<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>The seminar series "Formalisation of mathematics with interactive theorem provers" hosted at the Cambridge Centre for Mathematical Sciences that was running last year will be resuming from next week on with Anand Rao Tadipatri and Jonas Bayer <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="228846">@Jonas Bayer</span>  taking over the main organisation.</p>
<p>Some meetings will be in person, but whenever the speaker is remote, it will be possible to participate virtually too.<br>
Some of the in-person meetings will be live streamed as well.</p>
<p>This is a joint seminar series between the Cambridge Department of Computer Science and Technology and the Faculty of Mathematics, on the fast-growing area of formalisation of mathematics with proof assistants (interactive theorem provers) such as Isabelle and Lean. All levels welcome. <br>
Undergraduate students are particularly encouraged to actively participate.</p>
<p>You can find the schedule (in progress) and relevant information at the link below </p>

<p>Please feel free to invite your students and any colleagues who may be interested.</p>
<p>Hope to see many of you!</p>
