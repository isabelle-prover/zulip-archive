<p>Dear Isabelle enthusiasts,</p>
<p>we are organizing another edition of the proving competition workshop "Proof Ground", which will take place virtually just before ITP 2021.<br>
Please take note of our Call for Problems, and spread the word!</p>

<p>Proof Ground 2021<br>
Interactive Proving Contest<br>

<p>at ITP 2021<br>
Interactive Theorem Proving<br>
June 29 - July 2, 2021,  (originally in) Rome, Italy, now fully virtual<br>
<a href="https://easyconferences.eu/itp2021/">https://easyconferences.eu/itp2021/</a></p>
<hr>
<p>This workshop brings together researchers of the ITP community to compete in a "proving contest".</p>
<p>While programming contests (e.g. ACM ICPC, International Olympiad in Informatics) challenge large numbers of participants to solve algorithmic problems within a short time, we envision proving contests to entice proof engineers to formally prove small but interesting problems from mathematics or computer science.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://do.proof.in.tum.de">contest system</a> is currently used for teaching and hosting proving contests in Coq, Isabelle, and Lean.</p>
<p>Proof Ground 2021 is affiliated with the conference on <a href="https://easyconferences.eu/itp2021/">Interactive Theorem Proving 2021</a>.</p>
<p>As the main conference will happen as virtual conferences due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Proof Ground 2021 will also take a purely virtual format.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www21.in.tum.de/~wimmers/proofground2019/">first edition</a> of the workshop has been held at <a href="https://itp19.cecs.pdx.edu/">ITP 2019</a>. The <a href="https://www21.in.tum.de/~wimmers/proofground2020/">second edition</a> was affiliated with <a href="https://ijcar2020.org/">IJCAR 2020</a>.</p>
<h2>Important Dates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Submission deadline: May 30, 2021</li>
<li>Workshop and Competition:  June 28, 2021</li>
</ul>
<h2>Call for Problems</h2>
<p>In order to conduct a stimulating contest we solicit interesting tasks.</p>
<p>A contest typically lasts for two hours and consists of around five<br>
   problems with varying difficulty.</p>
<p>A problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>should contain an informal statement of the problem together with a template for the formal proof;</li>
<li>should come with a reference solution (in any ITP);</li>
<li>should be solvable (including formal proof) within 30 minutes;</li>
<li>should be easy to state in any proof assistant, without requiring too much background library;</li>
<li>could be from any part of mathematics, software verification, or your daily work with ITPs, and could also be a logic puzzle/riddle;</li>
<li>could contain several subproblems which lead to partial points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions from (potential) competition participants are allowed.</p>
<p>Examples can be found at the current "Proving for Fun" contest system, e.g. <a href="https://do.proof.in.tum.de/competitions/contest/6/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Submissions can be made via email to wimmers [at] in [dot] tum [dot] de by the date indicated above.</p>
