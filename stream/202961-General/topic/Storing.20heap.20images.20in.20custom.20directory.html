<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am sure this has been asked before but I don't really know how to find it, so please feel free to send a link. I am using a slightly modified version of Isabelle so if something seems off it might also be that. Pinging <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="233198">@Mathias Fleury</span> since he knows more about what is different in that version.</p>
<p>This question is about how to build a session without Isabelle writing to the home directory.</p>
<p>Basically, I have an Isabelle theory that I want to run on a set of benchmarks. The way this works on the cluster I am using is that for each benchmark, the benchmark and the theory file are copied into their own directory. I am writing the file dynamically so I have to copy it into the directory.</p>
<p>For now I wrote my script in a way that it copies not only the theory file but the whole directory it is in including the ROOT file. Then, I try to build the session with Isabelle and that is where my trouble start. If I leave the HOME directory as it is Isabelle will try to write to <code>$HOME/.isabelle/heaps/polyml.../</code> (as far as I understand) which is forbidden in this situation.</p>
<p>On the other hand if I set the Home directory (globally I am not sure how I would change it just for Isabelle) to the new folder, Isabelle will complain about the missing <code>JAVA_HOME</code>. While I see that I could re-download all dependencies I really don't want to do that for every benchmark. I also don't want to rebuild all session images that came before my new session but I guess there might be an option to avoid that anyways. I've tried to add the original directory as a component but that did not work.</p>
<p>I saw that there is a command line option <code>-o system_heaps</code> but that just writes the files to ISABELLE_HEAPS_SYSTEM which is still not helpful for me. I read the system manual (without understanding much unfortunately) and tried -e with an example from the ROOT file of HOL but that did also not do this.</p>

<p>for the $HOME/.isabelle/contrib im pretty sure you can set that manually using  the ISABELLE_COMPONENTS_BASE variable. by default its set to "$USER_HOME/.isabelle/contrib" thou im not sure about the heap part. you could also just copy $HOME/.isabelle whenever you set the home directory globally. AFAIK most modern filesystems are smart enough to optimize this copy away</p>

<p>You can also modify the ISABELLE_HEAPS_SYSTEM variable if your using a repo version as i dont think there are any system heaps on the repo version</p>

<p>Thanks, I will try that</p>
