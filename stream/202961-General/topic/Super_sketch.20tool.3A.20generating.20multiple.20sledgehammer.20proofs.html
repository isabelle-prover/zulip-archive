<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I have an Isabelle(2024) tool I want to share with you.<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/14278/kVU9NwtQ65YkP7P4TDH9Y0Ms/super_sketch-1.zip">super_sketch-1.zip</a></p>
<p>In my project I had the problem of having to prove lemmas with<br>
hundreds of subgoals and it was a bit cumbersome to have to<br>
invoke Sledgehammer on each of them one-by-one. I solved my<br>
problem with some ML code that extends Florian Haftmann's sketch<br>
command. In the attached code, I implemented a super_sketch<br>
command that outlines the proof skeleton but also invokes<br>
sledgehammer on each subgoal and collects the proof suggestions.</p>
<p>Since it was quite helpful to me, I attach the code. Maybe others<br>
might like to play with such a command as well. Super_sketch should<br>
work "plug-and-play" by just including a theory and then invoking<br>
the super_sketch command whenever there are many subgoals to be<br>
solved by sledgehammer. There is a simple theory about regular<br>
languages that illustrate how super_sketch works.</p>
<p>Note however, this code is just an experiment. The results are<br>
necessarily non-deterministic as super_sketch calls the external<br>
sledgehammer provers and they might reply with proofs in any<br>
shape or order. Also sometimes the proof suggested by super_sketch<br>
does not "reconstruct" unlike a manual invocation of sledgehammer<br>
on the same goal. Also, when the number of subgoals goes up to <br>
over a few hundred, the prover just grinds to a halt. <br>
If someone knows why and can suggest a fix, I<br>
would be very grateful. I am also happy to receive any feedback<br>
how super_sketch works and any improvements. </p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Chengsong Tan</p>

<p>Thanks for developing such a tool. Will surely give it a shot later on!</p>
