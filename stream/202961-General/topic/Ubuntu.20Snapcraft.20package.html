<p>Out of curiosity the other day, I started trying to figure out what the level of difficulty would be to rebuild Isabelle into a collection of Debian-style packages. I quickly came to the conclusion that this would be a rather tedious undertaking. However, I was able to get an Ubuntu Snapcraft package built locally. So far it seems to be fully functional, but I haven't spent a ton of time on it and I don't have nearly as much experience building Snapcraft packages as Docker containers or even Debian packages.</p>
<p>Before I spend any more time working on this, would there be interest in such a thing among other Ubuntu users in the event it was sufficiently tested? Until I recently built this Snapcraft package, I had just been using Isabelle by unpacking the tarball in a specific location in my home folder. However, I always liked the idea of being able to get a new laptop up and running with just a simple command, like <code>snap install isabelle</code> or getting some specific version using <code>snap install isabelle --channel=2021-1/stable</code> or what have you.</p>
