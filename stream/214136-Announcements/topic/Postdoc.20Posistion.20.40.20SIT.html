<p>A postdoctoral position in automated verification is open at the Singapore Institute of Technology under the supervision of Prof. David Sanán.</p>
<p>The project is about formalizing programming language semantics, constructing a framework for scalable verification, and building mechanisms for automatic reasoning on Isabelle/HOL.<br>
We aim for minimizing the gap between the edge of formal verification and efficient industrial applications.<br>
Specifically, we are focusing on formalizing Solidity and verifying smart contracts on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Qualifications:</p>
<p>- A Ph.D. awarded in Computer Science, Mathematics, or a closely related discipline.<br>
  - Experience in formal methods and formal verification. Experience in Isabelle theorem prover is preferred.<br>
  - Familiar with program semantics and program logic including Hoare Logic and Separation Logic.</p>
<p>This position has attractive salaries, around <strong>SGD 7k</strong> monthly, and the taxes in Singapore are very low.</p>
<p>The position is available on a full-time basis for one and a half years in the first instance, with the possibility of renewal(s).<br>
Starting date: Feb 2023.</p>
<p>To apply, send an email with the CV to <a href="mailto:david.miguel@singaporetech.edu.sg">david.miguel@singaporetech.edu.sg</a></p>
