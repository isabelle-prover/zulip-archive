<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am a newcomer to Isabelle/HOL and I am currently stuck while trying to formalize a personal project called <strong>"The Geometry of the Prime Number Spectrum."</strong> My goal is to explore a specific distribution (1/2) between prime numbers.</p>
<p>I am not a trained mathematician or an Isabelle expert, so I would appreciate it if someone could help me with a very patient and simple approach, as I might struggle with advanced technical explanations.<br>
<strong>The situation:</strong> Yesterday, I almost managed to generate a LaTeX PDF from Isabelle, which took about 4 hours and 26 minutes to compile. However, after trying to fix two minor errors (which looked like <strong>Unicode errors</strong>), everything broke. Now, I cannot even run a 15-second compilation without everything failing. My attempts to fix it myself have only made the situation worse.</p>
<p>I have uploaded my code here:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/14278/tnPiPXjQ-n747OhJehx8UiYD/geometrie_spectre_premier-2.zip">geometrie_spectre_premier (2).zip</a><br>
If someone could spare some time to look at my code and tell me what is wrong, I would be very grateful. Please don't expect too much from me regarding Isabelle basics, as I am still very much learning the fundamentals.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your kindness and help!</p>
<p>Best regards, Philippe"</p>

<p>Hi Philippe,</p>
<p>before attempting to generate a LaTeX PDF, I would first try to fix the proofs: several of your <code>by simp</code> proof attempts either don't terminate or do not prove the goal (I am using Isabelle 2025-2). Also, in the definition of <code>spectral_list</code> you should replace <code>\leftrightarrow</code> with <code>\longleftrightarrow</code>.</p>
