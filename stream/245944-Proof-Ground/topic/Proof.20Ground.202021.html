<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>We are/were planning to host another round of Proof Ground at ITP this year (<a href="https://www21.in.tum.de/~wimmers/proofground/">https://www21.in.tum.de/~wimmers/proofground/</a>).<br>
The number of problem submissions was unfortunately zero this year, so we were wondering if there is generally no interest.</p>
<p>Therefore, could those of you who were considering to attend give us a quick heads-up? Also, did anyone register "officially" yet (unfortunately, EasyChair cannot give us the number of registrations for this workshop)?</p>

<p>I was (of course) planning to attend. I could try to come up with some problems if you desperately need them, but that is of course not entirely optimal given that I am a participant. I would not want to invite accusations that my results are due to the problems all being submitted by me. <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span></p>
