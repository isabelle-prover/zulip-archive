<p>From: Vincent Jackson &lt;<a href="mailto:vjjac@student.unimelb.edu.au">vjjac@student.unimelb.edu.au</a>&gt;<br>
Hello all,</p>
<p>Recently I tried to build an old project (in Isabelle 2025, but which <br>
last built on Isabelle 2019), and got a "Duplicate use of directory" <br>
error. This problem appears to show up whenever there are two sessions <br>
in the same ROOT file, but which use different theory files from the <br>
current directory.</p>
<p>In which Isabelle edition did this error become a thing, and what is the <br>
intended way we should structure our sessions now? I do not understand <br>
why this is now an error; I find it strange that it now seems necessary <br>
to mirror the session hierarchy in our directory hierarchy. Is there a <br>
way to build different sessions from the same directory that I am not <br>
aware of, or is this the intent of the change?</p>
<p>Also, this behaviour does not seem to be documented in the Isabelle <br>
System Manual (at least, not in §2.1), so that should be updated.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

<p>P.S.</p>
<p>I have constructed a minimal example of the problem as follows:</p>
<p>$ cat A.thy<br>
theory A<br>
imports Main<br>
begin<br>
end<br>
$ cat B.thy<br>
theory B<br>
imports A<br>
begin<br>
end<br>
$ cat ROOT<br>
session A = Main +<br>
   theories<br>
     "A"</p>
<p>session B = A +<br>
   theories<br>
     "B"</p>
<p>and the error that results is</p>
<p>/home/admin/.isabelle/Isabelle2025/jedit/jars/isabelle_jedit_main.jar:<br>
Cannot start:<br>
*** Duplicate use of directory "/home/admin/Development/Isabelle/Theories"<br>
***   for session "A" (line 2 of "/home/admin/Development/Isabelle/Theories/ROOT")<br>
***   vs. session "B" (line 6 of "/home/admin/Development/Isabelle/Theories/ROOT")</p>

<p>This documentation is unusually clear and explicit. I won't add even more text.</p>

I see. Thanks for finding that.</p>
<p>That documentation could be better placed. The listing you have <br>
identified is for the "directories" syntax, which is why I, <br>
unfortunately, overlooked it. (As I did not use that syntax element.) <br>
The documentation also says these directories are "additional", but the <br>
duplicate directory exclusion also applies to the default directory. <br>
(And one can traverse additional directories via the "in ..." syntax too.)</p>
<p>I think it would be good to note explicitly in the "session" <br>
syntax documentation (or maybe the "session ... in ..." syntax <br>
documentation) that every session has an associated directory (which, as <br>
already explained in the documentation, is either explicitly given using <br>
the "in ..." syntax or defaults to the current directory) and that each <br>
directory so associated must be assigned to only one session.</p>
<p>In any case, thanks for answering my questions.<br>
