<a href="https://wiki.tfpie.science.ru.nl/TFPIE2024">https://wiki.tfpie.science.ru.nl/TFPIE2024</a><br>
(January 9th 2024, West Orange, NJ, USA, co-located with TFP 2024 at<br>
Seton Hall University)</p>
<p>TFPIE 2024 welcomes submissions describing techniques used in the classroom,<br>
tools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any creative use of<br>
functional programming (FP) to aid education in or outside Computer Science.<br>
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>FP and beginning CS students<br>
   FP and Computational Thinking<br>
   FP and Artificial Intelligence<br>
   FP in Robotics<br>
   FP and Music<br>
   Advanced FP for undergraduates<br>
   FP in graduate education<br>
   Engaging students in research using FP<br>
   FP in Programming Languages<br>
   FP in the high school curriculum<br>
   FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics<br>
   FP and Philosophy<br>
   The pedagogy of teaching FP<br>
   FP and e-learning: MOOCs, automated assessment etc.<br>
   Best Lectures - more details below</p>
<p>In addition to papers, we are requesting best lecture presentations. <br>
What's your<br>
best lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a fun way to <br>
present FP<br>
concepts to novices or perhaps an especially interesting presentation of a<br>
difficult topic? In either case, please consider sharing it. Best <br>
lecture topics<br>
will be selected for presentation based on a short abstract describing the<br>
lecture and its interest to TFPIE attendees. The length of the presentation<br>
should be comparable to that of a paper. In addition, the speaker can <br>
provide<br>
commentary on effectiveness or student feedback.</p>
<p>Submissions</p>
<p>Potential presenters are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-6 <br>
pages) or<br>
a draft paper (up to 20 pages) in EPTCS style. The authors of accepted<br>
presentations<br>
will have their preprints and their slides made available on the<br>
workshop's website.<br>
Papers and abstracts can be submitted via easychair at the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfpie2024">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfpie2024</a></p>
<p>After the workshop, presenters are invited to submit (a revised<br>
version of) their<br>
article for the formal review. The PC will select the best articles<br>
for publication<br>
in the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS). <br>
Articles<br>
rejected for presentation and extended abstracts will not be formally <br>
reviewed<br>
by the PC.</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
<p>Submission deadline: December 26th 2023, Anywhere on Earth<br>
