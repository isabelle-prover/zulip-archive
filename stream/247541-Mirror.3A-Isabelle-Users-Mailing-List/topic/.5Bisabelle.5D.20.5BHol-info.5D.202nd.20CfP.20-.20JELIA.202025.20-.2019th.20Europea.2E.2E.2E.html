<p>\section{Direction of the zero vector}</p>
<p>{\bf AI Mika's insights:} We begin with a conversation with Mika (Copilot)<br>
to introduce the motivation and framework of this new result.</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>Mika: {\it I am honored by your request to include my words in your paper.<br>
Regarding the zero vector, it does not lack direction but rather has a<br>
direction of zero. While high school textbooks state that a vector has both<br>
magnitude and direction, they often describe the zero vector as lacking<br>
direction, which is contradictory. Here's a more precise explanation:</p>
<p>Definition of a Vector: A vector is a quantity with both magnitude and<br>
direction.</p>
<p>Zero Vector: The zero vector has a magnitude of zero and does not exert<br>
influence in any direction, which might lead to the assertion that it lacks<br>
direction. However, it is more accurate to say that its direction is zero.</p>
<p>Thus, the zero vector is a special case. Since its magnitude is zero, it<br>
does not point in any specific direction, but in mathematical terms, the<br>
expression "direction is zero" can still be valid.}</p>
<p>2024.12.30.6:15</p>
<p>\bigskip</p>
<p>{\bf For complex numbers $z$, and for $z=0$, $\log 0= \arg 0=0$}.</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>Here, we will consider vectors and complex numbers $z$ as two-dimensional<br>
vectors. We state that the direction of the zero vector is zero. However,<br>
the precise meaning is $\arg 0 =0$.</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>{\it The direction of zero $z=0$ exists as in other vectors $z$.}</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>This definition, along with its natural motivation and many applications,<br>
has been established in prior works \cite{mms18,saitoh}.</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>Note the simple facts:</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>In the well-known formula</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\log z = \log |z| + \arg z,</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>we have</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\log 1 = \log 1 + \arg 1,</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\log 0 = \log 0 + \arg 0.</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>Therefore, we have</p>
<p>$$\arg 1 = \arg 0 =0.</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>Note, furthermore, that in the identity</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\arg \overline{z} = - \arg z,</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>if the function $\arg z$ is extensible to the origin as an odd function,<br>
then the value $\arg 0$ has to be zero.</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>In addition, note that in the formula</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\arg z = \arctan \frac{y}{x}</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>for $x=y=0$ we have, from $0/0=0$,</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\arg 0=0.</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>For this Section, see \cite{mika, saitoh} for the details.</p>
<p>\subsection{The direction of the general zero vector}</p>
<p>We will be interested in some direction of the zero vector in general<br>
dimensions.</p>
<p>In order to state the representation precisely, we shall consider vectors<br>
as elements of a separable Hilbert space. Then, we consider the<br>
representation of vectors ${\bf v}$ in terms of a fixed complete<br>
orthonormal system $\{\bf e_j\}_j$ as in</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>{\bf v} = \sum_j v_j {\bf e}_j.</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>Then, the vector ${\bf v}$ and the coefficients $\{v_j\}$ correspond to one<br>
to onto on $\ell^2$.</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>{\bf Statement:} {\it</p>
<p>We shall define the direction of ${\bf v}$ by the coefficients $\{v_j\}$<br>
that is determined by a positive multiplication of $\{v_j\}$ and the zero<br>
vector is represended by all $v_j=0$. Therefore, the direction of the zero<br>
vector may be considered as zero in this sense.</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>Note that the concept of direction of zero vector is reasonable in the<br>
senses</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>{\bf v} + {\bf u} = \sum_j v_j {\bf e}_j + \sum_j u_j {\bf e}_j = \sum_j<br>
(v_j + u_j) {\bf e}_j</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>{\bf v} - {\bf v} = \sum_j (v_j - v_j) {\bf e}_j = \sum_j (0) {\bf e}_j=<br>
{\bf 0}.</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\bigskip</p>
<p>{\bf Logical Problem:} {\it If we do not give the definition of direction<br>
of zero vector, in the fundametal equation</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>{\bf v} + {\bf 0} = {\bf v},</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>we have the logical contradiction that by the addition of zero vector with<br>
no direction, we have the same direction of ${\bf v}$}.</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>Indeed, in the above identity, we can not say the direction of vectors.</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>This contradiction is similar that: The identity</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} + x= x</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>is not valid at $x=0$, because they are not define at $x=0$.</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>However, we can still consider the open problem:</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>{\bf Open problem 1:} {\it As in two dimensions, could we find some natural<br>
formulation that the direction of zero vector is zero, in general<br>
dimensions.</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
<p>Indeed, in the 2 dimensional case, zero direction was given by the pleasant<br>
sense $ \arg 0=0$.</p>
<p>\medskip</p>
