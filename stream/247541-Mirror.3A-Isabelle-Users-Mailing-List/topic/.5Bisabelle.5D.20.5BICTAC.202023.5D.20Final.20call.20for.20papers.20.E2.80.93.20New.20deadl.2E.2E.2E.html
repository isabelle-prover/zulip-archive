<p>ABOUT PROTESTS IN PERU</p>
<p>We are continuously monitoring the political situation in the host country Peru, <br>
 which faced violent protests in 2022 also affecting travelers. To the best of our <br>
 knowledge, this situation has calmed down. If protests erupt again, we will work <br>
 closely with the ICTAC Steering Committee to choose the best feasible solution.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES </p>
<p><em>NEW</em> abstract deadline: 25 June 2023 (AoE)<br>
<em>NEW</em> submission deadline: 02 July 2023 (AoE)<br>
 Notification: 10 September 2023 (AoE)<br>
 Camera ready: 25 September 2023 (AoE)</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The ICTAC conference series aims at bringing together researchers<br>
 and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present<br>
 research and exchange ideas and experiences within theoretical aspects <br>
 of computing through methods and tools for system development. <br>
 ICTAC also aims to promote research cooperation between developing <br>
 and industrial countries.</p>
<p>TOPICS</p>
<p>The conference concerns all aspects of theoretical computer science,<br>
 including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Languages and automata</li>
<li>Semantics of programming languages</li>
<li>Logic in computer science</li>
<li>Lambda calculus, type theory, and category theory</li>
<li>Domain-specific languages</li>
<li>Theories of concurrency and mobility</li>
<li>Theories of distributed computing</li>
<li>Models of objects and components</li>
<li>Coordination models</li>
<li>Timed, hybrid, embedded, and cyber-physical systems</li>
<li>Security and privacy</li>
<li>Static analysis</li>
<li>Software verification</li>
<li>Software testing</li>
<li>Program generation and transformation</li>
<li>Model checking and theorem proving</li>
<li>Theory and methods of trustworthy AI</li>
<li>Applications and experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>We solicit submissions, related to the topics of ICTAC, in the<br>
 following categories:</p>
<p>A. original research contributions;<br>
 B. short papers, with original work in progress or with proposals of <br>
    new ideas and emerging challenges; and<br>
 C. tool papers on tools that support formal techniques for software<br>
    modeling, system design, and verification.</p>
<p>Submissions must not exceed 16 pages (excluding bibliography of<br>
 maximum 2 pages). Short and tool papers should not exceed 8 pages.</p>
<p>Submissions must not have been published or be under consideration for<br>
 publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis<br>
 of originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation<br>
 quality, and relevance to the conference’s topics.  </p>
<p>All contributions to ICTAC 2023 have to be submitted electronically<br>
 in PDF format via Easy Chair</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac20230">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac20230</a></p>
<p>Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS<br>
 papers (see <a href="http://www.springer.com/lncs">http://www.springer.com/lncs</a>), without modifications of <br>
 margins and other space-saving measures. Authors should therefore consult<br>
 Springer’s authors’ instructions and use their proceedings templates, <br>
 either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. <br>
 Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION</p>
<p>All accepted papers in categories A-C will appear in the proceedings of<br>
 the conference that will be published as a volume in Springer’s Lecture <br>
 Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.</p>
<p>All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their authors must<br>
 be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one author of<br>
 each accepted paper must register for the conference by the early <br>
 registration date, and present the paper.</p>
<p>We will have a special issue at the journal (TCS) Theoretical Computer <br>
 Science: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/theoretical-computer-science">https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/theoretical-computer-science</a>.<br>
 We will invite selected accepted papers from ICTAC 2023 to submit an extended <br>
 versions of their contribution to the special issue.</p>
