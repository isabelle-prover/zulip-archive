Dear mailing list,</p>
<p>we have successfully ported Isabelle_LLVM (minus some of the latest functionality, which Peter will port later) to the latest release candidate. We did not find any big problems but we would like to address the following minor things:</p>
<p>*<br>
Quite a large part of tactic.ML was moved to bires.ML, but this was not documented. We found it out by scanning the Isabelle files, but maybe this could be placed in the news as well.<br>
  *<br>
Pretty.writeln_chunks was separated into Pretty.writeln and Pretty.chunks, but not documented.<br>
     *<br>
Actually, I quite quickly found out many parts of Pure were renamed, but these were easy enough to port so I stopped making notes. Documentation is still appreciated though <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span><br>
  *<br>
Several proofs broke due to "take_update" being in the simp set. Removing it fixed these proofs. While take_update was in the simp set in the 2025 version already, it seems to cause trouble only now, maybe due to another change to the simp set?</p>
<p>Thanks to the developers for the latest release candidate. I still have to get used to the updated GUI in jedit, but the user experience generally seems to be much better to me!</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Bram</p>

Okay, I changed the integration contour to what the Malaysian people <br>
use. The adjustment was surprisingly easy. I did not have to touch the <br>
main proof at all; I only had to prove that the two z1 and z2 that do <br>
not follow the usual pattern (i.e. the endpoints of the very last arc) <br>
satisfy the same properties as the other ones. That's a bit of <br>
straightforward algebra.</p>
<p>So I managed to get a sorry-free proof of the theorem. It's not quite <br>
the same form as Apostol and the Malaysians and the remaining literature <br>
have because I haven't integrated the closed-form expression for the <br>
Bessel function yet. But I do have that (and much more on Bessel <br>
functions), so morally it's there. The constants in the error bound may <br>
also be different from what one might find in the literature (that said, <br>
Apostol doesn't even give a constant, just a "Big-O" estimate).</p>
<p>So to conclude, what we have shows that the infinite sum formula works. <br>
And we could also easily derive the asymptotic estimate for p(n).</p>
<p>I did however find that the constant one gets out of the proof is <br>
really, really bad, since it's exponential in n. So according to our <br>
bound, you need 2^O(n) terms of the sum to compute p(n), which is quite <br>
absurd. The true number is much lower. Not sure how much work is <br>
required to prove that. But neither Apostol nor the Malaysians care <br>
about that.</p>

Larry,</p>
<p>I am a little surprised that you "Removed simp status from list_update_beyond" <br>
(log entry).</p>
<p>lemma list_update_beyond: "length xs &lt;= i ==&gt; xs[i:=x] = xs"</p>
<p>It seems a useful rule to me (and I probably added it in the distant past). The <br>
function is defined like this on purpose to avoids undefinedness. Figuring out <br>
that the rule is applicable is not always onbious because of the precondition. <br>
Thus I would be in favour of turning [simp] back on here.</p>

Hello Makarius,</p>
<p>after using the new version for a couple of days I feel no features I use are missing. With the help of the mailing list I have now created a different try0 schedule for myself, so that has been resolved, thanks to everyone for the answers!</p>
<p>The only thing I noticed is that sledgehammer seems to abort much earlier now (in about half the time).<br>
The standard timeout for sledgehammer is 30 seconds, but I found sledgehammer to stop already after just under 15 seconds. If I increase the timeout to 60 seconds, it stops at just under 30 seconds.<br>
And I am sure that it does not abort due to the lack of a proof, as I have at least one example where sledgehammer does not find a proof with 30 seconds timeout, in which case it terminates after about 15 seconds without a proof. However, with 60 seconds timeout, a proof is found after about 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Typically I would provide a small example of said case, but I have failed to produce one of reasonable size so far. I do get this behaviour in my own formalization. However, it is easy to check that sledgehammer stops early on any lemma for which sledgehammer does not find a proof.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I have not noticed anything strange so far.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Bram</p>

Hello Stepan,</p>
<p>I simply moved satx and metis to the last batch.</p>
<p>declare [[try0_schedule = "<br>
  order presburger linarith algebra argo | simp auto blast fast fastforce force meson satx metis<br>
"]]</p>
<p>It seems to work well, but I am also considering moving everything into the same batch again (removing the pipe | ), as I do not notice an improvement from this setup compared to try0 in Isabelle2025. Maybe I am using it the wrong way though. Does anyone have any insights on this?</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Bram</p>

I'd prefer the old behaviour as standard, as it seems to be more likely to find proofs quickly. This is in particular important for auto-try0.</p>
<p>What was the motivation behind the change?</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:manuel@pruvisto.org">manuel@pruvisto.org</a>&gt;<br>
I also experienced problems with this. My impression was that try0 <br>
inexplicable <em>only</em> tried satx and metis and never tried any of the <br>
others, but I didn't care enough to investigate further. It did not <br>
occur to me that I ought to simply wait longer – in any case I would <br>
have had to wait significantly longer than my patience allows when using <br>
"try0", which I (in my usual workflow) expect to give an answer within 5 <br>
seconds or so at most.</p>
<p>So my impression is that the issue is mainly that one of "satx" and <br>
"metis" sometimes does not terminate within a reasonable amount of time <br>
and is also not killed within a reasonable amount of time, and then the <br>
others are not even tried.</p>
