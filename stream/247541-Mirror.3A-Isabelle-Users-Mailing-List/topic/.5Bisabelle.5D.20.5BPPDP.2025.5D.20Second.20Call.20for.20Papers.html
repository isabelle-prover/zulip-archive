           and Practice of Declarative Programming</p>
<p>September 10-11, 2025<br>
University of Calabria, Rende, Italyhttps://ppdp25.github.io/site/</p>
<p>Collocated with ICLP 2025.https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/</p>
<h1>Important dates</h1>
<ul>
<li>Title and abstract registration: 18 May 2025 (AoE)</li>
<li>Paper submission: 30 May 2025 (AoE)</li>
<li>Author notification: 7 July 2025</li>
<li>Final paper version: 21 July 2025</li>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The PPDP 2025 symposium brings together researchers from the declarative<br>
programming communities, including those working in the functional, logic,<br>
answer-set, and constraint handling programming paradigms. The goal is to<br>
stimulate research in the use of logical formalisms and methods for analyzing,<br>
performing, specifying, and reasoning about computations, including mechanisms<br>
for concurrency, security, static analysis, and verification.</p>
<p>PPDP 25 will be held at University of Calabria, Rende, Italy, as part of ICLP<br>
2025 (<a href="https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/">https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/</a>). At least one of the authors of an<br>
accepted paper is expected to attend the conference and present the paper.</p>
<p>Submissions are invited on all topics related to declarative programming, from<br>
principles to practice, from foundations to applications. Topics of interest<br>
include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Language Design: domain-specific languages; interoperability; concurrency,<br>
  parallelism and distribution; modules; functional languages; reactive<br>
  languages; languages with objects; languages for quantum computing; languages<br>
  inspired by biological and chemical computation; metaprogramming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Declarative languages in artificial intelligence: logic programming; database<br>
  languages; knowledge representation languages; probabilistic languages;<br>
  differentiable languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementations: abstract machines; interpreters; compilation; compile-time<br>
  and run-time optimization; memory management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foundations: types; logical frameworks; monads and effects; semantics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis and Transformation: partial evaluation; abstract interpretation;<br>
  control flow; data flow; information flow; termination analysis; resource<br>
  analysis; type inference and type checking; verification; validation;<br>
  debugging; testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools and Applications: programming and proof environments; verification<br>
  tools; case studies in proof assistants or interactive theorem provers;<br>
  certification; novel applications of declarative programming inside and<br>
  outside of CS; declarative programming pearls; practical experience reports<br>
  and industrial application; education.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Paper Submission</h1>
<p>Submissions can be made in three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular Research Papers,</li>
<li>System Descriptions, and</li>
<li>Experience Reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions of Research Papers must present original research which is<br>
unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 12 pages ACM<br>
style 2-column (including figures, but excluding bibliography). Work that<br>
already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings<br>
may be submitted. Research papers will be judged on originality, significance,<br>
correctness, clarity, and readability.</p>
<p>Submission of System Descriptions must describe a working system whose<br>
description has not been published or submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed<br>
10 pages and should contain a link to a working system. System Descriptions<br>
must be marked as such at the time of submission and will be judged on<br>
originality, significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability.</p>
<p>Submissions of Experience Reports are meant to help create a body of published,<br>
refereed, citable evidence where declarative programming such as functional,<br>
logic, answer-set, constraint programming, etc., is used in practice. They must<br>
not exceed 5 pages <strong>including references</strong>. Experience Reports must be marked<br>
as such at the time of submission and need not report original research<br>
results. They will be judged on significance, usefulness, clarity, and<br>
readability.</p>
<p>Possible topics for an Experience Report include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>insights gained from real-world projects using declarative programming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comparison of declarative programming with conventional programming in the<br>
  context of an industrial project or a university curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curricular issues encountered when using declarative programming in education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>real-world constraints that created special challenges for an implementation<br>
  of a declarative language or for declarative programming in general</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>novel use of declarative programming in the classroom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>programming pearl that illustrates a nifty new data structure or programming<br>
  technique.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplementary material may be provided via a link to an extended version of the<br>
submission (recommended), or in a clearly marked appendix beyond the above<br>
mentioned page limits. Reviewers are not required to study extended versions or<br>
any material beyond the respective page limit. Material beyond the page limit<br>
will not be included in the final published version.</p>
<h1>Submission Guidelines</h1>
<p>Submissions will be made via EasyChair. The submission webpage for<br>
PPDP 25 ishttps://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iclp25 (select PPDP<br>
track).</p>
<p>For each paper category, you must use the most recent version of the "Current<br>
ACM Master Template" which is available at<br>
(<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>). You must use the LaTeX<br>
sigconf proceedings template as the conference organizers are unable to process<br>
final submissions in other formats.</p>
<p>Authors should note ACM's statement on author's rights<br>
(<a href="http://authors.acm.org/">http://authors.acm.org/</a>) which apply to final papers. Submitted papers should<br>
meet the requirements of ACM's plagiarism policy<br>
(<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy">http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy</a>).</p>
<h1>Note About the New ACM Open Access Model</h1>
<p>ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International<br>
Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are<br>
not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be<br>
required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS<br>
article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be<br>
applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance<br>
here:<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance">https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance</a>.</p>
<p>Further information may be found on the ACM website, as follows:</p>
