<p>The Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an<br>
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of<br>
functional programming, taking a broad view of current and future<br>
trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for<br>
presenting the latest research results, and other contributions.</p>
<p>This year, TFP will take place in-person at UMass Boston,<br>
Massachusetts in the United States.  It is co-located with the Trends<br>
in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE) workshop, which will<br>
take on the day before the main symposium.</p>
<p>Please be aware that TFP has several submission deadlines. The first,<br>
November 23, is for authors that wish to have their full paper<br>
reviewed prior to the symposium. Papers that are accepted in this way<br>
must also be presented at the symposium. The second, December 16, is<br>
for authors that wish to present their work or work-in progress at the<br>
symposium first without submitting to the full review process for<br>
publication. These authors can then take into account<br>
feedback received at the symposium and submit a full article for<br>
review by the third deadline, February 17.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various<br>
routes. As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore<br>
identify the following five article categories. High-quality articles<br>
are solicited in any of these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Research Articles:<br>
   Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Position Articles:<br>
   On what new trends should or should not be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project Articles:<br>
   Descriptions of recently started new projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluation Articles:<br>
   What lessons can be drawn from a finished project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overview Articles:<br>
   Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for<br>
publication to any other forum. They may consider any aspect of<br>
functional programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or<br>
experience-oriented. Applications of functional programming techniques<br>
to other languages are also within the scope of the symposium.</p>
<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing</li>
<li>Functional programming in the cloud</li>
<li>High performance functional computing</li>
<li>Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs</li>
<li>Dependently typed functional programming</li>
<li>Validation and verification of functional programs</li>
<li>Debugging and profiling for functional languages</li>
<li>
<p>Functional programming in different application areas:<br>
   security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded<br>
   systems, global computing, grids, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interoperability with imperative programming languages</p>
</li>
<li>Novel memory management techniques</li>
<li>Program analysis and transformation techniques</li>
<li>Empirical performance studies</li>
<li>Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages</li>
<li>(Embedded) domain specific languages</li>
<li>New implementation strategies</li>
<li>Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of<br>
TFP, please contact the TFP 2023 program chair, Stephen Chang.</p>
<h2>Best Paper Awards</h2>
<p>TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.</p>
<p>First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best<br>
overall paper accepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.</p>
<p>Second, a prize for the best student paper is awarded each year.<br>
TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students,<br>
acknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new<br>
subject trends. A student paper is one for which the authors state<br>
that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are listed<br>
as first authors, and a student would present the paper.</p>
<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the<br>
best paper happens to be a student paper, then that paper will receive<br>
both prizes.</p>
<h2>Instructions to Authors</h2>
<p>Papers must be submitted at:</p>
<p>&lt;<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp23">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp23</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions<br>
formally reviewed either before or after the Symposium.<br>
Further, pre-symposium submissions may either be full (earlier deadline)<br>
or draft papers (later deadline).</p>
<h2>Pre-symposium formal review</h2>
<p>Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be<br>
submitted before the early deadline and will receive their reviews and<br>
notification of acceptance for both presentation and publication<br>
before the symposium. A paper that has been rejected for publication<br>
but accepted for presentation may be resubmitted for the<br>
post-symposium formal review.</p>
<h2>Post-symposium formal review</h2>
<p>Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of<br>
acceptance for presentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers<br>
will be invited to submit revised papers based on the feedback receive<br>
at the symposium. A post-symposium refereeing process will then select<br>
a subset of these articles for formal publication.</p>
<h2>Paper categories</h2>
<p>Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as<br>
extended abstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (20<br>
pages). The submission must clearly indicate which category it belongs<br>
to: research, position, project, evaluation, or overview paper. It<br>
should also indicate which authors are research students, and whether<br>
the main author(s) are students. A draft paper for which all authors<br>
are students will receive additional feedback by one of the PC members<br>
shortly after the symposium has taken place.</p>
<h2>Format</h2>
<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS<br>
style. For more information about formatting please consult the<br>
Springer LNCS web site.</p>
