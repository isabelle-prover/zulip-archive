<p>The Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an international<br>
forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of functional <br>
programming,<br>
taking a broad view of current and future trends in the area. It aspires to<br>
be a lively environment for presenting the latest research results, and <br>
other<br>
contributions.</p>
<p>This year, TFP will take place in-person at Seton Hall University, in South<br>
Orange, NJ in the United States. It is co-located with the Trends in <br>
Functional<br>
Programming in Education (TFPIE) workshop, which will take on the day <br>
before<br>
the main symposium.</p>
<p>Please be aware that TFP has several submission deadlines. The first, <br>
November 4,<br>
is for authors that wish to have their full paper reviewed prior to the <br>
symposium.<br>
Papers that are accepted in this way must also be presented at the <br>
symposium. The<br>
second, November 30, is for authors that wish to present their work or <br>
work-in<br>
progress at the symposium first without submitting to the full review <br>
process for<br>
publication. These authors can then take into account feedback received <br>
at the<br>
symposium and submit a full article for review by the third deadline, <br>
February 23.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various <br>
routes. As part<br>
of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the following <br>
five article<br>
categories. High-quality articles are solicited in any of these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Research Articles:<br>
   Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Position Articles:<br>
   On what new trends should or should not be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project Articles:<br>
   Descriptions of recently started new projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluation Articles:<br>
   What lessons can be drawn from a finished project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overview Articles:<br>
   Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for <br>
publication to any<br>
other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming: <br>
theoretical,<br>
implementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. Applications of functional<br>
programming techniques to other languages are also within the scope of <br>
the symposium.</p>
<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing</li>
<li>Functional programming in the cloud</li>
<li>High performance functional computing</li>
<li>Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs</li>
<li>Dependently typed functional programming</li>
<li>Validation and verification of functional programs</li>
<li>Debugging and profiling for functional languages</li>
<li>
<p>Functional programming in different application areas:<br>
   security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded<br>
   systems, global computing, grids, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interoperability with imperative programming languages</p>
</li>
<li>Novel memory management techniques</li>
<li>Program analysis and transformation techniques</li>
<li>Empirical performance studies</li>
<li>Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages</li>
<li>(Embedded) domain specific languages</li>
<li>New implementation strategies</li>
<li>Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of TFP, <br>
please contact<br>
the TFP 2024 program chair, Jason Hemann.</p>
<h2>Best Paper Awards</h2>
<p>TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.</p>
<p>First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the <br>
best overall paper<br>
accepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.</p>
<p>Second, each year TFP also awards a prize for the best student paper. <br>
TFP traditionally<br>
pays special attention to research students, acknowledging that students <br>
are almost by<br>
definition part of new subject trends. A student paper is one for which <br>
the authors<br>
state that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are <br>
the paper’s first<br>
authors, and a student would present the paper.</p>
<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the <br>
best paper happens<br>
to be a student paper, then that paper will receive both prizes.</p>
<h2>Instructions to Authors</h2>
<p>Authors must submit papers to:</p>
<p>&lt;<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp24">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp24</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally <br>
reviewed either<br>
before or after the Symposium. Further, pre-symposium submissions may <br>
either be full<br>
(earlier deadline) or draft papers (later deadline).</p>
<h2>Pre-symposium formal review</h2>
<p>Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted <br>
before the early<br>
deadline and will receive their reviews and notification of acceptance <br>
for both presentation<br>
and publication before the symposium. A paper that has been rejected for <br>
publication but<br>
accepted for presentation may be resubmitted for the post-symposium <br>
formal review.</p>
<h2>Post-symposium formal review</h2>
<p>Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance <br>
for presentation at<br>
the symposium. Authors of draft papers will be invited to submit revised <br>
papers based on the<br>
feedback receive at the symposium. A post-symposium refereeing process <br>
will then select a<br>
subset of these articles for formal publication.</p>
<h2>Paper categories</h2>
<p>Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as <br>
extended abstracts (4 to<br>
10 pages in length) or full papers (20 pages). The submission must <br>
clearly indicate which<br>
category it belongs to: research, position, project, evaluation, or <br>
overview paper. It should<br>
also indicate which authors are research students, and whether the main <br>
author(s) are students.<br>
A draft paper for which all authors are students will receive additional <br>
feedback by one of the<br>
PC members shortly after the symposium has taken place.</p>
<h2>Format</h2>
<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For <br>
more information about<br>
formatting please consult the Springer LNCS Guidelines web site:</p>
