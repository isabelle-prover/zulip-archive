26th International Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming 14-16 <br>
January 2025, Oxford, UK</p>
<h2>Important Dates</h2>
<p>Submission deadline (pre-symposium, full papers): Wed 13th Nov 2024 <br>
(AOE)<br>
Notification        (pre-symposium, full papers): Wed 11th Dec 2024<br>
Submission deadline (pre-symposium draft papers): Wed 11th Dec 2024 <br>
(AOE)<br>
Notification        (pre-symposium draft papers): Mon 16th Dec 2024<br>
Submission deadline (post-symposium review):      Wed 19th Feb 2025 <br>
(AOE)<br>
Notification        (post-symposium submissions): Wed 26th Mar 2025</p>
<p>The Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an <br>
international<br>
forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of functional <br>
programming,<br>
taking a broad view of current and future trends in the area. It aspires <br>
to be<br>
a lively environment for presenting the latest research results, and <br>
other<br>
contributions.</p>
<p>This year, TFP will take place in-person at the University of Oxford, <br>
UK. It<br>
is co-located with the Trends in Functional Programming in Education <br>
(TFPIE)<br>
workshop, which will take on the day before the main symposium.</p>
<p>Please be aware that TFP has several submission deadlines. The first, <br>
13th<br>
November, is for authors who wish to have their full paper reviewed <br>
prior to<br>
the symposium. Papers that are accepted in this way must also be <br>
presented at<br>
the symposium. The second, 11th December, is for authors who wish to <br>
present<br>
their work or work-in-progress at the symposium first without submitting <br>
to<br>
the full review process for publication. These authors can then take <br>
into<br>
account feedback received at the symposium and submit a full paper for <br>
review<br>
by the third deadline, 19th February.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various <br>
routes. As<br>
part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the <br>
following five<br>
paper categories. High-quality submissions are solicited in any of these<br>
categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research Papers: Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work</li>
<li>Position Papers: On what new trends should or should not be</li>
<li>Project Papers: Descriptions of recently started new projects</li>
<li>Evaluation Papers: What lessons can be drawn from a finished project</li>
<li>Overview Papers: Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted for publication <br>
to any<br>
other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming: <br>
theoretical,<br>
implementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. Applications of <br>
functional<br>
programming techniques to other languages are also within the scope of <br>
the<br>
symposium.</p>
<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing</li>
<li>Functional programming in the cloud</li>
<li>High performance functional computing</li>
<li>Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs</li>
<li>Dependently typed functional programming</li>
<li>Validation and verification of functional programs</li>
<li>Debugging and profiling for functional languages</li>
<li>
<p>Functional programming in different application areas:<br>
     security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded <br>
systems,<br>
     global computing, grids, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interoperability with imperative programming languages</p>
</li>
<li>Novel memory management techniques</li>
<li>Program analysis and transformation techniques</li>
<li>Empirical performance studies</li>
<li>Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages</li>
<li>(Embedded) domain specific languages</li>
<li>New implementation strategies</li>
<li>Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are in doubt on whether your paper is within the scope of TFP, <br>
please<br>
contact the programme chair, Jeremy Gibbons.</p>
<h2>Best Paper Awards</h2>
<p>TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.</p>
<p>First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the <br>
best overall<br>
paper accepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.</p>
<p>Second, each year TFP also awards a prize for the best student paper. <br>
TFP<br>
traditionally pays special attention to research students, acknowledging <br>
that<br>
students are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student <br>
paper is<br>
one for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of <br>
students,<br>
the students are the paper's first authors, and a student would present <br>
the paper.</p>
<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the <br>
best paper<br>
happens to be a student paper, then that paper will receive both prizes.</p>
<h2>Instructions to Authors</h2>
<p>Submission is via EquinOCS <br>
(<a href="https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/tfp2025">https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/tfp2025</a>).</p>
<p>Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally <br>
reviewed<br>
either before or after the Symposium. Further, pre-symposium submissions <br>
may either<br>
be full (earlier deadline) or draft papers (later deadline).</p>
<h2>Pre-symposium formal review</h2>
<p>Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted <br>
before the<br>
early deadline and will receive their reviews and notification of <br>
acceptance for<br>
both presentation and publication before the symposium. A paper that has <br>
been<br>
rejected for publication but accepted for presentation may be revised <br>
and resubmitted<br>
for the post-symposium formal review.</p>
<h2>Post-symposium formal review</h2>
<p>Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance <br>
for<br>
presentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers will be invited <br>
to submit<br>
revised papers based on the feedback received at the symposium. A <br>
post-symposium<br>
refereeing process will then select a subset of these papers for formal <br>
publication.</p>
<h2>Paper categories</h2>
<p>Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as <br>
extended<br>
abstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (up to 20 pages). The <br>
submission<br>
must clearly indicate which category it belongs to: research, position, <br>
project,<br>
evaluation, or overview paper. It should also indicate which authors are <br>
research<br>
students, and whether the main author(s) are students. A draft paper for <br>
which all<br>
authors are students will receive additional feedback by one of the PC <br>
members<br>
shortly after the symposium has taken place.</p>
<h2>Format</h2>
<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For <br>
more<br>
information about formatting please consult the Springer LNCS Guidelines <br>
web site<br>
