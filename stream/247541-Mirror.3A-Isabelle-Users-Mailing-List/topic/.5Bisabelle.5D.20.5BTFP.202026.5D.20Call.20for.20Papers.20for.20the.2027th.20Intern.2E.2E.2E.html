<p>The Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an <br>
international<br>
forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of functional <br>
programming,<br>
taking a broad view of current and future trends in the area. It aspires <br>
to be a<br>
lively environment for presenting the latest research results, and other<br>
contributions.</p>
<p>This year, TFP will take place in-person at the University of Southern <br>
Denmark,<br>
in Odense, Denmark. It is co-located with the Trends in Functional <br>
Programming<br>
in Education (TFPIE) workshop, which will take on the day before the <br>
main<br>
symposium.</p>
<p>Please be aware that TFP has several submission deadlines. The first, <br>
13th<br>
November, is for authors who wish to have their full paper reviewed <br>
prior to the<br>
symposium. Papers that are accepted in this way must also be presented <br>
at the<br>
symposium. The second, 11th December, is for authors who wish to present <br>
their<br>
work or work-in-progress at the symposium first without submitting to <br>
the full<br>
review process for publication. These authors can then take into account<br>
feedback received at the symposium and submit a full paper for review by <br>
the<br>
third deadline, 19th February.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various <br>
routes. As<br>
part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the <br>
following five<br>
paper categories. High-quality submissions are solicited in any of these<br>
categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research Papers: Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work</li>
<li>Position Papers: On what new trends should or should not be</li>
<li>Project Papers: Descriptions of recently started new projects</li>
<li>Evaluation Papers: What lessons can be drawn from a finished project</li>
<li>Overview Papers: Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted for publication <br>
to any<br>
other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming:<br>
theoretical, implementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. <br>
Applications of<br>
functional programming techniques to other languages are also within the <br>
scope<br>
of the symposium.</p>
<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing</li>
<li>Functional programming in the cloud</li>
<li>High performance functional computing</li>
<li>Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs</li>
<li>Dependently typed functional programming</li>
<li>Validation and verification of functional programs</li>
<li>Debugging and profiling for functional languages</li>
<li>
<p>Functional programming in different application areas:<br>
     security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded <br>
systems,<br>
     global computing, grids, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interoperability with imperative programming languages</p>
</li>
<li>Novel memory management techniques</li>
<li>Program analysis and transformation techniques</li>
<li>Empirical performance studies</li>
<li>Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages</li>
<li>(Embedded) domain specific languages</li>
<li>New implementation strategies</li>
<li>Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are in doubt on whether your paper is within the scope of TFP, <br>
please<br>
contact the programme chair, Casper Bach.</p>
<h2>Best Paper Awards</h2>
<p>TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.</p>
<p>First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the <br>
best<br>
overall paper accepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.</p>
<p>Second, each year TFP also awards a prize for the best student paper. <br>
TFP<br>
traditionally pays special attention to research students, acknowledging <br>
that<br>
students are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student <br>
paper is<br>
one for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of <br>
students,<br>
the students are the paper's first authors, and a student would present <br>
the<br>
paper.</p>
<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the <br>
best paper<br>
happens to be a student paper, then that paper will receive both prizes.</p>
<h2>Instructions to Authors</h2>
<p>Submission is via HotCRP:</p>
<p><a href="https://tfp26.hotcrp.com/">https://tfp26.hotcrp.com/</a></p>
<p>Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally<br>
reviewed either before or after the Symposium. Further, pre-symposium<br>
submissions may either be full (earlier deadline) or draft papers (later<br>
deadline). See below for more details.</p>
<p>Submission is single-blind.</p>
<p>Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the chair).</p>
<p>Accepted papers from the pre-symposium and post-symposium formal review <br>
will<br>
appear in a formal proceedings, published by Springer.</p>
<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For <br>
more<br>
information about formatting please consult the Springer LNCS Guidelines <br>
web<br>
site<br>
(<a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>).</p>
<h3>Pre-symposium formal review</h3>
<p>Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted <br>
before<br>
the early deadline and will receive their reviews and notification of <br>
acceptance<br>
for both presentation and publication before the symposium. A paper that <br>
has<br>
been rejected for publication but accepted for presentation may be <br>
revised and<br>
resubmitted for the post-symposium formal review.</p>
<h3>Post-symposium formal review</h3>
<p>Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance <br>
for<br>
presentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers will be invited <br>
to submit<br>
revised papers based on the feedback received at the symposium. A <br>
post-symposium<br>
refereeing process will then select a subset of these papers for formal<br>
publication.</p>
<h3>Paper categories</h3>
<p>Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as <br>
extended<br>
abstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (up to 20 pages). The<br>
submission must clearly indicate which category it belongs to: research,<br>
position, project, evaluation, or overview paper. It should also <br>
indicate which<br>
authors are research students, and whether the main author(s) are <br>
students. A<br>
draft paper for which all authors are students will receive additional <br>
feedback<br>
by one of the PC members shortly after the symposium has taken place.</p>
