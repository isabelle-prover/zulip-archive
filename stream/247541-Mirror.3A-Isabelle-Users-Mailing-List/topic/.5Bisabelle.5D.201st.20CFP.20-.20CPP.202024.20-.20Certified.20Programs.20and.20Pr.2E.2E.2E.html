<p>From: Sandrine Blazy &lt;<a href="mailto:sandrine.blazy@inria.fr">sandrine.blazy@inria.fr</a>&gt;<br>
Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP) is an international conference on<br>
practical and theoretical topics in all areas that consider formal<br>
verification and certification as an essential paradigm for their work. CPP<br>
spans areas of computer science, mathematics, logic, and education.</p>
<p>CPP 2024 (<a href="https://popl24.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2024">https://popl24.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2024</a>) will be held on 15-16<br>
January 2024 and will be co-located with POPL 2024 in London, UK. CPP 2024 is<br>
sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGLOG.</p>
<p>CPP 2024 will welcome contributions from all members of the community. The CPP<br>
2024 organizers will strive to enable both in-person and remote participation,<br>
in cooperation with the POPL 2024 organizers.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract Submission Deadline: 12 September 2023 at 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h)</li>
<li>Paper Submission Deadline: 19 September 2023 at 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h)</li>
<li>Notification (tentative): 21 November 2023</li>
<li>Camera Ready Deadline (tentative): Mid December 2023 (TBA)</li>
<li>Conference: 15-16 January 2024</li>
</ul>
<p>Deadlines expire at the end of the day, anywhere on earth. Abstract and<br>
submission deadlines are strict and there will be no extensions.</p>
<p>DISTINGUISHED PAPER AWARDS</p>
<p>Around 10% of the accepted papers at CPP 2024 will be designated as<br>
Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the CPP program<br>
committee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance,<br>
originality, significance and clarity.</p>

<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>
<p>Prior to the paper submission deadline, the authors should upload their<br>
anonymized paper in PDF format through the HotCRP system at</p>
<p><a href="https://cpp2024.hotcrp.com">https://cpp2024.hotcrp.com</a></p>
<p>The submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to<br>
allow the program committee to assess the merits of the contribution. They<br>
must be formatted following the ACM SIGPLAN Proceedings format using the<br>
acmart style with the sigplan option, which provides a two-column style, using<br>
10 point font for the main text, and a header for double blind review<br>
submission, i.e.,</p>
<p>\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,anonymous,review]{acmart}<br>
\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}</p>
<p>The submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages, including tables and figures,<br>
but excluding bibliography and clearly marked appendices. The papers should be<br>
self-contained without the appendices. Shorter papers are welcome and will be<br>
given equal consideration. Submissions not conforming to the requirements<br>
concerning format and maximum length may be rejected without further<br>
consideration.</p>
<p>CPP 2024 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process following<br>
the process from previous years. To facilitate this, the submissions must<br>
adhere to two rules:<br>
(1) author names and institutions must be omitted, and<br>
(2) references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person<br>
(e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the<br>
work of ...").</p>
<p>The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to<br>
an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible<br>
for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done<br>
in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of<br>
reviewing it more difficult. In particular, important background references<br>
should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors are free to<br>
disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as usual. For<br>
example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on<br>
their research ideas. Note that POPL 2024 itself will employ full double-blind<br>
reviewing, which differs from the light-weight CPP process.  This FAQ from<br>
previous SIGPLAN conference addresses many common concerns:<br>
<a href="https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ">https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ</a></p>
<p>We strongly encourage the authors to provide any supplementary material that<br>
supports the claims made in the paper, such as proof scripts or experimental<br>
data. This material must be uploaded at submission time, as an archive, not<br>
via a URL. Two forms of supplementary material may be submitted:<br>
(1) Anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers before<br>
they submit their first-draft reviews.<br>
(2) Non-anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers<br>
after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have learned the<br>
identity of the authors.</p>
<p>Please use anonymous supplementary material whenever possible, so that it can<br>
be taken into account from the beginning of the reviewing process.</p>
<p>The submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy<br>
(<a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/</a>) and the ACM Policy<br>
on Plagiarism (<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism">https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism</a>).<br>
Concurrent submissions to other conferences, journals, workshops with<br>
proceedings, or similar forums of publication are not allowed. The PC chairs<br>
should be informed of closely related work submitted to a conference or<br>
journal in advance of submission. One author of each accepted paper is<br>
expected to present it at the (possibly virtual) conference.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION, COPYRIGHT AND OPEN ACCESS</p>
<p>The CPP 2024 proceedings will be published by the ACM, and authors of accepted<br>
papers will be required to choose one of the following publication options:<br>
(1) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive<br>
permission-to-publish license and, optionally, licenses the work under a<br>
Creative Commons license.<br>
(2) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive<br>
permission-to-publish license.<br>
(3) Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.</p>
<p>For authors who can afford it, we recommend option (1), which will make the<br>
paper Gold Open Access, and also encourage such authors to license their work<br>
under the CC-BY license. ACM will charge you an article processing fee for<br>
this option (currently, US$700), which you have to pay directly with the ACM.<br>
You don’t need to pay this fee if the corresponding author’s affiliating<br>
institution is part of ACM OPEN<br>
(<a href="https://libraries.acm.org/subscriptions-access/open-participants">https://libraries.acm.org/subscriptions-access/open-participants</a>).</p>
<p>For everyone else, we recommend option (2), which is free and allows you to<br>
achieve Green Open Access, by uploading a preprint of your paper to a<br>
repository that guarantees permanent archival such as arXiv or HAL. This is<br>
anyway a good idea for timely dissemination even if you chose option 1.</p>
<p>The official CPP 2024 proceedings will also be available via SIGPLAN OpenTOC<br>
(<a href="http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp">http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp</a>).</p>
<p>For ACM’s take on this, see their Copyright Policy<br>
(<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy">http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy</a>) and Author Rights<br>
