<p>Call for Contributions</p>
<p>WiL 2023: 7th Women in Logic Workshop</p>
<p>July 1, 2023</p>
<p>Co-located with FSCD 2023</p>
<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/wil2023/home">https://sites.google.com/view/wil2023/home</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Women in Logic 2023 is a satellite event of the  8th International<br>
Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction (FSCD 2023)<br>
to be held in Rome, Italy, from July 1 to July 6, 2023.</p>
<p>The Women in Logic workshop (WiL) provides an opportunity to increase<br>
awareness of the valuable contributions made by women in the area of logic<br>
in computer science. Its main purpose is to promote the excellent research<br>
done by women, with the ultimate goal of increasing their visibility and<br>
representation in the community. Our aim is to:</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>provide a platform for female researchers to share their work and<br>
   achievements;<br>
   -</p>
<p>increase the feelings of community and belonging, especially among<br>
   junior faculty, post-docs and students through positive interactions with<br>
   peers and more established faculty;<br>
   -</p>
<p>establish new connections and collaborations;<br>
   -</p>
<p>foster a welcoming culture of mutual support and growth within the logic<br>
   research community.</p>
<p>We believe these aspects will benefit women working in logic and computer<br>
science, particularly early-career researchers.</p>
<p>Previous versions of Women in Logic (Reykjavík 2017, Oxford 2018, Vancouver<br>
2019, Paris 2020, Rome 2021, and Haifa 2022) were very successful in<br>
showcasing women's work and as catalysts for a recognition of the need for<br>
change in the community.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to: automata theory,<br>
automated deduction, categorical models and logics, concurrency and<br>
distributed computation, constraint programming, constructive mathematics,<br>
database theory, decision procedures, description logics, domain theory,<br>
finite model theory, formal aspects of program analysis, formal methods,<br>
foundations of computability, games and logic, higher-order logic, lambda<br>
and combinatory calculi, linear logic, logic in artificial intelligence,<br>
logic programming, logical aspects of bioinformatics, logical aspects of<br>
computational complexity, logical aspects of quantum computation, logical<br>
frameworks, logics of programs, modal and temporal logics, model checking,<br>
probabilistic systems, process calculi, programming language semantics,<br>
proof theory, real-time systems, reasoning about security and privacy,<br>
rewriting, type systems and type theory, and verification.</p>
