<p>The Fifteenth NASA Formal Methods Symposium</p>
<p><a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/nfm-2023">https://conf.researchr.org/home/nfm-2023</a></p>
<p>16 - 18 May 2023<br>
University of Houston Clear Lake, Houston, Texas, USA</p>
<hr>
<p>Theme of the Symposium:</p>
<hr>
<p>The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission-critical and <br>
safety-critical systems at NASA and in the aerospace industry require <br>
advanced techniques that address these systems' specification, design, <br>
verification, validation, and certification requirements. The NASA <br>
Formal Methods Symposium (NFM) is an annual forum to foster <br>
collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, <br>
academia, and industry. NFM's goals are to identify challenges and to <br>
provide solutions for achieving assurance for such critical systems.</p>
<p>New developments and emerging applications like autonomous software for <br>
uncrewed deep space human habitats, caretaker robotics, Unmanned Aerial <br>
Systems (UAS), UAS Traffic Management (UTM), and the need for <br>
system-wide fault detection, diagnosis, and prognostics provide new <br>
challenges for system specification, development, and verification <br>
approaches. The focus of these symposiums are on formal techniques and <br>
other approaches for software assurance, including their theory, current <br>
capabilities and limitations, as well as their potential application to <br>
aerospace, robotics, and other NASA-relevant safety-critical systems <br>
during all stages of the software life-cycle.</p>
<p>Topics of Interest:</p>
<hr>
<p>We encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches that bring together <br>
formal methods and techniques from other domains such as probabilistic <br>
reasoning, machine learning, control theory, robotics, and quantum <br>
computing among others.<br>
     * Formal verification, including theorem proving, model checking, <br>
and static analysis<br>
     * Advances in automated theorem proving including SAT and SMT solving<br>
     * Use of formal methods in software and system testing<br>
     * Run-time verification<br>
     * Techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods, such as <br>
abstraction and symbolic methods, compositional techniques, as well as <br>
parallel and/or distributed techniques<br>
     * Code generation from formally verified models<br>
     * Safety cases and system safety<br>
     * Formal approaches to fault tolerance<br>
     * Theoretical advances and empirical evaluations of formal methods <br>
techniques for safety-critical systems, including hybrid and embedded <br>
systems<br>
     * Formal methods in systems engineering and model-based development<br>
     * Correct-by-design controller synthesis<br>
     * Formal assurance methods to handle adaptive systems</p>

<p>The symposium will take place in the STEM Building at University of <br>
Houston Clear Lake, Houston, Texas, USA, 16-18 May 2023.</p>
<p>There will be no registration fee for participants. All interested <br>
individuals, including non-US citizens, are welcome to attend, to listen <br>
to the talks, and to participate in discussions; however, all attendees <br>
must register.</p>
<p>Submission Details:</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two categories of submissions:</p>
<p>1. Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete <br>
results (15 pages + references)<br>
    2. Two categories of short papers: (6 pages + references)<br>
    (a) Tool Papers describing novel, publicly-available tools<br>
    (b) Case Studies detailing complete applications of formal methods <br>
to real systems with publicly-available artifacts</p>
<p>All papers should be in English and describe original work that has not <br>
been published or submitted elsewhere. All submissions will be fully <br>
reviewed by members of the Programme Committee. Papers will appear in <br>
the Formal Methods subline of Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer <br>
Science (LNCS) and must use LNCS style formatting <br>
(<a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>). <br>
Papers must be submitted in PDF format at the EasyChair submission site:</p>
