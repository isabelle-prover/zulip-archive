<p>Typed Ordered Resolution<br>

<a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Typed_Ordered_Resolution.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Typed_Ordered_Resolution.html</a><br>
   Ordered Resolution is a proof calculus for reasoning about first-order<br>
   logic that is implemented in many automatic theorem provers. It works<br>
   by saturating the given set of clauses and is refutationally complete,<br>
   meaning that if the set is inconsistent, the saturation will contain a<br>
   contradiction. In this formalization, we restructured the completeness<br>
   proof to cleanly separate the ground (i.e., variable-free) and<br>
   nonground aspects. We also added a type system to the calculus. We<br>
   relied on the library for first-order clauses and on the saturation<br>
   framework.</p>

<p>Zippy - Generic White-Box Proof Search with Zippers<br>
   by Kevin Kappelmann<br>
<a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Zippy.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Zippy.html</a></p>
<p>This entry contains Zippy, a framework for tree-based searches. Zippy<br>
 is largely independent of concrete search tree representations, search<br>
 algorithms, states and effects. It is designed to create analysable<br>
 and navigable searches that are open to customisation and extensions<br>
 by users. An accompanying arXiv preprint is available here.</p>
<p>This entry also provides a concrete instantiation of the framework in<br>
 the form of a general purpose white-box prover, called zip. The prover<br>
 performs a proof tree search with customisable expansion actions and<br>
 search strategies, including A, breadth-first, depth-first, and<br>
 best-first search. By default, it integrates the classical reasoner,<br>
 simplifier, the blast and metis prover, and supports resolution with<br>
 higher-order and proof-producing unification, conditional substitutions,<br>
 case splitting, and induction, among other things. Users are free to<br>
 extend the prover with additional expansion actions and search<br>
 strategies. We demonstrate the capabilities of zip in an examples theory.</p>
<p>In most cases, zip can be used as a drop-in replacement for<br>
 Isabelle's classical methods, including auto, fastforce, force, fast, etc.<br>
 We demonstrate this with a benchmark containing 2267 method calls from<br>
 Isabelle's standard library, where zip achieves a success rate of<br>
 99.82% (2263/2267).</p>
<p>The Zippy framework is founded on concepts from functional programming<br>
 theory, particularly zippers, arrows, monads, lenses, and coroutines.<br>
 This entry contains a library of mentioned concepts for Isabelle/ML.</p>
