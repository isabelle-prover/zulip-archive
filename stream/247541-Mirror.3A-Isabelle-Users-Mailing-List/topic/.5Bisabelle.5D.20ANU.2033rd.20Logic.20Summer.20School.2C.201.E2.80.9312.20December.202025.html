33rd Annual ANU Logic Summer School<br>
1–12 December 2025<br>
Canberra, Ngunnawal and Ngambri Country, Australia<br>
<a href="http://comp.anu.edu.au/lss&lt;http://comp.anu.edu.au/lss">comp.anu.edu.au/lss&lt;http://comp.anu.edu.au/lss</a>&gt;</p>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The ANU Logic Summer School is an annual event that offers a two week long programme of lectures on modern logic, the foundational discipline of the information sciences. Topics include not only the science of reasoning but also computability theory, type theory and other tools for understanding processes, declarative programming, automatic proof generation, program verification and much more. The school is primarily geared at late undergraduate and masters students, but is open to all, including postgraduate and PhD students, postdocs, and participants from industry.</p>
<p>PROGRAMME</p>
<p>The school features four introductory courses in the first week, and a series of five lectures covering more advanced topics in the second week. The courses are given by a mix of local, domestic, and international speakers.</p>
<p>Week 1:<br>
John Slaney (ANU): Foundations of Metalogic<br>
Michael Norrish (ANU): Computability and Incompleteness<br>
Peter Baumgartner (CSIRO): Overview of Automated Reasoning<br>
Liam O’Connor (ANU): Introduction to Interactive Theorem-Proving with Isabelle</p>
<p>Week 2:<br>
Sonia Marin (U. Birmingham): Intuitionistic Modal Logic<br>
Chelsea Edmonds (UWA): Advanced Isabelle for Software Verification<br>
Cláudia Nalon (U. Brasília): Resolution for Modal Logics and its Implementation<br>
Gillian Russell (ANU): Barriers to Entailment<br>
Vineet Rajani (UNSW): Modal Type Theories and Logical Relations</p>
<p>SOCIAL EVENTS</p>
<p>The summer school hosts a welcome reception on Sunday, 30 November, a social dinner on Tuesday, 9 December, and organises an excursion to Canberra’s surrounds on Saturday, 6 December.</p>
