<p>From: Alex Shkotin &lt;<a href="mailto:alex.shkotin@gmail.com">alex.shkotin@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
This is interesting. The idea seems to be enjoying success, although it is<br>
rather strange. Since a hypothesis is a unit of knowledge of a developing<br>
theory. Each of the hypotheses placed in this repo will be duplicated by<br>
those who build the theory itself. And the simplest crawler could collect<br>
unproven theorems from all theories.<br>
Thanks for the link.</p>
