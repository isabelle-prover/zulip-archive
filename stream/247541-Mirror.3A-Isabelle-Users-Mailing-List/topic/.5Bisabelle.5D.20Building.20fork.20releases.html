Hi,<br>
I have a fork of isabelle, and I want to produce releases of it to<br>
distribute to users across macos/ubuntu/windows. How do I generate packages<br>
like the ones available on the isabelle website?</p>
<p>I have come across the program Admin/build_release, and I have tried using<br>
it, but had no luck.<br>
The first hurdle was that it depends on the mercurial history, but I forked<br>
from a git mirror, so mercurial commands don't work. I tried using the -S<br>
option instead which I think is supposed to bypass this by using an archive<br>
file of the repo, and that looked like it was going to work until it<br>
crashed with this error:</p>
<p>*** java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Requested array size exceeds VM limit</p>
<p>If this error is unexpected then I'm happy to do some deeper debugging if<br>
someone can provide a few pointers about how and where to start. (I don't<br>
have much experience debugging java or scala.) Otherwise: what am I doing<br>
wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks.<br>
Lex.</p>

<p>Can you open this existential quantifier, and say explicitly what it is about?</p>
<p>Isabelle is a system where end-users can do almost everything, without having <br>
to patch + fork.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>See my responses inline below...<br>
I hope these address your concerns.<br>
I look forward to hearing your suggestions about how best to proceed.</p>
<p>Thanks.<br>

<p>As far as I can tell, the release process only uses hg to determine a<br>
release name and to generate an archive of the tracked files. I can easily<br>
map this onto git for our fork if I need to. Is there anything else that<br>
specifically needs hg?<br>
Furthermore, we have plenty of experience with git, but not so much with<br>
mercurial. All our related projects also use git, and it simplifies our<br>
workflow. We're not going to move away from git, and we don't expect<br>
Isabelle to move away from mercurial.</p>

<p>I'm trying to make proper releases so that this fork is NOT a bad isabelle<br>
clone. It makes minimal changes to isabelle (just enough to enable one<br>
small extra feature)<br>
Currently our install instructions include: install git to clone and build<br>
the whole thing locally, or boot a prebuilt VM image.<br>
In my mind, this kind of thing is what makes a "bad Isabelle clone". If we<br>
were able to make proper releases using the existing process then we would<br>
have a "good Isabelle clone".<br>
I'm asking how to do this because I deliberately want to avoid our fork<br>
being labeled as a bad fork.<br>
This fork is going to be used by students, including students that are<br>
totally new to Isabelle, so we want their first experience of installing<br>
Isabelle to be an easy one.</p>

<p>I didn't know that I needed to justify making a fork release before asking<br>
for help.<br>
We had to fork Isabelle to add one extra feature that we need.<br>
As far as I'm aware, the changes we needed to make to Isabelle have already<br>
been deemed unsuitable for upstream Isabelle.</p>

<p>From: Lex Bailey &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
I agree that we shouldn't expect users to install Git to be able to use<br>
Isabelle or any fork of it.</p>
<p>The change that we have adds in an ML command<br>
"Active.run_system_shell_command", which is then used by some ML code in a<br>
theory file to provide clickable text in the output pane which lets the<br>
user run the command in a console pane. Correct me if I'm wrong, but my<br>
understanding is that this change was already rejected as it is "risky".<br>
(it makes it easier for theory files to run arbitrary commands on a users<br>
machine when they might not expect that to be possible)</p>
<p>If there is a way that we can achieve that without forking then that would<br>
be ideal. If that is the case then how do we do that? and what is the best<br>
way to package a vanilla Isabelle distribution with some custom heap images?</p>
<p>Full patch is here:<br>

(there is also a patch for the 2022 release)</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
