<p>-- Overview --</p>
<p>CADE is the major international forum for presenting research on all aspects of<br>
automated deduction. High-quality submissions on the general topic of automated<br>
deduction, including logical foundations, theory and principles, applications in<br>
and beyond computer science and mathematics, and implementations of automated<br>
reasoning systems are solicited. CADE-29 aims to present research that reflects<br>
the broad range of interesting and relevant topics in automated deduction.</p>
<p>CADE-29 is in cooperation with ACM SIGLOG.</p>
<p>-- Venue --</p>
<p>CADE-29 and affiliated satellite events will take place in Rome, Italy and will<br>
be co-located with FSCD 2023.</p>
<p>-- Publication --</p>
<p>CADE-29 proceedings will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Artificial<br>
Intelligence series in Gold Open Access mode at a CADE special rate of €200.00<br>
per paper. Funding will be available for authors of accepted papers who cannot<br>
cover the €200 fee.</p>
<p>-- Special Issue --</p>
<p>The authors of a selection of the best CADE-29 papers will be invited to submit<br>
an extended version of their paper after the conference, to be published in a<br>
special issue of the Journal of Automated Reasoning.</p>
<p>-- Submission Guidelines --</p>
<p>Submissions can be made in two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular papers</strong>. Up to 15 pages in LNCS style, excluding references. Proofs<br>
    of theoretical results that do not fit in the page limit may be provided in<br>
    an appendix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Short papers</strong>. This includes system descriptions, user experiences, case<br>
    studies and domain models. Up to 10 pages in LNCS style, excluding<br>
    references.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reviewers may consider material provided in appendices, but submissions must be<br>
self-contained within the page limit. Submissions must be unpublished and not<br>
submitted for publication elsewhere. They will be judged on relevance,<br>
originality, significance, correctness, and readability. If software or data is<br>
relevant to a paper, a link that provides access to the software/data must be<br>
provided to enable reproduction of results.</p>
<p>The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors will<br>
have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may solicit<br>
further reviews after the rebuttal period. Selected accepted papers will be<br>
considered by Program Committee for the CADE Best Paper Award.</p>
