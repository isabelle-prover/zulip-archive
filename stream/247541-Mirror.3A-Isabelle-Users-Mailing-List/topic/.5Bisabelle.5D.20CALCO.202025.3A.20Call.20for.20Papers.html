<p>Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer<br>
science. From data types to development techniques and specification<br>
formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the<br>
large body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering<br>
works of the 1960s. CALCO aims to bring together researchers and<br>
practitioners with interests in both foundational and applicative uses<br>
of algebra and coalgebra in computer science, traditional as well as<br>
emerging ones. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by<br>
joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop<br>
on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on<br>
Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in<br>
Bloomington, Indiana (US, 2023), Salzburg (Austria, 2021), London (UK,<br>
2019), Ljubljana (Slovenia,2017), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015),<br>
Warsaw (Poland, 2013), Winchester (UK, 2011), Udine (Italy, 2009),<br>
Bergen (Norway, 2007), Swansea (Wales, 2005).</p>
<p>The 11th edition will be held in Glasgow, UK, co-located with MFPS XLI.<br>
It is planned as a physical, in-person event.</p>
<p>Submission Categories</p>
<hr>
<p>CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and<br>
coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four<br>
categories of submissions.</p>
<p>Regular papers that report</p>
<ul>
<li>results on theoretical foundations,</li>
<li>novel methods and techniques for software development,</li>
<li>experiences with technology transfer to industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Co)Algebraic Pearls papers that</p>
<ul>
<li>present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Early ideas abstracts that lead to</p>
<ul>
<li>presentations of work in progress,</li>
<li>proposals for original venues of research.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tool presentation papers that</p>
<ul>
<li>report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submission Guidelines</p>
<hr>
<p>All submissions will be handled via EasyChair:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25</a></p>
<p>The format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs. Please use the<br>
latest version of the style:<br>
<a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/">http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/</a></p>
<p>It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length.<br>
Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately.<br>
Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz<br>
International Proceedings in Informatics series.</p>
<p>A special issue of the open access journal  Logical Methods in Computer<br>
Science (<a href="http://www.lmcs-online.org">http://www.lmcs-online.org</a>), containing extended versions of<br>
selected papers, is planned.</p>
<h3>Regular papers</h3>
<p>Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English<br>
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and<br>
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be<br>
maximum 15 pages long, excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space<br>
limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix.</p>
<h3>(Co)algebraic pearls</h3>
<p>This is a recent submission category. Explaining a known idea in a new<br>
way may make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We<br>
encourage the submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an<br>
idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing an<br>
application. Pearls are typically short and concise and so should not be<br>
longer than regular papers in the format specified by LIPIcs. Authors<br>
who feel they need a bit more space should consult the PC co-chairs. The<br>
accepted papers will be included in the final proceedings of the<br>
conference.</p>
<h3>Early ideas abstracts</h3>
<p>Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs.<br>
The volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on<br>
the CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged<br>
to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Tool papers</h3>
<p>Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs.<br>
The accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of<br>
the conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the<br>
time of submission for download and evaluation.</p>
<p>Best Paper and Best Presentation Awards</p>
<hr>
<p>This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose<br>
recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a Best<br>
Presentation Award, elected by the participants.</p>
