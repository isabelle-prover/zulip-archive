<p>==========================================================</p>
<p>Invited Speakers</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Ugo dal Lago (University of Bologna) (joint special session on Quantitative Semantics)</li>

<li>Elena di Lavore (University of Pisa)</li>
<li>Alexander Kurz (Chapman University)</li>
</ul>
<p>Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer science.<br>
From data types to development techniques and specification formalisms, both<br>
theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the large body of research<br>
proposed and implemented since the pioneering works of the 1960s.</p>
<p>CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in<br>
both foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer<br>
science, traditional as well as emerging ones. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual<br>
conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the<br>
International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT<br>
(the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions<br>
took place in Bloomington, Indiana (US, 2023), Salzburg (Austria, 2021), London<br>
(UK, 2019), Ljubljana (Slovenia,2017), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015), Warsaw<br>
(Poland, 2013), Winchester (UK, 2011), Udine (Italy, 2009), Bergen (Norway,<br>
2007), Swansea (Wales, 2005).</p>
<p>The 11th edition will be held in Glasgow, UK, co-located with MFPS XLI. It is<br>
planned as a physical, in-person event. It is expected that at least one author<br>
of each accepted paper will attend and give the presentation is person;<br>
exceptions can be made in case of unexpected travel/visa problems.</p>
<p>Submission Categories</p>
<hr>
<p>CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and coalgebraic<br>
theory and applications, and distinguishes between four categories of<br>
submissions.</p>
<p>Regular papers that report</p>
<ul>
<li>results on theoretical foundations,</li>
<li>novel methods and techniques for software development,</li>
<li>experiences with technology transfer to industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Co)Algebraic Pearls papers that</p>
<ul>
<li>present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Early ideas abstracts that lead to</p>
<ul>
<li>presentations of work in progress,</li>
<li>proposals for original venues of research.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tool presentation papers that</p>
<ul>
<li>report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submission Guidelines</p>
<hr>
<p>All submissions will be handled via EasyChair:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25</a></p>
<p>The format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs. Please use the latest<br>
version of the style:<br>
<a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/">http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/</a></p>
<p>It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length.<br>
Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately.<br>
Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz International<br>
Proceedings in Informatics series.</p>
<p>A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer<br>
Science (<a href="http://www.lmcs-online.org">http://www.lmcs-online.org</a>), containing extended versions of selected<br>
papers, is planned.</p>
<h3>Regular papers</h3>
<p>Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English presenting<br>
original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for<br>
publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be maximum 15 pages long,<br>
excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included<br>
in a clearly marked appendix.</p>
<h3>(Co)algebraic pearls</h3>
<p>This is a recent submission category. Explaining a known idea in a new way may<br>
make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We encourage the<br>
submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an idea in a beautiful or<br>
didactically clever way, perhaps by developing an application. Pearls are<br>
typically short and concise and so should not be longer than regular papers in<br>
the format specified by LIPIcs. Authors who feel they need a bit more space<br>
should consult the PC co-chairs. The accepted papers will be included in the<br>
final proceedings of the conference.</p>
<h3>Early ideas abstracts</h3>
<p>Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. The<br>
volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on the CALCO<br>
pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged to disseminate<br>
the results by subsequent publication elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Tool papers</h3>
<p>Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. The<br>
accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of the<br>
conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the time of<br>
submission for download and evaluation.</p>
<p>Best Paper and Best Presentation Awards</p>
<hr>
<p>This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose<br>
recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a Best<br>
Presentation Award, elected by the participants.</p>
