  # 1st International Workshop on Logic, Statistical and Neural AI (LoStaN<br>
2025)</p>
<p>Updates here: &lt;<a href="https://lostan-workshop.github.io/2025/">https://lostan-workshop.github.io/2025/</a>&gt;</p>

<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>The LoStaN workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners<br>
interested in bridging the gap between two traditionally distinct paradigms<br>
in Artificial Intelligence:<br>
<strong>symbolic reasoning</strong> based on <strong>logical knowledge</strong>,<br>
and <strong>data-driven</strong> approaches grounded in <strong>statistics</strong> and (deep)<br>
<strong>machine learning</strong>.</p>
<p>During its history, AI has seen tremendous progress from both ends of this<br>
spectrum.<br>
Symbolic methods offer interpretability, generalizability, and the ability<br>
to incorporate structured domain knowledge,<br>
while neural and statistical techniques excel in learning from vast amounts<br>
of data, dealing with uncertainty,<br>
and scaling to complex tasks.<br>
However, unifying these paradigms remains a grand challenge.<br>
The workshop aims to foster a research community that sees logical<br>
reasoning and statistical learning not as competing paradigms,<br>
but as complementary facets of intelligent behavior, and their integration<br>
not only as a technical challenge but rather as a transformative<br>
opportunity.</p>
<p>LoStaN provides a forum for discussing foundational questions, novel<br>
methodologies, and practical applications that seek to integrate logical<br>
and statistical AI,<br>
with the aim to energize this interdisciplinary space, promote<br>
collaboration between research communities, and inspire innovative<br>
solutions to AI.</p>

<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Submissions should be in <a href="https://it.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/wqyfdgftmcfw">__CEUR Workshop Proceedings__ style</a>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submissions must be exported in __PDF format__;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>_Camera-ready_ versions shall include the LaTeX __source files__;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submissions are <em>not</em> anonymous __(single-blind)__.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reviewing Format</h2>
<p>Each submission will undergo a traditional single-blind review process.<br>
This phase applies to all papers, regardless of type, and will determine<br>
the final acceptance or rejection decision.</p>
<p>Accepted contributions are presented at the workshop, and authors may<br>
collect further comments and insights.</p>
<p>After that, authors who are willing to publish their contribution to the<br>
workshop proceedings will be requested to produce a final version of the<br>
paper,<br>
addressing the reviewers’ suggestions and possibly integrating comments and<br>
insights from the workshop.</p>
<p>All papers will undergo the standard assessment in which reviewers will be<br>
asked to consider the submission focusing on its:</p>
<ul>
<li>__scope__: is the paper on-topic w.r.t. the workshop’s track or theme?</li>
<li>
<p>__significance__: is the idea proposed in the paper meaningful for the<br>
LoStaN community? Are the results relevant?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>__soundness__: is the approach proposed in the paper correct and robust?<br>
Are experiments (if any) well-designed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>__clarity__: is the paper clear and well organized? Is the discussion<br>
complete?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>__contextualization__: is relevant background and related literature<br>
being adequately referenced?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>__novelty__: is the contribution novel either from a conceptual or<br>
technical perspective?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the reviews will take into account the specific<br>
characteristics of the submitted contributions<br>
(see submission types above)<br>
to obtain their final decision.</p>
<h2>Proceedings</h2>
<p>The workshop will publish its own proceedings onto Scopus-indexed<br>
repositories, such as <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/">CEUR-WS</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>__Important note:__ Accepted papers will be included in the workshop<br>
proceedings __only if__ the authors explicitly agree to do so.<br>
In this way, works which are not mature enough for publication, as well as<br>
works which have already been published elsewhere can be presented and<br>
discussed at the workshop.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span aria-label="book" class="emoji emoji-1f4d6" role="img" title="book">:book:</span> Special Issue</h2>
<p>A selection of the best papers presented at the workshop will be invited to<br>
submit an extended version to a special issue in a journal (TBD).<br>
We are negotiating with several journals, and we will update this CfP as<br>
soon as we have more information.</p>
