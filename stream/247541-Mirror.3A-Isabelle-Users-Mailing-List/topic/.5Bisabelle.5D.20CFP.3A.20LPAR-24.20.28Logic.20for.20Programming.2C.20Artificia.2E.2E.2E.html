Abstract deadline       March 6, 2023<br>
Submission deadline     March 13, 2023</p>
<p>The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, Artificial<br>
Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year after year, some of<br>
the most renowned researchers in the areas of logic, automated reasoning,<br>
computational logic, programming languages and their applications come to<br>
present cutting-edge results, to discuss advances in these fields, and to<br>
exchange ideas. LPAR is an "A" ranked conference in the CORE ranking system;<br>
papers from previous proceedings are listed in DBLP. LPAR-24 will be held in<br>
Manizales, Colombia, at the National University of Colombia, 4-9th June<br>
2023.<br>
See the conference web site for all the details. The proceedings of LPAR-24<br>
will be published by EasyChair, in the EPiC Series in Computing.</p>
<p>*** Submission Guidelines</p>
<p>All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another<br>
journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular papers describing solid new research results. They can be up to<br>
  15 pages long in EasyChair style, including figures but excluding<br>
references<br>
  and appendices (that reviewers are not required to read). Where<br>
applicable,<br>
  regular papers  are supported by experimental validation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental and tool papers describing implementations of systems, report<br>
  experiments with implemented systems, or compare implemented systems.<br>
  Experimental and tool papers should be supported by a link to the<br>
artifact/<br>
  experimental evaluation available to the reviewers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The length of regular papers is limited to 15 pages in the EasyChair style<br>
(excluding the blibliography and appendices). The length of experimental and<br>
tool papers is limited to 8 pages in the EasyChair style (excluding the<br>
bibliography and appendices). Both types of papers must be electronically<br>
submitted in PDF via EasyChair:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar2023</a></p>
<p>Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of them<br>
will be present at the conference.</p>
<p>*** List of Topics</p>
<p>New results in the fields of computational logic and applications are<br>
welcome.<br>
Also welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open<br>
questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories and<br>
practices. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
