Submission site: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2023</a></p>
<p>=== Objectives and Scope ===</p>
<p>Formal techniques can help analyse programs, precisely describe program<br>
behaviour, and verify program properties. Modern programming languages<br>
are interesting targets for formal techniques due to their ubiquity and<br>
wide user base, stable and well-defined interfaces and platforms, and<br>
powerful (but also complex) libraries. New languages and applications in<br>
this space are continually arising, resulting in new programming<br>
languages (PL) research challenges.</p>
<p>Work on formal techniques and tools and on the formal underpinnings of<br>
programming languages themselves naturally complement each other. FTfJP<br>
is an established workshop which has run annually since 1999 alongside<br>
ECOOP, with the goal of bringing together people working in both fields.</p>
<p>The workshop has a broad PL theme. The most important criterion is that<br>
submissions will generate interesting discussions within this community.<br>
The term “Java-like” is somewhat historic and should be interpreted<br>
broadly: FTfJP solicits and welcomes submissions relating to programming<br>
languages in general, beyond Java, including submissions related to C#,<br>
Scala, and similar languages, and submissions on more general topics<br>
that may be relevant to such languages.</p>
<p>Example topics of interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language design and semantics</li>
<li>Type systems</li>
<li>Concurrency and new application domains</li>
<li>Specification and verification of program properties</li>
<li>Program analysis (static or dynamic)</li>
<li>Program synthesis</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Pearls (programs or proofs)</li>
</ul>
<p>FTfJP welcomes submissions on technical contributions, case studies,<br>
experience reports, challenge proposals, and position papers.</p>
<p>Webpages for previous workshops in this series are available at:<br>
<a href="https://ftfjp.github.io/">https://ftfjp.github.io/</a></p>
<p>=== Paper Categories ===</p>
<p>Contributions are sought in two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Full Papers (6 pages, excluding references) present a technical<br>
   contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. We welcome<br>
   both complete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is<br>
   particularly welcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate<br>
   interesting discussions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short Papers (2 pages, excluding references) should advocate a<br>
   promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely<br>
   to stimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage, e.g.,<br>
   established researchers to set out a personal vision, and beginning<br>
   researchers to present a planned path to a Ph.D.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the<br>
workshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed, and will be evaluated based<br>
on their clarity and their potential to generate interesting<br>
discussions. Reviewing will be single blind, there is no need to<br>
anonymize submissions.</p>
<p>The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in<br>
which a wide range of people share their expertise, from experienced<br>
researchers to beginning PhD students.</p>
<p>=== Submission Guidelines ===</p>
<p>All submissions and reviews will be managed within EasyChair.<br>
Submissions should be made via</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2023</a></p>
<p>There is no need to indicate the paper category (long/short).</p>
<p>Submissions should be in acmart/sigplan style, 10pt font. Formatting<br>
requirements are detailed on the SIGPLAN Author Information page<br>
(<a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author</a>).</p>
<p>We plan that, as in previous years, accepted papers will be published in<br>
the ACM Digital Library, though authors will be able to opt out of this<br>
publication, if desired. At least one author of an accepted paper must<br>
register to the conference by the early registration date and attend the<br>
workshop to present the work and participate in the discussions.</p>
<p>Selected papers will also be considered for extended versions to be<br>
submitted to the Journal of Object Technology (JOT).</p>
