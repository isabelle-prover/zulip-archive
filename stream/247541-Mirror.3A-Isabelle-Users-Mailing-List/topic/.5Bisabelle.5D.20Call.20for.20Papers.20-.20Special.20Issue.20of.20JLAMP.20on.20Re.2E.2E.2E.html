                                  Call for Papers<br>
               Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming         <br>
                 Special Issue on Recent Advances on Unification      <br>
===============================================================</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>The Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming (JLAMP) is <br>
an international journal that complements Elsevier's Science of Computer <br>
Programming and Theoretical Computer Science by its focus on the foundations <br>
and the application of logical, algebraic and categorical methods to <br>
programming and to the development of trustworthy computing systems. The aim <br>
of JLAMP special issues is to attract high-quality research papers in <br>
specific topics connected to logical and algebraic methods in the theory and <br>
practice of software development and computing systems.</p>
<p>The purpose of this special issue of JLAMP is to collect recent, original, <br>
and high-quality contributions on unification theory and its applications, <br>
as well as closely related topics. Unification is concerned with the problem <br>
of making two given terms equal, either syntactically or modulo an equational <br>
theory. It is a fundamental process used in various areas of computer science, <br>
including automated reasoning, term rewriting, logic programming, natural <br>
language processing, program analysis, knowledge representation, types, etc.</p>
<p>The International Workshop on Unification (UNIF) is the main international <br>
event on unification. This special issue is related to the research presented <br>
in the last four editions of the workshop, i.e., from UNIF 2021 to UNIF 2024. <br>
Nevertheless, submissions of high quality works on unification that were not <br>
presented at UNIF are also welcome. Thus, participants of UNIF, as well as <br>
other authors, are invited to submit contributions.</p>
<p>Topics</p>
<hr>
<p>Following the tradition of UNIF, this special issue addresses the topic of unification <br>
in a broad sense. A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:</p>
<p>* syntactic and equational unification algorithms<br>
  * matching and constraint solving<br>
  * higher-order unification<br>
  * unification in modal, temporal, and description logics<br>
  * admissibility of inference rules<br>
  * narrowing<br>
  * disunification<br>
  * anti-unification<br>
  * complexity issues  <br>
  * combination methods<br>
  * implementation techniques<br>
  * applications</p>
<p>Submission</p>
<hr>
<p>This special issue welcomes original and high-quality contributions on unification <br>
theory and its applications, as well as closely related topics. Submissions should <br>
consist of articles that have not been previously published and are not under <br>
consideration for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be peer-reviewed and <br>
handled according to the usual procedures of JLAMP.</p>
<p>Submitted manuscripts should be written in English and prepared following the guidelines <br>
of JLAMP. Papers should be submitted electronically by using the Editorial Manager for <br>
JLAMP, which can be accessed at:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/jlamp/default.aspx">https://www.editorialmanager.com/jlamp/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>The submission deadline is: <em>February 15, 2025</em>.</p>
<p>Please choose VSI:Recent Advances in Unification when you will be selecting the article type.</p>
