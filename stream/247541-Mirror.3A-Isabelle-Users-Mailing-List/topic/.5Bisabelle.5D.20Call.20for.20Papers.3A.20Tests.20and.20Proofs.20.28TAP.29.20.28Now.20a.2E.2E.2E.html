<h3><strong>New TAP Track at FM 2026: A Premier Venue for Tests and Proofs</strong></h3>
<p>Since 2007, the <a href="https://tapconference.github.io/2024/">Test and Proof (TAP)
conference</a> has long been a<br>
leading venue for research on the intersection of software testing and<br>
formal verification. Now, TAP is joining the 27th International<br>
Symposium on Formal Methods (FM 2026) as a new special track. This<br>
integration places the ground-breaking work of the Test and Proofs<br>
community at the heart of the world's premier conference on formal<br>
methods.</p>
<p>This new track provides a dedicated forum for researchers,<br>
practitioners, and tool developers to present and discuss the latest<br>
advances in the synergistic combination of traditionally distinct areas<br>
of dynamic analysis, e.g., testing, and static analysis, e.g., proving.<br>
By joining FM, the TAP track offers authors a wider, more diverse<br>
audience and the prestige of publication in the main, open-access FM<br>
2026 proceedings, published by Springer in the LNCS series. We invite<br>
you to be part of this exciting new chapter for the tests and proofs<br>
community!</p>
<p><strong>Track Highlight: FM 2026 Keynote by Professor Cristian Cadar</strong></p>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that TAP Track at FM 2026 will feature a<br>
keynote address by <strong>Professor Cristian Cadar</strong> of Imperial College<br>
London. Professor Cadar is a world-renowned authority on software<br>
reliability, security, and verification, and is particularly celebrated<br>
for his pioneering contributions to symbolic and dynamic execution<br>
(e.g., KLEE). His selection as a main symposium keynote speaker is a<br>
powerful testament to the increasing importance of the core topics of<br>
the TAP track to the broader computer science community.</p>
<h3><strong>Scope and Topics of Interest</strong></h3>
<p>The TAP track solicits high-quality, original research on the interplay<br>
between dynamic techniques such as testing, runtime verification<br>
etc.testing and formal verification such as proving, model checking,<br>
abstract interpretation, etc. . The track aims to foster new<br>
collaborations and advance the state of the art in creating reliable and<br>
secure software and systems. Topics of interest include, but are not<br>
limited to, the following areas:</p>
<p><strong>Foundations for Combining Testing and Verification</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Formalisms and theories that unify testing and proof\</li>
<li>Semantic foundations for combined static and dynamic analysis\</li>
<li>Proof theory for test-case generation and specification conformance\</li>
<li>Type systems with a testing and proving focus\</li>
<li>Formal models of test-based and proof-based development</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Synergistic Techniques and Tools</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Combination of model checking, theorem proving, and runtime<br>
    verification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synergies between symbolic execution, fuzzing, and formal analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test-case generation from formal specifications (e.g., using B, Z,<br>
    TLA+, VDM)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using test execution results to guide or automate proof discovery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Static analysis for test-suite reduction, prioritization, and<br>
    optimization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification-based and property-based testing</p>
</li>
<li>Formal methods for testing AI/ML-based systems</li>
<li>AI/ML techniques for enhancing formal verification and testing</li>
<li>Derivation of specifications and contracts from tests</li>
<li>Combination of static and dynamic analysis for security<br>
    vulnerability detection</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications and Empirical Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Case studies and experience reports applying combined test-and-proof<br>
    techniques to industrial systems (e.g., in security, cyber-physical<br>
    systems, autonomous systems, blockchain, or IoT)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empirical comparisons of different verification, testing, and<br>
    combined techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tool demonstration papers for new and innovative tools that support<br>
    tests and proofs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application of TAP techniques to challenge problems and benchmarks</p>
</li>
</ul>

reviewed following the policies and quality criteria of the FM Research<br>
Track.</p>
<p>The TAP track solicits papers in the following categories:</p>

    appendices):** For presenting mature tools, their theoretical<br>
    foundations, and empirical evaluations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Case Study Papers (max 15 pages, excluding references and<br>
    appendices):** For in-depth reports on the application of TAP<br>
    techniques to significant, real-world problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Short Papers (max 6 pages, excluding references and appendices):</strong><br>
    For presenting novel but not yet fully mature ideas, or for tool<br>
    demonstration papers that focus on a tool's features and usage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers should be original work, not published or submitted elsewhere, in<br>
Springer <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">LNCS format</a>,<br>
