<p>======================================================================</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction (MPC) aims to promote the development of mathematical principles and techniques that are demonstrably practical and effective in the process of constructing computer programs.</p>
<p>MPC 2022 will be held in Tbilisi, Georgia, on the 26th-28th September 2022, and is co-located with the Computational Logic Autumn Summit&lt;<a href="http://viam.science.tsu.ge/clas2022/">http://viam.science.tsu.ge/clas2022/</a>&gt; (CLAS'22). There will be a wide  range of other conferences and workshops co-located with MPC, including CICM, PPDP and RV.</p>
<p>KEYNOTE SPEAKERS:</p>
<p>Daniela Petrisan         University Paris Diderot, France</p>
<p>Conor McBride           University of Strathclyde, UK</p>
<p>ACCEPTED PAPERS:</p>
<p>The program can be found here&lt;<a href="https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/mpc22/index.php/program/">https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/mpc22/index.php/program/</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>CONFERENCE VENUE:</p>
<p>The conference will be held at the Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University (TSU), which is the oldest and largest educational and research institution not only in Georgia, but also in the South Caucasus. The venue is located in the city center, with many hotels, pubs,<br>
restaurants, parks, other attractions (zoo, theaters, cinemas, opera, etc.) within walking distance.</p>
<p>Social events as part of CLAS include a wine tour in Katheti. Georgia is one of the oldest wine-making countries in the world and Kakheti is a region where wine making has a long tradition.</p>
<p>Tbilisi International Airport is 15 km away from the city and offers direct connections to more than 30 destinations in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. From the airport, the city can be reached by bus or taxi. Another option is to  fly to Kutaisi in the west of Georgia, where low budget air companies  (such as WizzAir) are operating. A shuttle bus from<br>
the Kutaisi airport to Tbilisi takes about 3 hours.</p>
<p>Georgia allows visa-free entry for nearly 100 countries around the world. Further details may be found at the website of the Georgian government&lt;<a href="https://www.geoconsul.gov.ge/HtmlPage/Html/View?id=956&amp;lang=Eng">https://www.geoconsul.gov.ge/HtmlPage/Html/View?id=956&amp;lang=Eng</a>&gt;.</p>
