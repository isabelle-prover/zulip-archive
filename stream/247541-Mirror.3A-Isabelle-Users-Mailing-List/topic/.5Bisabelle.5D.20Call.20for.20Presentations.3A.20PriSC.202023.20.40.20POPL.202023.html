Call for Presentations: PriSC 2023 @ POPL 2023<br>
================================================</p>
<p>Secure compilation is an emerging field that puts together advances in security,<br>
programming languages, compilers, verification, systems, and hardware<br>
architectures in order to devise more secure compilation chains that eliminate<br>
many of today’s security vulnerabilities and that allow sound reasoning about<br>
security properties in the source language. For a concrete example, all modern<br>
languages provide a notion of structured control flow and an invoked procedure<br>
is expected to return to the right place. However, today’s compilation chains<br>
(compilers, linkers, loaders, runtime systems, hardware) cannot efficiently<br>
enforce this abstraction against linked low-level code, which can call and<br>
return to arbitrary instructions or smash the stack, blatantly violating the<br>
high-level abstraction. Other problems arise because today’s languages fail to<br>
specify security policies, such as data confidentiality, and the compilation<br>
chains thus fail to enforce them, especially against powerful side-channel<br>
attacks. The emerging secure compilation community aims to address such problems<br>
by identifying precise security goals and attacker models, designing more secure<br>
languages, devising efficient enforcement and mitigation mechanisms, and<br>
developing effective verification techniques for secure compilation chains.</p>
<p>7th Workshop on Principles of Secure Compilation (PriSC 2023)<br>
=============================================================</p>
<p>The Workshop on Principles of Secure Compilation (PriSC) is an informal 1-day<br>
workshop without any proceedings. The goal of this workshop is to identify<br>
interesting research directions and open challenges and to bring together<br>
researchers interested in working on building secure compilation chains, on<br>
developing proof techniques and verification tools, and on designing software or<br>
hardware enforcement mechanisms for secure compilation. The 7th edition of PriSC<br>
will be held on January 21 in Boston, Massachusetts, United State together with<br>
the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), 2023.</p>
<p>Important Dates<br>
===============</p>
<ul>
<li>Thu 27 Oct 2022: Submission Deadline</li>
<li>Thu 24 Nov 2022: Acceptance Notification</li>
<li>Sat 21 Jan 2023: Workshop</li>
</ul>
<p>Presentation Proposals and Attending the Workshop<br>
=================================================</p>
<p>Anyone interested in presenting at the workshop should submit an extended<br>
abstract (up to 2 pages, details below) covering past, ongoing, or future work.<br>
Any topic that could be of interest to secure compilation is in scope. Secure<br>
compilation should be interpreted very broadly to include any work in security,<br>
programming languages, architecture, systems or their combination that can be<br>
leveraged to preserve security properties of programs when they are compiled or<br>
to eliminate low-level vulnerabilities. Presentations that provide a useful<br>
outside view or challenge the community are also welcome. This includes<br>
presentations on new attack vectors such as microarchitectural side-channels,<br>
whose defenses could benefit from compiler techniques.</p>
<p>Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attacker models for secure compiler chains.</li>
<li>
<p>Secure compiler properties: fully abstract compilation and similar properties,<br>
memory safety, control-flow integrity, preservation of safety, information<br>
flow and other (hyper-)properties against adversarial contexts, secure<br>
multi-language interoperability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure interaction between different programming languages: foreign function<br>
interfaces, gradual types, securely combining different memory management<br>
strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforcement mechanisms and low-level security primitives: static checking,<br>
program verification, typed assembly languages, reference monitoring, program<br>
rewriting, software-based isolation/hiding techniques (SFI, crypto-based,<br>
randomization-based, OS/hypervisor-based), security-oriented architectural<br>
features such as Intel’s SGX, MPX and MPK, capability machines, side-channel<br>
defenses, object capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental evaluation and applications of secure compilers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof methods relevant to compilation: (bi)simulation, logical relations, game<br>
semantics, trace semantics, multi-language semantics, embedded interpreters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal verification of secure compilation chains (protection mechanisms,<br>
compilers, linkers, loaders), machine-checked proofs, translation validation,<br>
property-based testing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Guidelines for Submitting Extended Abstracts<br>
============================================</p>
<p>Extended abstracts should be submitted in PDF format and not exceed 2 pages<br>
(references not included). They should be formatted in two-column layout, 10pt<br>
font, and be printable on A4 and US Letter sized paper. We recommend using the<br>
new acmart LaTeX style in sigplan mode. Submissions are not anonymous and should<br>
provide sufficient detail to be assessed by the program committee. Presentation<br>
at the workshop does not preclude publication elsewhere.</p>
