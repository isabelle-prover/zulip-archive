International conference on reliability, safety and security of railway systems:<br>
modelling, analysis, verification and certification - RSSRail 2023<br>
October 10-12, 2023, Berlin, Germany<br>
<a href="https://rssr2023.ebuef.de/">https://rssr2023.ebuef.de/</a></p>
<p>Call for Contributions</p>
<p>The railway industry faces increasing pressure to improve system safety, to<br>
decrease production costs and time to market, to reduce carbon emissions and<br>
running costs, and to increase the capacity of the railway. Railway systems are<br>
now being integrated into larger multi-transport networks. Such systems require<br>
an even higher degree of automation at all levels of operation. These trends<br>
dramatically increase the complexity of railway applications and pose new<br>
challenges in developing novel methods of modelling, analysis, verification<br>
and validation to ensure their reliability, safety and security, as well as in<br>
supporting novel mechanisms and procedures to help make the case that<br>
development processes meet the mandated standards.</p>
<p>This conference will bring together researchers and developers working on railway<br>
system reliability, security and safety to discuss how all of these requirements<br>
can be met in an integrated way. It is also vital to ensure that advances in<br>
research (in both academia and industry) are driven by the real industrial needs.<br>
This will help ensure that such advances are followed by effective industrial<br>
deployment. Another particularly important objective is to integrate advances<br>
in research into the current development processes, and make them usable and<br>
scalable. Finally, a key goal is to develop advanced methods and tools that<br>
can ensure that the systems meet the requirements imposed by the regulatory<br>
standards and help in building the supportive arguments. This will be a<br>
working conference in which research challenges and progress will be<br>
discussed and evaluated by both researchers and engineers, focusing on<br>
their potential to be deployed in industrial settings.</p>
<p>Topics of particular interest include:<br>
• Safety in development processes and safety management<br>
• Combined approaches to safety and security<br>
• System and software safety analysis<br>
• Formal modelling and verification techniques<br>
• System reliability<br>
• Validation according to the standards<br>
• Safety and security argumentation<br>
• Fault and intrusion modelling and analysis<br>
• Evaluation of system capacity, energy consumption, cost and their interplay<br>
• Tool and model integration, tool chain<br>
• Domain-specific languages and modelling frameworks<br>
• Model reuse for reliability, safety and security<br>
• Modelling for maintenance strategy engineering.</p>
<p>The conference offers different options for presenting research:<br>
• Regular conference papers of 16 pages<br>
• Industrial conference papers of 10 pages, providing real-life feedback<br>
• Student conference papers of 10 pages, showcasing novel ideas and<br>
        early research results<br>
• Poster presentation, not to be accompanied by a full paper, however<br>
        the abstract will be published on the website<br>
• Tutorials to be offered in the first day (in total 4 tutorials a 90 minute in<br>
        two parallel sessions).</p>
<p>The important dates:<br>
• April 28, 2023: abstract submission for all papers; abstract submission for tutorials<br>
• May 5, 2023: full paper submission<br>
• June 16, 2023: Notification<br>
• July 14, 2023 camera-ready papers submitted<br>
• July 14, 2023 abstract submission for posters</p>
<p>The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series.<br>
