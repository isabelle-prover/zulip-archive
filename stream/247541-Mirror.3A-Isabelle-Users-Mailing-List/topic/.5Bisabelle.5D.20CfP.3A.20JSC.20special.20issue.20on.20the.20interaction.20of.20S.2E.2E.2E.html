Special Issue on the Interaction of Symbolic Computation and Machine <br>

=============================</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<hr>
<p>Symbolic computation (SC) aims at providing algorithmic solutions to <br>
problems dealing with symbolic objects such as terms, formulas, <br>
programs, representations of algebraic objects, etc. Algorithms and <br>
methods developed for the major subfields of SC (computer algebra, <br>
computational logic, automatic programming) have found successful <br>
applications in various areas.</p>
<p>From the beginning, SC was also considered a major approach to <br>
"artificial intelligence", since the problems solved by SC, typically, <br>
are problems that were considered hard for "human intelligence" (like <br>
symbolic integration, theorem proving, SAT/SMT solving, program <br>
verification, hardware verification, etc.).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, recent advances in artificial intelligence methods have <br>
provided new exciting opportunities in science and industry, being more <br>
and more integrated into most aspects of life. Machine learning (ML) <br>
methods, developed in parallel to symbolic methods for solving hard <br>
"artificial intelligence" problems, achieved spectacular results in <br>
numerous applications in recent years.</p>
<p>This special issue is dedicated to the interaction of symbolic <br>
computation and machine learning methods seen as the two major <br>
approaches to "artificial intelligence". We expect dramatic advances <br>
from a much closer interaction of the SC and the ML approaches to <br>
artificial intelligence. This interplay is, in fact, essential in the <br>
current scenario where the economy and society demand the development of <br>
complex, data-intensive, trustable, and high-performant computational <br>
systems that accompany humans in more and more facets of their daily life.</p>
<p>The special issue is organized as a follow-up of the 24th International <br>
Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing, <br>
SYNASC 2022. Participants of the symposium, as well as other authors, <br>
are invited to submit contributions. We welcome submissions describing <br>
the interaction of SC and ML methods, techniques, and tools, and their <br>
applications in AI.</p>
