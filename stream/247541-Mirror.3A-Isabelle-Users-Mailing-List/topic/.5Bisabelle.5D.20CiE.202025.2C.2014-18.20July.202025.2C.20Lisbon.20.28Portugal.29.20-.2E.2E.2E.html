<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br>
CiE 2025 will be the 21st conference organized by CiE (Computability in Europe). CiE is a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested in new developments in computability and their underlying significance for the real world. Previous meetings have taken place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006), Siena (2007), Athens (2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponta Delgada (2010), Sofia (2011), Cambridge (2012), Milan (2013), Budapest (2014), Bucharest (2015), Paris (2016), Turku (2017), Kiel (2018), Durham (2019), Salerno (2020, virtually), Ghent (2021, virtually), Swansea (2022), Batumi (2023), and Amsterdam (2024).</p>

<p>SPECIAL SESSIONS<br>
There will be 6 special sessions, details will be announced soon.</p>
<p>CONFERENCE TOPICS<br>
The CiE conferences serve as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of computability, foundations of computer science, logic, and theoretical computer science, as well as the interplay of these areas with practical issues in computer science and with other disciplines such as biology, mathematics, philosophy, or physics.</p>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSION<br>
THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE cordially invites all researchers, European and non-European, to submit their papers in all areas related to the above for presentation at the conference and inclusion in the proceedings of CiE 2025 at <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cie2025">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cie2025</a>.</p>
<p>CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS<br>
Papers submitted to the conference proceedings should represent original work, not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with formal proceedings. The Program Committee will rigorously review and select submitted papers. Accepted papers will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series from Springer-Verlag. Papers to be considered in the conferences proceedings must be submitted in PDF format, using the LNCS style (available at <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>) and must have a maximum of 15 pages, including references but excluding a possible appendix in which one can include proofs and other additional material. Papers building bridges between different parts of the research community are particularly welcome.</p>
<p>INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS<br>
Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. A proposal for an informal presentation must be submitted via our submission link: <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cie2025">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cie2025</a>, using the LNCS style file (available at <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>), and be 1 page long; a brief description of the results suffices and an abstract is not required. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2025 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals.</p>
