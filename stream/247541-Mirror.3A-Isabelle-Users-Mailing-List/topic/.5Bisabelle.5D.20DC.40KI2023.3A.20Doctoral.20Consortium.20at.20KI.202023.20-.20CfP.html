2nd CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS<br>
KI 2023 – DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM<br>
Berlin, September 26, 2023<br>
<a href="https://ki2023.gi.de/doctoral-consortium">https://ki2023.gi.de/doctoral-consortium</a></p>
<p>KI2023 takes place in Berlin, Germany, September 26–29, 2023. It is the <br>
46th edition of the German conference on Artificial Intelligence <br>
(abbreviated KI for "Künstliche Intelligenz") organized in cooperation <br>
with the Fachbereich Künstliche Intelligenz der Gesellschaft für <br>
Informatik (GI-SIG AI). KI is one of the major European AI conferences <br>
and traditionally brings together academic and industrial researchers <br>
from all areas of AI, providing an ideal place for exchanging news and <br>
research results on theory and applications. The technical program of <br>
KI2023 comprises paper presentations as well as tutorials and workshops.</p>
<p>DOCTORAL CONCORTIUM FORMAT<br>
There will be a PhD workshop with keynote and oral presentations during <br>
the KI conference, providing an opportunity for obtaining feedback on <br>
PhD projects. Doctoral students may also participate in a mentoring <br>
program that will connect students with experienced researchers in their <br>
field. The organizers will try to schedule personal meetings between <br>
mentors and students. Students can indicate their interest in this <br>
program when submitting their contribution, or directly by contacting <br>
the organizers. The schedule of the meetings will be announced ahead of <br>
the event. The organizers plan to publish extended abstracts as <br>
proceedings of the PhD workshop, probably with the GI-DL (GI Digital <br>
Library).</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be the opportunity to participate in the main <br>
conference poster session where the participants will have the chance to <br>
present their research to a larger audience.</p>
