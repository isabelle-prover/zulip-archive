<p>From: Lawrence Paulson &lt;<a href="mailto:lp15@cam.ac.uk">lp15@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Hello all, you may be interested in a little experiment I tried using the DeepSeek LLM yesterday. I asked whether it could translate a theorem header from n-dimensional real vectors to abstract Euclidean spaces. My query:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following theorem header fixes variable "a" to type "real^'n". Changing this type to "'a::euclidean_space" requires modifying the header, replacing $ and χ by their analogues for Euclidean spaces.</p>
<p>proposition<br>
  fixes a :: "real^'n"<br>
  assumes "m ≠ n" and ab_ne: "cbox a b ≠ {}" and an: "0 ≤ a$n"<br>
  shows measurable_shear_interval: "(λx. χ i. if i = m then x$m + x$n else x$i) <code> (cbox a b) ∈ lmeasurable"
   and measure_shear_interval: "measure lebesgue ((λx. χ i. if i = m then x$m + x$n else x$i) </code> cbox a b)<br>
               = measure lebesgue (cbox a b)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On its first attempt it produced something that seemed to be almost right but clunky and referred to something non-standard. Pushing it a little further, I got the following, which is far as I can tell is correct. (Isabelle accepts it.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>proposition<br>
  fixes a :: "'a::euclidean_space"<br>
  assumes "m ≠ n"      and "m ∈ Basis" and "n ∈ Basis"<br>
    and ab_ne: "cbox a b ≠ {}"      and an: "0 ≤ a ∙ n"<br>
  shows measurable_shear_interval:          "(λx. ∑i∈Basis. (if i = m then (x ∙ i) + (x ∙ n)                            else (x ∙ i)) *⇩R i) <code> (cbox a b) ∈ lmeasurable"
   and measure_shear_interval:          "measure lebesgue ((λx. ∑i∈Basis. (if i = m then (x ∙ i) + (x ∙ n)                                          else (x ∙ i)) *⇩R i) </code> cbox a b)<br>
         = measure lebesgue (cbox a b)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything was accompanied by quantities of plausible sounding narrative, e.g. "this version is more abstract and elegant”. A sample:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This version is more type-safe because:<br>
    • No need to worry about index bounds<br>
    • The basis vectors are first-class entities<br>
    • The notation more clearly reflects the mathematical intent<br>
Note that in this formulation:<br>
    • Basis is the canonical basis of the Euclidean space<br>
    • ∙ is the inner product (giving the component in a particular basis direction)<br>
    • *⇩R is the scalar multiplication<br>
    • The sum reconstructs the vector from its components<br>
Would you like me to explain any part of this formulation in more detail? Or would you like assistance with proving this version of the theorem?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My impression is that it was grabbing material from a variety of places, in particular the AFP entry Ordinary_Differential_Equations. But the word "elegant" doesn't appear there and in fact appears in the entire distribution + AFP only 42 times.</p>
<p>I recall doing the precise task above in the past and needing the better part of an hour to get it right. I didn't try to port the proof (which was long and complicated) and I would be surprised if it could get that right.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much more can be accomplished with the free version of DeepSeek. I have also seen Claude Sonnet 4 swallow entire Isabelle codebases and summarise them. These tools may already be useful for tasks such as identifying duplicate material.</p>

<p>I recently asked chatGPT if it could prove that $f(x) = x * ln (1 + 1/x)$ is <br>
monotone, but the answer was not helpful. How is DeepSeek doing on this one?<br>
(I think it can be proved easily via an alternating series for ln (1 + x)).</p>

Tobias,</p>
<p>I submitted the question of the monotonicity of the function f(x) = x * ln (1 + 1/x) to Deepseek. To that, I received a particularly detailed answer with many explanations of the thinking steps. Since Deepseek does not have the ability to share a conversation, I have put the answer in this PDF document.<br>

Tobias,</p>
<p>I submitted the question of the monotonicity of the function f(x) = x * ln (1 + 1/x) to Deepseek. To that, I received a particularly detailed answer with many explanations of the thinking steps. Since Deepseek does not have the ability to share a conversation, I have put the answer in this PDF document.<br>

Thanks, Huub. That DeeopSeek proof looks good (I only checked the case x &gt; 0). <br>
Much better than what I had got out of chatGPT, but somebody else posted a <br>
chatGPT proof that may be similar (I cannot find it just now).</p>
<p>Below you find Larry's short proof (for positive x) he sent to me. But it relies <br>
on this corollary</p>
<p>corollary ln_diff_less: "0 &lt; x ⟹ 0 &lt; y ⟹ x ≠ y ⟹ ln x - ln y &lt; (x - y) / y"</p>
<p>which in turn uses this lemma (from the library)</p>
<p>lemma ln_eq_minus_one:<br>
   assumes "0 &lt; x" "ln x = x - 1"<br>
   shows "x = 1"</p>
<p>Its proof (in the library) uses the derivative. So using a second derivative <br>
appears not unreasonable.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that DeepSeek also considers<br>
Alternative Approach: Using Series Expansion<br>
that I had also toyed with. I think it yields the result directly w/o going via <br>
derivatives (as DeepSeek does).</p>
<p>Tobias</p>
<p>Larry's proof:</p>
<p>lemma<br>
   defines "f ≡ (λx::real. x * ln (1 + 1/x))"<br>
   shows "strict_mono_on {0&lt;..} f"<br>
proof -<br>
   have "∃y. (f has_real_derivative y) (at x) ∧ 0 &lt; y" if "x&gt;0" for x :: real<br>
   proof -<br>
     have "(f has_real_derivative ln(x+1) - ln(x) - 1 / (x+1)) (at x)"<br>
       unfolding f_def using ‹x&gt;0›<br>
       by (rule_tac derivative_eq_intros refl | force simp add: ln_div <br>
divide_simps)+<br>
     then show ?thesis<br>
       using diff_gt_0_iff_gt ‹x&gt;0› ln_diff_less[of x "x+1"] by auto<br>
   qed<br>
   then have "f r &lt; f s" if "r &lt; s" "0 &lt; r" for r s::real<br>
     by (simp add: DERIV_pos_imp_increasing dual_order.strict_trans1 that)<br>
   then show ?thesis<br>
     by (blast intro: strict_mono_onI)<br>
