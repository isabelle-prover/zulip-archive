<p>From: Alexander Steen &lt;<a href="mailto:alexander.steen@uni-greifswald.de">alexander.steen@uni-greifswald.de</a>&gt;<br>
The Jury of the Dov Gabbay Prize for Logic and Foundations is pleased to <br>
annnounce that the 2023 Dov Gabbay Prize is awarded jointly to</p>
<ul>
<li>Dale Miller and Mirek Truszczynski *</li>
</ul>
<p>for their long-standing important contributions to the practice and <br>
theory of logic programming, theorem proving and related important <br>
strands in Computational Logic.</p>
<p>Dale Miller (Inria-Saclay and LIX/Ecole Polytechnique, France) has done <br>
pioneering and agenda-setting research bringing together and advancing <br>
logical proof theory and computational logic in the areas of <br>
higher-order logic programming and higher-order theorem proving. His <br>
research spans the full range from innovative foundational theory to the <br>
design and implementation of state-of-the-art working systems.</p>
<p>Mirek Truszczynski (University of Kentucky, USA) has done pioneering and <br>
agenda-setting research in logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, <br>
answer-set programming, and preference in computational choice, where <br>
his seminal contributions are widely recognized. His research has <br>
succesfully run the gamut from mathematical foundations to industrial <br>
applications.</p>
<p>The Dov Gabbay Prize was instituted in 2022 by the Initiative for Logic <br>
and Foundations on the occasion of Dov Gabbay's 77th birthday. Its <br>
intent is to recognize outstanding inspirational contributions in logic <br>
and foundations across the interdisciplinary range of activities in <br>
Gabbay’s work over the years.</p>
<p>In response to a first call, the Jury has received a wide and diverse <br>
range of strong nominations of high-profile excellent candidates, which <br>
resulted in extensive discussions. It was decided to focus in this first <br>
round on research in Computational Logic that reflects primary interests <br>
of Dov Gabbay.</p>
<p>With the awards to follow in the years to come, the profile of the <br>
Gabbay Prize will be built up further: in particular, Philosophical <br>
Logic and Mathematical Logic will be in focus in succeeding years. <br>
Further information on these and other matters regarding the Prize will <br>
be found in the next calls for proposals.</p>
