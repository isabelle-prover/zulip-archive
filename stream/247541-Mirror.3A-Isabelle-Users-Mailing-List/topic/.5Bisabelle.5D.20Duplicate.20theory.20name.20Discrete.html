Hi all,</p>
<p>I have the following error message in a thy file which uses both <br>
sessions Ordinary_Differential_Equations and HOL-CSPM:</p>
<p>exception THEORY raised (line 378 of "context.ML"):<br>
   Duplicate theory name<br>
   {..., Main, HOLCF.Porder, HOLCF.Pcpo, HOLCF.Cont, Discrete}<br>
   {..., HOL.Transcendental, HOL.Complex, HOL.MacLaurin, Complex_Main, <br>
Discrete}</p>
<p>A simple setup to reproduce the error is with the following theory:</p>
<p>theory MyTheory<br>
   imports<br>
     "HOLCF.Discrete"<br>
     "HOL-Library.Library"<br>
begin<br>
end</p>
<p>and a ROOTS file such as:</p>
<p>/path/to/Isabelle2024/src/HOL</p>
<p>Any idea on how to fix this?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

You cannot have two theories with the same base name in an import path <br>
unfortunately (a limitation coming from a time when theories were <br>
considered globally unique entities).</p>
<p>Currently, the only option (that I am aware of) is is to rename one of <br>
the theories.</p>

Hello,</p>
<p>it is somewhat rare to include all of HOL-Library in a theory. Usually <br>
you only import the bits of it that you actually need.</p>
<p>If your work does not depend on HOL-Library.Discrete then I would <br>
recommend to simply import the bits of HOL-Library that you explicitly need.</p>
<p>Of course we should try to make sure that at least within the HOL part <br>
of the Isabelle distribution, no duplicate theory names occur. And in <br>
the future, in the AFP as well.</p>

<p>From: Paolo Crisafulli &lt;<a href="mailto:paolo.crisafulli@irt-systemx.fr">paolo.crisafulli@irt-systemx.fr</a>&gt;<br>
Thank you for you answer.</p>
<p>HOL-Library.Discrete is used by HOL-Analysis (in Summation_Tests), fully <br>
imported by Ordinary_Differential_Equations.Linear_ODE, through <br>
Bounded_Linear_Operator.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have renamed HOL-Library.Discrete to LDiscrete (not <br>
a great name, just testing), and it only requires a reasonable effort to <br>
propagate the change:</p>
<p>./HOL/ex/Function_Growth.thy:19<br>
./HOL/Library/Library.thy:1<br>
./HOL/Library/LDiscrete.thy:24<br>
./HOL/Analysis/Summation_Tests.thy:14</p>
<p>Didn't actually do it for the whole AFP, but it looks reasonable too:</p>
<p>$ grep -r -l "HOL-Library.Discrete" . | xargs grep -c Discrete<br>
./thys/Bertrands_Postulate/Bertrand.thy:26<br>
./thys/Universal_Turing_Machine/Recs_alt_Def.thy:1<br>
./thys/Universal_Turing_Machine/Recs.thy:1<br>
./thys/Vickrey_Clarke_Groves/MiscTools.thy:3<br>
./thys/Pell/Efficient_Discrete_Sqrt.thy:23<br>
./thys/Pell/Pell_Algorithm.thy:6<br>
./thys/Hoare_Time/Nielson_Sqrt.thy:11<br>
./thys/Hoare_Time/QuantK_Sqrt.thy:11<br>
./thys/LLL_Basis_Reduction/LLL_Complexity.thy:1<br>
./thys/Continued_Fractions/Quadratic_Irrationals.thy:8<br>

./thys/Karatsuba_Sqrt/Karatsuba_Sqrt_Library.thy:8<br>
./thys/Karatsuba_Sqrt/Karatsuba_Sqrt.thy:40</p>
<p>I am willing to do the job if necessary.</p>
<p>Any thoughts anyone?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Looking again more closely, I now understand the rather generic name of theory <br>
HOL-Library.Discrete: it defines qualified functions like Discrete.log.</p>
<p>In contrast, HOLCF.Discrete is merely "internal" to HOLCF and not used <br>
directly elsewhere. So we could easily change that for Isabelle2025 (March <br>
2025), using the included changeset.</p>

Thank you Manuel.</p>
<p>To sum up:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to benefit from the renaming of HOL-Library.Discrete and <br>
HOLCF.Discrete, we need to work with a development version of <br>
Isabelle/HOL: <a href="https://isatest.sketis.net/devel/release_snapshot/">https://isatest.sketis.net/devel/release_snapshot/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a consequence, we'll also have to work with a development version <br>
of AFP, because of the impact of the renaming done in HOL-Library.Discrete</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and our submissions, if accepted, will be available in afp-devel only, <br>
until Q1 2025; then AFP release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
