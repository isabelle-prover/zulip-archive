<p>From: Giorgio Audrito &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
ECOOP is Europe’s longest-standing annual Programming Languages conference,<br>
bringing together researchers, practitioners, and students to share their<br>
ideas and experiences in all topics related to programming languages,<br>
software development, systems and applications. ECOOP welcomes high quality<br>
research papers relating to these fields in a broad sense. ECOOP was<br>
originally focused on object orientation, but now includes all practical<br>
and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems and<br>
environments. ECOOP solicits innovative solutions to real problems as well<br>
as evaluations of existing solutions.</p>
<p>ECOOP is committed to affordable open access publishing. Recent year’s<br>
publications have been published by Dagstuhl’s LIPIcs series under a<br>
Creative Commons CC-BY license where the authors retain their copyright.<br>
ECOOP articles have been published without open access publishing fee and<br>
can be accessed via a DOI. LIPIcs is indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar,<br>
Scopus and others.</p>
<p>In 2025, ECOOP will be hosted by the Software Engineering research group<br>
&lt;<a href="https://selabhvl.github.io/">https://selabhvl.github.io/</a>&gt; at the Høgskulen på Vestlandet (Western<br>
Norway University of Applied Sciences) &lt;<a href="https://www.hvl.no/">https://www.hvl.no/</a>&gt; in Bergen,<br>
Norway, between June 30th and July 4th. More information can be found on<br>
the conference website: <a href="https://2025.ecoop.org">https://2025.ecoop.org</a></p>

<p>Submissions</p>
<p>Submissions will be done through HotCRP &lt;<a href="https://ecoop25.hotcrp.com">https://ecoop25.hotcrp.com</a>&gt; but<br>
are not yet open at the time of this writing. Authors are asked to pick one<br>
of the following paper categories:</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Research. The most traditional category for papers that advance the<br>
   state of the art.<br>
   -</p>
<p>Replication. An empirical evaluation that reconstructs a published<br>
   experiment in a different context in order to validate the results of that<br>
   earlier work.<br>
   -</p>
<p>Experience. Applications of known PL techniques in practice as well as<br>
   tools. Industry papers will be reviewed by practitioners. We welcome<br>
   negative results that may provide inspiration for future research.<br>
   -</p>
<p>Pearls/Brave New Ideas. Articles that either explain a known idea in an<br>
   elegant way or unconventional papers introducing ideas that may take some<br>
   time to substantiate. These papers may be short.</p>
<p>Submission must not have been published, or have major overlap with<br>
previous work. In case of doubt, contact the PC chairs (listed below).<br>
Proceedings will be published in open access by Dagstuhl LIPIcs in the<br>
Dagstuhl LIPIcs LaTeX-style template (<br>
<a href="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author">https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author</a>). To reduce<br>
friction when resubmitting, ACM’s PACMPL and TOPLAS formatted papers can be<br>
submitted as such (with the understanding that if accepted, they will need<br>
to be reformatted and reduced to the page limit).</p>
<p>ECOOP uses double-anonymous reviewing. Authors’ identities are only<br>
revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must omit author names and<br>
institutions, and use the third person when referencing the authors’ own<br>
work. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the<br>
submission; see the FAQ &lt;<a href="https://2024.ecoop.org/track/ecoop-2024-papers#FAQ">https://2024.ecoop.org/track/ecoop-2024-papers#FAQ</a>&gt;.<br>
If in doubt, contact the chairs.</p>
<p>There is no page limit on submissions, but authors must understand that<br>
reviewers have a fixed time budget for each paper, so the length of the<br>
feedback is likely to be unaffected by length. Brevity is a virtue. Authors<br>
also have to consider that the camera-ready version must be (at most) 25<br>
pages in LIPIcs format (not including references).</p>
<p>Authors will be given a three-day period to read and respond to the reviews<br>
of their papers before the program committee meeting. Responses have no<br>
length limit.</p>
<p>ECOOP will continue to have two deadlines for submissions. Papers submitted<br>
in each round can be (a) accepted, (b) rejected, or (c) asked for<br>
revisions. Rejected papers that are submitted to the immediate next round<br>
can be desk-rejected if they do not sufficiently differ from the previous<br>
submission. Revisions can be submitted at any later round. Papers retain<br>
their reviewers during revision.</p>
<p>Review Criteria</p>
<p>Each paper will be evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Soundness: How well the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous<br>
   application of appropriate research methods;<br>
   -</p>
<p>Significance: The extent to which the paper’s contributions are novel,<br>
   original, and important, with respect to the existing body of knowledge;<br>
   -</p>
<p>Presentation: Whether the paper’s quality of writing meets the high<br>
   standards of ECOOP.</p>
<p>After author response and reviewer discussion, papers will be accepted if<br>
the PC decides that the paper meets our high bar for Soundness and<br>
Presentation, and if one reviewer judges the paper to meet the bar for<br>
Significance. The goal of this process is to ensure quality of writing and<br>
confidence in results, while assuming that if one reviewer finds the paper<br>
to be significant then there will be readers who do so as well.</p>
<p>Artifact Evaluation and Intent</p>
<p>To support replication of experiments, authors of research papers may<br>
submit artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. They will be asked<br>
whether they intend to submit an artifact at submission time. It is<br>
understood that some papers do not have artifacts. AEC members will serve<br>
on the extended review committee.</p>
<p>Journal First and Journal After</p>
<p>We have Journal First/After arrangements with ACM’s Transactions on<br>
Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), Elsevier’s Science of Computer<br>
Programming (SCP) and AITO’s Journal of Object Technology (JOT).</p>
<p>Only new research papers are eligible to be Journal First (JF). JF papers<br>
will have an extended abstract in the ECOOP proceedings. The deadline is<br>
the same as Round 1 of submissions and the notification is aligned with<br>
Round 2 notification. TOPLAS JF papers should be submitted according to<br>
this announcement. SCP JF papers should follow this call for papers. JF<br>
papers are presented at the conference and eligible for awards.</p>
<p>Journal After (JA) papers are papers for which the authors request to be<br>
considered for post conference journal publication. Once accepted by the<br>
ECOOP PC, these papers will be forwarded to the journal editors. Reviews<br>
and reviewers will be forwarded and used at the editor’s discretion. JA<br>
papers will have an extended abstract (up to 12 pages) in the conference<br>
proceedings.</p>
