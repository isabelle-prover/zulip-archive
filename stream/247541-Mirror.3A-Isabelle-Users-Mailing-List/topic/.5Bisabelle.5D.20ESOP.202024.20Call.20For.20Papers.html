<p>Scope<br>
ESOP is an annual conference devoted to fundamental issues in the<br>
specification, design, analysis, and implementation of programming<br>
languages and systems. ESOP seeks contributions on all aspects of<br>
programming language research including, but not limited to, the following<br>
areas: programming paradigms and styles, methods and tools to specify and<br>
reason about programs and languages, programming language foundations,<br>
methods and tools for implementation, concurrency and distribution,<br>
applications and emerging topics.</p>
<p>Contributions bridging the gap between theory and practice are particularly<br>
welcome.</p>
<p>Submission Categories</p>
<p>Research Papers are articles that advance the state-of-the-art on the<br>
theory and practice of programming languages and systems.</p>
<p>For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in<br>
Springer’s LNCS, ACM's PACMPL, or ACM's TOPLAS format. There is no page<br>
limit for submissions, but authors should be aware that reviewers are<br>
likely to balance the review time for all papers and that camera-ready<br>
papers may not exceed 25 pages (excluding bibliography) and must be<br>
formatted in Springer’s LNCS.</p>
<p>Experience Reports are articles reporting on systems and techniques<br>
developed in practice, such as artifacts, tools, mechanized proofs, and<br>
educational systems, both in academic and industrial settings. These<br>
articles must include a critical evaluation of the experience reported.</p>
<p>Submitted and camera-ready experience report papers must be formatted in<br>
Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography).</p>
<p>Fresh Perspectives are articles that promote new insights on programming<br>
languages and systems in a particularly elegant way. These papers may offer<br>
new tutorial perspectives of known concepts or they may introduce fresh new<br>
insights and ideas that could lead to relevant future developments.</p>
<p>Submitted and camera-ready fresh perspective papers must be formatted in<br>
Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography).</p>
<p>Springer's formatting style files and other information can be found on the<br>
Springer website:<br>
<a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a></p>
<p>Review Process<br>
The review process is double-blind with a rebuttal phase. In submitted<br>
papers, authors should omit names and institutions; refer to prior work in<br>
the third person; and should not include acknowledgements that might reveal<br>
their identity.<br>
During the evaluation period authors are free to speak publicly about their<br>
work and distribute preprints of their submitted papers. However, authors<br>
should avoid actions that would reveal their identities, such as directly<br>
contacting PC members.</p>
<p>Submission link: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esop2024">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esop2024</a><br>
Accepted papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer<br>
Science series.</p>
<p>Artifact Evaluation<br>
ESOP 2024 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation.<br>
Authors will be encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper<br>
notification. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision. Note:<br>
Artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5 page experience<br>
report (including 1 page bibliography), that will appear in the conference<br>
proceedings.</p>
<p>Journal-After Submissions</p>
<p>Revised and expanded versions of accepted ESOP research papers are eligible<br>
for the ESOP Journal-After TOPLAS channel. A call will open in January at a<br>
predefined date after the ESOP notification, and to which all accepted<br>
papers may apply. A first light review round will be performed by the ESOP<br>
PC, to reach Reject or Revise decisions. Papers with Revise decisions will<br>
proceed to a second thorough review round, in which additional reviews will<br>
be coordinated with TOPLAS, towards a final Reject or Accept decision.</p>
