<p>From: Tobias Nipkow &lt;<a href="mailto:nipkow@in.tum.de">nipkow@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear readers,</p>
<p>For a change I would like to describe a solution rather than ask a question.</p>
<p>If one is interested in executability, but wants to stay at an abstract level, <br>
one is sometimes faced with the challenge of executing set comprehensions. Of <br>
course there is no silver bullet for those, but often they feel almost <br>
executable, but Isabelle fails to recognize this.</p>
<p>A brute force approach is to define a second version on the list level and prove <br>
the equivalence and execute the list version. Here I want to show how to stay on <br>
the set level, yet make it executable.</p>
<p>A typical example:</p>
<p>definition f :: "(int * int) set ⇒ int set" where<br>
"f M = {b. ∃a. (a,b) ∈ M ∧ a &gt; b}"</p>
<p>This is not executable because of the EX. So we need to reformulate f:</p>
<p>lemma f_exec[code]: "f M = (λ(a,b). b) ` {(a,b) ∈ M. a &gt; b}"<br>
unfolding f_def f'_def by auto</p>
<p>The equivalence is automatic and the result executable, eg</p>
<p>value "f {(2,1), (1,2), (3,1)}"</p>
<p>In general, you can make a set comprehension executable by transforming it into <br>
compositions of ` (= map) and {a : M. ...} (= filter), where each component is <br>
executable. (UN may also come in handy, but if frequently leads to "UN x : M. <br>
{...}", which is better expressed with map and filter.)</p>
<p>Note that the filter pattern is restricted:<br>
It works for variables x in {x : M. ...}; in the latest distribution it also <br>
works for pairs (see above) and triples. Arbitrary tuples would require a simproc.</p>
<p>Best<br>

<p>Yes, Florian has recently modified this because I felt Set.filter" wasn't ideal.</p>
