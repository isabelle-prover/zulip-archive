FM 2026: Call for Papers</p>
<hr>
<p>May 20--22, 2026<br>
Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p>FM 2026 is the 27th international symposium on Formal Methods in a<br>
series organized by Formal Methods Europe (FME), an independent<br>
association whose aim is to stimulate the use of, and research on,<br>
formal methods for software development. The FM symposia have been<br>
successful in bringing together researchers and industrial users<br>
around a program of original papers on research and industrial<br>
experience, workshops, tutorials, reports on tools, projects, and<br>
ongoing doctoral research. FM 2026 will be both an occasion to<br>
celebrate and a platform for enthusiastic researchers and<br>
practitioners from a diversity of backgrounds to exchange their ideas<br>
and share their experiences. See<br>
<a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026">https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026</a></p>
<p>The FM 2026 proceedings will appear as part of the LNCS FM subline,<br>
with gold open access.</p>
<h2>Important Dates:</h2>
<p>Abstract Submission     November 25, 2025<br>
Full Paper Submission   December 2, 2025<br>
Paper Notification      January 30, 2026<br>
Final Version           February 23, 2026<br>
Main Conference         May 20--22, 2026</p>
<h2>Topics of Interest</h2>
<p>FM 2026 will highlight the development and application of formal<br>
methods in a wide range of domains including trustworthy AI,<br>
computer-based systems, systems-of-systems, cyber-physical systems,<br>
security, human-computer interaction, manufacturing, sustainability,<br>
energy, transport, smart cities, smart contracts in blockchain,<br>
healthcare and biology. We particularly welcome papers on techniques,<br>
tools, and experiences in interdisciplinary settings. We also welcome<br>
papers on experiences of applying formal methods in industrial<br>
settings, and on the design and validation of formal method tools.</p>
<h2>Track: Tests &amp; Proofs</h2>
<p>FM 2026 features a special track on Tests and Proofs (TAP) as a part<br>
of the conference.</p>
<p>TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets<br>
the interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the<br>
ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.</p>
<p>Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous<br>
techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of<br>
dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic<br>
techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are<br>
complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that<br>
provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and<br>
dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic<br>
execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or<br>
the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive<br>
enumeration. The verification of systems based on machine learning<br>
spurs novel combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g.,<br>
property verification of surrogate models that are generated through<br>
testing.</p>
<p>TAP's scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology,<br>
including foundational work, tool development, and empirical research.<br>
Topics of interest center around the combination of static techniques<br>
such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.</p>
<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p>We solicit various categories of papers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular Papers (max 15 pages)</li>
<li>Regular Papers, submitted to the TAP track (max 15 pages)</li>
<li>Long tool papers (max 15 pages)</li>
<li>Case study papers (max 15 pages)</li>
<li>Short papers (max 6 pages), including tool demonstration papers</li>
</ul>
<p>All page limits do not include references and appendices.</p>
<p>Papers should be original work, not published or submitted elsewhere,<br>
in Springer LNCS format, and written in English.</p>
<p>Each paper will be evaluated by at least three members of the Program<br>
Committee. Authors of papers reporting experimental work are strongly<br>
encouraged to make their experimental results available for use by the<br>
reviewers.</p>
<p>Papers submitted to the TAP track will undergo the same review process<br>
as other papers, by PC members with expertise in tests and proofs.</p>
<p>Case study papers should describe significant case studies, and the<br>
complete development should be made available at the time of<br>
review. The usual criteria for novelty, reproducibility, correctness<br>
and the ability for others to build upon the described work apply.</p>
<p>Tool papers and tool demonstration papers should explain enhancements<br>
made compared to previously published work. A tool demonstration paper<br>
need not present the theory behind the tool, but can focus on the<br>
tool's features, how it is used, its evaluation and examples and<br>
screenshots illustrating the tool's use. Authors of tool and tool<br>
demonstration papers should make their tools available for use by the<br>
reviewers and are highly encouraged to participate in the artifact<br>
evaluation once their paper is accepted.</p>
<p>Reviewing is single-blind.</p>
<p>For all papers, an appendix can provide additional material such as<br>
details on proofs or experiments. The appendix is not part of the page<br>
count and will only be read at the discretion of the reviewers. Thus,<br>
it should not contain information necessary for the understanding and<br>
evaluation of the presented work.</p>
<p>Papers will be accepted or rejected in the category in which they were<br>
submitted and will not be moved between categories. At least one<br>
author of an accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the<br>
conference as a registered participant.</p>
<h3>Proceedings</h3>
<p>The conference proceedings will be published open access by Springer<br>
in the LNCS series, as part of the FM subline, with gold open access.</p>
<h3>Submissions</h3>
<p>Submission link: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2026">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2026</a></p>
<p>Authors of all accepted papers are invited to submit an artifact for<br>
evaluation by the FM 2026 Artifact Evaluation Committee after the<br>
paper notification. For long tool papers and tool demonstration<br>
papers, submission of an artifact is strongly encouraged.</p>
<h3>Best Paper Award</h3>
<p>At the conference, the PC Chairs will present an award to the authors<br>
of the submission selected as the FM 2026 Best Paper.</p>
<h3>Special Issue</h3>
<p>Extended versions of selected papers will be invited for publication<br>
in a special issue of a journal to be announced soon.</p>
