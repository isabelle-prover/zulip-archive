<p>FM 2026: Call for Papers</p>
<hr>
<p>May 20--22, 2026<br>
Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p>FM 2026 is the 27th international symposium on Formal Methods in a series<br>
organized by Formal Methods Europe (FME), an independent association whose aim<br>
is to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for software<br>
development. The FM symposia have been successful in bringing together<br>
researchers and industrial users around a program of original papers on<br>
research and industrial experience, workshops, tutorials, reports on tools,<br>
projects, and ongoing doctoral research. FM 2026 will be both an occasion to<br>
celebrate and a platform for enthusiastic researchers and practitioners from a<br>
diversity of backgrounds to exchange their ideas and share their experiences.<br>
See <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026">https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026</a> for further details.</p>
<p>The FM 2026 proceedings will appear as part of the LNCS FM subline, with gold<br>
open access.</p>
<h2>Important Dates:</h2>
<p>Abstract Submission     November 25, 2025 23:59 AoE<br>
Full Paper Submission   December 2, 2025 23:59 AoE<br>
Paper Notification      January 30, 2026 23:59 AoE<br>
Final Version           February 23, 2026 23:59 AoE<br>
Main Conference         May 20--22, 2026</p>
<h2>Topics of Interest</h2>
<p>FM 2026 will highlight the development and application of formal methods in a<br>
wide range of domains including trustworthy AI, computer-based systems,<br>
systems-of-systems, cyber-physical systems, security, human-computer<br>
interaction, manufacturing, sustainability, energy, transport, smart cities,<br>
smart contracts in blockchain, healthcare and biology. We particularly welcome<br>
papers on techniques, tools, and experiences in interdisciplinary settings. We<br>
also welcome papers on experiences of applying formal methods in industrial<br>
settings, and on the design and validation of formal method tools.</p>
<p>The topics of interest for FM 2026 include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interdisciplinary formal methods: Techniques, tools, and experiences<br>
demonstrating the use of formal methods in interdisciplinary settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal methods in practice: industrial applications of formal methods,<br>
experience with formal methods in industry, tool usage reports, experiments<br>
with challenge problems. The authors are encouraged to explain how formal<br>
methods overcame problems, led to improved designs, or provided new insights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools for formal methods: Advances in automated verification, model<br>
checking, and testing with formal methods, tools integration, environments for<br>
formal methods, and experimental validation of tools. The authors are<br>
encouraged to demonstrate empirically that the new tool or environment<br>
advances the state of the art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal methods in software and systems engineering: Development processes<br>
with formal methods, usage guidelines for formal methods, and method<br>
integration. The authors are encouraged to evaluate process innovations with<br>
respect to qualitative or quantitative improvements. Empirical studies and<br>
evaluations are also solicited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theoretical foundations of formal methods: All aspects of theory related to<br>
specification, verification, refinement, and static and dynamic analysis. The<br>
authors are encouraged to explain how their results contribute to the solution<br>
of practical problems with formal methods or tools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are particularly interested in submissions that apply formal methods on<br>
autonomous systems, including AI - and non-AI-based perception, decision, and<br>
control algorithms, compilers, middleware, operating systems, virtual<br>
machines, communication protocols, and hardware. Example application domains<br>
are increasingly automated vehicles, robots, and drones.</p>
<p>FM 2026 features two special tracks: one on Tests and Proofs (TAP) and another<br>
on Tutorials. Further, a doctoral symposium and an industry day will be held<br>
(see below)</p>
<h3>Track: Tests &amp; Proofs (TAP)</h3>
<p>TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the<br>
interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate goal of<br>
improving software and system dependability.<br>
Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous techniques and<br>
a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of dynamic and static<br>
analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic techniques such as testing<br>
and static techniques such as proving are complementary rather than mutually<br>
exclusive. Notable examples that provide evidence for the potential of a<br>
combination of static and dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based<br>
on symbolic execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking,<br>
or the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration. The<br>
verification of systems based on machine learning spurs novel combinations of<br>
dynamic and static analyses, e.g., property verification of surrogate models<br>
that are generated through testing.<br>
TAP's scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology, including<br>
foundational work, tool development, and empirical research.<br>
See <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/track/fm-2026/fm-2026-tap">https://conf.researchr.org/track/fm-2026/fm-2026-tap</a> for further details.</p>
<h3>Track: Tutorials</h3>
<p>The primary goal of these tutorials is to convey ideas with a focus on<br>
pedagogy over technical innovation. They offer a valuable platform for<br>
participants to discuss technical challenges, exchange research concepts,<br>
explore educational strategies, and demonstrate or investigate practical<br>
applications. Tutorials should be designed to be broadly accessible and<br>
pedagogically oriented, clarifying key concepts, building intuition, and<br>
ensuring ease of understanding. They aim to attract new researchers, serve as<br>
bridges to practitioners, and disseminate useful ideas widely. These may be<br>
driven by fundamental academic interests, or by needs from specific<br>
application domains.<br>
See <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/track/fm-2026/fm-2026-tutorials">https://conf.researchr.org/track/fm-2026/fm-2026-tutorials</a> for further<br>
details.</p>
<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p>We solicit various categories of papers. Except for tutorials, which has a<br>
dedicated track, papers in all categories can be submitted to either the<br>
Research or the TAP track.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular Papers (max 15 pages)</li>
<li>Long tool papers (max 15 pages)</li>
<li>Case study papers (max 15 pages)</li>
<li>Short papers (max 6 pages), including tool demonstration papers</li>
<li>Tutorial papers submitted to the Tutorial track (max 25 pages)</li>
</ul>
<p>All page limits do not include references and appendices.</p>
<p>Papers should be original work, not published or submitted elsewhere, in<br>
Springer LNCS format, and written in English.</p>
<p>Each paper will be evaluated by at least three members of the Program<br>
Committee. Authors of papers reporting experimental work are strongly<br>
encouraged to make their experimental results available for use by the<br>
reviewers.</p>
<p>Papers submitted to the TAP track will undergo the same review process as<br>
other papers, by PC members with expertise in tests and proofs.</p>
<p>Case study papers should describe significant case studies, and the complete<br>
development should be made available at the time of review. The usual criteria<br>
for novelty, reproducibility, correctness and the ability for others to build<br>
upon the described work apply.</p>
<p>Tool papers and tool demonstration papers should explain enhancements made<br>
compared to previously published work. A tool demonstration paper need not<br>
present the theory behind the tool, but can focus on the tool's features, how<br>
it is used, its evaluation and examples and screenshots illustrating the<br>
tool's use. Authors of tool and tool demonstration papers should make their<br>
tools available for use by the reviewers and are highly encouraged to<br>
participate in the artifact evaluation once their paper is accepted.</p>
<p>Reviewing is single-blind.</p>
<p>For all papers, an appendix can provide additional material such as details on<br>
proofs or experiments. The appendix is not part of the page count and will<br>
only be read at the discretion of the reviewers. Thus, it should not contain<br>
information necessary for the understanding and evaluation of the presented<br>
work.</p>
<p>Papers will be accepted or rejected in the category in which they were<br>
submitted and will not be moved between categories. At least one author of an<br>
accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference as a<br>
registered participant.</p>
<h3>Proceedings</h3>
<p>The conference proceedings will be published open access by Springer in the<br>
LNCS series, as part of the FM subline, with gold open access.</p>
