<p>======================================================================<br>
  2023 Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD): Student Forum<br>
                   October 23-27, Ames, Iowa, USA</p>
<p>Call for Student Contributions!</p>
<p>======================================================================</p>
<p>Please consider submitting or encouraging your students to submit to<br>
this year's FMCAD student forum. More information can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://fmcad.org/FMCAD23/student_forum/">https://fmcad.org/FMCAD23/student_forum/</a></p>
<p>Student Forum<br>
Continuing the tradition of the previous years, FMCAD 2023 is hosting<br>
a Student Forum that provides a platform for students at any career<br>
stage (undergraduate or graduate) to introduce their research to the<br>
wider Formal Methods community, and solicit feedback.</p>
<p>Main Activities<br>
Each student will give a short presentation and present their poster<br>
in the poster session.</p>
<p>Submissions for the event must be short reports describing research<br>
ideas or ongoing work that the student is currently pursuing and must<br>
be within the scope of FMCAD. Work, part of which has been previously<br>
published, will be considered; the novel aspect to be addressed in<br>
future work must be clearly described in such cases. All submissions<br>
will be reviewed by the Student Forum's program committee.</p>
<p>Important Dates<br>
Student forum submission: July 12, 2023<br>
Student forum notification: Aug 10, 2023<br>
These deadlines are 11:59 pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth)</p>
<p>Format<br>
The event will consist of short presentations by the student authors<br>
of each accepted submission and of a poster that will be on display<br>
throughout the duration of the conference. All participants of the<br>
conference are encouraged to attend the talks and approach the<br>
students during the poster presentation. Instructions for the<br>
preparation of the talks and poster sessions will be announced on<br>
notification of acceptance.</p>
<p>Visibility<br>
Accepted submissions will be listed, with title and author name, in<br>
the event description in the conference proceedings. The authors will<br>
also have the option to upload their slide deck/poster/presentation to<br>
the FMCAD website. The report itself will not appear in the FMCAD<br>
proceedings. Thus, the presentation at the forum should not interfere<br>
with potential future submissions of this research (to FMCAD or<br>
elsewhere).</p>
<p>Travel Awards<br>
Most of the applicants will receive travel reimbursement after the<br>
conference (the amount of support will be announced later). The first<br>
author of each contribution will be given priority over other authors.<br>
Please make sure you hold on to all receipts for reimbursement.<br>
Further instructions on how to apply for travel grants will be on the<br>
website.</p>
