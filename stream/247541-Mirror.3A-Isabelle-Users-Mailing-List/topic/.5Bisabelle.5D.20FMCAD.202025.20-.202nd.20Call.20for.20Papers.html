<p>================================================================================<br>
   Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD) 2025 - Second Call <br>
for Papers<br>
================================================================================</p>
<p>FMCAD 2025 is the twenty-fifth edition in a series of conferences on the <br>
theory and<br>
applications of formal methods in hardware and system verification. The <br>
conference<br>
encompasses a wide range of topics related to formal aspects of <br>
computer-aided system<br>
design, including verification, specification, synthesis, and testing <br>
and provides<br>
a leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for presenting <br>
and discussing<br>
groundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical results, and tools for <br>
reasoning<br>
formally about computing systems.</p>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>Conference Website: <a href="https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/">https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/</a><br>
Conference Location: SRI Headquarters, Menlo Park, California, US<br>
Conference Dates: October 6 - October 10, 2025</p>
<p>FMCAD 2025 includes the FMCAD Student Forum <br>
(<a href="https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/student_forum/">https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/student_forum/</a>)<br>
and is co-located with VSTTE 2025.</p>
<h2>Topics of Interest</h2>
<p>FMCAD welcomes submission of papers reporting original research on <br>
advances in all<br>
aspects of formal methods and their applications to computer-aided design.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Model checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and <br>
reduction,<br>
compositional methods, decision procedures at the bit- and word-level, <br>
probabilistic<br>
methods, combinations of deductive methods and decision procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synthesis and compilation for computer system descriptions, modeling, <br>
specification,<br>
and implementation languages, formal semantics of languages and their <br>
subsets, model-based<br>
design, design derivation and transformation, correct-by-construction <br>
methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application of formal and semi-formal methods to functional and <br>
non-functional<br>
specification and validation of hardware and software, including timing <br>
and power<br>
modeling, verification of computing systems on all levels of <br>
abstraction, system-level<br>
design and verification for embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, <br>
automotive<br>
systems and other safety-critical systems, hardware-software co-design <br>
and verification,<br>
and transaction-level verification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience with the application of formal and semi-formal methods to <br>
industrial-scale<br>
designs; tools that represent formal verification enablement, introduce <br>
new features,<br>
or substantially improve the automation of formal methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application of formal methods to verifying safety, connectivity and <br>
security properties<br>
of networks, distributed systems, smart contracts, block chains, and IoT <br>
devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application of formal methods to the analysis of machine learning <br>
systems, and<br>
applications of machine learning to enhance formal methods techniques.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>FMCAD/VSTTE Program Outline</h3>
<ul>
<li>Main VSTTE Day: October 6, 2025</li>
<li>Joint FMCAD/VSTTE Tutorial Day: October 7, 2025</li>
<li>Main FMCAD days: October 8 - October 10, 2025</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmcad2025">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmcad2025</a></p>
<p>Two categories of papers are invited: Regular papers, and Tool &amp; Case <br>
Study papers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Regular papers</em> are expected to offer novel foundational ideas, <br>
theoretical results,<br>
or algorithmic improvements to existing methods, along with experimental <br>
impact validation<br>
where applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tool &amp; Case Study papers</em> are expected to report on the design, <br>
implementation<br>
or use of verification (or related) technology in a practically relevant <br>
context<br>
(which need not be industrial), and its impact on design processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Regular and Tool &amp; Case Study papers must use the IEEE Transactions <br>
format on<br>
letter-size paper with a 10-point font size; preferably, use the FMCAD <br>
template for<br>
papers. Papers in both categories can be either 8 pages (long) or 4 <br>
pages (short)<br>
in length excluding references. Short papers that describe emerging <br>
results, practical<br>
experiences, or original ideas that can be described succinctly are <br>
encouraged. Authors<br>
will be required to select an appropriate paper category at abstract <br>
submission time.<br>
Submissions may contain an optional appendix, which will not appear in <br>
the final<br>
version of the paper. The reviewers should be able to assess the quality <br>
and the<br>
relevance of the results in the paper without reading the appendix.</p>
<p>Submissions in all categories must contain original research that has <br>
not been previously<br>
published, nor is concurrently submitted for publication. Any partial <br>
overlap with<br>
published or concurrently submitted papers must be clearly indicated.</p>
<p>FMCAD employs a rigorous peer-review process and each submission will be <br>
reviewed<br>
by at least four members of the program committee. The review process is <br>
single-blind.</p>
<p>The review process will incorporate a feedback and rebuttal period <br>
during which authors<br>
will have the opportunity to formally respond to reviewer comments.</p>
<p><strong>New - Artifact Evaluation:</strong> FMCAD 2025 introduces optional artifact <br>
evaluation<br>
to enhance transparency and the usability of research outcomes. Authors <br>
reporting<br>
experimental results are strongly encouraged to publish their final data <br>
in a long-term<br>
repository (e.g. zenodo (<a href="https://zenodo.org">https://zenodo.org</a>)). With artifacts serving as <br>
supplementary<br>
evidence, high-quality artifacts can improve the likelihood of paper <br>
acceptance.<br>
Artifact evaluation will be integrated into the main review process, <br>
with one selected<br>
program committee member assessing the quality of the artifact alongside <br>
the paper.<br>
Accepted artifacts require a DOI and will be clearly identified in the <br>
published<br>
paper. Details are available on the Artifacts Page <br>
(<a href="https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/cfa">https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/cfa</a>).</p>
<p>Accepted papers are published by TU Wien Academic Press under a Creative <br>
Commons<br>
license (the authors retain the copyright) and distributed through the <br>
IEEE XPlore<br>
digital library. IEEE CEDA is a technical co-sponsor of FMCAD. There are <br>
no publication<br>
fees. Authors of accepted contributions will be required to sign the <br>
FMCAD copyright<br>
transfer form found here: <a href="https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf">https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf</a>.<br>
For each accepted paper, at least one unique author must register for <br>
the conference.<br>
Moreover, authors of accepted papers ensure that at least one of them <br>
will attend<br>
the conference and present the work.</p>
<h2>Student Forum</h2>
<p>Continuing the tradition of the previous years, FMCAD 2025 will host a <br>
Student Forum<br>
that provides a platform for graduate students at any career stage to <br>
introduce their<br>
research to the wider Formal Methods community, and solicit feedback.</p>
<p>Submissions for the student forum must be short reports describing <br>
research ideas<br>
or ongoing work that the student is currently pursuing, and must be <br>
within the scope<br>
of FMCAD. Work that has been partly published previously might be <br>
considered; the<br>
novel aspect to be addressed in future work must be clearly described in <br>
such cases.</p>
<p>All submissions will be reviewed by a selected group of FMCAD student <br>
forum committee<br>
members. Details are available on the Student Forum Page <br>
(<a href="https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/student_forum">https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/student_forum</a>).</p>
