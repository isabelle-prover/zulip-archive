<p>================================================================================<br>
  Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD) 2025 - Call for Papers<br>
================================================================================</p>
<p>FMCAD 2025 is the twenty-fifth edition in a series of conferences on the<br>
theory and<br>
applications of formal methods in hardware and system verification. The<br>
conference<br>
encompasses a wide range of topics related to formal aspects of computer-aided<br>
system<br>
design, including verification, specification, synthesis, and testing and<br>
provides<br>
a leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for presenting and<br>
discussing<br>
groundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical results, and tools for<br>
reasoning<br>
formally about computing systems.</p>

<h3>FMCAD/VSTTE Program Outline</h3>
<ul>
<li>Main VSTTE Day: October 6, 2025</li>
<li>Joint FMCAD/VSTTE Tutorial Day: October 7, 2025</li>
<li>Main FMCAD days: October 8 - October 10, 2025</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmcad2025">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmcad2025</a></p>
<p>Two categories of papers are invited: Regular papers, and Tool &amp; Case Study<br>
papers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Regular papers</em> are expected to offer novel foundational ideas, theoretical<br>
results,<br>
or algorithmic improvements to existing methods, along with experimental<br>
impact validation<br>
where applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tool &amp; Case Study papers</em> are expected to report on the design,<br>
implementation<br>
or use of verification (or related) technology in a practically relevant<br>
context<br>
(which need not be industrial), and its impact on design processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Regular and Tool &amp; Case Study papers must use the IEEE Transactions<br>
format on<br>
letter-size paper with a 10-point font size; preferably, use the FMCAD<br>
template for<br>
papers. Papers in both categories can be either 8 pages (long) or 4 pages<br>
(short)<br>
in length excluding references. Short papers that describe emerging results,<br>
practical<br>
experiences, or original ideas that can be described succinctly are<br>
encouraged. Authors<br>
will be required to select an appropriate paper category at abstract<br>
submission time.<br>
Submissions may contain an optional appendix, which will not appear in the<br>
final<br>
version of the paper. The reviewers should be able to assess the quality and<br>
the<br>
relevance of the results in the paper without reading the appendix.</p>
<p>Submissions in all categories must contain original research that has not been<br>
previously<br>
published, nor is concurrently submitted for publication. Any partial overlap<br>
with<br>
published or concurrently submitted papers must be clearly indicated.</p>
<p>FMCAD employs a rigorous peer-review process and each submission will be<br>
reviewed<br>
by at least four members of the program committee. The review process is<br>
single-blind.</p>
<p>The review process will incorporate a feedback and rebuttal period during<br>
which authors<br>
will have the opportunity to formally respond to reviewer comments.</p>
<p><strong>New - Artifact Evaluation:</strong> FMCAD 2025 introduces optional artifact<br>
evaluation<br>
to enhance transparency and the usability of research outcomes. Authors<br>
reporting<br>
experimental results are strongly encouraged to publish their final data in a<br>
long-term<br>
repository (e.g. zenodo (<a href="https://zenodo.org">https://zenodo.org</a>)). With artifacts serving as<br>
supplementary<br>
evidence, high-quality artifacts can improve the likelihood of paper<br>
acceptance.<br>
Artifact evaluation will be integrated into the main review process, with one<br>
selected<br>
program committee member assessing the quality of the artifact alongside the<br>
paper.<br>
Accepted artifacts require a DOI and will be clearly identified in the<br>
published<br>
paper. Details are available on the Artifacts Page<br>
(<a href="https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/cfa">https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/cfa</a>).</p>
<p>Accepted papers are published by TU Wien Academic Press under a Creative<br>
Commons<br>
license (the authors retain the copyright) and distributed through the IEEE<br>
XPlore<br>
digital library. IEEE CEDA is a technical co-sponsor of FMCAD. There are no<br>
publication<br>
fees. Authors of accepted contributions will be required to sign the FMCAD<br>
copyright<br>
transfer form found here: <a href="https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf">https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf</a>.<br>
For each accepted paper, at least one unique author must register for the<br>
conference.<br>
Moreover, authors of accepted papers ensure that at least one of them will<br>
attend<br>
the conference and present the work.</p>
<h2>Student Forum</h2>
<p>Continuing the tradition of the previous years, FMCAD 2025 will host a Student<br>
Forum<br>
that provides a platform for graduate students at any career stage to<br>
introduce their<br>
research to the wider Formal Methods community, and solicit feedback.</p>
<p>Submissions for the student forum must be short reports describing research<br>
ideas<br>
or ongoing work that the student is currently pursuing, and must be within the<br>
scope<br>
of FMCAD. Work that has been partly published previously might be considered;<br>
the<br>
novel aspect to be addressed in future work must be clearly described in such<br>
cases.</p>
<p>All submissions will be reviewed by a selected group of FMCAD student forum<br>
committee<br>
members. Details are available on the Student Forum Page<br>
(<a href="https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/student_forum">https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/student_forum</a>).</p>
