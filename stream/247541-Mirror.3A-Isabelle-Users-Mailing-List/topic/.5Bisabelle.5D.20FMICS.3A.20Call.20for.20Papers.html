<p>Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS)<br>
   31st International Conference, co-located with CONFEST</p>
<p><a href="https://confest-2026.github.io/fmics/">https://confest-2026.github.io/fmics/</a></p>
<p>2 - 4 September 2026<br>
         University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK</p>
<hr>
<p>Theme of the Conference:</p>
<hr>
<p>The aim of the FMICS conference series is to provide a forum for <br>
researchers an practitioners who are interested in the development and <br>
application of formal methods in industry. FMICS brings together <br>
scientists and engineers who are active in the area of formal methods <br>
and interested in exchanging their experiences in the industrial usage <br>
of these methods. The FMICS conference series also strives to promote <br>
research and development for the improvement of formal methods and tools <br>
for industrial applications.</p>
<p>FMICS is the ERCIM Working Group conference on Formal Methods for <br>
Industrial Critical Systems, and it is the key conference in the <br>
intersection of industrial applications and Formal Methods.</p>
<p>Topics of Interest:</p>
<hr>
<p>We encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches that bring together <br>
formal methods and industrial applications.<br>
     * Formal specification, including specification elicitation, <br>
validation, debugging, sanity checking, revision, coverage, and <br>
explainability.<br>
     * Case studies and experience reports on industrial applications of <br>
formal methods, focusing on lessons learned or identification of new <br>
research directions.<br>
     * Methods, techniques, and tools to support automated analysis, <br>
certification, debugging, learning, optimization, and transformation of <br>
complex, distributed, real-time, embedded, mobile, and autonomous systems.<br>
     * Verification and validation methods (model checking, theorem <br>
proving, SAT/SMT constraint solving, abstract interpretation, etc.) that <br>
address shortcomings of existing methods with respect to their <br>
industrial applicability (e.g., scalability and usability issues, tool <br>
qualification, and certification).<br>
     * Transfer to industry and impact of adoption of formal methods on <br>
the development process and associated costs in industry. Application of <br>
formal methods in standardization and industrial forums.</p>
<p>Important Dates:</p>

<p>Abstract Submission: 10 Apr 2026<br>
Paper Submission:    17 Apr 2026<br>
Paper Notifications:  1 Jun 2026<br>
Camera-ready Papers: 15 Jun 2026<br>
Conference:         2-4 Sep 2026</p>
<p>Submission Details:</p>
<hr>
<p>Papers must describe original research work and results. Submitted <br>
papers must not have previously appeared in a journal or conference with <br>
published proceedings and must not be concurrently submitted to any <br>
other peer-reviewed workshop, symposium, conference, or archival <br>
journal. Any partial overlap with any such published or concurrently <br>
submitted paper must be clearly indicated.</p>
<p>Submissions should clearly motivate relevance to industrial <br>
applications. Case study papers should identify lessons learned, <br>
validate theoretical results (such as scalability of methods), and <br>
provide specific motivation for further research and development.</p>
<p>Papers should not exceed 15 pages (excluding references) formatted <br>
according to the Springer author guidelines LNCS style. Any appendices <br>
(beyond the above page limit) might not be considered in the review <br>
process. All submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of <br>
the Programme Committee, which will make a selection among the <br>
submissions based on the novelty, soundness, and applicability of the <br>
presented ideas and results. Papers must be written in English and <br>
submitted in PDF format at the EasyChair submission site:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmics2026">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmics2026</a></p>
<p>For all papers with experimental results, we strongly recommend <br>
providing reviewers with an artifact that they can use to reproduce <br>
results, e.g., via a paper website.</p>
<p>ERCIM Award:</p>
<hr>
<p>As in best FMICS tradition, the paper with the best contributions to <br>
Software Science and Technology will be honoured with the EASST ERCIM award.</p>
