<p><strong>From:</strong> Gidon Ernst &lt;<a href="mailto:gidon.ernst@lmu.de">gidon.ernst@lmu.de</a>&gt;</p>
<p>[apologies for cross-posting]</p>
<p>Dear researchers,</p>
<p>We would like to invite you to submit your work as a paper to FTfJP 2026 <br>
(<a href="https://2026.ecoop.org/home/FTfJP-2026">https://2026.ecoop.org/home/FTfJP-2026</a> <br>
&lt;<a href="https://2026.ecoop.org/home/FTfJP-2026">https://2026.ecoop.org/home/FTfJP-2026</a>&gt;). The Formal Techniques for <br>
Judicious Programming (FTfJP) workshop is an established workshop which <br>
has run annually since 1999 alongside ECOOP, with the goal of bringing <br>
together people working in both fields.</p>
<p><em>Paper categories</em></p>
<p>We solicit two categories of papers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Full Papers (12 pages, excluding references) present a technical <br>
contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. We welcome both <br>
complete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is particularly <br>
welcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate interesting <br>
discussions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short Papers (6 pages, excluding references) should advocate a <br>
promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely to <br>
stimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage e.g. established <br>
researchers to set out a personal vision, and beginning researchers to <br>
present a planned path to a PhD.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the <br>
workshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed and will be evaluated based <br>
on their clarity and their potential to generate interesting <br>
discussions. Reviewing will be single blind, i.e, submissions need not <br>
be anonymized.</p>
<p>The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in <br>
which a wide range of people share their expertise, including <br>
experienced researchers, industry practitioners, and early-stage PhD <br>
students.</p>
<p><em>Submission guidelines</em></p>
<p>Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for ACM sigplan <br>
papers (\documentclass[sigplan,screen]{acmart}), see <br>
<a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/</a> for details. Submissions <br>
should be made via Easychair <br>
(<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ftfjp2026">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ftfjp2026</a>). There is no need to <br>
indicate the paper category (long/short).</p>
<p>The accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library, though <br>
authors will be able to opt out of this publication, if desired. At <br>
least one author of an accepted paper must register to the workshop by <br>
the early registration date and attend the workshop to present the work <br>
and participate in the discussions.</p>
<p><em>Lightning talks</em></p>
<p>In addition to papers, we also invite lightning talks (~10 minutes) on <br>
topics related to the workshop goals that allow participants to present <br>
preliminary work in academia and industry. Examples include but not <br>
limited to</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposing a research problem/challenge</li>
<li>Presenting a tool/demo</li>
<li>Presenting a short summary of a work already published elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission information will be announced closer to the workshop, but we <br>
plan it to be a lightweight process (e.g. title/abstract submission via <br>
Google Form).</p>
<p><em>Important dates</em><br>
*<br>
*</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission deadline: 18th February, 2026</li>
<li>Notification: 1st April, 2026</li>
<li>Camera ready: 30th April, 2026</li>
<li>Workshop: 30th June, 2026</li>
