<p>About ABZ</p>
<hr>
<p>The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of <br>
state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State <br>
Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual <br>
foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the <br>
design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference <br>
aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research <br>
communities around different formal methods.</p>
<p>The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008,<br>
where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint<br>
event. In the following years other formal methods were added,<br>
e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and<br>
TLA + in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016<br>
conferences in Linz, Austria and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was<br>
decided to name the conference "ABZ: International Conference on<br>
Rigorous State Based Methods", to stress the openness for further<br>
state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful<br>
discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the<br>
past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research<br>
community: the creation of reliable and safe software.  ABZ2020 and<br>
ABZ2021 were the two first new entitled conferences planned in Ulm but<br>
virtually organised.</p>
<p>ABZ 2023 will have a main conference track, a case study track, <br>
tutorials and workshops.</p>
<hr>
<p>Main ABZ Track</p>
<hr>
<p>Contributions are solicited on all aspects of the theory and <br>
applications of ASMs, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, Z and other state-based rigour <br>
approaches in software/hardware engineering, including the development <br>
of tools and industrial applications. The program spans from theoretical <br>
and methodological foundations to practical applications, emphasizing <br>
system engineering methods and tools that are distinguished by <br>
mathematical rigor and have proved to be industrially viable. The main <br>
goal of the conference is to contribute to the integration of accurate <br>
state- and machine-based system development methods, clarifying their <br>
commonalities and differences to better understand how to combine <br>
different approaches for accomplishing the various tasks in modeling, <br>
experimental validation, mathematical verification of reliable <br>
high-quality hardware/software systems. Although organized to host <br>
several formal methods in a single event, editorial control of the joint <br>
conference is vested in one integrated program committee.</p>
<hr>
<p>Case Study Track</p>
<hr>
<p>As successfully practiced since ABZ 2014, the 10th edition of ABZ will <br>
again include special sessions dedicated to an industrial case study.  <br>
We explicitly invite you to also submit contributions to case studies <br>
from previous conferences, which substantially extend the solutions <br>
presented there in one aspect or another. Possible enhancements could be <br>
new proof techniques, more elegant modeling, generation, verification, <br>
or validation of executable code, etc.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://abz2023.loria.fr/case-study">https://abz2023.loria.fr/case-study</a> for a detailed description of <br>
the new case study and links to the previous ones.</p>
<hr>
<p>Workshop and Tutorial Proposals</p>
<hr>
<p>Workshops and tutorials will be associated with the main event ABZ. <br>
Proposals are solicited in areas related to the conference topics.</p>
<p>A workshop proposal should contain the title of the workshop, a short <br>
description of the scientific content, the names and brief CVs of the <br>
workshop organizers, the intended PC for the workshop, the duration of <br>
the workshop, and the expected number of participants.</p>
<p>A tutorial proposal should contain the title of the tutorial, a short <br>
description of the scientific content, the names and brief CVs of the <br>
tutorial presenters and the duration.</p>
<p>Please submit your proposals to dominique dot mery at <a href="http://loria.fr">loria.fr</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Submissions</p>
<hr>
<p>Four kinds of contributions are invited:</p>
<p>*    Full Research papers: full papers of not more than 16 pages in LNCS <br>
format, which have to be original, unpublished and not submitted elsewhere.</p>
<p>*   Short presentations of work in progress, and tool demonstrations.An <br>
extended abstract of not more than 6 pages is expected and will be reviewed.</p>
<p>*    Application in industry papers: reporting on work or experiences on <br>
the application of state based formal methods in industry. An extended <br>
abstract of not more than 8 pages is expected and will be reviewed. It <br>
is also an interesting option for industrial practitioners who sometimes <br>
face too many constraints to prepare a full paper.</p>
<p>*    Answers to case study papers: full papers of not more than 16<br>
    pages in LNCS format reporting on the experiments conducted with<br>
     any of the state based techniques in the scope of ABZ 2023. We<br>
     also expect a link to a webpage, where the produced models can be<br>
     downloaded.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contribution to doctoral symposium:This is an excellent opportunity <br>
for PhD students to present their ongoing work and receive valuable <br>
feedback from the ABZ community. Please submit a short paper of no more <br>
than 4 pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Accepted papers will appear in the Springer LNCS proceedings.  The <br>
deadlines for the different kinds of contributions see above.</p>
