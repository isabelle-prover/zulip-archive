Kutaisi International University<br>
Kutaisi, Georgia<br>
<a href="https://viam.science.tsu.ge/jelia2025/">https://viam.science.tsu.ge/jelia2025/</a><br>
=======================================</p>
<p>== IMPORTANT DATES ==</p>
<p>Abstract submission: 2 May 2025</p>
<p>Paper submission: 9 May 2025</p>
<p>Notification of acceptance: 1 July 2025</p>
<p>Camera-ready due:  10 July 2025</p>
<p>The Program Committee of the 19th European Conference on Logics in <br>
Artificial Intelligence (JELIA 2025) invites the submission of technical <br>
papers for the conference that will be held in Kutaisi, Georgia, from <br>
the 1st to the 5th of September 2025.</p>
<p>== AIMS AND SCOPE ==</p>
<p>The aim of JELIA 2025 is to bring together active researchers interested <br>
in the use of logics in Artificial Intelligence, in order to discuss <br>
current research, results, problems, and applications of both <br>
theoretical and practical nature. JELIA strives to foster links and <br>
facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers from various <br>
disciplines, among researchers from academia and industry, and between <br>
theoreticians and practitioners.</p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished <br>
research in all areas related to the use of logics in Artificial <br>
Intelligence, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abductive and inductive reasoning</li>
<li>Applications of logic-based AI systems</li>
<li>Argumentation</li>
<li>
<p>Automated reasoning including satisfiability checking and its <br>
extensions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Causality and logics</p>
</li>
<li>Computational complexity and expressiveness</li>
<li>Deontic logic and normative systems</li>
<li>Description logics and other logical approaches to ontologies</li>
<li>Knowledge representation, reasoning, and compilation</li>
<li>Learning and reasoning</li>
<li>
<p>Logic programming, answer set programming, constraint logic <br>
programming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logics in machine learning</p>
</li>
<li>Logics for uncertain and probabilistic reasoning</li>
<li>Logics in multi-agent systems, games, and social choice</li>
<li>Neural networks and logic rules</li>
<li>
<p>Non-classical logics, such as modal, temporal, epistemic, dynamic, <br>
spatial, paraconsistent, and hybrid logics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonmonotonic logics, default logics, conditional logics</p>
</li>
<li>Planning and diagnosis based on logic</li>
<li>Preferences and optimization</li>
<li>Reasoning about actions</li>
<li>Updates, belief revision and nonmonotonic reasoning</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions describing implemented systems/applications and their <br>
application area(s) are also welcome.</p>
<p>== SPECIAL TRACK ==</p>
<p>Also this year we will include a Special Track on Logics for Explainable <br>
and Trustworthy AI. We welcome contributions that explore logic-based <br>
approaches to making AI more transparent, safer, or more trustworthy. <br>
The track aims to draw attention to this timely topic and create a space <br>
for discussing the role of logic. The papers accepted for the special <br>
track will be presented in dedicated sessions at the conference.</p>
<p>== AWARDS  ==</p>
<p>JELIA 2025 is happy to announce that there will be Best Paper and Best <br>
Student Paper Prizes sponsored by Springer, each is a cash prize <br>
amounting to EUR 500. The Program Committee will select for this honor <br>
the contribution of the highest technical excellence and scientific <br>
merit. In the case of the latter award, the primary author of the paper <br>
must be a student at the time of submission.</p>
<p>== SUBMISSION DETAILS ==</p>
<p>Submission Site: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jelia2025">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jelia2025</a></p>
<p>JELIA 2025 welcomes submissions of long or short papers. All submissions <br>
should contain original research, and sufficient detail to assess the <br>
merits and relevance of the contribution. Submissions must not have been <br>
previously published or be simultaneously submitted for publication <br>
elsewhere; see also the note below.</p>
<p>All submissions should not exceed 13 pages for long papers and 6 pages <br>
for short papers (excluding references and acknowledgments, including <br>
everything else, for example figures), and should be written in English. <br>
Papers must be self-contained; appendices with additional material (such <br>
as proofs) will only be considered at the reviewers' discretion and will <br>
not be published. Submissions must be formatted according to the <br>
standard Springer LNCS style (see <br>
<a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>), <br>
and are not anonymous. The conference proceedings of JELIA 2025 will be <br>
published by Springer Verlag in the series Lecture Notes in Artificial <br>
Intelligence, a sub-series of Lecture Notes in Computer Science <br>
(important note: Springer will require all the LaTeX source files of all <br>
accepted submissions).</p>
