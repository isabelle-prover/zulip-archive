<h1>Formal Methods Teaching Workshop (FMTea 2023)</h1>
<p>6 March 2023 --- Affiliated with Formal Methods 2023</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>
<p>to be announced soon</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>3 November 2022: Deadline for submission of papers</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>5 December 2022: Notifications to authors</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>5 January 2023: Deadline for camera-ready version</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>6 March 2023: FMTea 2023 Workshop</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE</p>
<p>Formal Methods provide software engineering with tools and techniques <br>
for rigorously reasoning about the correctness of systems. While in <br>
recent years formal methods are increasingly being used in industry, <br>
university curricula are not adapting at the same pace. Some existing <br>
formal methods classes interest and challenge students, whereas others <br>
fail to ignite student motivation. It is thus important to develop, <br>
share, and discuss approaches to effectively teach formal methods to the <br>
next generations. This discussion is now more important than ever due to <br>
the challenges and opportunities that arose from the pandemic, which <br>
forced many educators to adapt and deliver their teaching online. <br>
Exchange of ideas is critical to making these new online approaches a <br>
success and having a greater reach.</p>
<p>We envision this event as a one-day combination of keynote and workshop <br>
presentations, where various models of teaching are presented and <br>
explored, together with innovative approaches relevant for educators of <br>
Formal Methods in the 21st century.</p>
<p>More details can be found on our website: <a href="https://fmtea.github.io">https://fmtea.github.io</a></p>
<p>TOPICS</p>
<p>We aim to attract papers detailing authors’ experiences with FM <br>
Teaching. We would like to get papers discussing successes and failures <br>
of various methods, case studies, tools, etc. As self-learning seems to <br>
be an important aspect of FM teaching, we appreciate experiences with <br>
online teaching, including experiences with teaching formal methods via <br>
MOOCs. A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest for the FMTea23 <br>
workshop is below:</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Experiences and proposals related with “traditional” FM learning and<br>
    teaching</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Experiences and proposals related with online FM learning and teaching</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Integrating/embedding FM teaching/thinking within other computer<br>
    science courses</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Teaching FM for industry</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Student projects on FM, including group projects</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Innovative learning and teaching methods for FM</p>
<p>Computer science is transforming into a rigorous engineering discipline. <br>
Improved teaching techniques will ensure that FM is at the heart of this <br>
transformation process.</p>
<p>ORGANIZATION</p>
<p>FMTea 2023 is organized by FME’s Teaching Committee. Our broad aim is to <br>
support a worldwide improvement in learning Formal Methods, mainly by <br>
teaching but also via self-learning. To that end, we have already <br>
gathered a list of FM courses taught worldwide <br>
(<a href="https://fme-teaching.github.io">https://fme-teaching.github.io</a>) and plan to collect other resources as <br>
well, such as FM case studies, FM inspirational papers, etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the FME Teaching Committee coordinates a tutorial series, <br>
held online via zoom. Tutorials are collected on the FME Teaching <br>
Committee website (<a href="https://fme-teaching.github.io/">https://fme-teaching.github.io/</a>).</p>

<p>PREVIOUS EDITIONS</p>
<p>Several events focused on teaching aspects for Formal Methods were held <br>
at the beginning of the 2000s: two BCS-FACS TFM workshops (Oxford in <br>
2003 and London in 2006), the TFM 2004 conference in Ghent (with <br>
proceedings published as Springer LNCS Volume 3294), the FM-Ed 2006 <br>
workshop (Hamilton, co-located with FM'06), FORMED (Budapest, at ETAPS <br>
2008), FMET 2008 (Kitakyushu 2008, co-located with ICFEM), and TFM 2009 <br>
(Eindhoven, at FM 2009 with proceedings published as Springer LNCS <br>
Volume 5846). The first  FMTea event was FMTea 2019, the Formal Methods <br>
Teaching Workshop and Tutorial, in October 2019 in Porto, Portugal, <br>
affiliated with the 3rd World Congress on Formal Methods (FM19) with <br>
proceedings as Springer LNCS 11758. The FMTea 2021 workshop, affiliated <br>
with FM 2021, the 24th International Symposium on Formal Methods, <br>
Beijing, was held only online  in November 2021, with proceedings <br>
published as Springer LNCS 13122.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION DETAILS</p>
<p>FMTea 2023 invites high quality papers reporting on opinions, <br>
approaches, and experiences related to the topic of teaching Formal <br>
Methods. Each submitted paper will be reviewed by at least three PC <br>
members. The conference proceedings will be published in Springer's <br>
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. All submissions must be <br>
original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. <br>
Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files; <br>
we suggest to use the LaTeX2e package (the llncs.cls class file, <br>
available in llncs2e.zip and the typeinst.dem available in typeinst.zip <br>
as a template for your contribution). Papers should not exceed 15 pages <br>
in length. Submissions should be made using the FMTea 2023 Easychair web <br>
site:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmtea2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmtea2023</a></p>
<p>All accepted papers must be presented at the workshop. Their authors <br>
must be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one <br>
author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by an <br>
early date, to be indicated by the FM2023 organizers, and present the paper.</p>
