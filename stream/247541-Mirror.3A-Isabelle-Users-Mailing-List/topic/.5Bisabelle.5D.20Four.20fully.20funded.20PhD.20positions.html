<p>Up to four fully funded research positions with the opportunity of<br>
undertaking a PhD are available within the Foundation of Computation (FOX)<br>
Group, Department of Computer Science, at the University of Sheffield:<br>
<a href="http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/foundations-computation">www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/foundations-computation</a>.</p>
<p>The FOX research group at Sheffield is growing rapidly. These posts provide<br>
excellent opportunities for graduate students (UK and overseas) to obtain a<br>
PhD in any active research area of the group (see below the research<br>
interests of potential supervisors).</p>
<p>The posts are fully funded for three and half years. Note that<br>
exceptionally strong overseas candidates will be considered as well, with<br>
full cover of tuition fees.</p>
<p>Dr. Charles Grellois is mainly interested in the verification of functional<br>
programs, would they be deterministic or probabilistic. He has worked on<br>
higher-order model-checking in the deterministic case, and on higher-order<br>
termination analysis in the probabilistic case. These approaches use<br>
techniques from linear logic and its models, category theory,<br>
(intersection) type theory, tree automata theory, probabilistic semantics,<br>
realizability… Several interesting questions are still open so that several<br>
different PhD projects could be discussed on these topics; but he is also<br>
open to other research topics in this area, to be discussed with the<br>
prospective student.</p>
<p>Dr. Maksim Zhukovskii is interested in combinatorics, probability, logic,<br>
computational and descriptive complexity. Currently Maksim is working on<br>
variety of topics including extremal combinatorics (Turan-type questions,<br>
saturation, colourings, etc), random graphs (thresholds, limiting<br>
distributions, logical limit laws, almost sure theories), average-case<br>
complexity (canonical labelling of random graphs, search problems in random<br>
graphs, reconstruction problems), enumerative combinatorics (random regular<br>
graphs, degree sequences), algebraic combinatorics (Cayley graphs,<br>
isomorphism problem for abelian groups, matroids), random walks, first<br>
order logic and expressive power of its fragments, second order logic and<br>
modal logic. See <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sd_xBDQAAAAJ">scholar.google.com/citations?user=sd_xBDQAAAAJ</a> for the<br>
list of publications.</p>
<p>Dr. Jonni Virtema is keen to supervise students in any area of his current<br>
research, which relate to the interplay of logic and complexity theory.<br>
Current topics include logics and complexity theory related to numerical<br>
data, and temporal logics designed to express so-called hyperproperties,<br>
which are important in information flow and security. A further emerging<br>
topic is to study foundations of neural networks using the machinery of<br>
logics and complexity theory related to numerical data. See <a href="http://www.virtema.fi">www.virtema.fi</a><br>
for further details.</p>
<p>Dr. Harsh Beohar is broadly interested in comparative concurrency semantics<br>
and in the interplay of category theory, logic, and semantics. Current<br>
topics include expressive modal logics, behavioural equivalence games,<br>
synthesising distinguishing/characteristic formulae all at the level of<br>
coalgebras. See <a href="http://dblp.org/pid/13/7482.html">dblp.org/pid/13/7482.html</a> for an uptodate list of<br>
publications.</p>
