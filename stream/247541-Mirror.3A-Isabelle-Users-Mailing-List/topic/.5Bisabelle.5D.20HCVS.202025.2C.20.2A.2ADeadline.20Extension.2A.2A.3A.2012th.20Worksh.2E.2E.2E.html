<ul>
<li>Important Dates *</li>
</ul>
<p>Paper submission deadline <strong>extended</strong>: 30 May 2025<br>
Paper notification: mid June 2025<br>
Workshop: 22 July 2025</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope *</li>
</ul>
<p>Many Program Verification and Synthesis problems of interest can be <br>
modeled directly using Horn clauses and many recent advances in the CLP <br>
and CAV communities have centered around efficiently solving problems <br>
presented as Horn clauses.</p>
<p>This series of workshops aims to bring together researchers working in <br>
the communities of Constraint/Logic Programming (e.g., ICLP and CP), <br>
Program Verification (e.g., CAV, TACAS, and VMCAI), and Automated <br>
Deduction (e.g., CADE, IJCAR), on the topic of Horn clause based <br>
analysis, verification, and synthesis.</p>
<p>Horn clauses for verification and synthesis have been advocated by these <br>
communities in different times and from different perspectives and HCVS <br>
is organized to stimulate interaction and a fruitful exchange and <br>
integration of experiences.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the use of Horn <br>
clauses, constraints, and related formalisms in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Analysis and verification of programs and systems of various kinds <br>
(e.g., imperative, object-oriented, functional, logic, higher-order, <br>
concurrent, transition systems, petri-nets, smart contracts)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Program synthesis</p>
</li>
<li>Program testing</li>
<li>Program transformation</li>
<li>Constraint solving</li>
<li>Type systems</li>
<li>Machine learning and automated reasoning</li>
<li>CHC encoding of analysis and verification problems</li>
<li>Resource analysis</li>
<li>Case studies and tools</li>
<li>
<p>Challenging problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submission Guidelines *</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We solicit regular papers describing theory and implementation of <br>
Horn-clause based analysis and tool descriptions. We also solicit <br>
extended abstracts describing work-in-progress, as well as presentations <br>
covering previously published results, extended abstracts of doctoral <br>
theses, and overviews of research projects that are of interest to the <br>
workshop. At least one author of each accepted paper will be required to <br>
attend the workshop to present the contribution.</p>
<p>Submission has to be done in one of the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extended abstracts (up to 3 pages in EPTCS format), which describe <br>
work in progress or aim to initiate discussions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presentation-only papers, i.e., papers already submitted or presented <br>
at a conference or another workshop. Such papers can be submitted in any <br>
format, and will not be included in the workshop post-proceedings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular papers (up to 12 pages plus bibliography in EPTCS <br>
(<a href="http://www.eptcs.org/">http://www.eptcs.org/</a>) format), which should present previously <br>
unpublished work (completed or in progress), including descriptions of <br>
research, tools, and applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tool papers (up to 4 pages in EPTCS format), including the papers <br>
written by the CHC-COMP participants, which can outline the theoretical <br>
framework, the architecture, the usage, and experiments of the tool.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All submitted papers will be refereed by the program committee and will <br>
be selected for inclusion in accordance with the referee reports. If <br>
enough regular papers are accepted, both regular papers and extended <br>
abstracts will be published electronically. The publication of a paper <br>
is not intended to preclude later publication. Full versions of extended <br>
abstracts, or substantial revisions, may later be published elsewhere.</p>
<p>Papers must be submitted through the EasyChair system using the web <br>
page: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hcvs2025">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hcvs2025</a></p>
