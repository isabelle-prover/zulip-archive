<p>=== SCOPE ===</p>
<p>The general scope of the workshop is interaction and concurrency,<br>
broadly construed. The workshop welcomes contributions spanning the<br>
spectrum from theoretical models to practical implementations and<br>
empirical studies. Topics of interest include (but are not limited<br>
to):</p>
<p>* Formal semantics<br>
     * Process algebras and calculi<br>
     * Models and languages<br>
     * Protocols<br>
     * Logics and types<br>
     * Expressiveness<br>
     * Model transformations<br>
     * Tools, implementations, and experiments<br>
     * Specification and verification<br>
     * Coinductive techniques<br>
     * Tools and techniques for automation<br>
     * Synthesis techniques</p>
<p>Prospective authors are welcome to contact the chairs for advice on<br>
whether their proposed submission is in scope.</p>
<p>=== SELECTION PROCEDURE ===</p>
<p>Since its first edition in 2008, the distinguishing feature of ICE has<br>
been an innovative paper selection mechanism based on an interactive,<br>
friendly, and constructive discussion amongst authors and PC members<br>
in an online forum.</p>
<p>During the review phase, each submission is published in a dedicated<br>
discussion forum. The discussion forum can be accessed by the authors<br>
of the submission and by all PC members not in conflict with the<br>
submission (the forum preserves anonymity). The forum is used by<br>
reviewers to ask questions, clarifications, and modifications from the<br>
authors, allowing them better to explain and to improve all aspects of<br>
their submission. The evaluation of the submission will take into<br>
account not only the reviews, but also the outcome of the discussion.</p>
<p>As witnessed by the past editions of ICE, this procedure considerably<br>
improves the accuracy of the reviews, the fairness of the selection,<br>
the quality of camera-ready papers, and the discussion during the<br>
workshop.</p>
<p>ICE adopts a light double-blind reviewing process, detailed below.</p>
<p>This year, ICE implements a two-round paper submission procedure,<br>
with the understanding that all deadlines are now firm, and that<br>
papers submitted during the second round will have less time for<br>
discussion and feedback.</p>
<p>=== SUBMISSION GUIDELINES ===</p>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via hotcrp:</p>
<p><a href="https://ice24.hotcrp.com/">https://ice24.hotcrp.com/</a></p>
<p>We invite two types of submissions:</p>
<p>* Research papers: original contributions that will be published<br>
       in the workshop post-proceedings. Research papers must not be<br>
       simultaneously submitted to other conferences or workshops with<br>
       refereed proceedings. Research papers should be 3-16 pages<br>
       (references not included). Short research papers are<br>
       welcome; for example a 5 page short paper fits this category<br>
       perfectly. The submitted PDF can use any LaTeX style (but the<br>
       post-proceedings will use the EPTCS style).</p>
<p>* Oral communications: will be presented at the workshop, but will<br>
       not appear in the post-proceedings. This type of contribution<br>
       includes e.g. previously published contributions, preliminary<br>
       work, and position papers. There is no strict page limit for<br>
       this kind of submission but papers of 1-5 pages would be<br>
       appreciated. For example, a one page summary of previously<br>
       published work is welcome in this category.</p>
<p>Authors of research papers must omit their names and institutions from<br>
the title page, they should refer to their other work in the third<br>
person and omit acknowledgements that could reveal their identity or<br>
affiliation. The purpose is to avoid any bias based on authors’<br>
identity characteristics, such as gender, seniority, or nationality,<br>
in the review process. Our goal is to facilitate an unbiased approach<br>
to reviewing by supporting reviewers’ access to works that do not<br>
carry obvious references to the authors’ identities. As mentioned<br>
above, this is a lightweight double-blind process. Anonymization<br>
should not be a heavy burden for authors, and should not make papers<br>
weaker or more difficult to review. Advertising the paper on alternate<br>
forums (e.g., on a personal web-page, pre-print archive, email, talks,<br>
discussions with colleagues) is permitted, and authors will not be<br>
penalized by for such advertisement.</p>
<p>Papers in the “Oral communications” category need not be<br>
anonymized. For any questions concerning the double blind process,<br>
feel free to consult the ICEcreamers.</p>
<p>We are keen to enhance the balanced, inclusive and diverse nature of<br>
the ICE community, and would particularly encourage female colleagues<br>
and members of other underrepresented groups to submit their work.</p>
<p>=== PUBLICATIONS ===</p>
<p>Accepted research papers and communications must be presented at the<br>
workshop by one of the authors.</p>
<p>Accepted research papers will be published after the workshop in<br>
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science.</p>
<p>We plan to invite authors of selected papers and brief announcements<br>
to submit their work in a special issue in the Journal of Logical and<br>
Algebraic Methods in Programming (Elsevier). Such contributions will<br>
be peer-reviewed according to the standard journal policy, but they<br>
will be handled in a shorter time than regular submissions. A list of<br>
published and in preparation special issues of previous ICE editions<br>
is reported on the ICE website.</p>
<p>=== INVITED SPEAKER ===</p>
<p>Jorge A. Pérez -- Asynchronous Session-Based Concurrency</p>
<p>While formal models of concurrency tend to focus on synchronous communication,<br>
asynchronous communication is of clear practical relevance: it is the standard<br>
in most distributed systems and web-based applications nowadays. This talk will<br>
discuss asynchronous communication in the context of session-based concurrency,<br>
the model of computation in which session types specify the structure of the<br>
two-party protocols implemented by the channels of a<br>
communicating process.</p>
<p>In my talk, I will overview several recent results on asynchronous<br>
session-based concurrency. Specifically, I will discuss the challenge of<br>
ensuring the deadlock-freedom property for message-passing processes that<br>
communicate asynchronously in cyclic process networks governed by session types.</p>
<p>--- Biography ---<br>
Jorge A. Pérez is Associate Professor (tenured) at the University of<br>
Groningen, The Netherlands. Since 2019, he leads the Fundamental Computing<br>
Group, one of the research groups of the Bernoulli Institute of Mathematics,<br>
Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence. Prior to his current position in<br>
Groningen, Jorge worked as Post-doctoral Researcher at NOVA University Lisbon<br>
(2010-2014) and obtained his PhD at the University of Bologna (2010).</p>
<p>Jorge’s research interests concern Concurrency Theory, Semantics of<br>
Programming Languages, and Logic in Computer Science.   During February 2019 -<br>
January 2024, his research was supported by the Dutch Research Council (NWO)<br>
under a prestigious VIDI grant entitled “Unifying Correctness for<br>
Communicating Software”.</p>
