<p>The Interaction and Concurrency Experience (ICE) series of<br>
international scientific meetings are a forum for computer science<br>
researchers with research interests in models, verification, tools,<br>
and programming primitives for complex interactions.</p>
<p>=== HIGHLIGHTS ===</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinctive selection procedure</li>
<li>ICE welcomes full papers to be included in the proceedings</li>
<li>
<p>ICE also welcomes oral communications of already published or<br>
preliminary work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invited speaker: TBD</p>
</li>
<li>Publication in EPTCS (to be confirmed)</li>
<li>Special issue in the Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in<br>
Programming (Elsevier) (to be confirmed)</li>
</ul>
<p>=== IMPORTANT DATES ===</p>
<ul>
<li>April 2nd, 2026            : Paper submission deadline</li>
<li>April 3rd - April 28th   : Forum interaction, reviews, and PC discussion</li>
<li>April 30th                     : Notification to authors</li>
<li>June 12th                      : Workshop in Urbino, Italy</li>
<li>July 12th (tentative)      : Camera-ready for post-proceedings</li>
</ul>
<p>All dates are in the anywhere on Earth time zone.</p>
<p>=== SCOPE ===</p>
<p>The general scope of the workshop is interaction and concurrency,<br>
broadly construed. The workshop welcomes contributions spanning the<br>
spectrum from theoretical models to practical implementations and<br>
empirical studies. Topics of interest include (but are not limited<br>
to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Formal semantics</li>
<li>Process algebras and calculi</li>
<li>Models and languages</li>
<li>Protocols</li>
<li>Logics and types</li>
<li>Expressiveness</li>
<li>Model transformations</li>
<li>Tools, implementations, and experiments</li>
<li>Specification and verification</li>
<li>Coinductive techniques</li>
<li>Tools and techniques for automation</li>
<li>Synthesis techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>Prospective authors are welcome to contact the chairs for advice on<br>
whether their proposed submission is in scope.</p>
<p>=== SELECTION PROCEDURE ===</p>
<p>Since its first edition in 2008, the distinguishing feature of ICE has<br>
been an innovative paper selection mechanism based on an interactive,<br>
friendly, and constructive discussion amongst authors and PC members<br>
in an online forum.</p>
<p>During the review phase, each submission is published in a dedicated<br>
discussion forum. The discussion forum can be accessed by the authors<br>
of the submission and by all PC members not in conflict with the<br>
submission (the forum preserves anonymity). The forum is used by<br>
reviewers to ask questions, clarifications, and modifications from the<br>
authors, allowing them better to explain and to improve all aspects of<br>
their submission. The evaluation of the submission will take into<br>
account not only the reviews, but also the outcome of the discussion.</p>
<p>As witnessed by the past editions of ICE, this procedure considerably<br>
improves the accuracy of the reviews, the fairness of the selection,<br>
the quality of camera-ready papers, and the discussion during the<br>
workshop.</p>
<p>ICE adopts a light double-anonymous reviewing process, detailed below.</p>
<p>=== SUBMISSION GUIDELINES ===</p>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via hotcrp:</p>
<p><a href="https://ice26.hotcrp.com/">https://ice26.hotcrp.com/</a></p>
<p>We invite two types of submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Research papers: original contributions that will be published<br>
in the workshop post-proceedings. Research papers must not be<br>
simultaneously submitted to other conferences or workshops with<br>
refereed proceedings. Research papers should be 4-17 pages<br>
in length, excluding references. Short research papers are<br>
welcome; for example, a concise 5-page contribution is <br>
appropriate within this category. The submitted PDF may use <br>
any LaTeX style. However, accepted papers must be prepared in the <br>
EPTCS style for inclusion in the post-proceedings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oral communications: will be presented at the workshop, but will<br>
not appear in the post-proceedings. This type of contribution<br>
includes e.g., previously published contributions, preliminary<br>
work, and position papers. Submissions for oral communications<br>
should have a maximum length of 2 pages, excluding references.<br>
For example, a one-page summary of previously published work<br>
is welcome in this category.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Authors of research papers must omit their names and institutions from<br>
the title page, they should refer to their other work in the third<br>
person and omit acknowledgements that could reveal their identity or<br>
affiliation. The purpose is to avoid any bias based on authors’<br>
identity characteristics, such as gender, seniority, or nationality,<br>
in the review process. Our goal is to facilitate an unbiased approach<br>
to reviewing by supporting reviewers’ access to works that do not<br>
carry obvious references to the authors’ identities. As mentioned<br>
above, this is a lightweight double-anonymous process. Anonymization<br>
should not be a heavy burden for authors, and should not make papers<br>
weaker or more difficult to review. Advertising the paper on alternate<br>
forums (e.g., on a personal web-page, pre-print archive, email, talks,<br>
discussions with colleagues) is permitted.</p>
<p>Papers in the “Oral communications” category need not be<br>
anonymized. For any questions concerning the double anonymous process,<br>
feel free to consult the ICEcreamers.</p>
<p>We are keen to enhance the balanced, inclusive and diverse nature of<br>
the ICE community, and would particularly encourage female colleagues<br>
and members of other underrepresented groups to submit their work.</p>
<p>Submission by PC members (apart from the ICEcreamers) is allowed and encouraged.</p>
<p>=== PUBLICATIONS ===</p>
<p>Accepted research papers and communications must be presented at the<br>
workshop by one of the authors.</p>
<p>Accepted research papers will be published after the workshop in<br>
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (to be confirmed).</p>
<p>We plan to invite authors of selected papers and brief announcements<br>
to submit their work in a special issue in the Journal of Logical and<br>
Algebraic Methods in Programming (Elsevier). Such contributions will<br>
be peer-reviewed according to the standard journal policy, but they<br>
will be handled in a shorter time than regular submissions. A list of<br>
published and in preparation special issues of previous ICE editions<br>
is reported on the ICE website.</p>
