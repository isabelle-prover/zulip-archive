IJCAR 2024: Final Call for Papers</p>
<p>IJCAR &lt;<a href="https://ijcar.org/&gt;is">https://ijcar.org/&gt;is</a> the premier international joint conference <br>

<p>Topics</p>
<p>IJCAR 2024 invites submissions related to all aspects of automated or <br>
interactive logical reasoning, including foundations, implementations, <br>

    equational, higher-order, non-classical, constructive, modal,<br>
    temporal, many-valued, substructural, description, type theory.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Methods of interest include: tableaux, sequent calculi, resolution,<br>
    model-elimination, inverse method, paramodulation, term rewriting,<br>
    induction, unification, constraint solving, decision procedures,<br>
    model generation, model checking, semantic guidance, interactive<br>
    theorem proving, logical frameworks, AI-related methods for<br>
    deductive systems, proof presentation, automated theorem proving,<br>
    combination of decision or proof procedures, SAT and SMT solving,<br>
    machine learning and theorem proving, integration of automated<br>
    provers/proof assistants in automated test generators, program<br>
    synthesisers, verified compilers, intelligent systems, agent based<br>
    systems, knowledge processing systems, formal methods tools and<br>
    other symbolic tools, etc.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Applications of interest include: verification, formal methods,<br>
    program analysis and synthesis, computer mathematics, declarative<br>

<p>Submission Guidelines</p>
<p>IJCAR 2024 invites submissions related to the topics of interest <br>
mentioned above.</p>
<p>All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another <br>
peer-reviewed journal or conference. The following paper categories are <br>
welcome:</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>|Regular papers|describing solid new research results. They can be<br>
    up to 15 pages in LNCS style, including figures but excluding<br>
    references and appendices. Where applicable, regular papers are<br>
    supported by experimental validation. Submissions reporting on case<br>
    studies in an industrial context are strongly invited as regular papers.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>|Short papers|describing implemented systems, user experiences, case<br>
    studies and domain models, etc. They can be up to 7 pages in LNCS<br>
    style, excluding references and appendices.</p>
<p>All submissions will be judged on relevance, originality, significance, <br>
correctness, and readability. Proofs of theoretical results that do not <br>
fit in the page limit, executables of systems, and input data of <br>
experiments should be made available, e.g., via a reference to a website <br>
or in an appendix of the paper.</p>
<p>The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors <br>
will have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may <br>
solicit further reviews after the rebuttal period.</p>
<p>All submissions must be formatted using the Springer LNCS styles and <br>
submitted in PDF via EasyChair:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2024">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2024</a></p>
<p>The IJCAR 2024 proceedings will be published in the Springer <br>
seriesLecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence <br>
&lt;<a href="https://link.springer.com/conference/ijcar&gt;(LNAI/LNCS)">https://link.springer.com/conference/ijcar&gt;(LNAI/LNCS)</a> as Gold Open <br>
Access, and will be available online during the conference. At least one <br>
person must register for each accepted paper, and this registration must <br>
also cover the Gold Open Access processing fee of 200 Euro net per <br>
paper. Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least <br>
one of them will participate in the conference and present the work.</p>
<p>The papers delivered to us will be processed according to the regular <br>
workﬂow, meaning Springer will generate both full-text HTML and PDF <br>
versions of the papers, to be made available in SpringerLink, and the <br>
full book will be available in PDF and ePub formats. The papers will be <br>
published under the CC-BY-4.0-license.</p>
<p>Best Paper Award</p>
<p>IJCAR 2024 will recognize the most outstanding submissions with a best <br>
paper award and a best student paper award at the conference.</p>
<p>Student Travel Award</p>
<p>Woody Bledsoe Travel Awards will be available to support selected <br>
students in attending the conference.</p>
