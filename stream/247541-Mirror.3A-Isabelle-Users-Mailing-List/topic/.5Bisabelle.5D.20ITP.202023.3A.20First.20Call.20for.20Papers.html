ITP 2023: First Call for Papers</p>
<p><a href="https://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/ITP2023/">https://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/ITP2023/</a></p>
<p>The international conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP 2023) will take<br>
place on July 31 to August 4, 2023 in Bialystok, Poland. It is planned as a<br>
face-to-face (physical) meeting.</p>
<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all aspects of interactive theorem<br>
proving, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and<br>
applications in program verification, security, and the formalization of<br>
mathematics. This will be the 14th conference in the ITP series, while<br>
predecessor conferences from which it has evolved have been going since 1988.</p>
<p>Paper Submission</p>
<p>ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of<br>
interactive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics include, but<br>
are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>formalizations of computational models</li>
<li>improvements in theorem prover technology</li>
<li>formalizations of mathematics</li>
<li>integration with automated provers and other symbolic tools</li>
<li>verification of security algorithms</li>
<li>industrial applications of interactive theorem provers</li>
<li>formal aspects of hardware and software</li>
<li>user interfaces for interactive theorem provers</li>
<li>use of theorem provers in education</li>
<li>concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions will undergo single-blind peer review. </p>
<p>Regular papers should be no more than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic<br>
references in LIPIcs format, and they should not include an appendix. For<br>
detailed instructions for authors on document preparation see:<br>
<a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/">https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/</a></p>
<p>We also welcome short papers, which can be used to describe interesting work<br>
that is still ongoing and not fully mature. Such a preliminary report is limited<br>
to 6 pages and may consist of an extended abstract. Each of these papers should<br>
have the phrase "Short paper" as a subtitle. Accepted submissions in this<br>
category will be published in the main proceedings and will be presented as<br>
short talks.</p>
<p>The papers are to be submitted via EasyChair via the following link:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2023</a></p>
<p>All submissions are expected to be accompanied by verifiable evidence of a<br>
suitable implementation, such as the source files of a formalization for the<br>
proof assistant used.</p>
<p>Important Dates (AoE)</p>
<p>Abstract submission deadline:  February 13, 2023<br>
Paper submission deadline:     February 20, 2023<br>
Author notification:           April 17, 2023<br>
Camera-ready copy due:         May 15, 2023<br>
Conference:                    July 31 to August 4, 2023</p>
<p>Publication Details</p>
<p>As in earlier years, the conference proceedings will be published open access in<br>
the LIPIcs series ("Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics"). For more<br>
