16th International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving - ITP'25</p>
<p>Reykjavik, Iceland, 27 September-3 October 2025</p>
<p><a href="https://icetcs.github.io/frocos-itp-tableaux25/itp/">https://icetcs.github.io/frocos-itp-tableaux25/itp/</a></p>
<p>Second call for papers</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all aspects of interactive<br>
theorem proving, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation<br>
aspects and applications in program verification, security, and the<br>
formalization of mathematics. This will be the 16th conference in the<br>
ITP series, while predecessor conferences from which it has evolved have<br>
been going since 1988.</p>
<h1>Important dates</h1>
<ul>
<li>Abstract submission deadline: March 12, 2025</li>
<li>Paper submission deadline: March 19, 2025</li>
<li>Author notification: May 23, 2025</li>
<li>Camera-ready copy due: June 27, 2025</li>
</ul>
<h1>Topics</h1>
<p>ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of<br>
interactive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics<br>
include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>formalizations of computational models</li>
<li>improvements in interactive theorem prover technology</li>
<li>formalizations of mathematics</li>
<li>integration with automated provers and other symbolic tools</li>
<li>verification of security algorithms</li>
<li>industrial applications of interactive theorem provers</li>
<li>formal specification and verification of hardware and software</li>
<li>user interfaces for interactive theorem provers</li>
<li>use of theorem provers in education</li>
<li>concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Paper categories and submission</h1>
<p>We welcome regular papers and short papers. Submission for both is<br>
lightweight double-blind. This means that (1) author names and<br>
institutions must be omitted using the the anonymous option of the<br>
document class, (2) references to authors' own related work should be in<br>
the third person, and (3) the identity of authors will be reveiled to<br>
reviewers once they have submitted a first draft of their review.</p>
<p>The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers<br>
come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it<br>
impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing<br>
should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or<br>
makes the job of reviewing it more difficult. In particular, important<br>
background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition,<br>
authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their<br>
papers as usual. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on<br>
the web or give talks on their research ideas.</p>
<p>Regular papers must:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>be no more than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic<br>
     references</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not include an appendix, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be in LIPIcs format.</p>
<p>Short papers can be used to describe interesting work that is still <br>
ongoing and not fully mature. Accepted short papers will be published in <br>
the main proceedings and will be presented as short talks. Short papers must</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>be no more than 6 pages in length excluding bibliographic <br>
references and may consist of an extended abstract,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have the phrase "Short paper" as a subtitle,</p>
</li>
<li>not include an appendix, and</li>
<li>be in LIPIcs format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both categories of papers must be prepared in LaTeX using the <br>
lipics-v2021 style (v2021.1.3) and must be submitted electronically as <br>
pdf files through HotCRP:</p>
<p><a href="https://itp25.hotcrp.com">https://itp25.hotcrp.com</a></p>
<p>All submissions are expected to be accompanied by supplementary material <br>
containing verifiable evidence of a suitable implementation, such as the <br>
source files of a formalization for the proof assistant used. They also <br>
need to have a README explaining how the source files can be compiled <br>
and what exact version of the proof assistant and packages to use.</p>
<p>Two forms of supplementary material may be submitted: (1) Anonymous <br>
supplementary material is made available to the reviewers before they <br>
submit their first-draft reviews. (2) Non-anonymous supplementary <br>
material is made available to the reviewers after they have submitted <br>
their first-draft reviews and have learned the identity of the authors. <br>
We strongly encourage anonymous supplementary material whenever possible.</p>
<h1>Publication</h1>
<p>The conference proceedings will be published in Dagstuhl Publishing\'s<br>
<a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/series/LIPIcs">Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics
(LIPIcs)</a> series in<br>
Gold Open Access under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY-4.0
license</a>.</p>
<h1>Registration and Participation</h1>
<p>Remote attendance of the conference will be possible for a low or no<br>
fee. For all accepted papers, at least one author must pay a full<br>
registration fee. For presenters we strongly encourage physical<br>
participation since coming to the conference benefits the dissemination<br>
of the paper and the overall quality of the conference. Remote talks are<br>
only possible if agreed with the organizers by the registration<br>
deadline, but still one author must pay the full registration fee.</p>
