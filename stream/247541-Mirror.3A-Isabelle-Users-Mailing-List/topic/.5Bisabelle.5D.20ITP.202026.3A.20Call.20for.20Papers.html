ITP 2026: Call for Papers</p>

<p>The International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP 2026)<br>
will take place on 26-29 July, 2026 in Lisbon, Portugal.<br>
It will be part of FLoC 2026. ITP 2026 is part of the ITP conference series<br>
whose history goes back to 1988.</p>
<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all aspects of<br>
interactive theorem proving, ranging from theoretical foundations<br>
to implementation aspects and applications in program verification,<br>
security, and the formalization of mathematics. This will be the 17th<br>
conference in the ITP series, while predecessor conferences from which<br>
it has evolved have been going since 1988.</p>
<p>##Important Dates</p>
<p>Abstract Deadline: February 12, 2026 (AOE)<br>
Paper Submission Deadline: February 19, 2026 (AOE)<br>
Author Notification: April 26, 2026<br>
Camera-ready Copy: May 24, 2026<br>
Conference: July 26-29, 2026</p>
<p>##Topics</p>
<p>ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of<br>
interactive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics include,<br>
but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>formalizations of computational models</li>
<li>improvements in interactive theorem prover technology</li>
<li>formalizations of mathematics</li>
<li>integration with automated provers and other symbolic and neurosymbolic tools</li>
<li>industrial applications of interactive theorem provers</li>
<li>formal specification and verification of hardware and software</li>
<li>user interfaces for interactive theorem provers</li>
<li>use of theorem provers in education</li>
<li>concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)</li>
<li>sound methods for using AI in proof discovery</li>
</ul>
<p>We welcome regular papers and short papers. Submission for both is<br>
lightweight double-blind. This means that (1) author names and<br>
institutions must be omitted using the anonymous option of the document<br>
class, (2) references to authors' own related work should be in the third<br>
person.</p>
<p>The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come<br>
to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it<br>
impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing<br>
should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes<br>
the job of reviewing it more difficult. In particular, important background<br>
references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors are free<br>
to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as usual.<br>
For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give<br>
talks on their research ideas.</p>
<p>Regular papers must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be no more than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic references</li>
<li>not include an appendix, and</li>
<li>be in LIPIcs format.</li>
</ul>
<p>Short papers can be used to describe interesting work that is still<br>
ongoing and not fully mature. Accepted short papers will be published<br>
in the main proceedings and will be presented as short talks.</p>
<p>Short papers must:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>be no more than 6 pages in length excluding bibliographic references<br>
  and may consist of an extended abstract,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have the phrase "Short paper" as a subtitle,</p>
</li>
<li>not include an appendix, and</li>
<li>be in LIPIcs format.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both categories of papers must be prepared in LaTeX using the lipics-v2021<br>
style (v2021.1.3):</p>
<p><a href="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author">https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author</a></p>
<p>and must be submitted electronically as pdf files through<br>
HotCRP. All submissions are expected to be accompanied by anonymised<br>
supplementary material containing verifiable evidence of a suitable<br>
implementation, such as the source files of a formalization for the<br>
proof assistant used.</p>
<p>##Publication</p>
<p>The conference proceedings will be published in Dagstuhl Publishing's Leibniz<br>
International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series in Gold Open Access<br>
under the CC-BY-4.0 license.</p>
