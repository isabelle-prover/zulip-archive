We have a set of theory files that load into the JEdit version of <br>
Isabelle/HOL with no problem but when we try to do the command line <br>
build of the files, it fails with a "Failed to meet type constraint" error.</p>
<p>To further confuse the issue it fails under the Windows version of <br>
Isabelle/HOL but is fine under the Linux version running under WSL.</p>
<p>To even further confuse the issue it fails on a very old MacBook* <br>
(HighSierra) but is fine under a new MacBook M1 Pro (Ventura) and a <br>
Intel iMac (Ventura).</p>
<p>Is this a bug in Isabelle/HOL or is there really a problem with our <br>
theory files?</p>
<p>Does anyone have an idea of why the behaviour is inconsistent between <br>
JEdit and command line build?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance<br>

Hello,</p>
<p>others on this list (e.g. Makarius, presumably) will probably be more <br>
qualified to comment on your problem as such. But I'm happy to take a <br>
few stabs in the dark.</p>
<p>Firstly, I'd just like to point out that it would probably be <br>
tremendously helpful to anyone investigating this if you could provide a <br>
minimum (non-)working example.</p>
<p>And, just to clarify what exactly you are experiencing: What you are <br>
saying is that building it in Isabelle/JEdit works *always and <br>
everywhere*, whereas building it with "isabelle build" <em>consistently</em> <br>
fails on Windows and an old Macbook but <em>consistently</em> works on Linux, <br>
WSL, and a new MacBook?</p>
<p>In any case: what architecture are you using? x86_64_32, x86_64, ARM? <br>
The "new Macbook vs old Macbook" sounds like it could be an x86 vs ARM <br>
issue (although that does not explain the Windows vs. Linux/WSL issue). <br>
Have you tried switching to a different architecture? Have you tried <br>
switching "isabelle build" to single-threaded? Have you tried isolating <br>
the problematic segment of the relevant theory file and building that alone?</p>
<p>Okay, so here are some thoughts/theories:</p>
<ol>
<li>I recall that I personally had reproducibility issues with Isabelle <br>
two times. The first time it was a Poly/ML bug (a race condition in the <br>
ML runtime) that only manifested on Linux and only on some of the <br>
computers I tested it on and only with hyperthreading enabled and even <br>
then only sometimes. The second time it was a student who had <br>
overclocked his system a bit too eagerly (everything worked fine, <br>
including all normal stability tests, but Isabelle was too much for his <br>
poor CPU).</li>
</ol>
<p>But in both cases what I got was a crash and not a "type error", and it <br>
seems unlikely that an issue like this would cause something oddly <br>
specific like that. I doubt that a hardware defect is the cause in your <br>
case, but a threading issue is at least somewhat plausible.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Your problem also reminds me of some reproducibility issues Peter <br>
Lammich had a few years ago with interactive build vs batch build that <br>
boiled down to some multithreading issues. As I recall, some tactics <br>
behaved differently with and without parallelism enabled, which caused <br>
some schematic variables to be instantiated in different orders, thus <br>
leading to a different result. I'm not sure if your issue could <br>
something similar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I heard of that there are some "non-official" packaged versions of <br>
Isabelle in various package managers which replace Isabelle's bundled <br>
versions of various libraries and components with packaged versions <br>
(presumably to save disc space/make the download smaller). That can of <br>
course cause all kinds of issues and is therefore heavily discouraged. <br>
But since you mentioned Windows being affected, I doubt that this is <br>
what is going on (I think this typically is more of a Linux/Mac thing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a real long shot but I'm mentioning it anyway just to be <br>
sure: I have seen all kinds of bizarre problems on Windows being caused <br>
by third-party antivirus software like Kaspersky, McAfee, etc. Not <br>
Isabelle-related and usually more in the sense of something crashing <br>
rather than a "semantic" error like yours, but still – it might be worth <br>
a shot to try and disable any antivirus software you might have (Windows <br>
Defender should be fine). Wouldn't explain the Mac issue though.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

(I am presently busy with other things, but will come back to this thread later.)</p>
<p>Just a quick comment: Old Apple hardware works nicely and smoothly with Linux <br>
--- sometimes Ubuntu Mate is easier to install than regular Ubuntu, with all <br>
hardware drivers working immediately. I've recently refurbished several old <br>
machines. Policies by Apple regarding macOS can be safely ignored.</p>
<p>In any case, you do need min. 8 GB RAM for Isabelle applications, better 16 GB.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
jEdit is just a Java-based text editor --- you mean Isabelle/PIDE with the <br>
Isabelle/jEdit front-end: That is a very complex interactive computer-game for <br>
development of theories and proofs.</p>
<p>Many fine points differ in the interactive game vs. a batch-build via <br>
"isabelle build". The latter counts as authentic, the former only as an <br>
approximation.</p>
<p>Both use shared-memory multiprocessing by default: In very rare corner cases <br>
that can cause problems that don't show up with "isabelle build threads=1"</p>
