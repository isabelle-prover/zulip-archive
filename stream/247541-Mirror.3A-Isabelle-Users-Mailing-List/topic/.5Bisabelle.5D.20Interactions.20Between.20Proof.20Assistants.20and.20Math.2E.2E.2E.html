<p>From: <a href="mailto:alex.j.best@gmail.com">alex.j.best@gmail.com</a><br>
We are happy to announce that we will run a session on Interactions Between<br>
Proof Assistants and Mathematical Software at the biannual International<br>
Conference on Mathematical Software in Durham, UK 22-25 July 2024.</p>
<p>As part of this we are calling for abstracts for talks to be presented at the<br>
session. Abstracts should be around 200 words.  The short abstract deadline is<br>
the 24th February 2024, but we will review and accept abstracts on a rolling<br>
basis before then. Please send abstracts via email to<br>
alexjbest+icms@gmail.com.</p>
<p>We hope to inspire people to bring both their completed projects but also<br>
works in progress and demos to meet and discuss the intersections of formal<br>
and informal mathematical software with a wide range of interested<br>
participants. Abstracts will be published on the website<br>
<a href="https://proof-assistants-and-software-icms2024.github.io/">https://proof-assistants-and-software-icms2024.github.io/</a> as they are<br>
accepted.</p>
<p>We welcome expressions of interest before the official deadline, both of<br>
potential speakers and other participants in order to help us with the<br>
planning.</p>
<p>There will be the opportunity for accepted speakers to publish extended<br>
abstracts / papers in the proceedings of the ICMS, subject to participant<br>
interest.<br>
So if you have some work you'd like to present that would be of interest for<br>
this session please submit an abstract to us whenever it is ready!<br>
For funding and other particulars about the ICMS and location and travel<br>
please see the main ICMS website (which will be updated further in future).</p>
<p>The full description of the session is as follows:<br>
Interactive proof assistants (ITPs) are pieces of software that allow<br>
one to express mathematical constructs and arguments and check them<br>
interactively. Formalisation, the process of writing mathematical<br>
proofs in these systems, is becoming increasingly popular amongst<br>
mathematicians.</p>
<p>This session will showcase projects bridging the gap between ITPs and<br>
other kinds of mathematical software and computation. There are many<br>
aspects of this which could be explored further. For example; tactics<br>
for ITPs which make use (and verify) witnesses extracted from<br>
unverified computation; code extraction, allowing formalised<br>
algorithms to be used for computer algebra; proof discovery and<br>
visualisation tools within ITPs which make use of external<br>
mathematical software; using proof assistants to check key reductions<br>
in computer algebra; or interfaces between ITPs and SAT/SMT solvers to<br>
verify completely automated proofs.</p>
<p>We hope that this session will foster collaboration among people<br>
working in formalisation, computer algebra, and other areas of<br>
mathematical computation.</p>

Hi Ramon,</p>
<p>did you see this?</p>
<p>Talking about CvxLean then would be good.  However, would your Apple contract allow this?   If not, I’d be prepared to step in and give the talk.</p>
<p>*   Paul.</p>
