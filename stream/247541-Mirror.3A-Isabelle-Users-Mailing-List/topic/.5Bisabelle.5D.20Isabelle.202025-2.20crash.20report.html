<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I use Isabelle 2025-2 for a moderately large theory. With previous<br>
versions I did not have any problem. Now Isabelle/jEdit crashed<br>
several times when I invoked Sledgehammer. When viewing with top<br>
afterwards, two or three veriT processes were there, running on 100%,<br>
I had to kill them manually.</p>
<p>This was on an Ubuntu 22.04.</p>
<p>Is there any setting so that I could mitigate this problem?</p>

<p>Just to add to this, for what it's worth I have observed (with Isabelle 2025-1)<br>
a 'veriT' process to go unstable and consume unbounded amounts of memory.<br>
On my system, this typically causes the Linux OOM killer to nuke the 'poly'<br>
process, which typically is using more memory, though it would actually be<br>
better if it would nuke 'veriT' instead.</p>
<p>My system has 128GB of RAM.  I limit the PolyML heap to 64GB and the Java heap<br>
to 16GB.  When veriT goes unstable, it will consume the rest.</p>

<p><strong>From:</strong> Bryan Alexander Ford &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;</p>
<p>I can confirm that I have been experiencing this problem intermittently and nondeterministically, but quite regularly, throughout most of 2025 at least, using Isabelle2025 for Mac.  (I can’t remember for sure if I experienced it with Isabelle2024 before the upgrade from that.).  The problem became frequent enough that I have been habitually keeping an Activity Monitor window open alongside Isabelle, in order to notice when there are veriT threads still crunching on something when all sledgehammer activity is supposed to be stopped.  Quitting and restarting Isabelle entirely in that case always proved to be an easy workaround so I assumed it was a well-known issue and didn’t pay much attention to it.</p>
<p>Although the issue is certainly highly nondeterministic and I couldn’t promise to reproduce it reliably “on demand”, if there is some debug tooling anyone would like to suggest I enable in order to “catch it in the act” and get better information about what’s going on when this happens in the future, I’d be happy to do that.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Bryan</p>

<p>Thanks for the report. I take this as another confirmation that it is an old <br>
problem from Isabelle2025 (March 2025) at the least, so I was right not to <br>
attempt any changes in the last minute before Isabelle2025-1 (December 2025), <br>
which is now superseded by Isabelle2025-2 (Jan-2026).</p>
<p>The window of opportunity to address old problems on the spot is usually <br>
between RC0 (4 weeks before RC1), actual RC1, sometimes until RC2 (2 weeks <br>
after RC1). Between the releases, it is up to maintainers of Isabelle <br>
subsystems to do or not do anything --- eventually or later.</p>
<p>Here is the timetable for the next release: <br>
<a href="https://sketis.net/2025/plan-for-isabelle2026-october-2026">https://sketis.net/2025/plan-for-isabelle2026-october-2026</a></p>
<p>Generally note, that the Isabelle infrastructure does provide some means to <br>
manage process groups via the "session id" from POSIX/BSD, but processes may <br>
choose to leave that context later on, and can no longer be controlled. This <br>
approach is not bullet-proof: generic POSIX cannot do any better.</p>
<p>In contrast, we do see proper process tree management in Docker (on Linux, <br>
macOS, Windows), so there must be platform-specific mechanisms to implement <br>
that properly.</p>
<p>Maybe someone has some hints on that, or some example applications with <br>
external processes where this is done successfully.</p>

<p>Just to answer my own question, after browsing the web for approx. 2h: The <br>
Bazel code base (version 3ad9562ae006) has some notable implementations. E.g. <br>
linux-sandbox:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/tools/linux-sandbox-pid1.cc">https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/tools/linux-sandbox-pid1.cc</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/tools/linux-sandbox.cc">https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/tools/linux-sandbox.cc</a></p>
<p>That looks promising due to the "PID namespace" of the Linux kernel. It is <br>
lacking portability, though. The macOS situation is much weaker:</p>

<p>The Windows situation is totally unclear to me: maybe that platform has its <br>
own (better?) ways to manage process trees.</p>
<p>Anyway, we better stick with our good old bash_process wrapper for now, and <br>
sort out the problems of veriT before the next Isabelle release.</p>

<p>"""<br>
However, be aware that this solution is not bullet-proof: if a subprocess <br>
creates a new process group, it will escape our algorithm and there is nothing <br>
we can do about it. (It looks like FreeBSD has a NOTE_TRACK event that could <br>
let us track those processes… but of course this doesn’t exist on Darwin.) <br>
Anyway, in the context of Bazel’s process wrapper, we are willing to live with <br>
this limitation.<br>

<p>That sounds familiar. We have been living with these process group limitations <br>
for decades.</p>

<p>The result on running Isabelle.exe: various bash and poly processes show up as <br>
independent roots, with their own subtrees. So it looks like the model on <br>
Windows is as bad as generic Unix.</p>

<p>There are also portability problems within Linux: PID namespaces alone <br>
(CLONE_NEWPID) can only be created by a privileged process. Hence we <br>
need to create them as user namespace (CLONE_NEWUSER) -- like in the <br>
example -- but this may be a problem with some older linux versions: The <br>
feature was introduced in Kernel 3.8.0, but some distributions used to <br>
not have them enabled by default (kernel flag CONFIG_USER_NS) due to <br>
security concerns.</p>
