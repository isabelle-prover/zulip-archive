Dear Isabelle Community,</p>
<p>We have two undergraduate students in the Computer Science department at<br>
the University of York who are doing final year projects on creation of a<br>
package manager for Isabelle/HOL. The package manager is envisioned to<br>
complement the AFP and streamline Isabelle-based development lifecycles. As<br>
part of their methodology, they would like to survey the Isabelle community<br>
to gather requirements and preferences for the development.</p>
<p>We'd be very grateful if you can therefore fill out the following survey:<br>
<a href="https://york.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eUKMk2amXlWBsmq">https://york.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eUKMk2amXlWBsmq</a>. May we please ask<br>
you to only reply via the survey link, rather than by email. Thank you for<br>
your help with this.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Christian Pardillo Laursen</p>

Could you elaborate what kind of packages you mean?</p>

<p>Just a few side-remarks to widen the perspective.</p>
<p>* My paper "Isabelle/jEdit as IDE for domain-specific formal languages and <br>
informal text documents" <br>
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~eptcs/paper.cgi?FIDE2018.6">https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~eptcs/paper.cgi?FIDE2018.6</a> from the FIDE workshop <br>
2018 explains "PIDE document structure" in section 2. Such Isabelle-specific <br>
concepts have emerged over decades from technical and cultural <br>
side-conditions. There is usually little concern to copy other approaches, <br>
just because they are "popular" or "every does it".</p>
<p>Further note, that for 25 years I've always been talking about "formal proof <br>
documents" or "formal mathematical documents", rather than "program code" etc. <br>
It still remains to be seen, if or when Isabelle will manage to present an <br>
authoring model that is free from "program development" paradigms, <br>
terminology, tooling etc. In this respect, see also my paper "Interaction with <br>
Formal Mathematical Documents in Isabelle/PIDE" <br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01735">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01735</a> from CICM 2019.</p>
<p>* At ITP 2023, some Coq people have published a paper on their build and <br>
package management under the somewhat misleading title "Proof Repair <br>
Infrastructure for Supervised Models: Building a Large Proof Repair Dataset", <br>
see <br>
<a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol268-itp2023/LIPIcs.ITP.2023.26/LIPIcs.ITP.2023.26.pdf">https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol268-itp2023/LIPIcs.ITP.2023.26/LIPIcs.ITP.2023.26.pdf</a></p>
<p>Note that Coq projects follow a conventional model of make files with OPAM <br>
packages (with many variations). That causes some problems, though, which were <br>
the starting point for this paper: The authors wanted to collect data, but <br>
ended up tinkering with Coq builds.</p>
<p>In Isabelle you could move directly to the application (harvesting formal <br>
content from project results). See also this quote from section "5.2 Other <br>
proof assistants" of the Coq paper:</p>
<p>"""<br>
In Isabelle, the Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP) provides a highly centralized, <br>
standard host for proof developments and eases their association with metadata <br>
that may be useful for ML. The AFP also neatly versions proof developments for <br>
every official release of Isabelle and semantically groups them in different <br>
folders. At the time of writing, the AFP includes 725 proof developments [1], <br>
and it already forms the basis of a static dataset for Isabelle [32]. We <br>
suspect the AFP would also make a very strong basis for a proof repair dataset <br>
due to its neat versioning.<br>
"""</p>
<p>Please ignore what they later about PISA and scala-isabelle. The official <br>
Isabelle/Scala infrastructure is sufficient to do all the heavy lifting, <br>
without extra complication.</p>

By packages we mean collections of Isabelle theories which depend on other<br>
packages.<br>
Effectively AFP entries with more flexible versioning, although the specific<br>
features that packages will have will be influenced by the data we collect<br>
from the survey.</p>

<p>You probably mean "session" in official Isabelle terminology.</p>

<p>An "AFP entry" is a slight extension of the concept of "session". Its precise <br>
meaning is defined by the metadata and tooling of AFP (in Isabelle/Scala).</p>
