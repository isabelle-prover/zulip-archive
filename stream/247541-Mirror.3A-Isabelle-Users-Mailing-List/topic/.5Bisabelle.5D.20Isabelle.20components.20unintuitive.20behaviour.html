[Apologies if you receive this e-mail twice, I accidentally sent it to the wrong mailing list]</p>
<p>Hello mailing list,</p>
<p>I am currently trying out RC5 on a new laptop and found some unintuitive behaviour in isabelle components caused by the absence of "curl" on my Ubuntu 22.04 distribution. Adding the AFP (development branch) using "./isabelle components -u &lt;path to afp-devel&gt;/thys" initially seems to work, but upon inspection with "./isabelle components -l" I am getting the following:</p>
<p>Available components:<br>
....<br>
  &lt;path to afp_devel&gt;/thys<br>
  &lt;path to afp_devel&gt;</p>
<p>Missing components:<br>
  HOME/.isabelle/contrib/hugo-0.88.1<br>
  HOME/.isabelle/contrib/ci-extras-2</p>
<p>somehow the path to afp_devel is added twice, once with /thys and once without. Both were not there before running the initial command. Also there is some missing components (hugo and ci-extras) that my proofs don't seem to depend on as everything still runs smoothly. Furthermore, when I now thy to add another component (for debugging/reproducibility purposes, I use the 2023 branch of the isabelle_llvm project: <a href="https://github.com/lammich/isabelle_llvm">https://github.com/lammich/isabelle_llvm</a>) using<br>
"./isabelle components -u &lt;path to isabelle_llvm&gt;/thys" it will give the following message:</p>
<h3>Missing Isabelle component: "HOME/.isabelle/contrib/hugo-0.88.1"</h3>
<h3>Missing Isabelle component: "HOME/.isabelle/contrib/ci-extras-2"</h3>
<p>*** Bad Isabelle environment variable: "ISABELLE_CI_EXTRAS_JAR"</p>
<p>And it does not add the new component as shown by "./isabelle components -l"</p>
<p>I have explored the following workarounds:</p>
<p>*   adding Isabelle_LLVM before adding the AFP will work. It still produces the same error after adding the AFP but at least it will allow me to run my project flawlessly.<br>
  *   installing "curl" will allow Isabelle to automatically download the requested packages (hugo and ci-extras) when adding the AFP.</p>
<p>I also compared this behaviour to Isabelle2022, where this behaviour does not seem to occur (although the AFP is still added twice, once with the /thys and once without just like I observed in RC5).<br>
I do think that this behaviour is unintentional. Especially not being able to add any new components after adding the AFP if one hasn't installed curl. I am also not sure what hugo and ci-extras are supposed to do here, for reference, ci-extras seems to consist mostly of .jar files. I am looking forward to read other opinions on this.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Bram</p>

<p>Thanks for the detailed experience report. We have indeed accumulated a bit <br>
too much complexity in the Isabelle + AFP setup. It all needs to be sorted out <br>
soon in a coming release, and properly integrated into the Isabelle Prover IDE.</p>
<p>(I will start discussions about that on the isabelle-dev mailing list: we do <br>
need to make clear which component dependencies for AFP are really necessary.)</p>
<p>Back to your text: reading it twice, I first got worried about the state in <br>
Isabelle2023, which will become final and unchangeable in a few days.</p>
<p>Then I pretended to be a regular user of Isabelle2023-RC5 + AFP + <br>
isabelle_llvm and managed to setup everything in half the time of reading + <br>
worrying about the issue (of course, I know which diversions and pitfalls need <br>
to be avoided).</p>
<p>So here is my summary:</p>
<p>* Isabelle releases like Isabelle2023-RC5 need the corresponding AFP <br>
release: afp-2023 instead of afp-devel.</p>
<p>* Repository versions of Isabelle + AFP do need the "curl" command, as <br>
stated in Isabelle/README_REPOSITORY --- and you need to do invoke <br>
"Admin/init" until all components are saturated.</p>
<p>* Regular release versions of Isabelle + AFP neither need "curl" nor <br>
"Admin/init". For Isabelle all required components are already built and <br>
bundled. For AFP, components are suppressed, since they are "administrative" <br>
only. The main download afp-current.tar.gz from <br>
<a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/download">https://www.isa-afp.org/download</a> worked for me on the spot without problems.</p>
<p>* Mixing release downloads with repository snapshots requires detailed <br>
understanding of how things work. It is better to make a clear decision under <br>
which regime you want to work: either release or repository.</p>
<p>Some of these extra details are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Available components:<br>
....<br>
   &lt;path to afp_devel&gt;/thys<br>
   &lt;path to afp_devel&gt;</p>
<p>somehow the path to afp_devel is added twice, once with /thys and once <br>
without.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is because AFP repository clones provide two components, and there is <br>
some builtin smartness to add the second one automatically in certain situations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also there is <br>
some missing components (hugo and ci-extras) that my proofs don't seem to <br>
depend on as everything still runs smoothly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"hugo-0.88.1" helps to produce the AFP websites: its absence or presence <br>
normally does not get into the way.</p>
<p>"ci-extras" are a left-over from rather old times, and now I would say <br>
"experimental" or even "obsolete". We need to find out how to put it into <br>
proper form, or better eliminate it. ("ci-extras-2" introduces a reference to <br>
some $ISABELLE_CI_EXTRAS_JAR that is required for the Isabelle/Scala setup of <br>
AFP: without that it won't build.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have explored the following workarounds:</p>
<p>* installing "curl" will allow Isabelle to automatically download the<br>
    requested packages (hugo and ci-extras) when adding the AFP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not a workaround, but a regular requirement for Isabelle + AFP <br>
repository clones, to saturate components.</p>
<p>It is sad that Ubuntu has discontinued "curl" as default --- as it seems for <br>
no particular reason. Some years ago, "curl" was considered bread-and-butter <br>
for https access: I wonder what has happened there recently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also compared this behaviour to Isabelle2022, where this behaviour does not <br>
seem to occur (although the AFP is still added twice, once with the /thys and <br>
once without just like I observed in RC5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>afp-2022 also depends on "ci-extras", but it is "ci-extras-1" with slightly <br>
different (non-canonical) setup. It happens to build, but the failure to <br>
access the required jar is postponed to runtime. (In Isabelle, everything is <br>
as "static" as possible, instead of "dynamic" or untyped/unscoped.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do think that this behaviour is unintentional. Especially not being able to <br>
add any new components after adding the AFP if one hasn't installed curl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "curl" requirement is intentional. The rest is some overcomplexity that we <br>
need to sort out on our side, but not for Isabelle2023.</p>

<p>From: Fabian Huch &lt;<a href="mailto:huch@in.tum.de">huch@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
The main problem here is that you are trying to compose a release <br>
version of Isabelle with a development version of the AFP. In principle <br>
this can work, but for development versions one does need to resolve <br>
components (for Isabelle as well when using devel).</p>
<p>So most of the behaviour is expected, though I'll have to investigate <br>
why both afp (in the devel version, this contains some tooling) and <br>
afp/thys are added when you only added the afp/thys component - that <br>
does not seem ideal.</p>
