<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>I already sent this to the mailing list last year when 2021-1 came out <br>
but there was no answer, it probably got lost in the excitement of the <br>
RC-process.</p>
<p>Personally, I think this is a confusing problem and should be changed. <br>
However, if this is intended behavior, I would be happy if someone who <br>
feels responsible for the "bit" type (in Z2) can confirm this.</p>
<p>In Isabelle2021-1, the simplification rules for the type bit (from <br>
HOL-Library.Z2) have changed.</p>
<p>Besides other rules, we have the following simp rules:</p>
<p>* xor ?b ?c = of_bool (odd ?b ≠ odd ?c)<br>
  * of_bool (¬ ?P) = 1 - of_bool ?P<br>
  * (-) = (+)<br>
  * (+) = xor</p>
<p>These rules can give us a rewrite-cycle: xor is rewritten in terms of <br>
"of_bool (... ~= ...)" which goes to "1 - of_bool ..." which goes to "1 </p>
<ul>
<li>of_bool ..." which goes to "xor 1 (of_bool ...)". And we have xor back!</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether this actually happens depends on the concrete case (sometimes <br>
the a case distinction splitter rule on the arguments of the xor happens <br>
instead, I think).</p>
<p>But I have found that it can be quite easily triggered nonetheless.</p>
<p>For example, ‹xor b c = of_bool (b ≠ c)› makes the simplifier loop.</p>
<p>And if we add the (quite useful, imho) simp rule "((a=x) = (b=x)) = <br>
(a=b)" for bits, then even something as natural as ‹a + b + b = a› loops.</p>
<p>An example theory is attached.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't know if there are any important reasons for those <br>
xor-related simp-rules, but personally I feel that removing them (at <br>
least the "xor ?b ?c = of_bool (odd ?b ≠ odd ?c)" rule) would make the <br>
simplifier much less fragile in the presence of bit-related arithmetic.</p>
<p>(Also, as an aside: why is there "odd" in the definition of xor? <br>
Wouldn't "xor ?b ?c = of_bool (?b ≠ ?c)" be simpler and equivalent?)</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.<br>

Hi Dominique,</p>
<p>thanks for reporting this.</p>
<p>a) The evil simp rule clearly is ‹of_bool (¬ ?P) = 1 - of_bool ?P›, I am<br>
working on getting rid of it.  (As often, the problem does not reside in<br>
the theory which exposed it).</p>
<p>b) Concerning the deeper rationale, the history of theory Z2 is relevant.</p>
<p>Before 2013/14, the type bit = 0 | 1 was heavily used to represent<br>
single bit values e. g. in what is nowadays HOL/Bit_Operations.thy and<br>
HOL-Library/Word.thy – but not in all consequence, in some places bool<br>
was used for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Andreas Lochbihler then suggested to reconcile this, and from that time<br>
bool has been used consistently, the of_bool embedding stemming from<br>
that time.  The »bit« type has been kept for backward compatibility.</p>
<p>When starting re-working bit operations and word operations from 2019<br>
on, I did not dare to cut of that backward compatibility strain but<br>
asked myself for which applications »bit« could be preferable to »bool«<br>
and came to the conclusion that it is a complete model of the field with<br>
two elements, hence re-shaping it into theory Z2.</p>
<p>At that time I did not know of any applications but appreciated it as a<br>
nice example how to introduce a data type with overloaded constructor<br>
symbols.  Also I tried to provide automation to reduce problems on type<br>
»bit« to »bool«, hence using existing automation on »bool« to prove<br>
problems on »bit«, which explains the rather aggressive default simp rules.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You are clearly right that those RHSs could be formulated in a logically<br>
simpler way, but then the expression of the primary idea would get lost:<br>
reduce expressions on »bit« to expressions on »bool« with simple<br>
straightforward correspondences.</p>
<p>Your proposal would essentially loose the rewriting the »bool«.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>I wonder whether "xor ?b ?c = of_bool (odd ?b ≠ odd ?c)" shouldn't <br>
removed from the simp-set instead (or in addition to) "of_bool (¬ ?P) = <br>
1 - of_bool ?P". And then of course add enough simp-rules for xor to <br>
compensate for this (such as "xor a a = 0" etc). (I would assume not too <br>
many are needed.) One advantage would be that it leads to more readable <br>
simplifications. Or alternatively rewrite xor to plus, that fits best <br>
with the Z2-view and also leads to readable simplification results.</p>
<p>But that would of course not fit with the idea of rewriting everything <br>
to bool.</p>
<p>Another possibility would be to make bit a type synonym for bool and <br>
define 1 := true, 0 := false. (While still possibly instantiating the <br>
field typeclass.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At that time I did not know of any applications<br>
I can explain where I use it. In cryptography, we often have an <br>
adversary with a one-bit output (and we look at how the probability <br>
distribution of that output changes). Now we could, of course, say the <br>
output is of type bool, but there are two stylistic arguments against <br>
it: (a) We get farther away from the established notation in crypto <br>
(where we'd write Pr[x=1 : x&lt;-A] and not Pr[x : x&lt;-A]). (b) Using type <br>
bool implies a certain meaning of the bit values (truth) but the outputs <br>
0/1 of the adversary do not represent a yes/no answer per se, but just <br>
two choices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These arguments are of course a bit subjective, and technically there is <br>
nothing that stops us from using bool here.</p>

Ah, I understand now. "odd" is kind of "to_bool", and then it makes <br>
sense intuitively!</p>

<p>There might be reasons that the global rewriting to bool should be<br>
removed entirely,<br>
but then it should be done consequently for all operations, not just xor.</p>

<p>Another possibility would be to make bit a type synonym for bool and<br>

<p>That could be worth a try.</p>

<p>If your applications demands a very particular binary type, it could be best<br>
to construct your own copy of bool.</p>
