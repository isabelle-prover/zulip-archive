<p>From: Frederik Krogsdal Jacobsen &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle developers,</p>
<p>While trying Isabelle2023-RC4, I noticed a "bug"/dependency which has <br>
been present since Isabelle2023-RC0.<br>
I apologize for not catching this earlier, but I was out of office until <br>
recently.</p>
<p>The issue seems to have surfaced after commit eaf234b0c849, which moves <br>
the detection of the ISABELLE_HOSTNAME variable from a bash call in <br>
Scala to a bash script.<br>
The detection is implemented using the command "hostname -s" which on <br>
Linux is provided by the inetutils package. Since this package was not <br>
installed on my system, the script halts at that line, which for me <br>
manifested as follows: when I open Isabelle/jEdit, the GUI comes up, but <br>
the prover never starts, and I get a popup saying: "Undefined Isabelle <br>
environment variable: "ISABELLE_HOSTNAME"" and a terminal line saying: <br>
"Isabelle2023-RC4/lib/scripts/getsettings: line 81: hostname: command <br>
not found". This yields Isabelle/jEdit essentially unusable, since no <br>
statements are ever checked by the prover.</p>
<p>In Isabelle2022, where the ISABELLE_HOSTNAME variable is still detected <br>
in Scala, the "hostname -s" command still fails, but this is "caught" by <br>
Scala, and the variable simply ends up being empty.</p>
<p>In any case, the issue is easily fixed by installing inetutils. I don't <br>
know what the ISABELLE_HOSTNAME variable is used for, and Isabelle2022 <br>
has worked fine for me even with the variable being empty, though I <br>
guess the previous behaviour of silently ending up with an empty <br>
ISABELLE_HOSTNAME is not intentional.</p>
<p>If the dependency on inetutils is intentional, maybe this should be <br>
noted somewhere (a few Google searches with related keywords did not <br>
yield anything about this issue). The inetutils package mostly contains <br>
clients and servers for obsolete networking protocols, and so it will <br>
probably be more common not to have it installed in the future. The <br>
hostname could perhaps instead be detected by using the command "uname <br>
-n", which should work on all Linux distributions (being part of <br>
coreutils) and macOS.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Frederik</p>

<p>"uname -n" should work, although it lacks the "hostname -s" option.</p>

For the record: the Perl guys are doing it like this in module Sys::Hostname: <br>
<a href="https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/RJBS/perl-5.38.0/ext/Sys-Hostname/Hostname.pm">https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/RJBS/perl-5.38.0/ext/Sys-Hostname/Hostname.pm</a></p>
<p>The source contains many odd comments, but it is often unclear if they should <br>
be taken seriously. For example: "# method 3 - trusty old hostname command"</p>

<p>I am using Archlinux, and the package I am referring to is GNU <br>
Inetutils, but the situation is relatively common on systemd-based <br>
distributions where the "trusty old" tools have been replaced by <br>
"hostnamectl" and there is no mandatory "legacy" package to provide the <br>
"hostname" command directly like in Ubuntu. Sadly, the syntax for <br>
hostnamectl is not backward compatible, so my best bet is to use "uname" <br>
instead, since this should be available on essentially any Linux system <br>
capable of running Isabelle in the first place.<br>
Alternatively, maybe the JVM has some built-in cross-platform way of <br>
determining the hostname, but I don't know if this is easily available <br>
from Scala.</p>

special format. I imagine that for most users on personal computers, the <br>
hostname is only a single word anyway.</p>

<p>It is certainly also a solution to simply note somewhere that Isabelle <br>
requires that the "hostname" command is available since any reasonable <br>
Linux distribution should have it easily available for installation.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Frederik</p>

<p>Thanks for the explanation.</p>
<p>It means that the "hostname" command has been effectively killed as well: <br>
meaning that there is no cross-platform invocation for it that works on common <br>
Linuxes, macOS, Windows/Cygwin.</p>
<p>To address this problem of Linux, I have now made the following change: <br>

<p>Before using the hostname command, I had checked that already. There is <br>
nothing special in the Java library: it looks all a bit crude and fragile, <br>
compared to what Perl is doing.</p>

<p>For example, it is used to say which cluster build node runs a job. This is <br>
mainly a "comment" and does not have to be authentic.</p>
<p>Preferably it is an unqualified name that identifies the "node".</p>
<p>(I have derived that "by induction over the current sources", and the <br>
interpretation might change over time.)</p>
