<p>From: Ian Hayes &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@ian-hayes.id.au">mail@ian-hayes.id.au</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>Isabelle2025-1-RC1 exhibits the same issues I was having with using a <br>
mouse on a Mac on Isabelle-2025 (see below for copies of my posts). <br>
These issues make it frustrating to use Isabelle because one often has <br>
to repeat mouse clicks many times before they work. The issues have been <br>
in Isabelle for many years. They are exacerbated when one uses a (higher <br>
resolution) Apple Magic Mouse as compared to the track pad or an old <br>
Dell wheel mouse (although they occur with all three).</p>
<p>From my mailing list post 6/2/2025:<br>
&lt;<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/msg/cl-isabelle-users/2025-02/vsz7n4TvV8DU6LkdrX4hOA">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/msg/cl-isabelle-users/2025-02/vsz7n4TvV8DU6LkdrX4hOA</a>&gt;<br>

A slight movement of the mouse when Command clicking through to a <br>
lemma/definition means it fails and selects the character under the <br>
cursor. I'm guessing this is something to do with the fact that the <br>
Command click occurs, not on pressing the mouse, but when it is then <br>
released. For example, if you Command press and move the mouse a little <br>
and then release, it won't go through to the definition but rather <br>
selects the text under the cursor. And the behaviour is worse when I use <br>
an Apple magic mouse in place of an old mouse -- I suspect because the <br>
Magic mouse will generate a small movement more easily.</p>
<p>A similar issue occurs when clicking on a the output of sledgehammer to <br>
get it to copy the suggested proof into the theory file.</p>
<p>Another issue is double-clicking the name of a theory in the theories <br>
menu is also flaky if the mouse moves slightly between the two clicks, <br>
even if one remains within the same menu item.<br>

<p>From my mailing list post 10/2/2025<br>
&lt;<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/msg/cl-isabelle-users/2025-02/EG0nW0_Z5p704b34yHE6eA">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/msg/cl-isabelle-users/2025-02/EG0nW0_Z5p704b34yHE6eA</a>&gt;<br>

For MacOS for a left mouse click there are the following mouse events:</p>
<p>* Press down the button:  NSLeftMouseDown which invokes mouseDown<br>
  * Move the mouse while pressing the button: NSLeftMouseDragged which<br>
    invokes mouseDragged</p>
<p>* Release the button:|NSLeftMouseUp which invokesmouseUp|<br>
  * ||Move the mouse without pressing any button: NSMouseMoved which<br>
    invokes mouseMoved</p>
<p>A combination of mouseDown-mouseDragged-mouseUp selects the text between <br>
the coordinates of the mouseDown and mouseUp. The problem with <br>
Command-click would appear to be that the text selection behaviour is <br>
happening when the Command key is held down (for a click through) and <br>
the selection behaviour is taking precedence over the Command click*. If <br>
the selection behaviour was disabled while the Command key is held down <br>
that might fix the problem. Alternatively, the Command click behaviour <br>
should take precedence over selection of text.</p>
<p>*In practice, sometimes it recognises the Command-click and other it <br>
recognises a selection, so this looks like a classic (concurrency) race <br>
between the two actions. With the Command key held down, mouseDown-move <br>
a few characters-mouseUp always selects the text, even if it is in the <br>
one name.</p>
<p>An alternative scenario is the following.<br>
The mouseDown-mouseUp combination (*without *Command key held) moves the <br>
cursor to the location of the mouse. With the Command key held down, it <br>
non-deterministically either moves the cursor or clicks through to the <br>
definition. Again this looks like a race between the two actions. If the <br>
cursor movement action was disabled while the Command key is held down <br>
or the Command-click given precedence that may work.</p>
<p>From my experimentation, it appears the Command-click does not happen <br>
until the mouse is released (mouseUp). If the Command click action was <br>
invoked on mouseDown, the issue might be resolved.</p>
<p>Using the track-pad rather than the mouse is more reliable but can still <br>
exhibit the same behaviour. The detailed behaviour is that with Command <br>
held down, mouseDown moves the cursor to the mouse location and on <br>
mouseUp it moves it to the definition of the item. On some occasions it <br>
just moves the cursor to the mouse location and does not go to the <br>
definition, and on other occasions it moves the cursor to the mouse <br>
position and removes the highlight from the item under the mouse, where <br>
by highlight, I mean the highlighting that occurs when one presses the <br>
Command key.</p>
<p>Another symptom is that if the cursor is on name and the Command key <br>
held, the name is not highlighted, but if one leaves the Command key <br>
held and moves the cursor a little, the name is then highlighted.<br>
A related symptom is that when the Command key is held and the name <br>
highlighted for a couple of seconds, a pop-up window appears and the <br>
highlight is removed from the name until one moves the cursor again.</p>
<p>An old (lower resolution) Dell wheel mouse is more reliable than the <br>
track-pad, which is in turn more reliable than a magic mouse. But note <br>
that even with the old Dell mouse a small mouse movement between down <br>
and up gives a cursor move or select text action, and not a <br>
click-through to definition action. The symptoms occur on both my old M1 <br>
laptop and a new mini with a fresh install of everything.</p>
<p>Probably not relevant here but in the Finder under MacOS, if wants to <br>
select multiple files, one holds down the Command key while clicking on <br>
each file.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a mouse event handling expert.<br>

<p>Dear Isabelle users,</p>
<p>this calendar year has two Isabelle releases (which happen every 8-10 <br>
months). We are now ready to start the release process for <br>
Isabelle2025-1 (December 2025). See also the continuously updated blog <br>

<p>The NEWS and ANNOUNCE files are already up-to-date, but some <br>
documentation still requires update.</p>
<p>The coming weeks are dedicated to thorough testing of release <br>
candidates. Afterwards the release will become final and unchangeable <br>

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>a few days ago, I was about to dig up the old mail thread, to point out that <br>
RC2 has addresses most of these problems. The main idea is to use <br>
"MousePressed" events instead of "MouseClicked". The latter requires to <br>
release the button to be "committed", but the Magic Mouse does not like that.</p>
<p>This already makes a big difference, but now another problem shows up: When <br>
following hyperlinks via C-hover-click, there is often a selection range <br>
showing up on the target buffer. Maybe I find a solution for that until RC3 <br>
(presumably published next Wednesday).</p>
<p>Generally note that the time to sort out old problems (that are not <br>
regressions from the previous release) is before the release process starts <br>
with RC1: RC0 is a good event to take as a reminder.</p>

<p>RC3 was delayed several days, but it should now work properly. We have a new <br>
mouse handler, specifically for Isabelle/jEdit -- based on the regular mouse <br>
handler from jEdit.</p>
<p>That requires serious testing by everybody, especially on macOS, but the <br>
handler is uniform for all platforms.</p>
