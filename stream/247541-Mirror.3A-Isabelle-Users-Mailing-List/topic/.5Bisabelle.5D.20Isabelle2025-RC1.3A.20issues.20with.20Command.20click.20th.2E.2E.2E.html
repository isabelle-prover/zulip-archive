<p>From: Ian Hayes &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
I'm using MacOS Sequoia 15.3.</p>
<p>Issue 1:<br>
For the attached theory file,<br>
a Command click on the reference to lemma subset in locale test2, it <br>
takes one to the lemma in locale test1, however,<br>
a Command click on the reference to HT_def in locale test2 it takes one <br>
to the head of locale test2.<br>
A Command click on the reference to HT_def in locale test1 it takes one <br>
to the definition (in test1) as expected.<br>
A Command click on the reference to XX_def in locale test2 it takes one <br>
to the definition (outside the locales) as expected.<br>
The difference is that XX is defined outside the locale but HT is <br>
defined inside.<br>
I think same behaviour occurs in Isabelle-2024.</p>
<p>Issue 2: Again this is not a new issue.<br>
A slight movement of the mouse when Command clicking through to a <br>
lemma/definition means it fails and selects the character under the <br>
cursor. I'm guessing this is something to do with the fact that the <br>
Command click occurs, not on pressing the mouse, but when it is then <br>
released. For example, if you Command press and move the mouse a little <br>
and then release, it won't go through to the definition but rather <br>
selects the text under the cursor. And the behaviour is worse when I use <br>
an Apple magic mouse in place of an old mouse -- I suspect because the <br>
Magic mouse will generate a small movement more easily.</p>
<p>A similar issue occurs when clicking on a the output of sledgehammer to <br>
get it to copy the suggested proof into the theory file.</p>
<p>Another issue is double-clicking the name of a theory in the theories <br>
menu is also flaky if the mouse moves slightly between the two clicks, <br>
even if one remains within the same menu item.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance<br>

<p>This refers to the attached test2.thy which imports test1, but I did not see <br>
test1.thy: using "imports Main" instead works, but maybe you intended to show <br>
something else in test1.thy?</p>
<p>Anyway, I have clicked through the formal entities as sketched above, and <br>
don't see anything suspicious. Note that "locale test2 = test1 ..." in is not <br>
just a plain import, but a new locale based on existing locale(s) via locale <br>
expressions that are internally turned into morphisms. Formal entities of the <br>
new locale then get the position of the morphism that was applied to the old <br>
entities, instead of the old entities, or both the morphism and entity. That <br>

This is easy to achieve by following ancient naming conventions: theory names <br>

<p>I can confirm the behaviour: if you move the mouse-pointer between click-and-release or between a double-click, then this<br>
is interpreted differently than a standard click and double-click without movement when running Isabelle 2025-RC1 and Seqouia 15.3.</p>
<p>However, neither with my laptop touchpad nor with a classical (non-magic) mouse I a have a problem that there actually<br>
is movement between click-release or double-click, if I do not (on purpose) move my finger on the touchpad, or move the mouse<br>
during these actions.</p>

<p>From: Ian Hayes &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>Issue 1: Apologies test2 should just include Main (I was experimenting <br>
with references across theory files and found that it was just across <br>
locales so copied test1.thy into test2.thy so there was just a single <br>
file but forgot to replace the import). I agree it is not a regression <br>
and look forward to improvement at some point in the future. <br>
Side-remark: The naming was me being lazy in building a minimal test file.</p>
<p>Issue2: For MacOS for a left mouse click there are the following mouse <br>
events:</p>
<p>* Press down the button:  NSLeftMouseDown which invokes mouseDown<br>
  * Move the mouse while pressing the button: NSLeftMouseDragged which<br>
    invokes mouseDragged</p>
<p>* Release the button:|NSLeftMouseUp which invokesmouseUp|<br>
  * ||Move the mouse without pressing any button: NSMouseMoved which<br>
    invokes mouseMoved</p>
<p>A combination of mouseDown-mouseDragged-mouseUp selects the text between <br>
the coordinates of the mouseDown and mouseUp. The problem with <br>
Command-click would appear to be that the text selection behaviour is <br>
happening when the Command key is held down (for a click through) and <br>
the selection behaviour is taking precedence over the Command click*. If <br>
the selection behaviour was disabled while the Command key is held down <br>
that might fix the problem. Alternatively, the Command click behaviour <br>
should take precedence over selection of text.</p>
<p>*In practice, sometimes it recognises the Command-click and other it <br>
recognises a selection, so this looks like a classic (concurrency) race <br>
between the two actions. With the Command key held down, mouseDown-move <br>
a few characters-mouseUp always selects the text, even if it is in the <br>
one name.</p>
<p>An alternative scenario is the following.<br>
The mouseDown-mouseUp combination (*without *Command key held) moves the <br>
cursor to the location of the mouse. With the Command key held down, it <br>
non-deterministically either moves the cursor or clicks through to the <br>
definition. Again this looks like a race between the two actions. If the <br>
cursor movement action was disabled while the Command key is held down <br>
or the Command-click given precedence that may work.</p>
<p>From my experimentation, it appears the Command-click does not happen <br>
until the mouse is released (mouseUp). If the Command click action was <br>
invoked on mouseDown, the issue might be resolved.</p>
<p>Using the track-pad rather than the mouse is more reliable but can still <br>
exhibit the same behaviour. The detailed behaviour is that with Command <br>
held down, mouseDown moves the cursor to the mouse location and on <br>
mouseUp it moves it to the definition of the item. On some occasions it <br>
just moves the cursor to the mouse location and does not go to the <br>
definition, and on other occasions it moves the cursor to the mouse <br>
position and removes the highlight from the item under the mouse, where <br>
by highlight, I mean the highlighting that occurs when one presses the <br>
Command key.</p>
<p>Another symptom is that if the cursor is on name and the Command key <br>
held, the name is not highlighted, but if one leaves the Command key <br>
held and moves the cursor a little, the name is then highlighted.<br>
A related symptom is that when the Command key is held and the name <br>
highlighted for a couple of seconds, a pop-up window appears and the <br>
highlight is removed from the name until one moves the cursor again.</p>
<p>An old Dell wheel mouse is more reliable than the track-pad, which is in <br>
turn more reliable than a magic mouse. But note that even with the old <br>
Dell mouse a small mouse movement between down and up gives a cursor <br>
move or select text action, and not a click-through to definition <br>
action. The symptoms occur on both my old M1 laptop and a new mini with <br>
a fresh install of everything.</p>
<p>Probably not relevant here but in the Finder under MacOS, if wants to <br>
select multiple files, one holds down the Command key while clicking on <br>
each file.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a mouse event handling expert.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance<br>
