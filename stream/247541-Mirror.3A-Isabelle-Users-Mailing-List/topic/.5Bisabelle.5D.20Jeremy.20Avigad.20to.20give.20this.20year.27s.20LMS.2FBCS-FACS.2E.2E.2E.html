Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>I am delighted to announce that this year’s London Mathematical Society<br>
(LMS) / British Computer Society -- Formal Aspects of Computing Science<br>
(BCS-FACS) Evening Seminar will feature Jeremy Avigad as the distinguished<br>
speaker. Registration is free but required in advance.</p>
<p>Date: 6 November 2025<br>
Time: 19:00 (UK time)<br>
Format: Online via Zoom<br>
Talk title: Mathematics in the Age of AI<br>

Title: Mathematics in the Age of AI</p>
<p>Abstract:<br>
New technologies for reasoning and discovery are bound to have a profound<br>
effect on mathematical practice. Proof assistants are already changing the<br>
nature of collaboration, communication, and curation of mathematical<br>
knowledge. Automated reasoning tools are used to find mathematical objects<br>
with specified properties or rule out their existence, and to decide or<br>
verify mathematical claims. Machine learning and neural methods can<br>
discover patterns in mathematical data, explore complex mathematical<br>
spaces, and generate mathematical objects of interest. Neurosymbolic<br>
theorem provers, now capable of solving the most challenging competition<br>
problems, combine aspects of all of these technologies.</p>
<p>It is helpful to keep in mind that the phrase "AI for mathematics"<br>
encompasses several distinct technologies that overlap and interact in<br>
interesting ways. In this talk, I will survey the landscape, describe a few<br>
landmark applications to mathematics, and encourage you to join me in<br>
thinking about how mathematicians and computer scientists can collaborate<br>
to guide mathematics through this era of technological change.</p>
<p>Bio:<br>
Jeremy Avigad is a professor in the Department of Philosophy and the<br>
Department of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. He is<br>
the director of the Institute for Computer-Aided Reasoning in Mathematics,<br>
a new NSF Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, and the director of the<br>
Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics, a research center at Carnegie<br>
Mellon. He has contributed to mathematical logic and the history and<br>
philosophy of mathematics, and he is currently working on applications of<br>
formal methods and AI to mathematics. He serves on the Lean Community Admin<br>
Team and the board of the Lean Focused Research Organization.</p>
