<p>From: Claude Marche &lt;<a href="mailto:Claude.Marche@inria.fr">Claude.Marche@inria.fr</a>&gt;<br>
Hello to all,</p>
<p>A temporary engineer position at Inria is available in the context of<br>
the ``Decysif'' collaborative project. The main topic of work is<br>
the formal verification of Rust programs using the Creusot environment.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to forward this announce to anybody possibly interested</p>
<p>== The Decysif project ==</p>
<p>Decysif (<a href="https://decysif.fr/">https://decysif.fr/</a>) is a collaborative project joining the<br>
Toccata research team at Inria Saclay, the LMF laboratory of<br>
University Paris-Saclay, and the private companies AdaCore, OCamlPro<br>
and TrustInSoft in Paris.  The general objective of Decysif is to<br>
apply formal verification techniques and tools to the development of<br>
software that is critical for safety and security.</p>
<p>While the Decysif project targets programs written in Ada, C, C++ and<br>
Rust, the proposed engineer position is focused on the verification of<br>
Rust programs, and specifically using the Creusot environment<br>
(<a href="https://github.com/xldenis/creusot">https://github.com/xldenis/creusot</a>). In direct collaboration with the<br>
Why3 developers at Toccata and the research engineers at the<br>
industrial partners, the person recruited will have to work on the<br>
maturation of Creusot. Creusot is a prototype coming from a doctoral<br>
thesis and must be improved to be able to be applied to industrial<br>
case studies. The objectives concern, among other things, the<br>
extension of the supported Rust fragment, the need to complete<br>
specifications of Rust libraries, the improvement of the usability of<br>
the graphical user interface, the increase in the rate of proof<br>
automation, to set up methods to help proof (such as the generation of<br>
counterexamples in case of proof failure), to strengthen the<br>
robustness and reproducibility of proofs.</p>
<p>== Expectations from the candidates ==</p>
<p>We seek candidates with as much experience and skills as possible<br>
in several domains including: development using the OCaml language;<br>
development using the Rust language; techniques for evaluation,<br>
compilation and/or transformation of programs; formal methods for<br>
software engineering; formal logics; static analysis of programs;<br>
computer-assisted theorem proving; use of formal proof environments.</p>
<p>We expect some experience in the field of formal methods of software<br>
engineering in a general sense. The typical candidate would be someone<br>
who recently defended a master's thesis or a PhD in a related domain.</p>
<p>The research part of the job is significant, the work is expected<br>
to lead to academic publications.  The development activities include<br>
a participation in the development of Why3, for which we are<br>
interested in candidates with experience in OCaml programming, or<br>
similar functional programming languages, and in the practice of<br>
shared development using git.</p>
<p>Some skills in the use of a formal proof environment will be a plus.</p>
<p>== How to apply</p>
<p>The engineer position should be filled as soon as possible.</p>
