Synopsis</p>
<p>Alan Turing arguably wrote the first paper on formal methods over 75 years<br>
ago. Since then, there have been claims and counterclaims about formal<br>
methods. Tool development has been slow but aided by Moore’s Law, with the<br>
increasing power of computers. Although formal methods are not widespread<br>
in practical usage at a heavyweight level, their influence has crept into<br>
software engineering practice to the extent that they are no longer<br>
necessarily called formal methods in their use. In addition, in areas where<br>
safety and security are important, with the increasing use of computers in<br>
such applications, formal methods are a viable way to improve the<br>
reliability of such software-based systems. Their use in hardware, where a<br>
mistake can be very costly, is also important. This talk explores the<br>
journey of formal methods to the present day and speculates on future<br>
directions, including the use of Artificial Intelligence.<br>
