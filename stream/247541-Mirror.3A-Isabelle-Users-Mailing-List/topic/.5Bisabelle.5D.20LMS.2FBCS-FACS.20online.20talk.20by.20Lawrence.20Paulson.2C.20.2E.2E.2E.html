Dear all,</p>

these lists. Please note the information about registration below.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Andrei</p>

<p>Title: Formalising 21st-Century Mathematics</p>
<p>Abstract: The formalisation of mathematics is an ongoing process that<br>
arguably started as early as the 19th century, intensified with the<br>
foundational crisis at the start of the 20th century, and since the<br>
1970s has been conducted with the help of computers. Recent decades<br>
have seen the machine formalisation of lengthy and technically<br>
complicated proofs, but some have argued that even these were not<br>
representative of modern mathematics. Recent achievements by a number<br>
of different groups are starting to challenge this scepticism. The<br>
speaker will outline some of these, while also noting some of the<br>
remaining trouble spots.</p>
<p>Biography: Lawrence Paulson FRS is an American computer scientist. He<br>
is a Professor of Computational Logic at the University of Cambridge<br>
Computer Laboratory and a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge. He is<br>
best known for the cornerstone text on the programming language ML, ML<br>
for the Working Programmer. His research is based around the<br>
interactive theorem prover Isabelle, which he introduced in 1986. He<br>
has worked on the verification of cryptographic protocols using<br>
inductive definitions, and he has also formalised the constructible<br>
universe of Kurt Gödel. Recently he has built a new theorem prover,<br>
MetiTarski, for real-valued special functions.</p>

Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>Another note: This talk will be recorded and made available on youtube<br>
(I will come back with the link). I would like to apologise to those<br>
of you attending CPP -- when scheduling this (which happened a while<br>
ago) I lost sight of the overlap with CPP.  :-(</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Andrei</p>
