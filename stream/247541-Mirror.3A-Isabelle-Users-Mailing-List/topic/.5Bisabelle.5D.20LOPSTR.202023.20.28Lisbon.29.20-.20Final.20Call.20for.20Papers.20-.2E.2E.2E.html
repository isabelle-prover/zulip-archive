<p>33rd International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and<br>
Transformation (LOPSTR 2023)<br>
Co-located with PPDP 2023 as part of SPLASH 2023</p>
<p>October 23-24, 2023 - Cascais, Lisbon, Portugal</p>
<p><a href="https://lopstr.github.io/2023/">https://lopstr.github.io/2023/</a></p>
<p>Important dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract submission: May 19, 2023 (AoE)</li>
<li>Paper submission: May 26, 2023 (AoE)</li>
<li>Author notification: July 24, 2023 (AoE)</li>
<li>Camera-ready: August 18, 2023 </li>
<li>Symposium: October 23-24, 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international<br>
research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR<br>
is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any<br>
language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively,<br>
friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress.</p>
<p>LOPSTR 2023 will be held in-person at Hotel Cascais Miragem in<br>
Cascais, Lisbon, Portugal and will be co-located with PPDP 2023 as<br>
part of SPLASH 2023. At least one of the authors of the accepted paper<br>
is expected to attend the conference and present the paper. Information<br>
about venue and travel is available on the SPLASH 2023 website.</p>
<p>Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program<br>
development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both<br>
programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large, including, but<br>
not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>synthesis</li>
<li>transformation</li>
<li>specialization</li>
<li>inversion</li>
<li>composition</li>
<li>optimisation</li>
<li>specification</li>
<li>analysis and verification</li>
<li>testing and certification</li>
<li>program and model manipulation</li>
<li>AI-methods for program development</li>
<li>verification and testing of AI-based systems</li>
<li>transformational techniques in software engineering</li>
<li>
<p>logic-based methods for security, cyber-physical and distributed<br>
   system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>applications, tools and industrial practice</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new<br>
perspective and papers that describe experience with industrial<br>
applications and case studies are also welcome.</p>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSION</p>
<p>Submissions can be made in two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular Papers (15 pages max.)</li>
<li>Short Papers (8 pages max.)</li>
</ul>
<p>References do NOT count towards the page limit. Additional pages may<br>
be used for appendices not intended for publication. Reviewers are not<br>
required to read the appendices, and thus papers should be<br>
intelligible without them. All submissions must be written in English.</p>
<p>Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers/tools that have<br>
been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal,<br>
conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings.</p>
<p>Submissions of Regular Papers must describe the original work. Work<br>
that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop<br>
proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of<br>
questions).</p>
<p>Submissions of Short Papers may include presentations of exciting if<br>
not fully polished research and tool demonstrations that are of<br>
academic and industrial interest. Tool demonstrations should describe<br>
the relevant system, usability, and implementation aspects of a tool.</p>
<p>All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and<br>
published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)<br>
volume.</p>
<p>After the symposium, a selection of a few best papers will be invited<br>
for submission to rapid publication in the Journal of Theory and<br>
Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). Authors of selected papers will<br>
be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions to be considered<br>
for publication. The papers submitted to TPLP will be subject to the<br>
standard reviewing process of the journal.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>
<p>Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in<br>
English) in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science<br>
style. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title;<br>
authors and their affiliations; contact author's email; abstract; and<br>
three to four keywords which will be used to assist the PC in<br>
selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper. Authors should consult<br>
Springer's authors' instructions at the author's page, and use their<br>
proceedings templates, either for LaTeX (available also in overleaf)<br>
or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages<br>
authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, upon<br>
acceptance, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf<br>
of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a<br>
Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the<br>
copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the<br>
paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to<br>
the authorship of the papers cannot be made.</p>
<p>Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the<br>
manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their report. So, for<br>
LaTeX, we recommend that authors use:</p>
<p>\pagestyle{plain}<br>
\usepackage{lineno}<br>
\linenumbers</p>
<p>Papers should be submitted via EasyChair:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2023</a></p>
<p>BEST PAPER AWARD</p>
<p>Thanks to Springer's sponsorship, two best paper awards (one for each<br>
submission category), with a 500 EUR prize, will be given at LOPSTR<br>
2023. The program committee will select the winning papers based on<br>
relevance, originality and technical quality but may also take<br>
authorship into account (e.g. a student paper).</p>
