ANU Logic Summer School</p>
<p>December 2 – 13, 2024</p>
<p>Australian National University<br>
Canberra, Ngunnawal and Ngambri Country, Australia<br>

<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The ANU Logic Summer School is an annual event that offers a two week long programme of lectures on modern logic, the foundational discipline of the information sciences. Topics include not only the science of reasoning but also computability theory, type theory and other tools for understanding processes, declarative programming, automatic proof generation, program verification and much more. The school is primarily geared at late undergraduate and masters students, but is open to all, including postgraduate and PhD students, postdocs, and participants from industry.</p>
<p>PROGRAMME</p>
<p>The school features four introductory courses in the first week, and a series of five lectures covering more advanced topics in the second week. The courses are given by a mix of local, domestic and international speakers.</p>
<p>Week 1:<br>
John Slaney (ANU): Foundations of Metalogic<br>
Michael Norrish (ANU): Computability and Incompleteness<br>
Fabian Muehlboeck (ANU): Formalizing and Reasoning About Programming Languages<br>
Ranald Clouston (ANU): Propositions and Types, Proofs and Programs</p>
<p>Week 2:<br>
Iris van der Giessen (U. of Amsterdam): Interpolation through the Lens of Proof Theory<br>
Mark Reynolds (U. of Western Australia): Verification via Temporal Logic: an Introduction<br>
Tomasz Kowalski (La Trobe U. / Jagiellonian U.): Qualitative Calculi via Relation Algebras<br>
Sophie Pinchinat (U. of Rennes): Automatic Structures and their Logical theory<br>
Thomas Sewell (U. of New South Wales): Applying Logic in Software and Inefficient Computation</p>
<p>SOCIAL EVENTS</p>
<p>The summer school hosts a welcome reception on Sunday December 1, a social dinner on Thursday December 5, and organises an excursion to Canberra’s surrounds on Saturday December 7.</p>
