<h2>Call for Presentations</h2>
<p>ML (originally, "Meta Language") is a family of programming languages<br>
that includes dialects known as Standard ML, OCaml, and F#, among<br>
others. The development of these languages has inspired a large amount<br>
of computer science research, both practical and theoretical.</p>
<p>The ML 2025 workshop will continue the informal approach followed<br>
since 2010. Presentations are selected by the program committee from<br>
submitted proposals. There are no published proceedings, so<br>
contributions may be submitted for publication elsewhere. The main<br>
criterion is promoting and informing the development of the entire<br>
extended ML family and delivering a lively workshop atmosphere. We<br>
particularly encourage talks about works in progress, presentations of<br>
negative results (things that were expected to but did not quite work<br>
out) and informed positions.</p>
<p>Each presentation should take 20-25 minutes. The exact time will be<br>
decided based on scheduling constraints.</p>
<p>We plan the workshop to an be in-person event with remote<br>
participation (streamed live). We hope that speakers are able to<br>
present in person. If a speaker is unable to attend, they may<br>
instead present remotely.</p>
<p>The 2025 ML Family Workshop is co-located with ICFP/SPLASH 2025<br>
and will take place on <strong>October 16, 2025</strong> in Singapore.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>We seek presentations on topics including (but not limited to):</p>
<p>* Language design: abstraction, higher forms of polymorphism,<br>
    concurrency and parallelism, distribution and mobility, staging,<br>
    extensions for semi-structured data, generic programming,<br>
    object systems, etc.</p>
<p>* Implementation: compilers, interpreters, type checkers, partial<br>
    evaluators, runtime systems, garbage collectors, foreign function<br>
    interfaces, etc.</p>
<p>* Type systems: inference, effects, modules, contracts, specifications<br>
    and assertions, dynamic typing, error reporting, etc.</p>
<p>* Applications: case studies, experience reports, pearls, etc.</p>
<p>* Environments: libraries, tools, editors, debuggers, cross-language<br>
    interoperability, functional data structures, etc.</p>
<p>* Semantics of ML-family languages: operational and denotational<br>
    semantics, program equivalence, parametricity, mechanization, etc.</p>
<p>We specifically encourage reporting what did not meet expectations or<br>
what, despite all efforts, did not work to satisfaction.</p>
<p>Four kinds of submissions are solicited: Research Presentations,<br>
Experience Reports, Demos, and Informed Positions.</p>
<p>* Research Presentations: Research presentations should describe new<br>
    ideas, experimental results, or significant advances in ML-related<br>
    projects. We especially encourage presentations that describe work<br>
    in progress, that outline a future research agenda, or that<br>
    encourage lively discussion. These presentations should be<br>
    structured in a way which can be, at least in part, of interest to<br>
    (advanced) users.</p>
<p>* Experience Reports: Users are invited to submit Experience Reports<br>
    about their use of ML and related languages. These presentations do<br>
    not need to contain original research but they should tell an<br>
    interesting story to researchers or other advanced users, such as an<br>
    innovative or unexpected use of advanced features or a description<br>
    of the challenges they are facing or attempting to solve.</p>
<p>* Demos: Live demonstrations or short tutorials should show new<br>
    developments, interesting prototypes, or work in progress, in the<br>
    form of tools, libraries, or applications built on or related to ML<br>
    and related languages. (You will need to provide all the hardware<br>
    and software required for your demo; the workshop organizers are<br>
    only able to provide a projector.)</p>
<p>* Informed Positions: A justified argument for or against a language<br>
    feature. The argument must be substantiated, either theoretically<br>
    (e.g., by a demonstration of (un)soundness, an inference algorithm,<br>
    a complexity analysis), empirically or by substantial experience.<br>
    Personal experience is accepted as justification so long as it is<br>
    extensive and illustrated with concrete examples.</p>
<h2>Submission details</h2>
<p>Submissions must be in the PDF format and have a short summary<br>
(abstract) at the beginning. Submissions in the categories of<br>
Experience Reports, Demos, or Informed Positions should indicate so in<br>
the title or subtitle. The point of the submission should be clear<br>
from its two first pages (PC members are not obligated to read any<br>
further.)</p>
<p>Submissions must be uploaded to the workshop submission website before<br>
the submission deadline.</p>
<p>Only the short summary/abstract of accepted submissions will be<br>
published on the conference website. After acceptance, authors will<br>
have the opportunity to attach or link to that summary any relevant<br>
material (such as the updated submission, slides, etc.)</p>

<h2>Coordination with the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop</h2>
<p>The OCaml workshop is seen as more practical and is dedicated in<br>
significant part to OCaml community building and the development of<br>
the OCaml system. In contrast, the ML family workshop is not focused<br>
on any language in particular, is more research-oriented, and deals<br>
with general issues of ML-style programming and type systems. There<br>
is some overlap, which we are keen to explore in various ways. The<br>
authors who feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged<br>
to mention it at submission time or contact the program chairs.</p>
