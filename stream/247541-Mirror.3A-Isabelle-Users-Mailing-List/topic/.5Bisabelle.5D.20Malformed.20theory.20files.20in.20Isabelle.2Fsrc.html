<p>From: Xiaokun Luan &lt;<a href="mailto:luanxiaokun@pku.edu.cn">luanxiaokun@pku.edu.cn</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>I found that many theory files located in Isabelle/src seem to exhibit issues<br>
when loaded in jEdit.<br>
However, most of these files can be imported with no error and can be built<br>
successfully.<br>
I'm wondering why a theory file that cannot pass proof checking in jEdit can<br>
be built and imported with no error.<br>
Is this as expected and intentional, or am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Theories that are not listed in the ROOT files but can be imported</li>
</ol>
<p>I found four files of this kind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doc/Tutorial/Advanced/Partial.thy</li>
<li>Doc/Tutorial/Advanced/WFrec.thy</li>
<li>HOL/Proofs/Extraction/QuotRem.thy</li>
<li>HOL/Predicate_Compile_Examples/Hotel_Example_Small_Generator.thy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Partial.thy is importing "Tutorial.While_Combinator", which has been moved to<br>
HOL-Library, so it cannot be imported.<br>
WFrec.thy uses deprecated command recdef, QuoRem.thy complains that there is<br>
illegal free variable.<br>
Hotel_Example_Small_Generator.thy complains there is a type error.<br>
All of these three files can be imported with no error.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Theories that are not listed in the ROOT files and cannot be imported</li>
</ol>
<p>Theory files in Doc/Tutorial/Recdef seem to be about the deprecated command<br>
recdef.<br>
They cannot be imported since the folder Recdef is not declared in the<br>
Tutorial session.<br>
The first two kinds of malformed files are not checked during the build<br>
process.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Theories that are listed in the ROOT files but have errors</li>
</ol>
<p>I found seven theory files listed in the ROOT files that throw errors when<br>
loaded in jEdit:</p>
<ul>
<li>HOL/Proofs/Extraction/Euclid.thy, invalid free variable</li>
<li>HOL/Proofs/Extraction/Greatest_Common_Divisor.thy, illegal free variable</li>
<li>HOL/Proofs/Extraction/Higman_Extraction.thy, exception THM 0 raised</li>
<li>HOL/Proofs/Extraction/Pigeonhole.thy, extra variable on rhs</li>
<li>HOL/Proofs/Extraction/Warshall.thy, undefined fact</li>
<li>HOL/Proofs/Lambda/WeakNorm.thy, exception THM 0 raised</li>
<li>HOL/Proofs/ex/XML_Data.thy, partial proof term</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these files can be imported with no error, and the build process also<br>
succeeds.<br>
I'm aware that some theory files use oops to skip unsuccessful proof attempts,<br>
but none of these files do that.</p>
<p>Maybe the first two kinds of malformed (if so) theory files could just be<br>
removed to keep things a little tidier.<br>
As for the third kind of files, I'm not sure if these errors are expected,<br>
since they can be built and imported, or if they are just malformed and should<br>
be fixed or removed.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Xiaokun</p>

The recdef doc looks like it might actually be unused (nowadays there is <br>
only old_recdef), maybe someone knows what should happen with the docs.</p>
<p>As for your other problems, you have some misconceptions here:</p>
<p>(1) Theory files do not all need to be listed in a ROOT file -- for <br>
instance, they can just be imported by a theory that is listed (e.g., <br>
QuotRem is imported by Greatest_Common_Divisor).</p>
<p>(3) You'll have to start jEdit with the right logic/session -- use <br>
<code>isabelle jedit -R HOL-Proofs-Extraction</code>, for example.</p>

Hi Fabian,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply and explanation, it seems clearer to me now.</p>
<p>Theory files do not all need to be listed in a ROOT file, but I've seen many<br>
cases (mainly in AFP) where the theory file is neither imported by any other<br>
theory files in the session, nor listed in the ROOT file. I think in such<br>
case, this file will never be checked during the build process, correct?</p>
<p>What makes it worse is that, if the file (that not listed nor imported) is<br>
placed in the root folder of the session, or in any directory that is listed<br>
in the ROOT file, it can still be imported by using A.B where A is the session<br>
name and B the theory name. (Please correct me if I'm wrong) I imagine that<br>
these files will eventually end up like the malformed doc theory files. Though<br>
things still work as long as we don't import these "dead code", I think it<br>
would be tidier if these files can be listed in the ROOT file and fixed<br>
accordingly, or just removed.</p>

<p>Yes. In fact, you can find out those particular theories using (with <br>
isabelle-devel + afp-devel installed):</p>
<p>isabelle afp_check_roots -C unused_thys</p>

Unfortunately yes.<br>

<p>Agreed. For new submissions, we do not allow such dangling theories but <br>
yes there are some entries that still have them -- it is on the authors <br>
to check their material if it is relevant and should be checked or <br>
irrelevant and can be removed. I guess one could message them about that.</p>
