<p>From: Yong Kiam &lt;<a href="mailto:tanyongkiam@gmail.com">tanyongkiam@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>(Apologies for multiple copies)</p>
<p>We are jointly advertising for several open PhD and postdoc positions in<br>
PL/FM at the School of Computer Science and Engineering<br>
&lt;<a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse">https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse</a>&gt;, Nanyang Technological University (NTU),<br>
Singapore &lt;<a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/">https://www.ntu.edu.sg/</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>PhD positions are fully funded, and will be for the January 2025 or August<br>
2025 intake at SCSE, NTU.</p>
<p>Details of the postdoctoral positions vary, but they are open to candidates<br>
with PhD-level qualifications in a range of topics in PL/FM. Please see<br>
below for further information on individual openings; interested candidates<br>
should contact us directly.</p>
<p>Luke Ong, Professor</p>
<p>We invite motivated and well-qualified candidates to work on Bayesian<br>
Statistical Probabilistic Programming, as part of a research programme<br>
funded by the National Research Foundation, Singapore.</p>
<p>The appointees will work in the Probabilistic Programming Lab, where<br>
research is carried out on a wide range of topics, especially in the<br>
interface of programming languages, machine learning, and Bayesian<br>
statistics, but also in allied areas in semantics of computation, formal<br>
methods and verification, and in logic and algorithms.</p>
<p>Bayesian Statistical Probabilistic Programming lies in the interface of<br>
programming languages, machine learning, and Bayesian statistics. These<br>
positions will suit researchers with expertise in one (or more) of the<br>
three areas, and are interested and committed to collaborating with experts<br>
in the other areas.</p>
<p>Further details are available at<br>

<p>Yang Liu, Professor</p>
<p>I have fully-funded PhD positions available for PL/SE/Security on web3<br>
security (smart contract and runtime monitoring), AV security and<br>
robustness, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications: applying LLM for<br>
FM (specification/property generation, proof automation), LLM for security<br>
(vulnerability detection via static analysis or fuzzing, vulnerability<br>
repair), LLM for SE (multi-agent software development), LLM security<br>
(prompt injection, jailbreak, defence against LLM attacks).</p>

<p>Conrad Watt, Assistant Professor</p>
<p>I have fully-funded PhD positions available for PL research, broadly<br>
construed, related to the WebAssembly programming language and virtual<br>
machine. A successful applicant will have the opportunity to work closely<br>
with WebAssembly's industrial standards body and inform the future<br>
direction of the language.</p>
<p>I am also looking to recruit postdocs with experience in mechanised theorem<br>
proving and programming language semantics, to work on advanced extensions<br>
and applications of the WasmCert-Isabelle mechanisation of WebAssembly and<br>
related artefacts. A key theme of this work will be driving industrial<br>
adoption of verified artefacts - for example, see<br>
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3591224">https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3591224</a>. Experience with Isabelle/HOL<br>
would be highly desirable. Funding is available for up to 4 years of<br>
full-time employment.</p>

<p>Yong Kiam Tan, (incoming) Assistant Professor</p>
<p>I am interested in applications of deductive verification and interactive<br>
theorem proving in automated reasoning, compilers (CakeML), randomized<br>
algorithms, hybrid systems, and cryptography. I am recruiting up to three<br>
PhD students and three postdocs for these topics under a new Singapore NRF<br>
fellowship project.</p>
<p>Please visit <a href="https://tanyongkiam.github.io/advert.html">https://tanyongkiam.github.io/advert.html</a> for contact and<br>
other details.</p>
<p>Conrad and Yong Kiam would also like to draw attention to A*STAR's graduate<br>
scholarships (<br>
<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/overview">https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/overview</a>).<br>
These competitive national awards offer enhanced support for exceptional<br>
PhD applicants, who we would jointly supervise in a project related to the<br>
intersection of WebAssembly and CakeML. Please contact us for more details.</p>
