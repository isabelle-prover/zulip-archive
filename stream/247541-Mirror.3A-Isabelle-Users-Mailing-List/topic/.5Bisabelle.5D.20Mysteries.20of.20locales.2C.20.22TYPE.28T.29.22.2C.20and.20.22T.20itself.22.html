<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:manuel@pruvisto.org">manuel@pruvisto.org</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>this mostly isn't really a locale issue, but an issue with the ML-style <br>
ad-hoc polymorphism in Isabelle. This is described briefly in §2.3.2 of <br>
the Isabelle implementation manual. But let me try to explain it here as <br>
well:</p>
<p>Explicit polymorphism would be to model polymorphic constants as <br>
functions that take "type parameters". Isabelle, on the other hand, does <br>
not have explicit type parameters but has a kind of implicit polymorphism.</p>
<p>Consider for instance the following definition:</p>
<p>definition "foo = (∀x. x = x)"</p>
<p>This constant "foo" is of Boolean type, but it is polymorphic – even <br>
though its type itself is not polymorphic. The question of whether "foo" <br>
is true or not depends on the type of the "x" that we are quantifying <br>
over. Of course, this is just not possible. If you have something of <br>
type "bool", it cannot be True in one context and False in another.</p>
<p>The solution to this is hinted at when you look at the warning message <br>
emitted by Isabelle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additional type variable(s) in specification of "foo": 'a<br>
and inspecting the actual type of foo:<br>
"foo"<br>
  :: "'a itself ⇒ bool"<br>
Isabelle adds an additional dummy parameter to the "foo" to make this <br>
implicit dependence on the "type parameter" 'a explicit. The type "'a <br>
itself" is essentially a singleton type that only contains the dummy <br>
value "Pure.type :: 'a itself", which can, for convenience, be written <br>
with the syntax "TYPE('a)". Similar tricks are often employed in Haskell <br>
to bring type parameters to the term level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, these issues rarely show up. One example is something like <br>
the characteristic of a (semi-)ring, where the ring in question comes <br>
from a typeclass. The following is a slightly modified example taken <br>
from the "GCD" theory in the HOL session in the Isabelle distribution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>definition semiring_char :: "'a :: semiring_1 itself ⇒ nat"<br>
  where "semiring_char _ = Gcd {n. of_nat n = (0 :: 'a)}"<br>
Here, the dependence on the type parameter 'a was already made explicit <br>
by adding a dummy "itself" parameter. One could also have done without it:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>definition semiring_char :: "nat"<br>
  where "semiring_char = Gcd {n. of_nat n = (0 :: 'a :: semiring_1)}"<br>
In this case, we get the same warning as above and Isabelle would add <br>
the "itself" parameter and the end result would be the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your example, the perhaps confusing bit is that Isabelle seems to <br>
have eliminated your "dummy" parameter (presumably because nothing in <br>
your locale actually depends on the value of "dummy") and then, through <br>
the above mechanism, introduced its own dummy parameter of type "'a <br>
itself". The exact mechanism of elimination of this unnecessary <br>
parameter is not clear to me, especially because it doesn't do this in <br>
other cases, such as "locale foo = fixes x :: bool". There we can do <br>
"interpretation foo True" without an error.</p>
<p>In any case, I would recommend just replacing your "dummy :: 'a" <br>
parameter with a "dummy :: 'a itself" parameter and doing the <br>
interpretation with "TYPE('a)" instead of "undefined :: 'a".</p>
<p>By the way, your "degenerate" locale might as well be turned into a <br>
"degenerate" type class (you do get a "additional type variables" <br>
warning, but you can just ignore it):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>class nondegenerate =<br>
  assumes is_nondegenerate: "∃x :: 'a. x ≠ undefined"</p>
<p>instance bool :: nondegenerate<br>
  by intro_classes blast<br>
I for one would however phrase the axiom as "∃x y. x ≠ y" instead. <br>
Logically equivalent, of course, but I for one think it's nicer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Manuel</p>
<p>For the nitpicks: "'a itself" is only a singleton type in the sense that <br>
we cannot prove it to have more than one value. The only way to <br>
construct values of type "'a itself" is through "Pure.type" and of <br>
course things like "undefined" and "SOME x. True". There is no way to <br>
prove that it is a singleton type.</p>

<p>Thanks for this pointer.  For some reason, "TYPE" and "itself" did not make it into to the index of<br>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@andreas-lochbihler.de">mail@andreas-lochbihler.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Eugene,</p>
<p>One more addition to Manuel's excellent explanation: A locale <br>
declaration defines a constant with the same name as the locale that <br>
collects all the assumptions of the locale in a predicate. As arguments, <br>
the constant takes those locale parameters that actually appear in the <br>
assumptions. In your locale, the dummy parameter does not show up in the <br>
locale assumptions. Accordinglz, the generated constant nondegenerate is <br>
defined as</p>
<p>"nondegenerate == ∃x :: 'a. x ≠ undefined"</p>
<p>This definition depends on the type variable 'a very much similar to <br>
Manuel's foo. Therefore, Isabelle's definition facilities add the "'a <br>
itself" parameter to make this dependence explicit.</p>
<p>I'd recommend to avoid this roundabout way of introducing a type <br>
dependency by adding a vacuous assumption involving dummy, for example</p>
<p>locale nondegenerate = fixes dummy :: 'a<br>
   assumes is_nondegenerate: "∃x :: 'a. x ≠ undefined"<br>
     and dummy: "dummy = dummy"</p>
<p>This will make the constant nondegenerate depend on the parameter dummy, <br>
so its type is now "'a =&gt; bool" and there's no hidden polymorphism any <br>
more. You can of course change dummy's type to "'a itself" to make <br>
explicit that the locale does not care about the particular value chosen.</p>
<p>The benefit of adding the dummy assumption can be seen when you have <br>
multiple such parameters in a locale:</p>
<p>locale l = fixes dummy1 :: "'a itself" and dummy2 :: "'b itself"<br>
   assumes "∃x :: 'b. x ≠ undefined" "∃x :: 'a. x ≠ undefined"</p>
<p>Here, the order of the itself arguments to the generated constant l <br>
depends on the Isabelle internals for making the hidden polymorphism <br>
explicit. In particular, they are not controlled by the order of the <br>
locale arguments. This is brittle and possibly confusing. Instead, if <br>
you explicitly add the vacuous assumptions, you're in control of the <br>
order of parameters.</p>

Thank you, Andreas, your note is also very helpful.</p>
<p>Though I can't say my understanding is crystal clear just yet, I've been able to rework things<br>
using what Manuel and you have said and arrive at something less obscure and redundant and<br>
in general more to my taste.</p>
<p>I have taken into consideration your "dummy = dummy" suggestion, but I am currently not liking<br>
it so much, due to the extra trivial proof obligations that are introduced when the locales are<br>
interpreted.  But I might change my mind if I run into the brittleness that you indicate.</p>
