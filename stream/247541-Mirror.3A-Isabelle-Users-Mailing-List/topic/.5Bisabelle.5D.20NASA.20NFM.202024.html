<p>Theme of the Symposium:</p>
<hr>
<p>The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission-critical and<br>
safety-critical systems at NASA and in the aerospace industry requires advanced<br>
technologies to address their specification, design, verification, validation,<br>
and certification processes. For example, there is an increasing need for<br>
autonomous systems in deep space missions including NASA’s Moon to Mars<br>
exploration plans. The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is a forum to foster<br>
collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, other<br>
government agencies, academia, and industry, with the goal of identifying<br>
challenges and providing solutions towards achieving assurance for such<br>
critical systems. The focus of this symposium is on formal techniques for<br>
software and system assurance for applications in space, aviation, robotics,<br>
and other NASA-relevant safety-critical systems. This year’s symposium extends<br>
the focus to safety assurance of machine learning enabled autonomous systems,<br>
formal methods for digital transformation, and accessibility for new<br>
industries.</p>

<p>Submissions:</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two categories of submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular Papers (15 pages including references), describing fully developed<br>
  work and complete results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short Papers (6 pages including references), in one of the categories below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tool papers describing novel and publicly available tools</li>
<li>Case studies detailing applications of formal methods</li>
<li>New emerging ideas in the topics of interest</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All papers should be in English and describe original work that has not been<br>
published or submitted elsewhere. NFM24 will be a hybrid conference. Authors of<br>
accepted papers are encouraged to present their work in person at the<br>
conference.</p>
<p>There will be a tool demonstration session at the conference, where tool<br>
developers get to showcase their tools interactively with the attendees. All<br>
tool papers, under the short papers category, are required to participate in<br>
the tool demonstration session. Authors of regular papers are also welcome to<br>
participate in the tool demonstration session to showcase their application.</p>
<p>All submitters who are interested in participating in the tool demonstration<br>
session must include an additional appendix (maximum 4 pages and will not<br>
appear in the proceedings) containing the description of the proposed demo and<br>
the URL to a screencast demonstrating the tool. Authors of all accepted papers<br>
additionally have an opportunity to present a poster.</p>
<p>All submissions will be fully reviewed by members of the Program Committee.<br>
Accepted regular and short papers will be published in the Formal Methods<br>
subline of Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) and must use<br>
LNCS style formatting described on<br>
<a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>.<br>
Papers must be submitted in PDF format at the EasyChair submission site,<br>
