First-Order Rewriting<br>

<p>This entry, derived from the Isabelle Formalization of Rewriting (IsaFoR), <br>
provides a formalized foundation for first-order term rewriting. This serves as <br>
the basis for the certifier CeTA, which is generated from IsaFoR and verifies <br>
termination, confluence, and complexity proofs for term rewrite systems (TRSs). <br>
This formalization covers fundamental results for term rewriting, as presented <br>
in the foundational textbooks by Baader and Nipkow and TeReSe. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various types of rewrite steps, such as root, ground, parallel, and multi-steps.</li>
<li>Special cases of TRSs, such as linear and left-linear TRSs.</li>
<li>A definition of critical pairs and key results, including the critical pair lemma.</li>
<li>Orthogonality, notably that weak orthogonality implies confluence.</li>
<li>Executable versions of relevant definitions, such as parallel and multi-step <br>
rewriting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Proof Terms for Term Rewriting<br>
Christina Kirk</p>
<p>Proof terms are first-order terms that represent reductions in term rewriting. <br>
They were initially introduced in TeReSe by van Oostrom and de Vrijer to study <br>
equivalences of reductions in left-linear rewrite systems. This entry formalizes <br>
proof terms for multi-steps in first-order term rewrite systems. We define <br>
simple proof terms (i.e., without a composition operator) and establish the <br>
correspondence to multi-steps: each proof term represents a multi-step with the <br>
same source and target, and every multi-step can be expressed as a proof term. <br>
The formalization moreover includes operations on proof terms, such as <br>
residuals, join, and deletion and a method for labeling proof term sources to <br>
identify overlaps between two proof terms.<br>
This formalization is part of the Isabelle Formalization of Rewriting (IsaFoR) <br>
and is an essential component of several formalized confluence and commutation <br>
results involving multi-steps.</p>
