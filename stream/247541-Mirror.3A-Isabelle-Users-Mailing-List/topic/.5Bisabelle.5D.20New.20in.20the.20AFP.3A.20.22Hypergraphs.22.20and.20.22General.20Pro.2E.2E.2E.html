<p>From: "Thiemann, René" &lt;<a href="mailto:Rene.Thiemann@uibk.ac.at">Rene.Thiemann@uibk.ac.at</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>there are two further AFP entries from the Cambridge team, this time by Chelsea.</p>
<p>Hypergraphs<br>
  by Chelsea Edmonds</p>
<p>This entry is a simple extension of the Combinatorial design theory library,<br>
which presents new and existing concepts using hypergraph language. Both designs<br>
and hypergraphs are types of incidence set systems and hence have the same<br>
underlying foundation. However, they are often used in different contexts, and<br>
some definitions are unique. This library uses locales to rewrite equivalent<br>
definitions and build a basic hypergraph hierarchy with direct links to<br>
equivalent design theory concepts to avoid repetition, further demonstrating the<br>
power of the "locale-centric" approach. The library includes all standard<br>
definitions (order, degree etc.), as well as some extensions on hypergraph<br>
decompositions and spanning subhypergraphs.</p>

<p>General Probabilistic Techniques for Combinatorics and the Lovasz Local Lemma<br>
  by Chelsea Edmonds</p>
<p>This entry aims to formalise several useful general techniques for using the<br>
probabilistic method for combinatorial structures (or discrete spaces more<br>
generally). In particular, it focuses on bounding tools for combinatorics, such<br>
as the union and complete independence bounds, and the first formalisation of<br>
the pivotal Lovász local lemma. The formalisation focuses on the general lemma,<br>
however also proves several useful variations, including the more well-known<br>
symmetric version. Both the original formalisation and several of the variations<br>
used dependency graphs, which were formalised using Noschinski's general<br>
directed graph library. Additionally, the entry provides several useful<br>
existence lemmas, required at the end of most probabilistic proofs on<br>
combinatorial structures. Finally, the entry includes several significant<br>
extensions to the existing probability libraries, particularly for conditional<br>
probability (such as Bayes theorem) and independent events. The formalisation is<br>
primarily based on Alon and Spencer's textbook "The Probabilistic Method", as<br>
well as Zhao's course notes on the subject.</p>
