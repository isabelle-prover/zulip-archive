<p>Formalization of CommCSL: A Relational Concurrent Separation Logic for Proving<br>
Information Flow Security in Concurrent Programs<br>
  by Thibault Dardinier</p>
<p>Information flow security ensures that the secret data manipulated by a program<br>
does not influence its observable output. Proving information flow security is<br>
especially challenging for concurrent programs, where operations on secret data<br>
may influence the execution time of a thread and, thereby, the interleaving<br>
between threads. Such internal timing channels may affect the observable outcome<br>
of a program even if an attacker does not observe execution times. Existing<br>
verification techniques for information flow security in concurrent programs<br>
attempt to prove that secret data does not influence the relative timing of<br>
threads. However, these techniques are often restrictive (for instance because<br>
they disallow branching on secret data) and make strong assumptions about the<br>
execution platform (ignoring caching, processor instructions with data-dependent<br>
execution time, and other common features that affect execution time).</p>
<p>In this entry, we formalize and prove the soundness of CommCSL, a novel<br>
relational concurrent separation logic for proving secure information flow in<br>
concurrent programs that lifts these restrictions and does not make any<br>
assumptions about timing behavior. The key idea is to prove that all mutating<br>
operations performed on shared data commute, such that different thread<br>
interleavings do not influence its final value. Crucially, commutativity is<br>
required only for an abstraction of the shared data that contains the<br>
information that will be leaked to a public output. Abstract commutativity is<br>
satisfied by many more operations than standard commutativity, which makes our<br>
technique widely applicable.</p>
