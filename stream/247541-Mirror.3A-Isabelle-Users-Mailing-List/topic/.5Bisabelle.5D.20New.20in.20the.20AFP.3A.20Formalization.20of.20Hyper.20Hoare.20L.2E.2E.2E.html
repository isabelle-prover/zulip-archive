Formalization of Hyper Hoare Logic: A Logic to (Dis-)Prove Program Hyperproperties</p>
<p>Thibault Dardinier</p>
<p>Hoare logics are proof systems that allow one to formally establish properties <br>
of computer programs. Traditional Hoare logics prove properties of individual <br>
program executions (so-called trace properties, such as functional correctness). <br>
On the one hand, Hoare logic has been generalized to prove properties of <br>
multiple executions of a program (so-called hyperproperties, such as determinism <br>
or non-interference). These program logics prove the absence of (bad <br>
combinations of) executions. On the other hand, program logics similar to Hoare <br>
logic have been proposed to disprove program properties (e.g., Incorrectness <br>
Logic [8]), by proving the existence of (bad combinations of) executions. All of <br>
these logics have in common that they specify program properties using <br>
assertions over a fixed number of states, for instance, a single pre- and <br>
post-state for functional properties or pairs of pre- and post-states for <br>
non-interference. In this entry, we formalize Hyper Hoare Logic, a <br>
generalization of Hoare logic that lifts assertions to properties of arbitrary <br>
sets of states. The resulting logic is simple yet expressive: its judgments can <br>
express arbitrary trace- and hyperproperties over the terminating executions of <br>
a program. By allowing assertions to reason about sets of states, Hyper Hoare <br>
Logic can reason about both the absence and the existence of (combinations of) <br>
executions, and, thereby, supports both proving and disproving program <br>
(hyper-)properties within the same logic. In fact, we prove that Hyper Hoare <br>
Logic subsumes the properties handled by numerous existing correctness and <br>
incorrectness logics, and can express hyperproperties that no existing Hoare <br>
logic can. We also prove that Hyper Hoare Logic is sound and complete.</p>
