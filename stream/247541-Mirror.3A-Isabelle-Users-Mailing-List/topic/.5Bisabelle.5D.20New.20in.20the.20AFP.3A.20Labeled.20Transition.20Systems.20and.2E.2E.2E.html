Enjoy two new entries on Labeled Transition Systems, and Pushdown <br>
Systems, verifying the important post<em>, pre</em>, and dual* algorithms for <br>
reachability in PDSs!</p>
<p>Labeled Transition Systems</p>
<p>Labeled transition systems are ubiquitous in computer science. They are <br>
used e.g. for automata and for program graphs in program analysis. We <br>
formalize labeled transition systems with and without epsilon <br>
transitions. The main difference between formalizations of labeled <br>
transition systems is in their choice of how to represent the transition <br>
system. In the present formalization the set of nodes is a type, and a <br>
labeled transition system is represented as a locale fixing a set of <br>
transitions where each transition is a triple of respectively a start <br>
node, a label and an end node. Wimmer [Wim20] provides an overview of <br>
formalizations of graphs and transition systems.</p>
<p>Pushdown Systems</p>
<p>We formalize pushdown systems and the correctness of the pushdown <br>
reachability algorithms post* (forward search), pre* (backward search) <br>
and dual* (bi-directional search). For pre* we refine the algorithm to <br>
an executable version for which one can generate code using Isabelle's <br>
code generator. For pre* and post* we follow Stefan Schwoon's PhD thesis <br>
[Sch02a]. The dual* algorithm is from a paper by Jensen et. al presented <br>
at ATVA2021 [JSS+21]. The formalization is described in our FMCAD2022 <br>
paper [SSST22] in which we also document how we have used it to do <br>
differential testing against a C++ implementation of pushdown <br>
reachability called PDAAAL. Lammich et al. [Lam09, LMW09] formalized the <br>
pre* algorithm for dynamic pushdown networks (DPN) which is a <br>
generalization of pushdown systems. Our work is independent from that <br>
because the post* of DPNs is not regular and additionally the DPN <br>
formalization does not support epsilon transitions which we use for <br>
post* and dual*.</p>
