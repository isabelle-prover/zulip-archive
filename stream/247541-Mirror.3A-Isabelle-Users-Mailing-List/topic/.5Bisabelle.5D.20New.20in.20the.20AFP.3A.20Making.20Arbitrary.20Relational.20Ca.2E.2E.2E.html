Making Arbitrary Relational Calculus Queries Safe-Range<br>
Martin Raszyk and Dmitriy Traytel</p>
<p>The relational calculus (RC), i.e., first-order logic with equality but without <br>
function symbols, is a concise, declarative database query language. In contrast <br>
to relational algebra or SQL, which are the traditional query languages of <br>
choice in the database community, RC queries can evaluate to an infinite <br>
relation. Moreover, even in cases where the evaluation result of an RC query <br>
would be finite it is not clear how to efficiently compute it. Safe-range RC is <br>
an interesting syntactic subclass of RC, because all safe-range queries evaluate <br>
to a finite result and it is well-known how to evaluate such queries by <br>
translating them to relational algebra. We formalize and prove correct our <br>
recent translation of an arbitrary RC query into a pair of safe-range queries. <br>
Assuming an infinite domain, the two queries have the following meaning: The <br>
first is closed and characterizes the original query's relative safety, i.e., <br>
whether given a fixed database (interpretation of atomic predicates with finite <br>
relations), the original query evaluates to a finite relation. The second <br>
safe-range query is equivalent to the original query, if the latter is <br>
relatively safe. The formalization uses the Refinement Framework to go from the <br>
non-deterministic algorithm described in the paper to a deterministic, <br>
executable query translation. Our executable query translation is a first step <br>
towards a verified tool that efficiently evaluates arbitrary RC queries. This <br>
very problem is also solved by the AFP entry Eval_FO with a theoretically <br>
incomparable but practically worse time complexity. (The latter is demonstrated <br>
by our empirical evaluation.)</p>
