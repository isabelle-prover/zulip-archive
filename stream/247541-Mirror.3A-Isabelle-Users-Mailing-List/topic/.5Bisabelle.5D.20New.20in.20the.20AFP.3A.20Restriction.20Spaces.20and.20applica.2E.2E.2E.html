Restriction Spaces: a Fixed-Point Theory<br>
Benoît Ballenghien, Benjamin Puyobro and Burkhart Wolff</p>
<p>Fixed-point constructions are fundamental to defining recursive and co-recursive <br>
functions. However, a general axiom Y f = f(Y f) leads to inconsistency, and <br>
definitions must therefore be based on theories guaranteeing existence under <br>
suitable conditions. In Isabelle/HOL, these constructions are typically based on <br>
sets, well-founded orders or domain-theoretic models such as for example HOLCF. <br>
In this submission we introduce a formalization of restriction spaces i.e. <br>
spaces equipped with a so-called restriction, satifying three properties ....<br>
They turn out to be cartesian closed and admit natural notions of <br>
constructiveness and completeness, enabling the definition of a fixed-point <br>
operator under verifiable side-conditions. This is achieved in our entry, from <br>
topological definitions to induction principles. Additionally, we configure the <br>
simplifier so that it can automatically solve both constructiveness and <br>
admissibility subgoals, as long as users write higher-order rules for their <br>
operators. Since our implementation relies on axiomatic type classes, the <br>
resulting library is a fully abstract, flexible and reusable framework.</p>

<p>Examples of Restriction Spaces<br>
Benoît Ballenghien, Benjamin Puyobro and Burkhart Wolff</p>
<p>In this session, a number of examples are provided to illustrate how the <br>
Restriction_Spaces library works. The simple cases are, of course, covered: <br>
trivial restriction, booleans, integers, option type, and so on. But we also <br>
explore more elaborate constructions, such as formal power series and a trace <br>
model of the CSP process algebra. Additionally, we provide a lightweight <br>
integration with HOLCF, equipping restriction spaces with the inherited partial <br>
order structure when needed.</p>

<p>Ultrametric Structure for Restriction Spaces<br>
Benoît Ballenghien, Benjamin Puyobro and Burkhart Wolff</p>
<p>In this entry, we explore the relationship between restriction spaces and usual <br>
metric structures by instantiating the former as ultrametric spaces. This is <br>
classically captured by defining the distance as<br>
but we actually generalize this perspective by introducing a hierarchy of <br>
increasingly refined type classes to systematically relate ultrametric and <br>
restriction-based notions. This layered approach enables a precise comparison of <br>
structural and topological properties. In the end, our main result establishes <br>
that completeness in the sense of restriction spaces coincides with standard <br>
metric completeness, thus bridging the gap between our framework and Banach's <br>
fixed-point theorem established in HOL-Analysis.</p>

<p>CSP Semantics over Restriction Spaces<br>
Benoît Ballenghien and Burkhart Wolff</p>
<p>We use the Restriction_Spaces library as a semantic foundation for the process <br>
algebra framework HOL-CSP, offering a complementary backend to the existing <br>
HOLCF infrastructure. The type of processes is instantiated as a restriction <br>
space, and we prove that it is complete in this setting. This enables the <br>
construction of fixed points for recursive process definitions without having to <br>
rely exclusively on a pointed complete partial order. Notably, some operators <br>
are constructive without being Scott-continuous, and vice versa, illustrating <br>
the genuine complementarity between the two approaches. We also show that key <br>
CSP operators are either constructive or non-destructive, and verify the <br>
admissibility of several predicates, thereby supporting automated reasoning over <br>
recursive specifications.</p>
