<p>Swap Distance<br>
Manuel Eberl</p>
<p>Given two lists that are permutations of one another, the swap distance (also <br>
known as the Kendall tau distance) is the minimum number of swap operations of <br>
adjacent elements required to make the two lists the same.</p>
<p>Equivalently, the swap distance of two finite linear orders and is the number of <br>
disagreements of the two orders, i.e. of pairs such that and .</p>
<p>This article defines these two notions of swap distance as well as their <br>
equivalence under the obvious isomorphism between lists and linear orders given <br>
by interpreting a list as a ranking of elements in descending order.</p>
<p>An efficient O(n log n) algorithm to compute the swap distance is also provided <br>
via the connection to the number of inversions of a list, for which an efficient <br>
algorithm is already available in the AFP.</p>

<p>Linear orders as rankings<br>
Manuel Eberl</p>
<p>This entry formalises the obvious isomorphism between finite linear orders and <br>
lists, where the list in question is interpreted as a ranking, i.e. it lists the <br>
elements in descending order without repetition.</p>
<p>It also provides an executable algorithm to compute topological sortings, i.e. <br>
all rankings whose linear orders are extensions of a given relation.</p>

<p>The Impossibility of Strategyproof Rank Aggregation<br>
Manuel Eberl and Patrick Lederer</p>
<p>In Social Choice Theory, a social welfare function (SWF) is a function that <br>
takes a collection of individual preferences on some set of alternatives and <br>
returns an aggregated preference relation.</p>
<p>More formally: Consider finite sets of agents N = {1,...,n} and alternatives A = <br>
{x1,...,xm}. The input of an SWF is an n-tuple of rankings (i.e. linear orders) <br>
of A, and its output is a ranking of A as well.</p>
<p>Various desirable properties on SWFs can be defined:</p>
<p>Anonymity: The SWF is invariant under permutation of the agents.</p>
<p>Unanimity: If all voters prefer x over y, then x is preferred over y in the <br>
output ranking as well.</p>
<p>Majority consistency: If there exists a ranking x1,...,xm such that for every i <br>
&lt; j, the alternative xi is preferred over xj by more than half of the agents, <br>
that ranking must be returned.</p>
<p>Kemeny strategyproofness: Strategic voting is not possible for a single agent, <br>
i.e. no agent can achieve a result more aligned with their own preferences by <br>
lying about them.</p>
<p>This entry contains two impossibility results for SWFs with alternatives and agents:</p>
<p>There exists no anonymous, unanimous, and Kemeny-strategyproof SWF for m &gt;= <br>
5 and n even or for m = 4 and n a multiple of 4.<br>
     There exists no majority-consistent and Kemeny-strategyproof SWF for m = 4 <br>
and n &gt;= 3 or m &gt;= 4 and n : {9,11,13,15} Un {17,...}.</p>
<p>For some of the base cases, SAT solving is used by letting specialised <br>
automation prove a large number of clauses, translating to the DIMACS format, <br>
and importing a proof pre-generated by an external SAT solver using Lammich's <br>
GRAT format.</p>
