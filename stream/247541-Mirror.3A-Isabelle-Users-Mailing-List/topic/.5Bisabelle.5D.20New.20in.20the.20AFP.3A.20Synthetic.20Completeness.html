Synthetic Completeness<br>
Asta Halkjær From</p>
<p>In this work, I provide an abstract framework for proving the completeness of a <br>
logical calculus using the synthetic method. The synthetic method is based on <br>
maximal consistent saturated sets (MCSs). A set of formulas is consistent (with <br>
respect to the calculus) when we cannot derive a contradiction from it. It is <br>
maximally consistent when it contains every formula that is consistent with it. <br>
For logics where it is relevant, it is saturated when it contains a witness for <br>
every existential formula. To prove completeness using these maximal consistent <br>
saturated sets, we prove a truth lemma: every formula in an MCS has a satisfying <br>
model. Here, Hintikka sets provide a useful stepping stone. These can be seen as <br>
characterizations of the MCSs based on simple subformula conditions rather than <br>
via the calculus. We then prove that every Hintikka set gives rise to a <br>
satisfying model and that MCSs are Hintikka sets. Now, assume a valid formula <br>
cannot be derived. Then its negation must be consistent and therefore <br>
satisfiable. This contradicts validity and the original formula must be derivable.</p>
<p>To start, I build maximal consistent saturated sets for any logic that satisfies <br>
a small set of assumptions. I do this using a transfinite version of <br>
Lindenbaum's lemma, which allows me to support languages of any cardinality. I <br>
then prove useful abstract results about derivations and refutations as they <br>
relate to MCSs. Finally, I show how Hintikka sets can be derived from the <br>
logic's semantics, outlining one way to prove the required truth lemma.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the versatility of the framework, I instantiate it with five <br>
different examples. The formalization contains soundness and completeness <br>
results for: a propositional tableau calculus, a propositional sequent calculus, <br>
an axiomatic system for modal logic, a labelled natural deduction system for <br>
hybrid logic and a natural deduction system for first-order logic. The tableau <br>
example uses custom Hintikka sets based on the calculus, but the other four <br>
examples derive them from the semantics in the style of the framework. The <br>
hybrid and first-order logic examples rely on saturated MCSs. This places <br>
requirements on the cardinalities of their languages to ensure that there are <br>
enough witnesses available. In both cases, the type of witnesses must be <br>
infinite and have cardinality at least that of the type of <br>
propositional/predicate symbols.</p>
