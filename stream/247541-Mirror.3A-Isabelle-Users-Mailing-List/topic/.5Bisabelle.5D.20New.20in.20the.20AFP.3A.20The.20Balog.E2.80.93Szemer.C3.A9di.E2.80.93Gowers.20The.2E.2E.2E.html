Dear all,</p>
<p>I'd like to announce a new AFP entry.</p>

<p>The Balog–Szemerédi–Gowers Theorem <br>
  by Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki, Mantas Bakšys and Chelsea Edmonds</p>
<p>We formalise the Balog–Szemerédi–Gowers Theorem, a profound result in additive<br>
combinatorics which played a central role in Gowers's proof deriving the first<br>
effective bounds for Szemerédi's Theorem. The proof is of great mathematical<br>
interest given that it involves an interplay between different mathematical<br>
areas, namely applications of graph theory and probability theory to additive<br>
combinatorics involving algebraic objects. This interplay is what made the<br>
process of the formalisation, for which we had to develop formalisations of new<br>
background material in the aforementioned areas, more rich and technically<br>
challenging. We demonstrate how locales, Isabelle’s module system, can be<br>
employed to handle such interplays. To treat the graph-theoretic aspects of the<br>
proof, we make use of a new, more general undirected graph theory library<br>
developed recently by Chelsea Edmonds, which is both flexible and extensible.<br>
For the formalisation we followed a proof presented in the 2022 lecture notes by<br>
Timothy Gowers Introduction to Additive Combinatorics for Part III of the<br>
Mathematics Tripos taught at the University of Cambridge. In addition to the<br>
main theorem, which, following our source, is formulated for difference sets, we<br>
also give an alternative version for sumsets which required a formalisation of<br>
an auxiliary triangle inequality following a proof by Yufei Zhao from his book<br>
Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics . We moreover formalise a few additional<br>
results in additive combinatorics that are not used in the proof of the main<br>
theorem. This is the first formalisation of the Balog–Szemerédi–Gowers Theorem<br>
in any proof assistant to our knowledge.</p>
