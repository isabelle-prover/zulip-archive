The CHSH inequality: Tsirelson's upper-bound and other results<br>
  by Mnacho Echenim, Mehdi Mhalla, and Coraline Mori</p>
<p>The CHSH inequality, named after Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt, was used by<br>
Alain Aspect to prove experimentally that Einstein's hypothesis stating that<br>
quantum mechanics could be defined using local hidden variables was incorrect.<br>
The CHSH inequality is based on a setting in which an experiment consisting of<br>
two separate parties performing joint measurements is run several times, and a<br>
score is derived from these runs. If the local hidden variable hypothesis had<br>
been correct, this score would have been bounded by 2, but a suitable choice of<br>
observables in a quantum setting permits to violate this inequality when<br>
measuring the Bell state; this is the result that Aspect obtained<br>
experimentally. Tsirelson answered the question of how large this violation<br>
could be by proving that in the quantum setting, the highest score that can be<br>
obtained when running this experiment is 2 * sqrt(2). Along with elementary<br>
results on density matrices which represent quantum states in the finite<br>
dimensional setting, we formalize Tsirelson's result and summarize the main<br>
results on the CHSH score:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Under the local hidden variable hypothesis, this score admits 2 as an<br>
   upper-bound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the density matrix under consideration is separable, the upper-bound<br>
   cannot be violated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When one of the parties in the experiment performs measures using commuting<br>
   observables, this upper-bound remains valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, the upper-bound of this score is 2 * sqrt(2), regardless of the<br>
   observables that are used and the quantum state that is measured, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This upper-bound is reached for a suitable choice of observables when<br>
   measuring the Bell state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
