Unbounded Separation Logic<br>
Thibault Dardinier</p>
<p>Many separation logics support fractional permissions to distinguish between <br>
read and write access to a heap location, for instance, to allow concurrent <br>
reads while enforcing exclusive writes. Fractional permissions extend to <br>
composite assertions such as (co)inductive predicates and magic wands by <br>
allowing those to be multiplied by a fraction. Typical separation logic proofs <br>
require that this multiplication has three key properties: it needs to <br>
distribute over assertions, it should permit fractions to be factored out from <br>
assertions, and two fractions of the same assertion should be combinable into <br>
one larger fraction. Existing formal semantics incorporating fractional <br>
assertions into a separation logic define multiplication semantically (via <br>
models), resulting in a semantics in which distributivity and combinability do <br>
not hold for key resource assertions such as magic wands, and fractions cannot <br>
be factored out from a separating conjunction. By contrast, existing automatic <br>
separation logic verifiers define multiplication syntactically, resulting in a <br>
different semantics for which it is unknown whether distributivity and <br>
combinability hold for all assertions. In this entry (which accompanies an <br>
OOPSLA'22 paper), we present and formalize an unbounded version of separation <br>
logic, a novel semantics for separation logic assertions that allows states to <br>
hold more than a full permission to a heap location during the evaluation of an <br>
assertion. By reimposing upper bounds on the permissions held per location at <br>
statement boundaries, we retain key properties of separation logic, in <br>
particular, we prove that the frame rule still holds. We also prove that our <br>
assertion semantics unifies semantic and syntactic multiplication and thereby <br>
reconciles the discrepancy between separation logic theory and tools and enjoys <br>
distributivity, factorisability, and combinability.</p>
