<p>Dear fellow Isabelle users,</p>
<p>(Larry has already kindly pointed to some posts/videos related to this<br>
project a few days ago.  This posting provides a bit more information.)</p>
<p>At AWS re:Invent 2025 in Las Vegas, we announced the AWS Nitro Isolation<br>
Engine [1, 2, 3], a formally verified enhancement to the AWS Nitro System<br>
that enforces isolation between virtual machines hosted on AWS's new<br>
Graviton5-based EC2 instances.</p>
<p>Nitro Isolation Engine represents a significant deployment of mechanized<br>
proof in production infrastructure, and we therefore wanted to bring this<br>
to the attention of the formal methods and programming languages<br>
communities. This work builds directly on decades of advances in<br>
interactive theorem proving, program verification, and programming<br>
languages theory, alongside landmark projects—such as, seL4 [4], CertiKOS<br>
[5], SeKVM [6], and many others—that were inspirations for this work.<br>
What is Nitro Isolation Engine?</p>
<p>Nitro Isolation Engine is a small, trusted computing base written in Rust<br>
that sits beneath the AWS Nitro Hypervisor, providing a security isolation<br>
boundary between the hypervisor and guest virtual machines, and between<br>
co-tenanted guest virtual machines. The Nitro Isolation Engine controls the<br>
critical hardware features required for isolating customer workloads,<br>
primarily control of Stage Two translation tables.<br>
The verification effort</p>
<p>Nitro Isolation Engine was designed with verification in mind from the<br>
first line of code. Nitro Isolation Engine is subject to AWS’s existing<br>
rigorous engineering practices, including the deployment of<br>
property-based-testing and lightweight formal methods, for example the Kani<br>
bounded model checker for Rust [7].</p>
<p>Building atop this foundation, we have specified and verified the<br>
correctness of Nitro Isolation Engine in Isabelle/HOL [8]. Our model and<br>
proofs consist of around 260,000 lines of machine-checked models and<br>
proofs. Specifically, we have proved:</p>
<p>- *Functional correctness: *Nitro Isolation Engine behaves as specified<br>
   for all operations: virtual machine creation, memory mapping, instruction<br>
   and data abort handling, and so on. As corollaries of our total<br>
   verification style, we have also proven memory-safety, termination, and<br>
   absence of runtime errors, providing our modelling assumptions are accurate.</p>
<p>- <em>Confidentiality</em>: We prove a noninterference-style property<br>
   demonstrating the confidentiality of guest virtual machine states,<br>
   formalized as indistinguishability preservation up-to permitted flows of<br>
   declassified information out of a guest.</p>
<p>- <em>Integrity</em>: The integrity of guest virtual machine state is<br>
   formalized as a safety property, showing that the private state of one<br>
   virtual machine is unaffected by operations modifying another distinct<br>
   virtual machine.</p>
<p>In addition, we have applied Iris [9] and Verus [10] to prove the<br>
correctness of the Nitro Isolation Engine’s concurrency primitives,<br>
including ticket locks, mutexes, and rendezvous barriers.</p>
<p>For functional verification, we defined μRust, a restricted subset of Rust<br>
expressive enough to write Nitro Isolation Engine but amenable to formal<br>
reasoning and embedded its semantics into Isabelle/HOL. Specifications are<br>
written in separation logic, and proofs proceed via weakest precondition<br>
calculus with custom automation. We have made our verification<br>
infrastructure open source as the AutoCorrode library [11] for<br>
Isabelle/HOL, which may be of independent interest.</p>

<p>Hey, just wanted to extend a really big congratulation to you all. <br>
Knowing from personal experience what it takes to pull something like <br>
this off, this is a really impressive effort. Well done guys!</p>
