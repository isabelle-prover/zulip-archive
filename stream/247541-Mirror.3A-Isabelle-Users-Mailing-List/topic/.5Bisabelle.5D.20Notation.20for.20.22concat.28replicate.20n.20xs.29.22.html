<p>From: Tobias Nipkow &lt;<a href="mailto:nipkow@in.tum.de">nipkow@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
The expression "concat(replicate n xs)" occurs frequently in the area of formal <br>
languages / combinatorics on words. That is why Stepan Holub and friends have <br>
defined an infix operator</p>
<p>"xs \&lt;^sup&gt;@n = concat(replicate n xs)"</p>
<p>Because it has also cropped up in other places, I would like to define this <br>
operator already in List (i.e. Main) and am wondering about the syntax:</p>
<p>^@ or ^^</p>
<p>The latter exists and is overloaded, which may require type annotations in a few <br>
places but means it is more `standard'.</p>
<p>Any feedback on this proposal?</p>

Yes, I fully understand that instantiation policy should be cautious and <br>
conservative, although I wonder whether concatenation is not the only <br>
reasonable instance of monoid multiplication for lists. My point was <br>
that full instantiation would solve Tobias's question about concat <br>
replicate in a simple and natural way.</p>

After some more discussions I/we decided against the type class version of the <br>
list power operator: although having (^) is attractive, it would also give us 1 <br>
and (*) on lists (defined as [] and (@)). Although mathemtically reasonable, it <br>
is problematic because lists and their notation are so basic. Thus I have opted <br>
for the overloaded ^^ operator that will be available as a separate theory.</p>

<p>Yes, I fully understand that instantiation policy should be cautious and <br>
conservative, although I wonder whether concatenation is not the only <br>
reasonable instance of monoid multiplication for lists. My point was that full <br>
instantiation would solve Tobias's question about concat replicate in a simple <br>
and natural way.</p>

Makes sense. I support your decision by roughly 51:49.</p>

<p>After some more discussions I/we decided against the type class <br>
version of the list power operator: although having (^) is attractive, <br>
it would also give us 1 and (*) on lists (defined as [] and (@)). <br>
Although mathemtically reasonable, it is problematic because lists and <br>
their notation are so basic. Thus I have opted for the overloaded ^^ <br>
operator that will be available as a separate theory.</p>

<p>Please note that I have very recently defined ^^ on lists and ported <br>
some of Stepan's lemmas to List. However, this is not a final <br>
decision. I would be just as happy with ^. In fact, I agree that this <br>
subtheory (with ^ or ^^) should go into a separate theory. I would <br>
put it into the AFP for visibility (and because List-Index is already <br>
there).</p>
<p>From the previous discussion it seems to me there should be a <br>
separate theory List_Power that defines ^ on lists. Same as Stepan, I <br>
would argue it is the only reasonable interpretation for ^ on lists. <br>
Moreover, there is still ^^ for other interpretations.</p>
<p>Any objections?</p>
