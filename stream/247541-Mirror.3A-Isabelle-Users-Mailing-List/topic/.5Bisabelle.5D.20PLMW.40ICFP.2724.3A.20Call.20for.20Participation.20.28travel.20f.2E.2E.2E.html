ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) at ICFP 24,<br>
Milan, Italy</p>
<p>Workshop: Monday, September 2, 2024<br>
Website: <a href="https://icfp24.sigplan.org/home/PLMW-ICFP-2024">https://icfp24.sigplan.org/home/PLMW-ICFP-2024</a></p>
<p>PLMW is a workshop co-located with ICFP 2024 (the International Conference<br>
on Functional Programming) in Milan, Italy, from September 2-7.</p>
<p>The purpose of this mentoring workshop is to encourage graduate students<br>
and senior undergraduate students to pursue careers in programming language<br>
research. This workshop will bring together world leaders in programming<br>
languages research and teaching from academia and industry to help students<br>
imagine how they might contribute to our research community. Topics will<br>
range from the abstract (e.g., what is PL research and how does one become<br>
involved in it) to the concrete (e.g., how to navigate an academic<br>
conference, how to pick a research area) as well as technical talks on<br>
cutting-edge topics.</p>
<p>We especially encourage women and underrepresented minority students, and<br>
people with disabilities to attend PLMW.</p>
<p>This workshop is part of the activities surrounding ICFP, and takes place<br>
the day before the main conference. One goal of the workshop is to make the<br>
ICFP conference more accessible to newcomers. We hope that participants<br>
will stay through the entire conference.</p>
<p>Note that ICFP and PLMW are planned to be largely in-person events. While<br>
we recognize that travel to conferences is not easy for everyone, we do<br>
hope you will be able to join us in person to get the most out of the<br>
conference and its community-building aspects.</p>
<p>A number of sponsors have generously donated scholarship funds for<br>
qualified students to attend PLMW. These scholarships can cover expenses<br>
(airfare, hotel, and registration fees) for attendance at both the workshop<br>
and the ICFP conference.</p>
<p>Students attending this year will get one year free student membership of<br>
SIGPLAN, unless they prefer to opt out during their application.</p>
<p>The workshop registration is open to all. Students with alternative sources<br>
of funding are welcome as well.</p>
