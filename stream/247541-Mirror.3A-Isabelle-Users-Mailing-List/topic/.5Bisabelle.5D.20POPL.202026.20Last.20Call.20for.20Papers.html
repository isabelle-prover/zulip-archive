PACMPL Issue POPL 2026 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming<br>
languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical. Authors<br>
of<br>
papers published in PACMPL Issue POPL 2026 will be invited to present their<br>
work<br>
in the POPL conference in January 2026, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN,<br>
in<br>
cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.</p>

<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>Conference Location: Rennes, France</p>
<p>Conference Dates: January 11-17, 2026</p>
<p>General Chair: Sandrine Blazy, University of Rennes</p>
<p>Program Chair: Suresh Jagannathan, Purdue University</p>
<p>Program Committee:<br>
<a href="https://popl26.sigplan.org/committee/POPL-2026-popl-research-papers-program-committee">https://popl26.sigplan.org/committee/POPL-2026-popl-research-papers-program-committee</a></p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion of<br>
all<br>
aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical<br>
and<br>
experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to<br>
experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring<br>
contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or<br>
application of programming languages.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
<p>The Review Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each<br>
submission<br>
as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general POPL audience.<br>
All<br>
papers will be judged on significance, originality, relevance, correctness,<br>
and<br>
clarity. Each paper must explain its scientific contribution in both<br>
general and<br>
technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it<br>
is<br>
significant, and comparing it with previous work. Advice on writing<br>
technical<br>
papers can be found on the SIGPLAN author information page:<br>
<a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/</a>.</p>
<p>Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly<br>
enforced.</p>
<h3>Double-Blind Reviewing Process</h3>
<p>POPL 2026 will use a full double-blind reviewing process (similar to the one<br>
used in recent years (POPL 2023 - 2025) but different from the lightweight<br>
double-blind process used before then). This means that identities of<br>
authors<br>
will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance<br>
decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted<br>
papers.<br>
The use of full double-blind reviewing has several consequences for authors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Submissions</strong>: Authors must omit their names and institutions from their<br>
  paper submissions. In addition, references to authors’ own prior work<br>
should<br>
  be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but<br>
rather<br>
  “We build on the work of …”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supplementary material</strong>: Authors are permitted to provide supplementary<br>
  material (e.g., detailed proofs, proof scripts, system implementations, or<br>
  experimental data) along with their submission, which reviewers may (but<br>
are<br>
  not required to) examine. This material may take the form of a single<br>
file,<br>
  such as a PDF or a tarball. Authors must fully anonymize any supplementary<br>
  material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Author response</strong>: In responding to reviews, authors should not say<br>
anything<br>
  that reveals their identity, since author identities will not be revealed<br>
to<br>
  reviewers at that stage of the reviewing process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dissemination of work under submission</strong>: Authors are welcome to<br>
disseminate<br>
  their ideas and post draft versions of their paper(s) on their personal<br>
  website, institutional repository, or arXiv (reviewers will be asked to<br>
turn<br>
  off arXiv notifications during the review period). But authors should not<br>
take<br>
  steps that would almost certainly reveal their identities to members of<br>
the<br>
  Program Committee, e.g., directly contacting PC members or publicizing the<br>
  work on widely-visible social media or major mailing lists used by the<br>
  community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of the above restrictions is to help the Program Committee and<br>
external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to<br>
make<br>
it impossible for them to discover the authors’ identities if they were to<br>
try.<br>
In particular, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens<br>
the<br>
quality of the submission.</p>
<p>However, there are occasionally cases where adhering to the above<br>
restrictions<br>
is truly difficult or impossible for one reason or another. In such cases,<br>
the<br>
authors should contact the Program Chair to discuss the situation and how to<br>
handle it.</p>
<p>The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing addresses many common scenarios and<br>
answers<br>
many common questions about this topic. But there remain many grey areas and<br>
trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind<br>
rules<br>
or you encounter a complex case that is not clearly covered by the FAQ,<br>
please<br>
contact the Program Chair for guidance.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Process</h3>
<p>POPL 2026 will have five Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor<br>
reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not<br>
enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.</p>
<p>As in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to<br>
reviews, as indicated in the Important Dates table. Responses are optional.<br>
A<br>
response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews;<br>
in<br>
particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will<br>
write a<br>
short reaction to these author responses.</p>
<p>The Review Committee (RC) will discuss papers electronically, and will use<br>
synchronous virtual meetings to discuss any papers for which there is<br>
disagreement among reviewers, in some cases soliciting additional input from<br>
other experts in the committee. There is no formal External Review<br>
Committee,<br>
though experts outside the committee may be consulted for some papers.<br>
Reviews<br>
will be accompanied by a short summary of the reasons behind the committee’s<br>
decision with the goal of clarifying the reasons behind the decision.</p>
<p>To conform with ACM requirements for journal publication, all POPL papers<br>
will<br>
be conditionally accepted; authors will be required to submit a short<br>
description of the changes made to the final version of the paper,<br>
including how<br>
the changes address any requirements imposed by the Review Committee. That<br>
the<br>
changes are sufficient will be confirmed by the original reviewers prior to<br>
acceptance to POPL. Authors of conditionally accepted papers must submit a<br>
satisfactory revision to the Review Committee by the requested deadline or<br>
risk<br>
rejection.</p>
<p>For additional information about the reviewing process, see: <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/POPL/Principles/">Principles of
POPL</a>, a presentation<br>
of<br>
the underlying organizational and reviewing policies for POPL. For POPL<br>
2026,<br>
policies specified in this Call for Papers supersede those in the<br>
Principles of<br>
POPL document.</p>
<h3>Submission Site Information</h3>
<p>The submission site is <a href="https://popl26.hotcrp.com">https://popl26.hotcrp.com</a>.</p>
<p>Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last<br>
submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline. The submission<br>
site<br>
requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and<br>
potential<br>
conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will<br>
need to be approved by the Program Chair (as this kind of change potentially<br>
undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).</p>
<p>The submission deadline is 11:59PM July 10, 2025 anywhere on earth (AOE):<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth</a></p>
<h3>Conflicts of Interest</h3>
<p>For each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare<br>
all<br>
potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission.<br>
This<br>
includes marking PC conflicts as well as “Other Conflicts (external)”. A<br>
conflict caught late in the reviewing process leads to a voided review<br>
which may<br>
be infeasible to replace.</p>
<p>Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D.,<br>
post-doc; forever), between an author and a co-author (papers and<br>
proposals; for<br>
two years), between people at the same institution (branches of large<br>
companies<br>
or different locations of research institutes are considered to be the same<br>
institution; for two years after leaving an institution), between people<br>
with<br>
financial conflicts of interest, and between friends or relatives.</p>
<p>If a possible reviewer does not meet the above criteria, please do not<br>
identify<br>
him/her as conflicted. Doing so could be viewed as an attempt to prevent a<br>
qualified, but possibly skeptical reviewer from reviewing your paper. If you<br>
nevertheless believe that a reviewer who does not meet the above criteria is<br>
conflicted, or if you are unsure about a possible conflict, you may<br>
identify the<br>
person and send a note to the PC Chair. Declaring a spurious conflict with<br>
the<br>
aim of excluding otherwise qualified reviewers can be grounds for desk<br>
rejection.</p>
<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>Prior to the paper submission deadline, authors should upload their full<br>
anonymized paper. Here are some key requirements concerning paper<br>
submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each paper should have no more than **25 pages of text, excluding<br>
  bibliography**, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the <code>acmart</code> LaTeX<br>
  class with <code>acmsmall</code> option). It is a single-column page layout with a<br>
10 pt<br>
  font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent POPL page<br>
layouts. In<br>
  this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in<br>
  (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a<br>
larger<br>
  text block) is grounds for summary rejection. The PACMPL template for<br>
LaTeX<br>
  can be found at the <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/">SIGPLAN author information
  page</a>, and further information<br>
  about PACMPL submissions can be found on the [PACMPL author guidelines<br>
