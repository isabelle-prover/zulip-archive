<p>The entry in question is "Padic_Field", and the theory that is affected most <br>
severely is "Padic_Field_Powers". We talked about this entry quite a bit when <br>
it was first submitted three years ago. Back then the performance problems <br>
were so severe I was wondering whether we could even accept it.</p>
<p>The entire entry is still pretty slow for what it is. But it's not as <br>
excessive as it once was. I asked the author to try to reduce the context <br>
switches as much as possible and that already helped a lot. But I also think <br>
some of the other performance tuning you did to Isabelle since then also helped.</p>
<p>As it stands now, there are still two "context" commands in there that take <br>
about 5 s (elapsed) on my machine, namely in line 41 and line 10404. The <br>
"lemma" command on line 2837 and the subsequent "blast" call also take about 2 <br>
seconds each, presumably due to the context switch induced by "(in <br>
padic_fields)". As I recall, this used to be almost an order of magnitude worse.</p>
<p>Of course, 2 or 5 seconds is not dramatic. But in a development that uses <br>
locales quite a bit, these numbers accumulate to an extent that makes working <br>
with such a development interactively (especially during refactoring) very <br>
annoying.</p>

<p>Thanks for the detailed report. I have looked around a bit in that session: it <br>
requires more work to understand its uses of locales and potential problems of <br>
that infrastructure (or the application).</p>
<p>I am also including measurements from the past two years, always on the same <br>
hardware: it shows that nothing has really changed so far.</p>

Sorting in the order of the build date, I get the following. It is a bit jagged, and the maximum value of timing_cpu is 777000.</p>

<p>The build_date is somewhat accidental. Relevant is the pull_date, i.e. the <br>
date when a the nightly-build daemon has first seen a certain changeset (via <br>
"hg pull").</p>
