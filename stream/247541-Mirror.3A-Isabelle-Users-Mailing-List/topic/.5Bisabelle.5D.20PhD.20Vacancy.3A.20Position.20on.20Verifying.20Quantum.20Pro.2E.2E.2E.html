<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
[Apologies for multiple copies.]</p>
<p>We are looking for applicants for the PhD project</p>
<p>“Towards Zero-Defect Quantum Programs”</p>
<p>at RWTH Aachen University.</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to develop methods for statically analysing <br>
programs intended for near-term quantum computers by combining <br>
techniques from the verification of probabilistic programs and the <br>
verification of quantum programs. This shall enable developers on <br>
quantum hardware to drastically reduce the amount of testing and <br>
simulation required, and to detect errors early in the program design <br>
and to understand them more easily, thus streamlining the software <br>
development process and significantly reducing testing and simulation <br>
costs. A particular focus will be on near-term systems with realistic <br>
error models (NISQ), and on use-cases from practice.</p>
<p>The project is a cooperation between the Chair of Quantum Information <br>
Systems and the Software Modeling and Verification (MOVES) group at RWTH <br>
Aachen University and will be jointly supervised by Joost-Pieter Katoen <br>
and Dominique Unruh.</p>
<p><em>Application deadline:</em> September 25, 23:59 (AoE)</p>
<p><em>Required profile.</em> Candidates must have (or soon obtain) a master <br>
degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics or related area and <br>
have completed their studies with excellent grades. You should have <br>
interest in performing original, highly competitive scientific research, <br>
publishing your results in top conferences and scientific journals. <br>
Self-motivation and the ability to work both independently and as a team <br>
player in local and international research groups are expected. Fluency <br>
in English is required; proficiency in German is helpful but not <br>
compulsory.</p>
<p><em>What do we offer?</em> We offer a stimulating international research <br>
environment, the possibility to participate in highly competitive and <br>
interdisciplinary research and the opportunity to involve students in <br>
your research through project work. Doctoral researchers have a status <br>
as employee with a salary according to the German federal employee scale <br>
TV-L E13; the exact salary is subject to your family situation. The <br>
duration of the position is four years.</p>
