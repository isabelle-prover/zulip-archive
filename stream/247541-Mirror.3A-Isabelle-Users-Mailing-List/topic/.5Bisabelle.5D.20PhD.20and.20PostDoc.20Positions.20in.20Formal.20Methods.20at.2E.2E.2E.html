<p>From: Bernhard Beckert &lt;<a href="mailto:beckert@kit.edu">beckert@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
We are hiring:</p>
<p>PhD Researchers and Postdoctoral Researchers<br>
    in applied formal methods for software and algorithm engineering</p>
<p><a href="https://formal.kastel.kit.edu/offers/jobs.phtml">https://formal.kastel.kit.edu/offers/jobs.phtml</a></p>
<p>Are you ready to embark on a thrilling scientific journey bringing together <br>
the precision of rigorous formal foundations with the latest advances in <br>
software and algorithm engineering research? Then apply now to shape the <br>
future of formal verification in an excellent working environment.</p>
<p>We are delighted to announce several Ph.D. and PostDoc positions in the group <br>
Application-oriented Formal Verification. The group is part of the Institute <br>
for Information Security and Dependability (KASTEL) and the KIT Department of <br>
Informatics, one of the leading Computer Science Departments in Germany.</p>
<p>Within the DFG CRC 1608: Convide – Consistency in the View-Based Development <br>
of Cyber-Physical Systems, we plan to investigate the application of formal <br>
methods to establish, exploit, and recover consistency in domain-spanning <br>
models within the Model-Driven Development of cyber-physical systems.<br>
In the Helmholtz Pilot Programme: KiKIT – Kerninformatik we will explore how <br>
formal refinement approaches empower us to tackle the complexity of <br>
sophisticated models in a modular and collaborative manner. By leveraging <br>
different formal techniques and abstractions, we aim to integrate diverse <br>
approaches with a particular focus on cyber-physical systems.</p>
<p>We are seeking PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers with the following <br>
qualifications:<br>
• a very good master's degree (MSc) in Computer Science or a related field <br>
(PhD candidates) or a PhD degree in computer science, software engineering, <br>
systems engineering, or a related discipline (postdocs)<br>
• a strong background in formal methods,<br>
• ideally a background in software engineering and/or algorithm engineering,<br>
• a strong commitment to research: independent work ethic and a passion for <br>
working independently and in teams on challenging research questions,<br>
• excellent communication skills, both written and verbal,<br>
• proficiency in English, German language skills are an advantage.</p>
<p>The positions will be full-time employee positions at KIT (TV-L E13), offering <br>
a competitive salary starting at approximately 4200-4800 €/month (before <br>
taxes). We provide an excellent working environment within a vibrant and <br>
internationally recognized research group.</p>
<p>Benefits from a position at KIT:<br>
• Graduate school within the CRC Convide<br>
• Access to a network of leading scientists, computer scientists, and engineers.<br>
• Opportunities to collaborate with interdisciplinary teams working on complex <br>
software-intensive technical systems.<br>
• Varied job responsibilities and ample opportunities for further training and <br>
professional development.<br>
• Flexible working time models to ensure a healthy work-life balance.<br>
• Subsidy for the BW job ticket and access to on-site casino/cafeteria facilities.</p>

To apply, please send your application documents as a single PDF file, <br>
including a cover letter, a curriculum vitae, references, thesis, list of <br>
publications (if applicable), academic transcripts etc.<br>
We strongly encourage applications from women to ensure balanced <br>
representation in our team. Equally qualified applicants with recognized <br>
severe disabilities will receive preferential consideration.<br>
Join us in shaping the future of formal verification and model-driven <br>
development. Take this opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking research <br>
and make a meaningful impact on the development of sustainable technical products.</p>
<p>Application until: 31 August 2023 (1st round, later applications will also be <br>
considered)</p>
<p>Apply now and be part of a dynamic research environment at KIT!</p>
