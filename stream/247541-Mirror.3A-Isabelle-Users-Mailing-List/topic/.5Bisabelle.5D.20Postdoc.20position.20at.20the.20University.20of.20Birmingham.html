Dear all,</p>
<p>We would like to invite applications for an up to 3 years fully-funded<br>
postdoctoral position within the School of Computer Science at the<br>
University of Birmingham (see below for details on how to apply).</p>
<p>The successful candidate will contribute to an EPSRC-funded project aiming<br>
at designing and formally verifying distributed systems, in particular<br>
Byzantine fault-tolerant distributed systems as used for example in<br>
blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The start date is flexible, ideally early 2023.</p>
<p>The environment:</p>
<hr>
<p>The School of Computer Science has large and thriving Theory and Security<br>
research groups. Among our research interests related to this project are<br>
for example:</p>
<p>- Formal verification<br>
   - Proof assistants<br>
   - Model checking<br>
   - Blockchain Technology<br>
   - Security &amp; Privacy</p>
<p>Both groups are very active, organising regular seminars, informal<br>
meetings, and actively participating in many events such as the Midlands<br>
Graduate School or the Cyber Security PhD Winter School. For more<br>
information see<br>

<p>From: Harry Butterworth &lt;<a href="mailto:heb1001@gmail.com">heb1001@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
No doubt you’ve got something else in mind but…</p>
<p>If you write a layer of software to create a BFT implementation of the seL4<br>
abstract specification on top of a cluster of seL4 nodes and then do a<br>
refinement proof that your new layer implements the seL4 abstract spec,<br>
assuming the constituent nodes also implement the abstract spec, then<br>
you’ll create a useful bit of infrastructure that will be compatible with<br>
the seL4 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Anything written to run on seL4 could be migrated to your platform to get<br>
Byzantine fault tolerance with very little incremental programming effort.</p>
<p>You could size the project based on the published seL4 metrics and the<br>
sizes of existing BFT platforms.  It’s quite a lot of work to do everything<br>
but it’s plausible to get an unverified BFT platform working with a few PY<br>
of effort.</p>
<p>One advantage of this approach is that you’ll immediately start with an<br>
existing formal spec of the API your project will need to implement so you<br>
won’t waste time building the wrong thing.</p>
<p>There was an earlier seL4 replication project that might help.  I was<br>
looking out for it but have now lost track of whether or not it was ever<br>
open sourced.</p>
<p>I expect there are multiple ways to implement the required software layer<br>
but it would certainly be possible to use something blockchain-like in<br>
there for the BFT distributed consensus required to manage the consistency<br>
of the replicas.</p>
<p>I thought about doing this for fun a little while ago.  One of the<br>
difficulties was that the seL4 tool chain didn’t support concurrency.  Some<br>
kind of solution for that would be required for the refinement proof for<br>
the distributed system: concurrency is inherent and must be modeled in<br>
order to prove that it doesn’t cause a violation of the spec.</p>
