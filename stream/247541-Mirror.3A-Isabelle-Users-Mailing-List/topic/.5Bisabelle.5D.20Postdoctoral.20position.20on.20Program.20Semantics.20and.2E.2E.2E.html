<strong> Apologies if you receive multiple copies of these open positions </strong></p>
<p>A postdoctoral position in program semantics and verification is open at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) under the supervision of Prof. David Sanan.</p>
<p>The project aims to minimize the gap between formal verification and efficient industrial applications. Specifically, we focus on constructing a verification framework for software using deductive reasoning, and on the formalization of smart contract semantics, with special attention to the Solidity language.</p>
<p>The candidate will work on formalizing programming language semantics, constructing a framework for scalable verification, and building mechanisms for automatic reasoning on Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>Qualifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Ph.D. in Computer Science, Mathematics, or a closely related discipline.</li>
<li>Experience in formal methods and formal verification. Experience in Isabelle theorem prover is preferred.</li>
<li>Familiar with program semantics and program logic, including Hoare Logic and Separation Logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>SIT offers highly competitive salaries and is situated in Singapore, a multicultural English-speaking city. Singapore offers high-quality education and healthcare at all levels and very low tax rates.</p>
<p>The position is available full-time for one and a half years in the first instance, with the possibility of renewal(s).</p>
<p>Starting date: as soon as possible.</p>
<p>To apply, send an email with the CV to <a href="mailto:david.miguel@singaporetech.edu.sg">david.miguel@singaporetech.edu.sg</a></p>
