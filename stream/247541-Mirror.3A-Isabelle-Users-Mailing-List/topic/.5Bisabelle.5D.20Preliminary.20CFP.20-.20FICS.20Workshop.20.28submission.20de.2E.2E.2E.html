<p>=== Preliminary Call for contributions ===</p>
<p>Workshop on Fixed Points in Computer Science<br>
19 &amp; 20 February 2024<br>
<a href="https://www.irif.fr/users/saurin/fics2024/index.html">https://www.irif.fr/users/saurin/fics2024/index.html</a></p>
<p>This year, FICS workshop (Workshop on Fixed Points in Computer Science) <br>
will take place in Naples on the 19th and 20th of February, 2024, <br>
affiliated with CSL 2024 (<a href="https://csl2024.github.io/Home/">https://csl2024.github.io/Home/</a>).</p>
<p>== About FICS workshop series ==</p>
<p>The goal is to bring together people from different subfields such as <br>
algebra/coalgebra, verification, logic, around the thematic of fixed <br>
points. Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of <br>
computer science. They are used to justify (co)recursive definitions and <br>
associated reasoning techniques. The construction and properties of <br>
fixed points have been investigated in many different settings such as: <br>
design and implementation of programming languages, logics, <br>
verification, databases.</p>
<p>== Scope ==</p>
<p>Topics include, but are not restricted to:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed points in algebra and coalgebra</li>
<li>fixed points in formal languages and automata</li>
<li>fixed points in game theory</li>
<li>fixed points in programming language semantics</li>
<li>fixed points in proofs</li>
<li>fixed points in the mu-calculus and modal logics</li>
<li>fixed points in process algebras and process calculi</li>
<li>fixed points in functional programming and type theory</li>
<li>fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits</li>
<li>
<p>fixed points in automated theorem proving, interactive theorem proving <br>
and logic programming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed points in finite model theory, descriptive complexity theory, <br>
and databases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed points in category theory for logic in computer science</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>== Important dates ==</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission deadline for short and extended abstracts: 1 December 2023;</li>
<li>Notification: 21 December 2023;</li>
<li>Workshop: 19 and 20 February 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>== Types of submissions ==</p>
<p>This year, we welcome two categories of submissions, short abstracts as <br>
well as extended abstracts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>short abstracts are abstracts of 3 to 5 pages, references included, <br>
describing the topic of the proposed contributed talk. They may contain <br>
(i) new completed results, (ii) work in progress or (iii) already <br>
(recently) published or submitted works. The submission can refer to a <br>
published paper or a preprint but the description given in the short <br>
abstract should be sufficiently detailed for the PC to judge the <br>
relevance of the proposed talk to the workshop program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extended abstracts are papers of 6 to 10 pages, references excluded, <br>
describing original results which have not been published nor are <br>
currently submitted elsewhere. The results must be presented in <br>
sufficient details to constitute a scientific publication. An appendix <br>
can provide additional details for the reviewer but will be read at the <br>
discretion of the reviewers. We plan to have formal proceedings for <br>
extended abstract, more details will be posted on FICS website and in <br>
forthcoming calls for contributions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both types of submissions will be handled via Easychair and will be <br>
peer-reviewed by the PC.</p>
<p>== Journal publication ==</p>
<p>Depending on the number and quality of submissions, we will plan a <br>
subsequent special issue of a journal, as often done for previous <br>
editions of the workshop.</p>
