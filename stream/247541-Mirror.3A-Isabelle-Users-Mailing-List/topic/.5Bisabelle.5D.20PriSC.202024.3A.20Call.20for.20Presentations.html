Call for Presentations: PriSC 2024 @ POPL 2024<br>
================================================</p>
<p>Secure compilation is an emerging field that puts together advances in<br>
security, programming languages, compilers, verification, systems,<br>
and hardware architectures in order to devise more secure compilation<br>
chains that eliminate many of today’s security vulnerabilities and<br>
that allow sound reasoning about security properties in the source<br>
language. For a concrete example, all modern languages provide a<br>
notion of structured control flow and an invoked procedure is<br>
expected to return to the right place. However, today’s compilation<br>
chains (compilers, linkers, loaders, runtime systems, hardware)<br>
cannot efficiently enforce this abstraction against linked low-level<br>
code, which can call and return to arbitrary instructions or smash<br>
the stack, blatantly violating the high-level abstraction. Other<br>
problems arise because today’s languages fail to specify security<br>
policies, such as data confidentiality, and the compilation chains<br>
thus fail to enforce them, especially against powerful side-channel<br>
attacks. The emerging secure compilation community aims to address<br>
such problems by identifying precise security goals and attacker<br>
models, designing more secure languages, devising efficient<br>
enforcement and mitigation mechanisms, and developing effective<br>
verification techniques for secure compilation chains.</p>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to identify interesting research<br>
directions and open challenges and to bring together researchers<br>
interested in working on building secure compilation chains, on<br>
developing proof techniques and verification tools, and on designing<br>
software or hardware enforcement mechanisms for secure compilation.</p>
<p>8th Workshop on Principles of Secure Compilation (PriSC 2024)<br>
=============================================================</p>
<p>The Workshop on Principles of Secure Compilation (PriSC) is an<br>
informal 1-day workshop without any proceedings. The goal is to bring<br>
together researchers interested in secure compilation and to identify<br>
interesting research directions and open challenges. The 8th edition<br>
of PriSC will be held on January 20, 2024 in London, United Kingdom<br>
together with the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming<br>
Languages (POPL) 2024.</p>
<p>Important Dates<br>
===============</p>
<ul>
<li>Thu 02 Nov 2023: Submission Deadline</li>
<li>Thu 07 Dec 2023: Acceptance Notification</li>
<li>Sat 20 Jan 2024: Workshop</li>
</ul>
<p>Presentation Proposals and Attending the Workshop<br>
=================================================</p>
<p>Anyone interested in presenting at the workshop should submit an<br>
extended abstract (up to 2 pages, details below) covering past,<br>
ongoing, or future work. Any topic that could be of interest to<br>
secure compilation is in scope. Secure compilation should be<br>
interpreted very broadly to include any work in security, programming<br>
languages, architecture, systems or their combination that can be<br>
leveraged to preserve security properties of programs when they are<br>
compiled or to eliminate low-level vulnerabilities. Presentations<br>
that provide a useful outside view or challenge the community are<br>
also welcome. This includes presentations on new attack vectors such<br>
as microarchitectural side-channels, whose defenses could benefit<br>
from compiler techniques.</p>
<p>Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attacker models for secure compiler chains.</li>
<li>
<p>Secure compiler properties: fully abstract compilation and similar<br>
properties, memory safety, control-flow integrity, preservation of<br>
safety, information flow and other (hyper-)properties against<br>
adversarial contexts, secure multi-language interoperability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure interaction between different programming languages: foreign<br>
function interfaces, gradual types, securely combining different<br>
memory management strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforcement mechanisms and low-level security primitives: static<br>
checking, program verification, typed assembly languages, reference<br>
monitoring, program rewriting, software-based isolation/hiding<br>
techniques (SFI, crypto-based, randomization-based,<br>
OS/hypervisor-based), security-oriented architectural features such<br>
as Intel’s SGX, MPX and MPK, capability machines, side-channel<br>
defenses, object capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental evaluation and applications of secure compilers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof methods relevant to compilation: (bi)simulation, logical<br>
relations, game semantics, trace semantics, multi-language semantics,<br>
embedded interpreters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal verification of secure compilation chains<br>
(protection mechanisms, compilers, linkers, loaders), machine-checked<br>
proofs, translation validation, property-based testing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Guidelines for Submitting Extended Abstracts<br>
============================================</p>
<p>Extended abstracts should be submitted in PDF format and not exceed 2<br>
pages (references not included). They should be formatted in<br>
two-column layout, 10pt font, and be printable on A4 and US Letter<br>
sized paper. We recommend using the new acmart LaTeX style in sigplan<br>
mode.</p>
<p>Submissions are not anonymous and should provide sufficient<br>
detail to be assessed by the program committee. Presentation at the<br>
workshop does not preclude publication elsewhere.</p>
