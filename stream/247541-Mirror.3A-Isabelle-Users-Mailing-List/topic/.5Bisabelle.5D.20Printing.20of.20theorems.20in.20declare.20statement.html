Hello,</p>
<p>first of all thank you for making Isabelle print the types of constants<br>
on CTRL+hover. This is probably the biggest quality of live change for<br>
me in several versions of Isabelle.</p>
<p>One minor thing (which is not specific to 2025) is that it would be nice<br>
if we use <code>declare</code> to e.g. declare a simp rule, having the mouse on<br>
that line would show the theorem, similar to <code>thm</code>. At the moment, I<br>
need to copy+paste the name of the theorem (plus potentially other<br>
attributes) and put <code>thm</code> in front to see what is getting registered.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Jan</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>another issue that is also present in at least Isabelle2024 is that the <br>
formatter breaks if the jedit option "Restore previously opened files on <br>
startup" is enabled. How to reproduce:</p>
<p>Open Isabelle, go to settings-&gt;Global Options-&gt;General-&gt;Restore <br>
previously opened files on startup</p>
<p>Write an apply script (or anything else with formatting), e.g.:<br>
lemma test: "A = B"<br>
   apply (rule trans)<br>
    apply (rule trans)<br>
     apply (rule trans)</p>
<p>At this point the indent while typing (after pressing Enter) as well as <br>
the manually triggered one (CTRL+i) are working (as expected).</p>
<p>Close Isabelle and restart it. Then trigger the formatter. Now <br>
everything is just pushed all the way to the left:<br>
lemma test: "A = B"<br>
apply (rule trans)<br>
apply (rule trans)<br>
apply (rule trans)</p>
<p>Disabling that option and restarting Isabelle fixes the issue.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Jan</p>

<p>Doing it with existing mechanisms would be very expensive: all occurrences of <br>
facts had to be printed and stored in the PIDE document model (and build <br>
database).</p>
<p>There are so many facts, and they are often large as a statement. This <br>
approach is not going to scale.</p>
