<p>From: Andrea Vezzosi &lt;<a href="mailto:vezzosi.ndr@gmail.com">vezzosi.ndr@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>Are there Isabelle tools or formalizations in the area of program<br>
synthesis?</p>
<p>Especially interested in ones for functional languages (e.g. (some subset<br>
of) Haskell or ML), the end goal would be a tactic that given a<br>
specification and a partial program (i.e. with placeholders, aka typed<br>
holes) produces a completed program, if possible.</p>
<p>No particular constraints on the specification format, but the synthesis<br>
should be flexible in the form of programs that could be synthesized,<br>
because I would like to support a variety of partial programs as inputs.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Andrea</p>

I am not aware of any. I played around with this sort of thing 40 years ago, in the context of Martin-Löf type theory. It was supposedly one of the main benefits of MLTT (as people argued at the time), but I found it really difficult.</p>
<p>A bit later, a student of mine (Martin Coen) did some experiments and built what he called Classical Computational Logic for Untyped Lambda Calculus, which is still available in the distribution as Isabelle/CCL. His idea was to adopt some ideas from type theory while being classical, and giving up on the idea that the program you want will emerge from a natural proof. He was convinced (and I agree) that you are better off allowing the user to supply the program, which sounds a bit like what you are requesting. But nobody has touched this in 35 years. It's there if you want to take a look.</p>
