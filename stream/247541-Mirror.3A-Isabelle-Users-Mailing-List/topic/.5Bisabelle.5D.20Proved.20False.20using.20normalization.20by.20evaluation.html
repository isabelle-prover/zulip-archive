Dear list,</p>
<p>I just proved False using the normalization method in Isabelle/HOL, see <br>
below. It seems like TYPE(T) arguments are generalized(?) to TYPE(?'a) <br>
arguments when running the method (even when dropping the code equation <br>
for the constant to be normalized).</p>
<p>Is this a known problem and is there anything I can do to stop the <br>
normalizer from tinkering with TYPE(T) arguments?</p>
<p>Background: I used normalization by evaluation to work on a large data <br>
structure in an Isabelle/HOL proof for which the performance of the <br>
simplifier is insufficient.</p>

Just for the benefit of readers on this mailing list who are not <br>
familiar with the NBE method: this is <em>not</em> a proof method that goes <br>
through the Isabelle kernel. It is an oracle, and one with a significant <br>
trusted code base. Moreover, I think it is used much less than the code <br>
generator oracle (the "eval" method), so issues like this one can remain <br>
unnoticed for a long time.</p>
<p>So, although I do not think it was previously known that you could prove <br>
"False" with NBE, it is not very surprising either. And it does <em>not</em> <br>
mean that Isabelle as a system is broken.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't know enough about the internals of NBE to really <br>
comment on this issue otherwise. I just wanted to make sure this was <br>
stated somewhere clearly on the mailing list.</p>

Noting that UNIV is normalized to " List.coset []", one is tempted to <br>
suspect that the typing is careless in the most natural place to go <br>
wrong, namely with Nil.<br>

<p><code>
In most cases, these type reconstructions are unique, as follows from 
the structure of normal terms in the simply-typed lambda calculus. 
However, in the presence of polymorphic constants, the most general 
type could be more general than intended. For example, let f be a 
polymorphic constant of type “(’a =&gt; ’a) =&gt; bool”, say without any 
rewrite rule. Then the untyped normal form of “f (λu::bool. u)” would 
be “f (λu. u)” with most general type annotations “f (λu::’a. u)”. To 
avoid such widening of types only those equations will be considered 
as being proved by normalisation where the typing of the result is 
completely determined, i.e. those equations where the most general 
type for the result does not introduce any new type variables. It 
should be noted that this, in particular, is always the case if an 
expression evaluates to True.

<p>I would not go that far. I'm sure I have referred to things that I <br>
"proved" with eval, for example, as "proven". Without quotation marks. A <br>
reasonable argument can be made that oracles are evil and should not be <br>
used in formal proof at all (or otherwise one should not call it "formal <br>
proof" anymore). But I think some more nuance is appropriate and one has <br>
to look at the oracle in question.</p>
<p>I for one have sometimes wondered whether something like a "numeral <br>
addition and multiplication" oracle that can only prove theorems of the <br>
form "(a :: num) + b = c" and "(a :: num) * b = c" would be an <br>
interesting thing to have to speed up numerical computations without <br>
resorting to full-on reflection. The trusted code base would be tiny, <br>
and the soundness of Isabelle depends on trusting Poly/ML to be able to <br>
do arithmetic on integers already anyway. And I think it would be <br>
throwing out the baby with the bath water to say a proof using this <br>
oracle is no longer a proof.</p>
<p>Something like "eval" or "nbe" is of course much more involved and there <br>
are much greater dangers for introducing inconsistency (e.g. one can use <br>
"code_printing" to make eval "prove" just about anything).</p>

You seem to be confusing terminology here.</p>
<p>The concept of an oracle is that it must be trusted. SMT solvers are <br>
normally not trusted as oracles in Isabelle (and especially not in the <br>
AFP) -- e.g., sledgehammer reconstructs all its proofs unless you <br>
explicitly ask it not to.</p>
<p>It is not a surprise that using additional oracles in arbitrary ways <br>
will introduce inconsistencies -- you can also axiomatize "False", if <br>
you want.</p>
<p>Also Isabelle is an LCF-style system which eliminates the need for proof <br>
terms.</p>

Following Peter's post about <code>thm_oracles</code>, is there a way of invoking<br>
<code>isabelle build</code> for a session so that it fails if any proof of a lemma<br>
appearing within that session invokes a method that does not pass through<br>
the kernel?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

Others have written good responses to this already, but let me just add <br>
this: Proof terms are not really something that is used very much in <br>
Isabelle. When you have an "oracle" in Isabelle that can easily be made <br>
to return a proof term (be it an Isabelle proof term or something more <br>
domain-specific, such as a SAT or SMT proof), the usual thing to do is <br>
to just "import" the proof term by plugging together Isabelle theorems <br>
(such that everything goes through the kernel). Or, better still, to <br>
just have the "oracle" plug Isabelle theorems together directly.</p>
<p>The "generate some proof object and then push it through the kernel" <br>
approach is taken e.g. by Isabelle's "smt" tactic, by various tools to <br>
import SAT proofs in e.g. the DRUP format, and I think there was a proof <br>
method for linear orders that does this as well (not sure whether it is <br>
in the AFP or the distribution).</p>
<p>The "plug theorems together directly" approach is taken e.g. by my <br>
real_asymp method for proving asymptotic properties like limits and "Big <br>
O" statements. This is in the Isabelle distribution. The advantage here <br>
is that you don't have to first compute a (possibly huge) proof object <br>
and then process it (a bit like deforestation). The disadvantage might <br>
be that plugging together Isabelle theorems tends to be expensive, so if <br>
you're doing a lot of exploration where it's not clear whether a branch <br>
of computation will actually lead to a result, this might not be the <br>
right approach.</p>
<p>But once you do any of that, it's not an oracle anymore (at least not in <br>
Isabelle terminology), but a proof method. An oracle is by definition <br>
trusted code that need not justify what it does to the Isabelle kernel. <br>
Consequently, one has to be very careful with these. Morally, I think a <br>
good argument can be made that oracles make sense for statements that, <br>
if you were to see a proof for them on paper or in a proof term, it <br>
would feel like a waste of space: straightforward computations that take <br>
a lot of time but where it is completely clear <em>how</em> to do them. I think <br>
that is how people in systems such as Coq would often use reflection.</p>

<p>Is there a clear answer to a logician who wants to know what is the <br>

Yes, you can look at the transitive dependencies of your theorem that <br>
are axioms (doable in a bit of Isabelle/ML programming). Your axiomatic <br>
system consists of those + the metalogic itself, which has been <br>
formalized e.g. by Simon Roßkopf and Tobias Nipkow [1] (their proof <br>
checker even verifies whether the extracted term is a proof for the <br>
theorem).</p>
<p>The trouble is that you are going to find a lot of axioms, e.g., every <br>
constant or type definition will add some. Those axioms are also added <br>
directly, without using the oracle mechanism. I'm not quite sure why <br>
(possibly performance reasons), because the latter would mean that it'd <br>
be sufficient to only look at a few oracles instead of a linearly <br>
growing set of axioms -- and we even have helpful tools such as the <br>
thm_oracles command.</p>

how you would expect an inference system to behave), includiung well-formedness, <br>
type class and overloading.</p>
<p>The above paper presents a proof checker that takes an Isabelle proof term and <br>
checks that the axioms of whatever theory you are in (which may be <br>

<p>* "proof method" is goal refinement operation of the Isar proof language. <br>
Proof methods may appear as initial method in 'proof' or terminal method in <br>
'qed'; the Isar language is parametric over the method language, these may do <br>
whatever is technically possible, even non-sense.</p>
<p>* Above you could say "derived inference rule (of the kernel)".</p>

<p>When introducing Isabelle, I sometimes start with Pure and the Isar proof <br>

<p>There are various possibilities to do that. The Isabelle/ML operation <br>

<p>To "harden" regular Isabelle builds, I would use a slightly different <br>

that it "oversees" the overall Isabelle/ML session. The Scala tool could cause <br>
an error, or display results nicely as a report in the HTML presentation, for <br>
example, to say clearly "how correct" which theorem is, meaning what are its <br>
extra dependencies on oracles, axioms, etc.</p>

<p>Hi. Indeed, <a href="https://github.com/Deducteam/isabelle_dedukti">https://github.com/Deducteam/isabelle_dedukti</a> is an Isabelle <br>
component that can convert Isabelle proof terms into Dedukti or Lambdapi <br>
files. Current Dedukti and Lambdapi checkers (dkcheck, kontroli and <br>
lambdapi) are quite fast, especially the first two. The main limitation <br>
currently is rather on the Isabelle side: the current proof export is <br>
quite slow. In the last Isabelle workshop (Tbilisi, 2024), Makarius gave <br>
a nice talk on proof export and his long-term project to improve it (see <br>
<a href="https://files.sketis.net/Isabelle_Workshop_2024/Isabelle_2024_paper_6.pdf">https://files.sketis.net/Isabelle_Workshop_2024/Isabelle_2024_paper_6.pdf</a>). <br>
Note that isabelle_dedukti does not handle oracles. The Dedukti or <br>
Lambdapi representation provides another interesting way to see what <br>
exactly is the logic implemented by Isabelle, and what is assumed by the <br>
kernel.</p>

<p>for the final piece of a series of improvements in nbe.ML.</p>
<p>There were basically two things to put into shape:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Low-level type inference during term reconstruction was restored using <br>
proof-context level type inference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constants carry explicit type arguments, hence the underapproximation <br>
for equality used for non-left-linear patterns can distinguish different <br>
type instances. As a side effect, type reconstruction of terms is <br>
complete now (although this never had been an issue an practice AFAIR).</p>
