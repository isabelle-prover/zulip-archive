<p>Call For Papers</p>
<p>The ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) has gathered scientists <br>
from different areas of computing for over thirty years. The forum gives <br>
participants an opportunity to interact with different communities <br>
sharing an interest in applied computing.</p>
<p>The 39th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2024) <br>
&lt;<a href="https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2024/&gt;is">https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2024/&gt;is</a> sponsored by the ACM Special <br>
Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP), and will take place on <br>
April 8 - April 12, 2024, in Avila, Spain.</p>
<p>The Software Verification and Testing track aims to contribute to the <br>
challenge of improving the usability of formal methods in software <br>
engineering. The track covers areas such as formal methods for <br>
verification and testing, based on theorem proving, model checking, <br>
static analysis, and run-time verification. We invite authors to submit <br>
new results in formal verification and testing, as well as development <br>
of technologies to improve the usability of formal methods in software <br>
engineering. We also welcome detailed descriptions of applications of <br>
mechanical verification to large scale software.</p>
<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>* model checking<br>
  * theorem proving<br>
  * correct by construction development<br>
  * model-based testing<br>
  * software testing<br>
  * symbolic execution<br>
  * static and dynamic analysis<br>
  * abstract interpretation<br>
  * analysis methods for dependable systems<br>
  * software certification and proof carrying code<br>
  * fault diagnosis and debugging<br>
  * verification and validation of large scale software systems<br>
  * real world applications and case studies applying software testing<br>
    and verification</p>
<p>* benchmarks and data sets for software testing and verification</p>
<p>Submission Guidelines</p>
<p>Paper submissions must report on original, unpublished work. Submitted <br>
papers will undergo a double-blind review process. Author(s) name(s) and <br>
address(es) must not appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference <br>
should be avoided and made in the third person. We welcome research <br>
papers and posters. Research papers should have at most 8 two-column <br>
pages in ACM format (further two pages, to a total of 10 pages, may be <br>
available at a charge). The length of a poster is limited to three pages <br>
(one extra page may be available at a charge). Please comply to this <br>
page limit already at submission time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the context of the Student Research Competition (SRC) <br>
program to provide graduate students the opportunity to meet and <br>
exchange ideas with researchers and practitioners in their areas of <br>
interest, graduate students are invited to submit research abstracts <br>
(maximum of 4 pages in ACM camera-ready format) following the <br>
instructions published at the SAC 2024 website. Last year’s example can <br>
be foundhere <br>
&lt;<a href="https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2023/authorkit/ACM_SigConf-SRC2023.pdf">https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2023/authorkit/ACM_SigConf-SRC2023.pdf</a>&gt;. <br>
Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed.</p>
<p>Accepted papers will be published in the ACM SAC 2024 proceedings in the <br>
ACM digital library. Paper registration is required, allowing the <br>
inclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author <br>
or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement <br>
for the paper/poster to be included in the ACM digital library. No-show <br>
of registered papers and posters will result in excluding them from the <br>
ACM digital library.</p>
