<hr>
<p>The 30th Static Analysis Symposium, SAS 2023, will be co-located with<br>
SPLASH 2023 in Cascais (Lisbon), Portugal.</p>
<p>Static Analysis is widely recognized as a fundamental tool for program<br>
verification, bug detection, compiler optimization, program understanding, and<br>
software maintenance. The series of Static Analysis Symposia has served as the<br>
primary venue for the presentation of theoretical, practical, and application<br>
advances in the area.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>All deadlines are AoE (Anywhere on Earth) </p>
<ul>
<li>Full paper submission: April 24, 2023 </li>
<li>Artifact submission: April 29, 2023</li>
<li>Author response period: June 11-14, 2023</li>
<li>Notification: June 29, 2023</li>
<li>Final version due: August 3, 2023</li>

</ul>
<p>TOPICS </p>

and presentations of refereed papers. Contributions are welcomed on<br>
all aspects of static analysis, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p>Abstract interpretation<br>
Automated deduction<br>
Data flow analysis<br>
Debugging techniques<br>
Deductive methods<br>
Emerging applications<br>
Model-checking<br>
Data science<br>
Program optimizations and transformations<br>
Program synthesis<br>
Program verification<br>
Machine learning and verification<br>
Security analysis<br>
Tool environments and architectures<br>
Theoretical frameworks<br>
Type checking<br>
Distributed or networked systems</p>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSION</p>
<p>All paper submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance,<br>
correctness, originality, and clarity. </p>
<p>Submission link: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sas2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sas2023</a></p>
<p>We welcome regular papers as well as papers focusing on any of the<br>
following in the NEAT (New questions/areas, Experience, Announcement,<br>
Tool) category:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well-motivated discussion of new questions or new areas. </li>
<li>Experience with static analysis tools, Industrial Reports, and Case Studies </li>
<li>Brief announcements of work in progress </li>
<li>Tool papers </li>
</ul>
<p>We do not impose a page limit for submitted papers but we encourage<br>
brevity as reviewers have a limited time that they can spend on each<br>
paper. With the exception of experience papers, all other papers will<br>
follow a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.  The identity of<br>
the authors for the remaining papers will be known to the reviewers.</p>
<p>Submissions can address any programming paradigm, including<br>
concurrent, constraint, functional, imperative, logic,<br>
object-oriented, aspect, multi-core, distributed, and GPU<br>
programming.</p>
<p>Papers must be written and presented in English. A submitted paper<br>
must describe original work and must not substantially overlap with<br>
papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted<br>
to a journal or a conference with refereed proceedings.</p>
<p>All submitted papers will be judged on the basis of significance,<br>
relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. The review process<br>
will include a rebuttal period where authors have the opportunity to<br>
respond to preliminary reviews on the paper.</p>
<p>RADHIA COUSOT AWARD</p>
<p>The program committee will select an accepted regular paper for the Radhia<br>
Cousot Young Researcher Best Paper Award in memory of Radhia Cousot and her<br>
fundamental contributions to static analysis, as well as being one of the main<br>
promoters and organizers of the SAS series of conferences.</p>
<p>ARTIFACTS</p>
<p>As in previous years, we encourage authors to submit a virtual machine image<br>
containing any artifacts and evaluations presented in the paper. Artifact<br>
submission is optional. Artifact evaluation will be concurrent with paper<br>
review.</p>
