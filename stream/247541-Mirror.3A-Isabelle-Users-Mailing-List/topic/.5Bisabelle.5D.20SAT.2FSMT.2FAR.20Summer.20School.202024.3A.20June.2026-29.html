SAT/SMT/AR 2024: International Summer School on Satisfiability, <br>
Satisfiability Modulo Theories, and Automated Reasoning<br>
<a href="https://sat-smt-ar-school.gitlab.io/www/2024/index.html">https://sat-smt-ar-school.gitlab.io/www/2024/index.html</a><br>
June 26-29, 2024, Nancy, France</p>
<p>Satisfiability (SAT), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and <br>
Automated Reasoning (AR) continue to make rapid advances and find novel <br>
uses in a wide variety of applications, both in computer science and <br>
beyond. The SAT/SMT/AR Summer School aims to bring a select group of <br>
students up to speed quickly in this exciting research area. The school <br>
continues the successful line of Summer Schools that ran from 2011 to 2022.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that the next edition of the SAT/SMT/AR <br>
Summer School will take place in Nancy, France from June 26 to June 29, <br>
2024. The lectures planned this year are detailed on the website and <br>
include a mix of basic and advanced theory as well as practical sessions.</p>
<p>The school is intended for PhD students, Master students, and industrial <br>
practitioners who want to get a good understanding of capabilities and <br>
current research directions in the area of SAT, SMT, and Automated <br>
Reasoning. Prior knowledge in those areas is not required, but knowledge <br>
of logic, general problem solving skills, good programming and math <br>
skills are helpful.</p>
<p>As the number of participants is limited, all prospective participants <br>
will have to apply by filling this form:</p>
<p><a href="https://sondages.inria.fr/index.php/171451?lang=en">https://sondages.inria.fr/index.php/171451?lang=en</a></p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>* a short CV (at most 3 pages, including publications, if any),<br>
  * a letter of motivation written by the applicant (1 page),<br>
  * for students, the name of a supervisor from which to ask a<br>
    supporting email (1 paragraph).</p>
<p>The letter should explain the motivation for attending the Summer <br>
School. Based on the application letters approximately 50 participants <br>
will be chosen from all qualified applicants. Admitted participants will <br>
then be provided a link for registration. The registration cost will be <br>
/free/. Students that need travel support may indicate so in the <br>
application form. Students that have a paper accepted at IJCAR and plan <br>
to attend the conference are encouraged to apply for the Woody Bledsoe <br>
award (<a href="https://cadeinc.org/WoodyBledsoeAward">https://cadeinc.org/WoodyBledsoeAward</a>). Information on how to <br>
apply is available on the IJCAR 2024 website ( <br>
<a href="https://merz.gitlabpages.inria.fr/2024-ijcar/post/bledsoe/">https://merz.gitlabpages.inria.fr/2024-ijcar/post/bledsoe/</a> ).</p>
<p>Applications to the SAT/SMT/AR Summer School close on the 10th of May. <br>
