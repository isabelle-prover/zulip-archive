<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>Probabilistic programming is a popular tool for statistics and<br>
machine learning. The idea is to describe a statistical model as<br>
a program with random choices. The program might be a simulation<br>
of a system, such as a physics model, a model of viral spread,<br>
or a model of electoral behaviour. We can now carry out<br>
statistical inference over the system, for example, by running a<br>
Monte Carlo simulation – running the simulation 100,000’s of<br>
times.</p>
<p>As I will discuss in this talk, the idea of treating statistical<br>
models as computer programs also has a foundational appeal. If<br>
we can understand statistical models as programs, then the<br>
foundations of probability and statistics can be discussed in<br>
terms of program semantics. There is a chance of new<br>
foundational perspectives on statistics, in terms of programming<br>
languages and their formal methods.</p>
<p>As I will explain, this programming-based foundation for<br>
statistics is attractive because there are some intuitively<br>
simple scenarios, such as inference over function spaces, which<br>
have an easy programming implementation, but for which the<br>
traditional mathematical interpretation is complicated.</p>
<p>SPEAKER BIOGRAPHY</p>
<p>Sam Staton is a Professor of Computer Science and Royal Society<br>
University Research Fellow at the University of Oxford. There he<br>
currently runs an ERC grant "Better Languages for Statistics".<br>
Before arriving in Oxford in 2015, Sam spent time in Nijmegen,<br>
Paris, and Cambridge. His PhD was in Cambridge with Marcelo<br>
Fiore (2007). Sam's main research is in programming language<br>
theory, but he is also interested in logic and category theory.<br>
He has recent contributions in probabilistic programming<br>
languages, and quantum computing and programming languages.</p>
