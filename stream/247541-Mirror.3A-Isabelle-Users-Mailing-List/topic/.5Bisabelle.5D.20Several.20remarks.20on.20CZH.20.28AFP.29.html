<p>From: Mihails Milehins &lt;<a href="mailto:mihailsmilehins@gmail.com">mihailsmilehins@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>I would like to make several remarks about the entries CZH_* on the AFP:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I may have mentioned to several members of the community that I have an<br>
intention to continue improving these entries and provide further material.<br>
However, it is likely that this will not be possible. I have not been able<br>
to find the time and/or the computational resources to continue this work<br>
thus far, and I doubt that this will change in the foreseeable future.<br>
Moreover, I noticed that HOTG started taking shape once again and there is<br>
further relevant automation that became available recently [1]. From my<br>
perspective, TG is a more natural setting for formalization of category<br>
theory than ZFC. Furthermore, from my experience, the automation provided<br>
in [1] could be "game changing" in the context of the formalization of<br>
mathematics in set-theoretic foundations at large (be it ZFC or TG). This<br>
makes it less appealing to continue the development of my own formalization<br>
(without, at least, a significant overhaul based on [1]). Naturally, I will<br>
try to do my best to maintain the content that has already been published<br>
on the AFP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While I have accrued some further material beyond what is currently in<br>
the AFP (Freyd's General Adjoint Functor Theorem and its applications in<br>
algebra, quotient categories, further material on dagger categories), I do<br>
not believe that I have enough material for a conference paper on this<br>
topic. However, if anyone from the community could agree to provide an<br>
endorsement for a relevant subject area on Arxiv, I would like to upload a<br>
short note about these entries. The reasons for this are two-fold:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>2.1. While the scope of the formalization is quite narrow, I believe that<br>
this may have been the first substantial formalization (in a proof<br>
assistant) of category theory with the categories defined on the stages of<br>
the von Neumann hierarchy, rather than the Grothendieck's universes.</p>
<p>2.2. The formalization largely rests on the homegrown automation<br>
(Conditional_Simplification), which has advantages (and some disadvantages)<br>
over the traditional classical methods (auto/force) that combine classical<br>
reasoning and rewriting. Again, I believe that this may be the first use<br>
case (at least in the context of Isabelle) for this type of algorithm, and<br>
(efficiency matters aside) I found it exceptionally convenient in a<br>
set-theoretic setting (or any setting with theorems that contain a large<br>
number of non-trivial premises).</p>
<p>Of course, I would be happy to be proven wrong about either/both of the<br>
claims above.</p>
