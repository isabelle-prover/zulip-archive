<p>From: Kevin Kappelmann &lt;<a href="mailto:kevin.kappelmann@tum.de">kevin.kappelmann@tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear list,</p>
<p>I am using Isabelle2025 and want to report an unexpected behaviour of a <br>
check in Pure/goal.ML, function "prove_common" and in <br>
Pure/Isar/proof.ML, function "conclude_goal".</p>
<p>Both functions try to check if the proven theorem is an instance of the <br>
originally passed theorem statement using "Unify.matcher". However, <br>
Unify.matcher is incomplete for higher-order matching, e.g. it fails on <br>
the matching problem<br>
"(?f :: prop ⇒ prop) ((?x :: prop ⇒ prop) y) ≡ ?f y"<br>
(one solution: ?x |-&gt; λ_. y).</p>
<p>As a consequence, sound proofs get rejected e.g. when using Goal.prove <br>
and when writing a proof in Isar. Below I append an example theory file <br>
showcasing this, including a minimised version of a lemma that triggered <br>
this behaviour in my development.</p>
<p>Optimally, one would like to have a complete higher-order matcher, but I <br>
am not aware of a simple algorithm for that (though I am by no means an <br>
expert in this area). Checking the history of goal.ML and proof.ML <br>
indicates that both have seen iterations trying to improve the <br>
completeness of the instance check, i.e. this behaviour has been <br>
considered and refined in the past.</p>
<p>Since the check happens in goal.ML and proof.ML, it affects users of <br>
Isabelle/ML and Isabelle/Isar.<br>
(1) I wonder if the check in goal.ML is necessary at all?<br>
(2) Would it be conceivable to temporarily disable the check (e.g. with <br>
a configuration option) in goal.ML and/or proof.ML for users?</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Kevin</p>

Dear Kevin,</p>
<p>Higher-order matching is undecidable. The check is necessary because a tactic replaces the proof state by a new proof state and could easily replace the goal by a different one. Matching is only necessary if the original goal contains schematic variables, which is these days extremely rare. Most of the time we only have to check for identity.</p>

Higher-Order matchig modulo beta+eta (this is important) is decidable. This was <br>
proved by Stirling in 2007 but is beside the point (partly because of the <br>
complexity). The point that Kevin is making is this: the check has no logical <br>
relevance, it is a sanity check, but it rules out perfectly sound proofs. Thus <br>
there should be some way to say "the incomplete sanity check prevents this <br>
operation, but trust me, I know what I am doing and you don't need to protect me <br>

Hi Fabian,</p>
<p>I’m not sure what you mean by “in meta-programming it is not relevant”. The same (ruled-out) example:</p>
<p>ML ‹<br>
  Goal.prove @{context} [] [] (HOLogic.mk_Trueprop @{term False})<br>
    (fn _ =&gt; PRIMITIVE (fn thm =&gt; TrueI RS Drule.protectI))<br>
›</p>
<p>Regarding the qed syntax proposal: Kevin’s original goal has no schematic variables, so there is nothing to instantiate.</p>

For my original proof (and the one in the shared theory file using <br>
"simp"), I discovered in the meantime that the list to set comprehension <br>
simproc in List.thy creates the instance that does not pass the matching <br>
sanity check. The simproc can be modified to use Goal.prove_internal <br>
(which uses no matching check) instead of Goal.prove. I shared a patch <br>
with Tobias which will be published soon.</p>

<p>Dear list,</p>
<p>I am using Isabelle2025 and want to report an unexpected behaviour of a <br>
check in Pure/goal.ML, function "prove_common" and in Pure/Isar/ <br>
proof.ML, function "conclude_goal".</p>
<p>Both functions try to check if the proven theorem is an instance of the <br>
originally passed theorem statement using "Unify.matcher". However, <br>
Unify.matcher is incomplete for higher-order matching, e.g. it fails on <br>
the matching problem<br>
"(?f :: prop ⇒ prop) ((?x :: prop ⇒ prop) y) ≡ ?f y"<br>
(one solution: ?x |-&gt; λ_. y).</p>
<p>As a consequence, sound proofs get rejected e.g. when using Goal.prove <br>
and when writing a proof in Isar. Below I append an example theory file <br>
showcasing this, including a minimised version of a lemma that triggered <br>
this behaviour in my development.</p>
<p>Optimally, one would like to have a complete higher-order matcher, but I <br>
am not aware of a simple algorithm for that (though I am by no means an <br>
expert in this area). Checking the history of goal.ML and proof.ML <br>
indicates that both have seen iterations trying to improve the <br>
completeness of the instance check, i.e. this behaviour has been <br>
considered and refined in the past.</p>
<p>Since the check happens in goal.ML and proof.ML, it affects users of <br>
Isabelle/ML and Isabelle/Isar.<br>
(1) I wonder if the check in goal.ML is necessary at all?<br>
(2) Would it be conceivable to temporarily disable the check (e.g. with <br>
a configuration option) in goal.ML and/or proof.ML for users?</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This thread is already concluded, being mostly based on misunderstandings how <br>
things work.</p>
<p>I merely want to report the situation concerning the regular documentation of <br>
Isabelle/ML, which is a combination of "isabelle doc implementation" + reading <br>
the sources:</p>
<p>* The implementation manual for talks conceptually about a "prove" <br>
operation and then refers concretely to Goal.prove and Goal.prove_common. The <br>
text for "prove" is this:</p>
<p>The ‹prove› operation provides an interface for structured backwards<br>
   reasoning under program control, with some explicit sanity checks of the<br>
   result. [...]</p>
<p>* The documentation in ML is as follows: src/Pure/goal.ML defines things <br>
clearly from the bottom up. Before introducing Goal.prove_common (and more <br>
"prove variations"), there is this notable explanation:</p>
<p>(* prove_internal -- minimal checks, no normalization of result! *)</p>
<p>fun prove_internal ctxt casms cprop tac =<br>
   (case SINGLE (tac (map (Assumption.assume ctxt) casms)) (init cprop) of<br>
     SOME th =&gt; Drule.implies_intr_list casms (finish ctxt th)<br>
   | NONE =&gt; error "Tactic failed");</p>
<p>A quick "induction over the sources" (via hypersearch in Isabelle/jEdit) shows <br>
that Goal.prove_internal is only used in very few situations. So there is no <br>
need to emphasize it in the LaTeX-based documentation; the ML-based <br>
documentation is sufficient.</p>
<p>That's it. Thread closed.</p>
