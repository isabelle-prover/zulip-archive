TABLEAUX 2023 - PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>The 32nd International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic<br>

Prague, Czech Republic, September 18-21, 2023</p>

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br>
The 32nd International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic<br>
Tableaux and Related Methods (TABLEAUX 2023) will be hosted by the<br>
Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic, September 18-21,<br>
2023.</p>
<p>TABLEAUX is the main international conference at which research on all<br>
aspects -- theoretical foundations, implementation techniques, systems<br>
development and applications -- of tableaux-based reasoning and<br>
related methods is presented. The first TABLEAUX conference was held<br>
in Lautenbach near Karlsruhe, Germany, in 1992. Since then it has been<br>
organised on an annual basis (sometimes as a part of IJCAR).</p>
<p>TABLEAUX 2023 will be co-located with the 14th International Symposium<br>
on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS 2023). The conferences will<br>
provide a rich programme of workshops, tutorials, invited talks, paper<br>
presentations and system descriptions.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF CONFERENCE<br>
Tableaux and related proof methods offer convenient and flexible tools<br>
for automated reasoning for both classical and non-classical logics.<br>
Areas of application include verification of software and computer<br>
systems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its<br>
required inference engines, teaching, and system diagnosis.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>* tableau methods for classical and non-classical logics (including<br>
first-order, higher-order, modal, temporal, description, hybrid,<br>
intuitionistic, linear, substructural, fuzzy, relevance and<br>
non-monotonic logics) and their proof-theoretic foundations;</p>
<p>* sequent, natural deduction, labelled, nested and deep calculi for<br>
classical and non-classical logics, as tools for proof search and<br>
proof representation;</p>
<p>* related methods (SMT, model elimination, model checking,<br>
connection methods, resolution, BDDs, translation approaches);</p>
<p>* flexible, easily extendable, light-weight methods for theorem<br>
proving; novel types of calculi for theorem proving and verification<br>
in classical and non-classical logics;</p>
<p>* systems, tools, implementations, empirical evaluations and<br>
applications (provers, proof assistants, logical frameworks, model<br>
checkers, etc.);</p>
<p>* implementation techniques (data structures, efficient algorithms,<br>
performance measurement, extensibility, etc.);</p>
<p>* combinations with machine learning and other AI methods;<br>
   * techniques for proof generation and compact (or human-readable)<br>
proof representation;</p>
<p>* theoretical and practical aspects of decision procedures;<br>
   * applications of automated deduction to mathematics, software<br>
development, verification, deductive and temporal databases, knowledge<br>
representation, ontologies, fault diagnosis or teaching.</p>
<p>We also welcome papers describing applications of tableau procedures<br>
to real-world examples. Such papers should be tailored to the TABLEAUX<br>
community and should focus on the role of reasoning and on logical<br>
aspects of the solution.</p>
<p>AITP-TABLEAUX SPECIAL TRACK<br>
Besides the main track, TABLEAUX 2023 will host a special track on<br>
Artificial Intelligence and Theorem Proving (AITP). The special track<br>
invites papers combining machine learning and related AI methods with<br>
standard TABLEAUX topics (see above). We welcome full versions of the<br>
extended abstracts presented at the AITP conference<br>
(<a href="http://aitp-conference.org/2023/">http://aitp-conference.org/2023/</a>).</p>
<p>WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS<br>
If you would like to organize a workshop or run a tutorial, please let<br>
us know before July 14, 2023.</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>
To be announced.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES<br>
Submissions are invited in the following two categories:<br>
(A) regular papers reporting original theoretical research or<br>
applications. Up to 15 pages excluding references;<br>
(B) short papers such as system descriptions, user experiences, case<br>
studies and domain models. Up to 9 pages excluding references.</p>
<p>Submissions will be reviewed by the Program Committee, possibly with<br>
the help of external reviewers, taking into account correctness,<br>
originality, readability, relevance, and significance. Any additional<br>
material (going beyond the page limit) may be included in a clearly<br>
marked appendix that will be read at the discretion of the committee<br>
and must be removed for the camera-ready version.</p>
<p>Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for archival<br>
publication elsewhere. If software or data is relevant to a paper, a<br>
link that provides access to the software/data must be provided to<br>
enable reproduction of the results. Accepted papers in categories (A)<br>
and (B) will be published in the conference proceedings.</p>
<p>Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be<br>
submitted electronically as PDF files via the EasyChair system:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=tableaux2023">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=tableaux2023</a></p>
<p>For all accepted papers, at least one author is required to register<br>
for the conference and present the paper. A title and a short abstract<br>
of about 100 words must be submitted before the paper submission<br>
deadline. Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files can be<br>
obtained at:<br>

<p>CONFERENCE FORMAT AND COVID-19<br>
TABLEAUX 2023 and FroCoS 2023 are planned as in-person conferences.<br>
However, virtual participation might be a possibility in exceptional<br>
situations.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION<br>

covered from sponsorships and from the registration fees of all<br>
participants.</p>
<p>BEST PAPER AWARDS<br>
The program committee will select</p>
<ul>
<li>the TABLEAUX 2023 Best Paper; and,</li>
<li>the TABLEAUX 2023 Best Paper by a Junior Researcher.</li>
</ul>
