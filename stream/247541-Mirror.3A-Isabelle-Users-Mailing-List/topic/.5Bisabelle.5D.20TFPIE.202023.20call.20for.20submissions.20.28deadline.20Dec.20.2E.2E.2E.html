(January 12th 2023, Boston, MA, USA, co-located with TFP 2023 and POPL 2023)</p>
<p>TFPIE 2023 welcomes submissions describing techniques used in the classroom,<br>
tools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any creative use of<br>
functional programming (FP) to aid education in or outside Computer Science.<br>
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>FP and beginning CS students<br>
  FP and Computational Thinking<br>
  FP and Artificial Intelligence<br>
  FP in Robotics<br>
  FP and Music<br>
  Advanced FP for undergraduates<br>
  FP in graduate education<br>
  Engaging students in research using FP<br>
  FP in Programming Languages<br>
  FP in the high school curriculum<br>
  FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics<br>
  FP and Philosophy<br>
  The pedagogy of teaching FP<br>
  FP and e-learning: MOOCs, automated assessment etc.<br>
  Best Lectures - more details below</p>
<p>In addition to papers, we are requesting best lecture presentations. What's<br>
your<br>
best lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a fun way to<br>
present FP<br>
concepts to novices or perhaps an especially interesting presentation of a<br>
difficult topic? In either case, please consider sharing it. Best lecture<br>
topics<br>
will be selected for presentation based on a short abstract describing the<br>
