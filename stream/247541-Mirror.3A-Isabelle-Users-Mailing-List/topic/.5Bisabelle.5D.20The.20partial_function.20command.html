Hello,</p>
<p>I am a fan of the partial_function command, but I noticed two small <br>
technical shortcomings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Despite working with chain-complete partial orders, it can only <br>
define <em>functions</em> that return a CCPO, not <em>values</em> of a CCPO. If you <br>
try to do something like</li>
</ol>
<p>partial_function (option) foo :: "'a option" where "foo = foo"</p>
<p>you simply get: exception Empty raised (line 357 of "library.ML")</p>
<p>You might think using partial_function to define a constant is silly, <br>
but there <em>are</em> settings where it makes sense, e.g. probabilistic ones:</p>
<p>partial_function (spmf) foo :: "nat spmf"<br>
   where "foo = do {b ← coin_spmf; if b then return_spmf 0 else map_spmf <br>
Suc foo}"</p>
<p>Of course, the problem can be avoided by simply adding a dummy parameter <br>
of type unit.</p>
<p>So is there any reason for why this is not supported? If one wanted to <br>
support it, would one have to implement the "unit abstraction hack" or <br>
is there a more direct way?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The internal definition is not only not exposed to the user level <br>
(i.e. "thm foo_def" does not work) but there also seems to be no way to <br>
access it from ML. The only thing that is returned is the term itself <br>
(foo) and the recurrence (foo.simps). This makes it hard (if not <br>
impossible) to use partial_function as a component in other tools.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course one could always write down the fixed point explicitly, but <br>
the partial_function command provides nice automation for e.g. <br>
monotonicity proofs that one would have to do manually.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

<p>I’d like to see that too but it strikes me as not too much bother to just use the fixed-point combinator directly in these cases.</p>

<p>Try</p>
<p>context<br>
  notes [[function_internals]]<br>
begin</p>
<p>partial_function (spmf) ….<br>
(* put a valid def here *)</p>
<p>print_theorems</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>(see e.g. CryptHOL in the AFP)</p>
<p>I tend to feel that <code>partial_function</code> should always yield a def.</p>

<p>Is there really much gained for recursively-defined CAFs (Haskell terminology)? No parameters, no interesting monotonicity.</p>

<p>Aha, good to know! Thanks. I wasn't aware that worked for <br>
partial_function as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tend to feel that <code>partial_function</code> should always yield a def.<br>
I feel so, too. Especially in ML. Calling a command and then making a <br>
string and accessing a generated theorem by name seems hacky to me.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Honestly I haven't given that much thought. For me it's mainly a matter <br>
of uniformity: if you want to build some automation on top of <br>
partial_function (which I have very vague mid-term plans to do) it's <br>
annoying if you have to add a case distinction like that.</p>
