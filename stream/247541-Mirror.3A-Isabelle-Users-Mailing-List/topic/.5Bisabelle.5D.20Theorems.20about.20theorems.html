<p>From: "John F. Hughes" &lt;<a href="mailto:jfh@cs.brown.edu">jfh@cs.brown.edu</a>&gt;<br>
I need a little setup to ask this question. I'll try to make it brief:</p>
<p>In projective geometry, there are four basic axioms, P1 ... P4, for a<br>
projective plane. P1, for instance, says that given two distinct points,<br>
there's a unique line containing both. P2 says that given two distinct<br>
lines, there's at least one point that lies on both. A short proof using P1<br>
shows that P2 can be strengthened to say that given two distinct lines,<br>
there's a <em>unique</em> point lying on both.</p>
<p>We can swap the words "point" and "line" and the phrases "lies on" and<br>
"contains" in any statement about a projective plane to get a so-called<br>
"dual" statement. So P2 is the dual to P1. As it happens, the duals to P3<br>
and P4 are also true in any projective plane, so if we have a set Pts of<br>
point and Lns of lines, and a 'liesOn' predicate which together constitute<br>
a projective plane Pi,  then the set Lns, the set Pts, and 'contains'<br>
<em>also</em> constitute<br>
a projective plane, the 'dual' plane, called Pi*. I've got a locale,<br>
"pplane" that takes a set of points, a set of lines, and a 'liesOn'<br>
relation, so this can be stated as<br>
theorem</p>
<p>This also means that any theorem about projective planes also has a 'dual'<br>
theorem, gotten by replacing "point" with "line" and vice-version, and<br>
doing the same for "lies on" and "contains". Because the duals of the<br>
axioms are also facts, we get a conclusion that if some theorem S is true<br>
for all projective planes, then so is the dual statement.</p>
<p>Hartshorne's little book about projective geometry says it like this<br>
(please ignore the mention of P5):<br>
[image: image.png]<br>
More important is the corollary:<br>
[image: image.png]</p>
<p>My question is this: is it possible to formulate such a theorem in<br>
Isabelle? The statement of the corollary could actually be strengthened to<br>
say that the <em>proof</em> of S* consists of simply dualizing the proof of S<br>
(i.e., swap point/line, etc., in every fact in that proof).</p>
<p>I haven't, in my wanderings through Isabelle, seen anything that seems to<br>
do this kind of introspection, i.e., that treats an Isabelle proof or<br>
statement as an object that can be transformed/acted on by various<br>
functions, etc. Then again, I may simply be looking in the wrong places.<br>
I'd appreciate any suggestions, *or *reasons why this sort of thing cannot<br>
be done.<br>

Your theorem can be stated exactly as below if pplane is formalized as a <br>
locale. This would be the standard way in Isabelle, in my opinion.</p>
<p>As for the proofs, the obvious problem is that in Isabelle "proof <br>
objects" are not the preferred point of view, proving is rather a <br>
computation (in the sense of LCF, logic for computable functions). <br>
However, the fact that the locale can be interpreted in the dual way <br>
"morally" means just what you want: any proof in the locale pplane is <br>
exactly the same independently of how the parameters are instantiated. <br>
To stress this you could call the parameters of the locale in some <br>
abstract way, like objects_one, objects_two, myrelataion, and then to <br>
show that both dual instantiations interpret your locale.</p>

<p>From: "John F. Hughes" &lt;<a href="mailto:jfh@cs.brown.edu">jfh@cs.brown.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks for your comments.</p>
<p>I have indeed made a locale called "pplane", and the "dual_is_plane"<br>
theorem has been written and proved, so I've formalized Hartshorne's<br>
Proposition 4.1.</p>
<p>But it's his Corollary 4.2 that interests me (especially in the extended<br>
form where one says "and the proof of the dual theorem is gotten by<br>
dualizing each fact in the proof of the primal theorem") -- <em>that</em> is a<br>
statement about theorems and proofs rather than about projective planes. As<br>
a mathematician reading the book, I had no trouble believing Corr. 4.2, but<br>
that's different from being able to formalize it.</p>
<p>At this point, if I have proved a theorem like</p>
<p>lemma prim: if Pi is a plane containing a line k and a point P not on k,<br>
then there is a point Q such that Q is not on k and Q is not equal to P</p>
<p>I can then <em>write</em> its dual theorem by hand:</p>
<p>lemma dual: if Pi is a plane containing a point S and a line n not<br>
containing S, then there is a line t such that t does not contain S and t<br>
is not equal to n.</p>
<p>and there's a one-line Isabelle proof, using "prim" and "dual_is_plane".<br>
But I do not know how to express, in Isabelle, that "no matter what primal<br>
lemma I write, I will <em>always</em> be able to prove the dual with this same<br>
one-line proof," which is the content of Corr. 4.2.</p>

Although theorems in Isabelle/HOL can represent proof rules, the actual <br>
proofs are not part of the term language.</p>
<p>Instead, the basic inference rules are functions of the meta-language <br>
that produce objects of the (meta-level) type 'thm'. Objects of type <br>
'thm' can only be produced by those inference rules, so every 'thm' is <br>
correct by construction, and no actual proof is carried around in the <br>
logical system.</p>
<p>That means, in Isabelle/HOL you cannot express this property -- i.e., <br>
that something is provable, or how -- as a theorem. You can only express <br>
that something holds, e.g. that a property implies its dual.</p>

<p>I have indeed made a locale called "pplane", and the "dual_is_plane" <br>

Proposition 4.1.</p>
<p>But it's his Corollary 4.2 that interests me (especially in the <br>
extended form where one says "and the proof of the dual theorem is <br>
gotten by dualizing each fact in the proof of the primal theorem") -- <br>
/that/ is a statement about theorems and proofs rather than about <br>
projective planes. As a mathematician reading the book, I had no <br>
trouble believing Corr. 4.2, but that's different from being able to <br>
formalize it.</p>
<p>At this point, if I have proved a theorem like</p>
<p>lemma prim: if Pi is a plane containing a line k and a point P not on <br>
k, then there is a point Q such that Q is not on k and Q is not equal to P</p>
<p>I can then /write/ its dual theorem by hand:</p>
<p>lemma dual: if Pi is a plane containing a point S and a line n not <br>
containing S, then there is a line t such that t does not contain S <br>
and t is not equal to n.</p>
<p>and there's a one-line Isabelle proof, using "prim" and <br>
"dual_is_plane". But I do not know how to express, in Isabelle, that <br>
"no matter what primal lemma I write, I will /always/ be able to prove <br>
the dual with this same one-line proof," which is the content of Corr. <br>
4.2.</p>

<p>Your theorem can be stated exactly as below if pplane is<br>
    formalized as a locale. This would be the standard way in<br>
    Isabelle, in my opinion.</p>
<p>As for the proofs, the obvious problem is that in Isabelle "proof<br>
    objects" are not the preferred point of view, proving is rather a<br>
    computation (in the sense of LCF, logic for computable functions).<br>
    However, the fact that the locale can be interpreted in the dual<br>
    way "morally" means just what you want: any proof in the locale<br>
    pplane is exactly the same independently of how the parameters are<br>
    instantiated. To stress this you could call the parameters of the<br>
    locale in some abstract way, like objects_one, objects_two,<br>
    myrelataion, and then to show that both dual instantiations<br>
    interpret your locale.</p>

<p>I need a little setup to ask this question. I'll try to make<br>
        it brief:</p>
<p>In projective geometry, there are four basic axioms, P1 ...<br>
        P4, for a projective plane. P1, for instance, says that given<br>
        two distinct points, there's a unique line containing both.<br>
        P2 says that given two distinct lines, there's at least one<br>
        point that lies on both. A short proof using P1 shows that P2<br>
        can be strengthened to say that given two distinct lines,<br>
        there's a <em>unique</em> point lying on both.</p>
<p>We can swap the words "point" and "line" and the phrases<br>
        "lies on" and "contains" in any statement about a projective<br>
        plane to get a so-called "dual" statement. So P2 is the dual<br>
        to P1. As it happens, the duals to P3 and P4 are also true in<br>
        any projective plane, so if we have a set Pts of point and<br>
        Lns of lines, and a 'liesOn' predicate which together<br>
        constitute a projective plane Pi,  then the set Lns, the set<br>
        Pts, and 'contains' /also/ constitute a projective plane, the<br>
        'dual' plane, called Pi*. I've got a locale, "pplane" that<br>
        takes a set of points, a set of lines, and a 'liesOn'<br>
        relation, so this can be stated as<br>
        theorem</p>
<p>This also means that any theorem about projective planes also<br>
        has a 'dual' theorem, gotten by replacing "point" with "line"<br>
        and vice-version, and doing the same for "lies on" and<br>
        "contains". Because the duals of the axioms are also facts,<br>
        we get a conclusion that if some theorem S is true for all<br>
        projective planes, then so is the dual statement.</p>
<p>Hartshorne's little book about projective geometry says it<br>
        like this (please ignore the mention of P5):<br>
        image.png<br>
        More important is the corollary:<br>
        image.png</p>
<p>My question is this: is it possible to formulate such a<br>
        theorem in Isabelle? The statement of the corollary could<br>
        actually be strengthened to say that the /proof/ of S*<br>
        consists of simply dualizing the proof of S (i.e., swap<br>
        point/line, etc., in every fact in that proof).</p>
<p>I haven't, in my wanderings through Isabelle, seen anything<br>
        that seems to do this kind of introspection, i.e., that<br>
        treats an Isabelle proof or statement as an object that can<br>
        be transformed/acted on by various functions, etc. Then<br>
        again, I may simply be looking in the wrong places. I'd<br>
        appreciate any suggestions, *or *reasons why this sort of<br>
        thing cannot be done.<br>
