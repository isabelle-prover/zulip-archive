<p>The cluster of excellence*Hausdorff Center for Mathematics (HCM) *at the <br>
*University of Bonn *brings together researchers in mathematics and its <br>
applications. In this framework the center is looking forward to filling in the <br>
area of theoretical mathematics</p>
<p><em>a permanent W2-Professorship and</em></p>
<p>*a temporary W2-Professorship for five years *</p>
<p>*in the field of *</p>
<p><em>formal mathematics and computer assisted theorem proving.</em>**</p>
<p>* Concerning the temporary W2-Professorship for five years, *we are looking for <br>
young promising researchers holding a doctoral degree, who are developing their <br>
own research agenda and who have already demonstrated scientific excellence <br>
andindependence by publications in the field of formal mathematics and computer <br>
assisted theorem proving. The candidates are expected to contribute to our <br>
teaching program in all phases. German language skills are not required. We seek <br>
candidates with an interdisciplinary profile and international research <br>
experience in the rapidly developing field of computer supported formalization <br>
of mathematics and interactive as well as automated theorem proving at the <br>
interface between theoretical mathematics and computer science.</p>
<p>*Concerning the permanent W2-Professorship, *we in addition expect that <br>
candidates have an already established international research profile <br>
characterized by an outstanding scientific qualification and significant <br>
experience in advancing the field of formal mathematics and computer assisted <br>
theorem proving.</p>
<p>The candidates hired on both positions will become members of the HCM and will <br>
be eligible to further scientific and financial support.</p>
<p>The University of Bonn actively supports diversity and equal opportunities. <br>
The University of Bonn has been certified as a family-friendly university and <br>
