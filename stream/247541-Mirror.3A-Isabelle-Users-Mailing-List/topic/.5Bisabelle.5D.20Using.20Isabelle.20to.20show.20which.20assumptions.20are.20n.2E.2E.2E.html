Hello,</p>
<p>In short: Is it possible to make a program using Isabelle so that you give it a mathematical statement in ZFC and FOL and it creates a proof of it and tells you which axioms are used?</p>
<p>I am a Master of Science in statistics. I consider Helmut Strasser's book "Mathematical theory of statistics: Statistical experiments and asymptotic decision theory" as a good background for statistical experiments. I asked Strasser personally and he said that the book is based on ZFC axioms and First order logic. I would then be interested in understanding ZFC axioms so well that from every statement in the book I could say that which specific axioms are needed in the statement in hand. Is this possible to achieve by using Isabelle and have someone already made this?</p>
<p>I was bedazzled by Isabelle when reading this "Distilling the Requirements of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems with a Proof Assistant" (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-021-09599-8">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-021-09599-8</a>). It was fascinating to see how Isabelle could be used to prove Gödel's theorem. I think proof assistants like Isabelle are crucial in understanding mathematics better.</p>

I am perhaps not the perfect person to answer this, but I'll give it a <br>
shot anyway. Perhaps others who are more knowledgeable than me can weigh <br>
in as well.</p>
<p>I would say probably not. I suppose it depends on the complexity of the <br>
proof of the given statement. But first of all, you have to remember <br>
that Isabelle is an <em>interactive</em> proof assistant, not an automated one. <br>
You don't just give it a statement and then it runs for a bit and will <br>
give you a proof (or not). You have to guide the system in small steps. <br>
 From a user perspective, I would say that there are two main aspects <br>
where the proof assistant actually "assist" you: one, by telling you, in <br>
any given situation, what you still have to show and what facts you have <br>
available; two, by providing automation to "close the gap" from one step <br>
to the next.</p>
<p>So yes, there is some automation that you could use for that, I imagine <br>
it would be fairly easy to use that to build a tool like you envision <br>
inside Isabelle, by adding or dropping axioms or assumptions, running <br>
the automation (e.g. one of the built-in proof methods or sledgehammer <br>
or whatever) and checking whether a proof comes out. But the big problem <br>
that I see here is that just because the system doesn't find a proof <br>
(within a reasonable amount of time) does of course not mean that there <br>
is no proof. For simple propositional statements, this will probably <br>
work, but already for first-order logic I think it is probably not too <br>
hard to find not-too-complex examples that are provable but take the <br>
automation forever to find a proof. So if you're hoping to apply this to <br>
"real" maths and not just toy examples, I don't think that is realistic. <br>
And you might be better of using an automated theorem prover anyway <br>
(although I think they have similar limitations).</p>
<p>What is more realistic is the following process, which is something that <br>
I think many people who work with ITPs can attest (I suspect that's <br>
what's happening in that Gödel paper you mentioned, too): you formalise <br>
some theorem, either from scratch or based on a paper proof. When you're <br>
done, you start playing around with the assumptions of the theorem; <br>
tighten some of the inequalities, drop some assumptions, generalise the <br>
statement, etc. And then you have a look where the existing proof <br>
breaks. Sometimes it doesn't break at all. Sometimes it breaks in a few <br>
places but with some inspection and/or the automation those places are <br>
easily fixed. It is not rare to find that the paper proofs contain <br>
assumptions that are completely unnecessary, i.e. not just such that the <br>
proof is easily repaired when you remove them, but really not used <br>
anywhere in the proof. Similarly, ITPs allow you to refactor proofs much <br>
more painlessly, because you immediately see what breaks and where.</p>
<p>Dually, you also occasionally find <em>missing</em> assumptions, i.e. <br>
assumptions that you have to add for the paper proof to work, or even <br>
for the theorem to hold in the first place. But that's another story…</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer!</p>
<p>Yes I did not take that into account that indeed even if the statements are in a book which every sentence is provable that the system cannot prove in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>Yea I understand that if I can formalise a theorem then I can study its behavior with Isabelle. But yeah I guess I was looking for a more general system that would quickly show me that "This statement X uses these and these axioms of ZFC and FOL" can be pretty difficult. Maybe if I formalise the books general ideas then it could work like you mention.</p>
<p>But so it seems that this has not been attempted or do the automated theorem provers do this kind of things?</p>

dear lauri,</p>
<p>i think your question should instead be: “can this piece of mathematics be proven with substantially less powerful axioms than zfc and fol?  how much weaker can we make the axioms and still prove this?”</p>
<p>for example, much of mathematics doesn't need the axiom of replacement.</p>
<p>a bigger issue that you will face is that much of current work with interactive provers does not start from the axioms of zfc but instead is based on systems like, for example, the calculus of inductive constructions.  of the major interactive provers, isabelle/hol seems to me to be the closest to typical mathematics yet most work in isabelle/hol is not founded on the axioms of zfc.</p>
<p>i hope this perspective is somehow useful.</p>

<p>From: Moritz Roos &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>i want to add to the reply from Joe Wells.<br>
You should certainly read a tiny bit of "elementary" set theory based on<br>
ZFC to get a feel for why basically <em>all</em> the Axioms of ZFC are needed<br>
to found typical mathematics<br>
(okay one can maybe make a case against foundation, replacement and<br>
(atleast strong versions of) choice for some areas, but the rest are<br>
<em>very</em> much needed).<br>
So i fear the answer to most "what do i need" questions will be<br>
"basically all of them" most of the time and this is why Joe already<br>
pointed you at the refined question of "How could we weaken (not fully<br>
delete) the axioms to still prove one singled-out theorem?".</p>
<p>But before you can make sense of any answer to that refined question,<br>
you should consider reading a bit into the axioms of ZFC:<br>
I can wholeheartedly recommend Derek Goldrei's "Classic Set Theory : A<br>
guide to independent study".<br>
He will develop very basic mathematics (construction of what a function<br>
is etc.) and some ordinal number theory showing where which axioms are<br>
used, introducing them step by step as needed.<br>
I have never read a more nicely written book on mathematics before!</p>
<p>Moreover i want to mention the Metamath proof system. It has been<br>
designed with this back-traceability of axioms in mind and is based on<br>
ZFC + FOL.<br>
You can click on any of the already proved theorems, and which axioms<br>
were <em>used</em> (notice however, that this might still be different from<br>
"which axioms are <em>really needed</em>") via recursive unravelling of all<br>
definitions and needed theorems for the proof.<br>
See for example this result about matrices and their adjuncts:<br>
<a href="https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/madurid.html">https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/madurid.html</a> and scroll to the bottom to<br>
"<em>This theorem was proved from axioms:</em>".</p>
<p>If you also want to dive into what reasoning in FOL can look like, i<br>
will recommend the "forall x" book, availible at<br>
<a href="https://www.fecundity.com/logic/">https://www.fecundity.com/logic/</a> (it is free of charge).</p>

Hi!</p>
<p>I highly appreciate your answers! I am very happy that the this mailing list provides a way to contact people who can help.</p>
<p>This way of saying "“can this piece of mathematics be proven with substantially less powerful axioms than zfc and fol? how much weaker can we make the axioms and still prove this?" is something I would be interested, but this could result in a situation where the weaker axiom is not part of ZFC or FOL but would be a different system. Maybe like "how many assumptions we can take away from ZFC &amp; FOL and still prove this?"</p>
<p>It is true that the answer might usually be that "we need all of the assumptions" but I would like to be able to say that rather than assume that most probably that is the answer all the time. Since indeed it might not always be the case and that is interesting.</p>
<p>Those book and website recommendations are very welcome. I have studied mathematics for 5 years in the form of statistics and ZFC axioms have become familiar when thinking about mathematics, but that book might indeed explain things in a very clear way.</p>
<p>Metamath might be something that I am looking for and yes that is a issue that things can be proven in many different ways, but right now one way would suffice even if it is not the one that has least axioms in use.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Lauri Tarpila<br>
PS: Is it enough to just choose "reply" when answering or should I choose "reply all" and add everyone as recipients so that everyone sees my response?<br>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>i want to add to the reply from Joe Wells.<br>
You should certainly read a tiny bit of "elementary" set theory based on ZFC to get a feel for why basically all the Axioms of ZFC are needed to found typical mathematics<br>
(okay one can maybe make a case against foundation, replacement and (atleast strong versions of) choice for some areas, but the rest are very much needed).<br>
So i fear the answer to most "what do i need" questions will be "basically all of them" most of the time and this is why Joe already pointed you at the refined question of "How could we weaken (not fully delete) the axioms to still prove one singled-out theorem?".</p>
<p>But before you can make sense of any answer to that refined question, you should consider reading a bit into the axioms of ZFC:<br>
I can wholeheartedly recommend Derek Goldrei's "Classic Set Theory : A guide to independent study".<br>
He will develop very basic mathematics (construction of what a function is etc.) and some ordinal number theory showing where which axioms are used, introducing them step by step as needed.<br>
I have never read a more nicely written book on mathematics before!</p>
<p>Moreover i want to mention the Metamath proof system. It has been designed with this back-traceability of axioms in mind and is based on ZFC + FOL.<br>
You can click on any of the already proved theorems, and which axioms were used (notice however, that this might still be different from "which axioms are really needed") via recursive unravelling of all definitions and needed theorems for the proof.<br>
See for example this result about matrices and their adjuncts: <a href="https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/madurid.html">https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/madurid.html</a> and scroll to the bottom to "This theorem was proved from axioms:".</p>
<p>If you also want to dive into what reasoning in FOL can look like, i will recommend the "forall x" book, availible at <a href="https://www.fecundity.com/logic/">https://www.fecundity.com/logic/</a> (it is free of charge).</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In short: Is it possible to make a program using Isabelle so that you give it a mathematical statement in ZFC and FOL and it creates a proof of it and tells you which axioms are used?</p>
<p>I am a Master of Science in statistics. I consider Helmut Strasser's book "Mathematical theory of statistics: Statistical experiments and asymptotic decision theory" as a good background for statistical experiments. I asked Strasser personally and he said that the book is based on ZFC axioms and First order logic. I would then be interested in understanding ZFC axioms so well that from every statement in the book I could say that which specific axioms are needed in the statement in hand. Is this possible to achieve by using Isabelle and have someone already made this?</p>
<p>I was bedazzled by Isabelle when reading this "Distilling the Requirements of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems with a Proof Assistant" (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-021-09599-8">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-021-09599-8</a>). It was fascinating to see how Isabelle could be used to prove Gödel's theorem. I think proof assistants like Isabelle are crucial in understanding mathematics better.</p>

I suspect the author was being a bit careless when he said "the book is based on ZFC axioms and First order logic”. I’d be surprised if he refers to any ZF axioms by name. But it’s generally assumed that all mathematics can be developed in ZFC, ergo, so is his book on the theory of statistics. But HOL (as in Isabelle/HOL) is probably a much better formal basis for his book.</p>
<p>If on the other hand you are reading a book about ordinals, cardinals, the Mostowski collapse, Aronszajn trees and such like, then it really is based on the ZFC axioms.</p>
