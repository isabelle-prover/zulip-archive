<p>Call for Papers *<br>
VMCAI 2024 is the 25th International Conference on Verification, Model<br>
Checking, and Abstract Interpretation. The conference will be held on<br>
January 15-16, 2024, in London, UK, co-located with POPL 2024. VMCAI<br>
provides a forum for researchers from the communities of Verification,<br>
Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation, facilitating interaction,<br>
cross-fertilization, and advancement of hybrid methods that combine these<br>
and related areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scope *<br>
The program of VMCAI 2024 will consist of refereed research papers as well<br>
as invited talks. Research contributions can report new results as well as<br>
experimental evaluations and comparisons of existing techniques.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Program Verification</li>
<li>Model Checking</li>

<ul>
<li>Submissions *<br>
Submissions are required to follow Springer’s LNCS format. The page limit<br>
depends on the paper’s category (see below). In each category, additional<br>
material beyond the page limit may be placed in a clearly marked appendix<br>
to be read at the discretion of the reviewers and to be omitted in the<br>
final version. Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting<br>
can be found at the Springer website:<br>
<a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All accepted papers will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in<br>
Computer Science series. Submissions will undergo a single-blind review<br>
process. There will be three categories of papers: regular papers, tool<br>
papers, and case studies. Papers in each category have a different page<br>
limit and will be evaluated differently.</p>
<p>Regular papers clearly identify and justify an advance to the field of<br>
verification, abstract interpretation, or model checking. Where applicable,<br>
they are supported by experimental validation. Regular papers are<br>
restricted to 20 pages in LNCS format, not counting references.</p>
<p>Tool papers present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel extensions<br>
to an existing tool. They should provide a short description of the<br>
theoretical foundations with relevant citations and emphasize the design<br>
and implementation concerns, including software architecture and core data<br>
structures. A regular tool paper should give a clear account of the tool’s<br>
functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities with reference to<br>
the type and size of problems it can handle, describe experience with<br>
realistic case studies, and, where applicable, provide a rigorous<br>
experimental evaluation. Papers that present extensions to existing tools<br>
should clearly focus on the improvements or extensions with respect to<br>
previously published versions of the tool, preferably substantiated by data<br>
on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. Authors are<br>
strongly encouraged to make their tools publicly available and submit an<br>
artifact. Tool papers are restricted to 12 pages in LNCS format, not<br>
counting references.</p>
<p>Case studies are expected to describe the use of verification, model<br>
checking, and abstract interpretation techniques in new application domains<br>
or industrial settings. Papers in this category do not necessarily need to<br>
present original research results but are expected to contain novel<br>
applications of formal methods and techniques as well as an evaluation of<br>
these techniques in the chosen application domain. Such papers are<br>
encouraged to discuss the unique challenges of transferring research ideas<br>
to a real-world setting and reflect on any lessons learned from this<br>
technology transfer experience. Case study papers are restricted to 20<br>
pages in LNCS format, not counting references. (Shorter case study papers<br>
are also welcome.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Artifacts *<br>
VMCAI 2024 allows authors to submit an artifact along with a paper.<br>
Artifacts are any additional material that substantiates the claims made in<br>
the paper, and ideally makes them fully replicable. Artifacts of interest<br>
include (but are not limited to):</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software, Tools, or Frameworks</p>
</li>
<li>Data sets</li>
<li>Test suites</li>
<li>Machine checkable proofs</li>
<li>Any combination of them</li>
<li>Any other artifact described in the paper</li>
</ul>
<p>Artifact submission is optional. However, we highly encourage all authors<br>
to also submit an artifact. A successfully evaluated artifact can increase<br>
your chance of being accepted since the evaluation result of your artifact<br>
is taken into account during the paper review. The artifact will be<br>
evaluated in parallel with the submission by the artifact evaluation<br>
committee (AEC). The AEC will read the paper and evaluate the artifact on<br>
the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>consistency with and replicability of results in the paper,</li>
<li>completeness,</li>
<li>documentation, and</li>
<li>
<p>ease of use.<br>
