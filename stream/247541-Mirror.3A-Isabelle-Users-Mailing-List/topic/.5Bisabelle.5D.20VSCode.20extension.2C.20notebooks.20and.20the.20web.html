<p>From: David Fuenmayor &lt;<a href="mailto:davfuenmayor@gmail.com">davfuenmayor@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
I am a big fan of Isabelle's PIDE and think it was a very smart move to<br>
adopt the notebook-like paradigm for an ITP back in the day (long before<br>
everyone started buzzing about Jupyter notebooks!). However, I feel that<br>
Isabelle has been lagging behind in terms of usability in recent years. Not<br>
only has the bar been raised a lot when it comes to UX and documentation<br>
(interactive tutorials and the like), but notebooks have also been evolving<br>
towards enabling real-time collaborative work (e.g., think of LaTeX before<br>
vs. after Overleaf).</p>
<p>For example, the lack of a web interface for Isabelle is a big pain point<br>
for me, particularly because it has seriously hindered my Isabelle<br>
'proselytising' activities. I've had to turn down offers to introduce<br>
Isabelle to large classrooms simply because I know I will end up spending<br>
most of the time troubleshooting installation problems (from my experience,<br>
at least 5 different sources of trouble for a small 20-person room).<br>
Admittedly, most problems are not Isabelle's, but rather the user's fault<br>
(myriad issues ranging from not enough disk space to overprotective<br>
OS/antivirus). Nonetheless, the deterring effect is the same.</p>
<p>I find it very useful to have a web interface (even if self-hosted) to<br>
showcase Isabelle formalization work for people to quickly review and adapt<br>
(it is difficult to convince people to install desktop software these<br>
days!). On a more ambitious note, I believe that a real-time collaborative<br>
notebook-like ITP could really be a game-changer in maths and logic<br>
teaching (we have tried this for programming using Livebook<br>
&lt;<a href="https://livebook.dev/">https://livebook.dev/</a>&gt; with good results).</p>
<p>I was under the (false?) impression that work on the VSCode extension was a<br>
step towards bringing Isabelle to the web. Is this something on the<br>
roadmap? If so, I would be glad to contribute what I can to make this<br>
happen.</p>

<p>Thanks for the experience report on user exposure. Can you say a bit <br>
more about the target audience? Are people more from Mathematics <br>
background (i.e. weak Windows machine with little memory) or <br>
Computer-Science (i.e. strong Linux or macOS system)?</p>
<p>Over the decades we did foster a bias to the ancient notion of <br>
"engineering workstation", although that now means MacBook Pro Apple <br>
Silicon M2 instead of Sun Sparcstation 10 or 20.</p>

<p>VSCode is an Electron application. The idea of the Electron platform is <br>
to bring typical web technologies to the desktop (HTML/SVG/CSS, Node.js, <br>
Chromium).</p>
<p>So that is a move of the web onto the desktop, not of a desktop <br>
application into the web.</p>

<p>I have had everything in my audience. Although maybe people working in<br>
modal/non-classical logics tend to align with the former stereotype you<br>
mention.<br>
Early undergrad's computers are remarkably heterogeneous!</p>
<p>VSCode is an Electron application. The idea of the Electron platform is<br>
to bring typical web technologies to the desktop (HTML/SVG/CSS, Node.js,<br>
Chromium).</p>
<p>I see. Maybe I am being overspeculative here, since I have no clue how PIDE<br>
is built.<br>
When I first learnt of the VSCode extension, I immediately thought of the<br>
possibility of a Monaco-based web editor (+LSP, etc) for a 'light' subset<br>
of Isabelle's functionalities (enough to motivate people to install the<br>
real thing for big game).<br>
Maybe what I need is already covered in VSCode with the CodeServer<br>
&lt;<a href="https://vscode.dev/">https://vscode.dev/</a>&gt; and/or LiveShare<br>
&lt;<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share">https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share</a>&gt;<br>
functionalities (assuming the current Isabelle VSCode distribution plays<br>
well with that).<br>
In my experience the current VSCode PIDE still has many rough corners.<br>
Functionalities like semantic highlighting are too brittle and break<br>
easily, bold symbols (and sometimes sub/superscripts) are not rendered,<br>
etc. I am looking forward to the next developments and improvements on this<br>
front.</p>

Fun fact: when I first used the ARPANET in the 1970s, one of its advertised purposes was to allow you to run software on someone else’s computer. I wanted to use Macsyma </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macsyma">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macsyma</a></p>
<p>and to do that, you had to log into MIT’s Incompatible Timesharing System. That worked fine, only at 110 baud (bits/sec). A shame we cannot do that with today’s high-speed networks and a dedicated processor somewhere.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Isabelle really is trivial to install. I wish people understood that.</p>

<p>Indeed. Maybe you know the saying by the famous philosopher Karl <br>
Valentin from Munich: "In the good old times, even the future looked <br>
brighter!"</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I do agree, and usually aim at exactly that.</p>
<p>But we do have certain cultural assumptions, e.g. some basic <br>
understanding that hard work needs decent hardware resources.</p>

<p>From: Jeremy Sylvestre &lt;<a href="mailto:jsylvest@ualberta.ca">jsylvest@ualberta.ca</a>&gt;<br>
You can run VS Code over the web in a browser using code-server, which I<br>
believe was open-sourced by Microsoft in 2021. Full IDE in your browser,<br>
works essentially the same as the desktop app.  Before VSCodium was bundled<br>
with Isabelle, when the Isabelle VSCode plugin was standalone and available<br>
in the marketplace, I played around with using Isabelle on an HPC cluster<br>
via code-server. Had code-server/Isabelle running on a compute node in the<br>
cluster, and connected with my browser through a ssh tunnel. It worked<br>
surprisingly well.</p>

<p>Well, Isabelle/VSCode it is all still experimental. There is a difference in a <br>
