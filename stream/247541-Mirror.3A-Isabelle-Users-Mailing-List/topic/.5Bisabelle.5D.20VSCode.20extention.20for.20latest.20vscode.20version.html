<p>From: Jimmy Situ &lt;<a href="mailto:web@jimmystone.cn">web@jimmystone.cn</a>&gt;<br>
Hi, All</p>
<p>I want to install the Isabelle 2022 vscode extension but it reports the extension is not compatible with VS Code 1.78.2</p>
<p>Then I check the package.json in source code in the following link,<br>
<a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/53b59fa42696/src/Tools/VSCode/extension/package.json#l20">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/53b59fa42696/src/Tools/VSCode/extension/package.json#l20</a></p>
<p>It seems only support 1.70.1. Is it compatible with a later version of vscode?<br>
Changing <br>
      "vscode": "1.70.1" <br>
to<br>
      "vscode": "^1.70.1"<br>
is better for compatible later version vscode?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Jimmy Situ</p>

The extension in the extension marketplace is no longer supported, <br>
instead you can start Isabelle/VScode directly from isabelle (see <br>
'isabelle vscode -?').</p>

Drive-by comment, but: why is this? I use many different languages from<br>
vscode and I don't want to be using a separate mechanism just to start<br>
"isabelle/vscode". It sounds like a path back to the jedit days, I don't<br>
want the proof assistant controlling the editor lifetime.</p>

Yes, I'm aware of the technical use of this term. But it is nevertheless<br>
strange to me to be saying that you are developing a proof assistant<br>
interface which is exclusively for use by blind people. And the question<br>
remains: why was the plugin mode deprecated?</p>

Isabelle is indeed the master over the editor, not the other way round. We did <br>
not do this at the start, e.g. with Proof General / Emacs in 1998: In those <br>
archaic times there were constantly problems coming from the non-integration <br>
of the prover and the editor.</p>
<p>Since 2008, our requirement is to make everything just work, without manual <br>
intervention by the user. This requires to "pin" versions, in order to reduce <br>
the space of variation to just 1.</p>
<p>Moreover, Isabelle/VSCode requires a patched version of VSCod(ium) --- just <br>
like Isabelle/jEdit requires a patched version of jEdit.</p>
<p>So indeed, there is only one version of VSCode that Isabelle/VSCode can use: <br>
the one that is bundled with Isabelle. (I will see if I can update that for <br>
Isabelle2023 within the next 2-3 days.)</p>
<p>People who don't like that approach should be honest and don't use it.</p>

Presently, Isabelle/VSCode is merely an experimental PIDE front-end, while <br>
Isabelle/jEdit is the real thing.</p>
<p>Isabelle/VSCode might point into a possible future, but it will require a lot <br>
of work to get it on par with Isabelle/jEdit.</p>
<p>Accessibility is indeed a motivation for that, because VSCode (Chromium, <br>

and never will.</p>
<p>The more Isabelle/VSCode progresses, the more we will rely on a particular <br>
version (and patches for it).</p>
<p>The bundled versions from Isabelle2022 documents the changes as follows in its <br>
README:</p>

This is VSCodium 1.70.1 from <a href="https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium.git">https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium.git</a></p>
<p>It has been built from sources using "isabelle build_vscodium". This applies<br>
a few changes required for Isabelle/VSCode, see "patches" directory for a<br>

It is certainly not exclusive -- the whole purpose is to be inclusive, <br>
and with the small restriction of using the bundled vscode, you can <br>
certainly use it for other purposes (some people like to use <br>
Isabelle/VScode for its vim keybindings plugin).</p>

is not intended to replace Isabelle/jEdit.</p>

now to try to understand what specifically you need from the editor that<br>
requires the base executable to be changed. It seems the main issue is the<br>
fact that isabelle uses a non-standard text encoding. Do I understand<br>
correctly that the utf8_decoder implemented in isabelle_encoding.ts is just<br>
transcoding the files into UTF8? Maybe this encoding could be upstreamed to<br>
vscode, or the extension could contribute a new encoding to the encodings<br>
list. Is there an open issue upstream about this?</p>

<p>I will usually take imperfect integration (e.g. just syntax highlighting)<br>
of my preferred editor over a heavyweight all-in-one solution that doesn't<br>
play well with any of my other tools. (At least you aren't shipping an<br>
OS... yet.) But that's just my preference, and you make it very clear where<br>
I should take my opinions.</p>
<p>What is the last working version of the extension? Perhaps someone else<br>
could keep it alive, imperfect as it is.</p>

<p>Well, there is a fundamental cultural mismatch: VSCode follows the paradigm <br>
"latest is greatest", but that requires a lot of real-time resources to <br>
maintain its many parts. (It ultimately does not work, as I've experienced <br>
many times before, e.g. with Haskell or Scala extensions).</p>
<p>In congtrast to that, Isabelle is about making each release a static closure <br>
of the best we could do at release time. That means all contributing <br>
components will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>(Again: We did not start with that attitude initially. In the wild old days, <br>
we did it like many other projects out there, and delivered much less quality.)</p>

Do I understand correctly that the utf8_decoderimplemented in isabelle_encoding.ts is just transcoding the files into UTF8?

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Now the Isabelle2023 release has required more than 2 weeks. We have <br>
accumulated a bit too much complexity, but in the end everything should fit <br>
together properly --- on all platforms.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago, I did make some attempts to rebuild our bundled version <br>
VSCode, but failed: the cross-build for Windows on Linux stopped working <br>
shortly after our version 1.70.1. It is unclear if this is accidental or <br>
intentional: there is plenty of time to investigate, and nothing is "broken" <br>
in the meantime, because the bundled version works fine (nobody has reported <br>
problems so far).</p>
<p>Concerning the motivation(s) to patch VSCode, here is a list in decreasing <br>
order of importance:</p>
<p>1) Support for Isabelle text encoding as a mapping from Latex-style names <br>
to Unicode points.</p>
<p>2) Support for Isabelle fonts that fit precisely for the Isabelle text <br>
encoding and use high-quality glyphs from LaTeX.</p>
<p>3) Robust system integration: Everything should work on the spot, without <br>
self-assembly or tinkering.</p>
<p>4) Provide side-entries to access the bundled components of VSCode <br>
separately: Electron / Chromium / Node.js (see also <br>
<a href="https://files.sketis.net/Isabelle_Workshop_2022/Isabelle_2022_paper_7.pdf">https://files.sketis.net/Isabelle_Workshop_2022/Isabelle_2022_paper_7.pdf</a>)</p>
<p>More will come over time, as Isabelle/VSCode becomes a more serious contender <br>
of Isabelle/jEdit, not just an experiment on alternative PIDE front-ends.</p>
<p>Of course, almost everything could be done differently. The Isabelle tradition <br>
and culture predates most other cultures that we see today, so things might <br>
look unusual (I would say: usually better).</p>
<p>Often there are also violations of what is today considered "standard" or <br>
"essential". For example, the well-known text book on addictive software <br>
design (from 2014) <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/hooked">https://www.nirandfar.com/hooked</a> says, that the "IKEA <br>
principle" of self-assembly is important to make users feel attached to <br>
"their" product that they have struggled to put together themselves.</p>
<p>I've dismissed that already in 2009, even using the same name "IKEA principle" <br>
as something to be avoided. In German, the counter-principle is called "AEG" <br>
(Auspacken -- Einstecken -- Geht): it means everything works immediately out <br>
of the box.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Just another side-remark for the very start of this mailing list thread: <br>
"compatible later version" is merely an unproven claim of the idea of <br>
"semantic versioning" that is so strongly emphasized in the Node.js and VSCode <br>
communities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this concept does not hold its promise!</p>
<p>I was very open to it initially (around 2017), when working with VSCode for <br>
the first time. Later I have seen it fail often and routinely.</p>
<p>In Isabelle we do it differently (and better): There is exactly one version of <br>
every contributing component, and that is tested over several months to ensure <br>
that it really works (on all platforms). There are no implicit updates of <br>
seemingly "compatible" components. (Both Docker and NixOS follow a similar <br>
approach.)</p>

<p>So are you using Isabelle on VSCode seriously?</p>
<p>I've heard rumors that a few Isabelle users have managed to use it <br>
productively, although I find it hard to believe: Isabelle/VSCode is still a <br>
small experiment, and not a proper Prover IDE yet.</p>

live in the Isabelle world".</p>

<p>That is a misunderstanding. For using Isabelle, you merely need to use <br>
Isabelle. E.g. Isabelle/jEdit or Isabelle/VSCode as front-end. There is no <br>

    possibilities<br>

    take a single browser version into account (not 20).</p>
<p>I see you want to keep with the vendor lock-in effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also don't like the predominance of the Chromium engine.</p>
<p>Over some decades, web browsers have promised "independence" that they never <br>
delivered. In recent years, the situation has become particularly bad for <br>
Firefox: Chromium has taken over a lot of its former territory.</p>
<p>For everyday web browsing, I now use both Firefox and Chromium, whichever <br>
happens to work better. At some point, I might even have to retire Firefox.</p>
<p>For Isabelle, I don't want to see this browser non-compatibility problem at <br>
all. If (or when) we do HTML things seriously, it will be for precisely one <br>
browser engine: the one that is bundled with Isabelle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that semantic versioning is a specific thing, just because a project has <br>
version numbers doesn't mean it is using semantic versioning. Especially the <br>
older projects, since semver only became popular around 2010 or so, so <br>
anything older was probably already invested in its existing versioning system.</p>

"things get better when numbers go up" which seemed to be the status quo from <br>
2000's software. It is primarily about API compatibility, which makes it well <br>
suited to ecosystems like npm modules.</p>

<p>I did take a close look and the "semver" specification around 2017 / 2018, and <br>
gave these guys a huge bonus, assuming that reality fits to their promises.</p>

I just wanted to add that I wrote thousands of lines Isabelle/HOL and <br>
Isabelle/ML in VSCode and here my top 2 annoyances:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Jumping from one file to another one (e.g. using ctrl+click) and then <br>
going back kills the syntax highlighting (until an arbitrary change to <br>
the file is made; it then recovers).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message formatting in the output panel is not working properly when <br>
compared to jEdit (e.g. proof states).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But other than that, I'm much quicker in VSCode because I get to have <br>
Vim keybindings :)</p>

I am not a VSCode user (I am mostly an Emacs dinosaur), but as a result of this thread I got the idea<br>
to fire up Isabelle/VSCode.  The first thing I noticed (to my dismay) was that the color scheme is completely<br>
different from the Isabelle/JEdit color scheme, both for light and dark themes.  Is there any good reason for<br>
this?  After a number of years of using Isabelle/JEdit, my brain is now hard-wired to recognize the subtle<br>
color changes that indicate free variables and so on.  Is there an easy way to load a file that sets<br>
the color scheme used in the Isabelle/JEdit light theme?  I don't really feel like converting a bunch<br>
of hex RGB codes to decimal and entering them in the preferences window of VSCode.</p>
<p>The other thing I noticed is that when selecting "Document" display the syntax coloring only extended<br>
by about one window's worth of code and it would not color the rest even when I scrolled down into it.<br>
I should mention that I typically use Isabelle via remote desktop to a headless system, and I do observe<br>
some glitches involving window repaint, but I have typically not regarded them as Isabelle's fault.</p>

<p>I work with Isabelle/jEdit to work on having a "smt (cvc5)" tactic and I <br>

    inconsistently however). I know at least one other user who faced<br>

<li>
<p>It crashes regularly during freezing (more than once a day), losing<br>
    work each time (autosave does not work <em>and</em> keybindings for save do<br>
    not work <em>and</em> saving with the mouse does not work anymore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy-paste does not work consistently (I resorted to press it 3<br>
    times and hope for each copying)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have to use the mouse to find the windows (like the search window<br>
    that does not get the focus when covered by another window)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current position in the buffers (like the output buffer) is not<br>
    saved and lost, so I have to search again for what I was currently<br>
    looking. And search does not work there (yes, there is something<br>
    called "search", but it is only a highlighting box that takes some<br>
    kind of regexp as input, making it useless to search for terms)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>None of these issues is new, nor is a regression over the last Isabelle <br>
version… and still this is now how I image the AEG principle at all.</p>
<p>Overall, my choice is between a bad "Prover IDE" experience and a bad <br>
text-editor experience. I picked the former, as working around <br>
limitations is possible.</p>

see Isabelle returning into "extension space". That game is over.</p>

<p>That sounds all very bad. You have occasionally told me about a few of <br>
these observations, but not the whole list.</p>
<p>There must be something very special in your OS setup that is preventing <br>

<p>No, the main reason is just historical accidence. The jEdit text editor <br>
had a very good "light" theme when the distinction of "light" vs. "dark" <br>
did not exist. VSCode is quite different themes.</p>
<p>My plan is to unify this eventually:</p>
<p>* refine the traditional Isabelle/jEdit color scheme into something <br>
that can be used as "light theme" for both Isabelle/jEdit and <br>
Isabelle/VSCode</p>
<p>* find a VSCode "dark" scheme that can be turned into a uniform one <br>
for both editors</p>
<p>That would be one more step away from the "experimental" status of <br>
Isabelle/VSCode.</p>

<p>The other thing I noticed is that when selecting "Document" display the syntax coloring only extended<br>

I should mention that I typically use Isabelle via remote desktop to a headless system, and I do observe<br>
some glitches involving window repaint, but I have typically not regarded them as Isabelle's fault.</p>

<p>I am unsure what you mean exactly. Note that scrolling events are not <br>
exposed to VSCode extensions (at least that was the state some years <br>
ago). Only actual cursor movement counts for the display engine.</p>
<p>(Maybe that is another motivation for funny patches to the VSCodium code <br>
base, although it makes me feel uneasy already.)</p>

Just to provide a record of what I was talking about, see the attached screenshot.<br>
I got there by opening the theory file, selecting the "Preview" mode using an icon at the<br>
upper right, and then scrolling down by one-half a view.  You can see that the upper half<br>
of the view is colored and the lower half is not.  Clicking the mouse on the uncolored portion<br>
does not cause any change.</p>
