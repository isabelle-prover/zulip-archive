Why Can't We Divide by Zero?</p>

<p>The common beliefs about the impossibility of division by zero, the<br>
indeterminate discussions, the reasons for the inability, and the<br>
computational troubles – all these are obvious. Mathematicians would think<br>
it's absurd to debate about them since they can be understood in about<br>
three seconds.</p>
<p>However, dividing by zero actually has a new meaning and reveals a vast<br>
world. When it comes to dividing by zero, there is another interpretation.<br>
This is the new meaning of division by zero.</p>
<p>These definitions and meanings are guaranteed by the three golden rules of<br>
division by zero, and their usefulness extends to all areas of mathematics.</p>
<p>In fact, the division by zero is inherently obvious from the meaning of<br>
zero itself. The sense of zero encompasses meanings like nothingness,<br>
absence, inability, standard, and so on.</p>
<p>To divide by zero means not dividing at all. Thus, there is no number to be<br>
allocated, resulting in zero.</p>
<p>Today marks the 11th anniversary of the birth of 1/0 = 0/0 = 0.</p>
<p>When contemplating the answer to the question "What is 100/0?", we realized<br>
that the result was self-evident from the formula we had been studying<br>
without recognition. Everything was obvious, not in three seconds, but<br>
instantaneously.</p>
