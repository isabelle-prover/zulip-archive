<p>Women in Logic 2023 is a satellite event of the 8th International Conference <br>
on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction (FSCD 2023) to be held <br>
in Rome, Italy, from July 1 to July 6, 2023.</p>
<p>The Women in Logic workshop (WiL) provides an opportunity to increase<br>
awareness of the valuable contributions made by women in the area of<br>
logic in computer science. Its main purpose is to promote the excellent<br>
research done by women, with the ultimate goal of increasing their<br>
visibility and representation in the community. Our aim is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>provide a platform for female researchers to share their work and<br>
achievements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the feelings of community and belonging, especially among<br>
junior faculty, post-docs and students through positive interactions<br>
with peers and more established faculty;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish new connections and collaborations;</p>
</li>
<li>foster a welcoming culture of mutual support and growth within the<br>
logic research community.<br>
We believe these aspects will benefit women working in logic and computer<br>
science, particularly early-career researchers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Previous versions of Women in Logic (Reykjavík 2017, Oxford 2018, <br>
Vancouver 2019, Paris 2020, Rome 2021, and Haifa 2022) were very successful <br>
in showcasing women's work and as catalysts for a recognition of the need <br>
for change in the community.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to: automata theory, <br>
automated deduction, categorical models and logics, concurrency <br>
and distributed computation, constraint programming, constructive <br>
mathematics, database theory, decision procedures, description logics, <br>
domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects of program analysis, <br>
formal methods, foundations of computability, games and logic, <br>
higher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic, <br>
logic in artificial intelligence, logic programming, logical aspects <br>
of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational complexity, <br>
logical aspects of quantum computation, logical frameworks, logics <br>
of programs, modal and temporal logics, model checking, probabilistic <br>
systems, process calculi, programming language semantics, proof theory, <br>
real-time systems, reasoning about security and privacy, rewriting, <br>
type systems and type theory, and verification.</p>
