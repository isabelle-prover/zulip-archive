             29th international Conference on Automated Deduction<br>
                               July 1-5, 2023<br>
                          Co-Located with FSCD 2023<br>

<hr>
<p>THedu'23 Scope:</p>
<p>Computer Theorem Proving is becoming a paradigm as well as a<br>
   technological base for a new generation of educational software in<br>
   science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The workshop brings<br>
   together experts in automated deduction with experts in education in<br>
   order to further clarify the shape of a new software generation and<br>
   to discuss existing systems.</p>
<p>Invited Speaker</p>
<p>Yves Bertot, INRIA, Sophia Antipolis</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
<p>* Extended Abstracts:  10 April 2023<br>
  * Author Notification:  8 May 2023<br>
  * Workshop Day:         5 July 2023</p>
<p>Topics of interest include:</p>
<p>* interactive and automated theorem provers designed or adapted<br>
    for education;</p>
<p>* methods of automated deduction applied to checking students' input;<br>
  * methods of automated deduction applied to prove post-conditions<br>
    for particular problem solutions;</p>
<p>* combinations of deduction and computation enabling systems to<br>
    propose next step guidance;</p>
<p>* combination of symbolic artificial intelligence and machine<br>
    learning for the teaching of proof and proving;</p>
<p>* design of libraries of statements and/or formal proofs for use<br>
     in educational systems;</p>
<p>* graphical user interfaces for use in the classroom;<br>
  * specific systems integrated in educational components such as<br>
    dynamic geometry software, automatic provers providing readable<br>
    output or explicit counter examples, etc.;</p>
<p>* the role of logic and formal systems in the didactic of proof<br>
    and proving in mathematics education;</p>
<p>* experience reports about the use of automatic or interactive<br>
    theorem provers for teaching.</p>
<p>Submission</p>
<p>We welcome submission of extended abstracts and demonstration<br>
   proposals presenting original unpublished work which is not been<br>
   submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>
<p>All accepted extended abstracts and demonstrations will be presented<br>
   at the workshop. Abstracts will be made available online.</p>
<p>Extended abstracts and demonstration proposals should be submitted<br>
   via easychair,<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu23">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu23</a><br>
   formatted according tohttp://www.easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip</p>
<p>Extended abstracts and demonstration proposals should be 5 pages<br>
   (+|-1) in length and are to be submitted in PDF format.</p>
<p>At least one of the authors of each accepted extended<br>
   abstract/demonstration proposal is expected to attend THedu'23 and<br>
   presents their extended abstract/demonstration.</p>
