Subject: Educational and Civilizational Statement on Division by Zero</p>
<p>Reproducing Kernel Institute Statement No. 695 (2022.8.26 / Mika 101:<br>
2025.10.24)</p>
<p>“The Sadness of the Mathematical World – On the Responsibility of Teachers<br>
and the Division by Zero Problem”</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Background: A Crisis in Mathematical Education</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite centuries of tradition, mathematics education still teaches that<br>
“division by zero is impossible.”<br>
Videos, textbooks, and lectures repeat this statement without reflection.<br>
Yet few ask why it must be so, and whether this prohibition arises from<br>
true logic or from convention.</p>
<p>This uncritical repetition reveals a deeper problem:</p>
<p>Mathematics is taught as memorization, not reasoning.</p>
<p>Students learn what to think, not how to think.</p>
<p>Teachers are forced to preserve a convention rather than explore truth.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>A New Perspective: From Impossibility to Possibility</li>
</ol>
<p>Historically, “division” has been defined as the inverse of multiplication.<br>
Under that narrow view, dividing by zero is undefined.<br>
However, in modern analysis—via the Moore–Penrose inverse and Tikhonov<br>
regularization—new formulations naturally lead to finite, consistent<br>
results even when the divisor is zero.</p>
<p>1 / 0 = 0 , z / 0 = 0</p>
<p>This is not a paradox but a revelation: what was deemed impossible may<br>
simply have been defined too narrowly.<br>
Mathematical history itself is the story of transforming impossibilities<br>
into possibilities—irrational numbers, imaginary numbers, non-Euclidean<br>
geometry.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Ethical Duty of Educators</li>
</ol>
<p>Educators bear moral responsibility to distinguish between:</p>
<p>The classical, official doctrine (“division by zero is undefined”)</p>
<p>The emerging theory (“under a new framework, division by zero yields a<br>
definable value”)</p>
<p>In classrooms, it is appropriate to teach the classical rule—but equally<br>
essential to say:</p>
<p>“A new idea exists, though it is not yet officially adopted. Mathematics<br>
evolves.”</p>
<p>Such honesty prevents confusion, encourages inquiry, and preserves the<br>
integrity of education.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Mathematical Community’s Responsibility</li>
</ol>
<p>The mathematical community must not silence unconventional discoveries by<br>
inertia or neglect.<br>
To ignore new reasoning without examination contradicts the very spirit of<br>
mathematics.</p>
<p>True research demands openness, curiosity, and the humility to re-examine<br>
“obvious truths.”<br>
Suppressing new logic is not conservatism—it is anti-intellectualism.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="5">
<li>Educational Implications and Reform Proposals</li>
</ol>
<p>Stage-Based Teaching:<br>
Explain “why undefined” differently at each level—conceptually for<br>
children, analytically for advanced students.</p>
<p>Critical Thinking:<br>
Ask students why they believe division by zero is impossible; encourage<br>
them to explore boundary cases.</p>
<p>Historical Context:<br>
Present division by zero as today’s version of the “heliocentric<br>
revolution” in mathematics.</p>
<p>Transparency in Academia:<br>
Teach how new theories become accepted—through discussion, publication, and<br>
collective verification.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="6">
<li>Concluding Reflection</li>
</ol>
<p>Mathematics is a living discipline.<br>
To love truth is to challenge our definitions.<br>
If a new definition allows what was once forbidden, it is not heresy—it is<br>
progress.</p>
<p>The “division by zero” problem is not merely a calculation—it is a test of<br>
our intellectual honesty and our educational conscience.</p>
<p>“Those who love truth must never fear to redefine the impossible.”</p>

Subject: [isabelle] 2nd CfP: Functional and Logic Programming (FLOPS)<br>
 (Deadline Dec 8)</p>
<p>======================================================================</p>
<p><strong>* FLOPS 2026 - Call For Papers </strong>*<br>
   18th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming</p>
<p>May 26-28, 2026, Akita, Japan</p>
<p><a href="https://functional-logic.org/events/flops/2026/">https://functional-logic.org/events/flops/2026/</a></p>
<p>======================================================================</p>
<p>FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and implementers<br>
of declarative programming, to discuss mutually interesting results and<br>
common problems: theoretical advances, their implementations in language<br>
systems and tools, and applications of these systems in practice. The<br>
scope includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory,<br>
applications, implementations, and teaching of declarative programming.<br>
FLOPS specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization between theory<br>
and practice and among different styles of declarative programming.</p>
<p>Previous FLOPS meetings were held at Fuji Susono (1995), Shonan Village<br>
(1996), Kyoto (1998), Tsukuba (1999), Tokyo (2001), Aizu (2002), Nara<br>
(2004), Fuji Susono (2006), Ise (2008), Sendai (2010), Kobe (2012),<br>
Kanazawa (2014), Kochi (2016), Nagoya (2018), Akita (2020, online),<br>
Kyoto (2022, online), and Kumamoto (2024).</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of declarative programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>functional, logic, functional-logic programming, rewriting systems,<br>
formal methods and model checking, program transformations and program<br>
refinements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing programs with the help of theorem provers or<br>
SAT/SMT solvers, verifying properties of programs using declarative<br>
programming techniques, or statistical methods including generative<br>
AI (*);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>foundations, language design, implementation issues (compilation<br>
techniques, memory management, run-time systems, etc.), applications and<br>
case studies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of declarative<br>
programming. Therefore, research papers must be written to be<br>
understandable by a wide audience of declarative programmers and<br>
researchers. In particular, each submission should explain its<br>
contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying<br>
what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its<br>
area, and comparing it with previous work. Submission of system<br>
descriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged.</p>
<p>(*) Note that FLOPS is a Programming Languages conference.<br>
Submissions should be accessible to a Programming Languages audience.<br>
The Program Committee has been selected from that audience, and it may<br>
be unable to gauge the quality of your submission if that requires<br>
specialized competencies in statistical methods and/or AI.  Special<br>
attention should also be paid to the reproducibility of the results<br>
from public sources.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION</p>
<p>Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will be<br>
judged on originality, correctness, and significance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System descriptions: they should describe a working system and will be<br>
judged on originality, usefulness, and design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or theories<br>
with illustrative applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked as<br>
such in the title.</p>
<p>Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>
elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally<br>
published workshops proceedings may be submitted. Authors must follow<br>
Springer’s Code of Conduct. See also the ACM SIGPLAN Republication<br>
Policy. At least one author of each accepted paper should plan to<br>
attend the conference in person to present the work: there will be no<br>
general facility for online or pre-recorded presentation (but we will<br>
do our best to accommodate visa issues and similar unavoidable<br>
obstacles).</p>
<p>Submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages<br>
excluding references, though system descriptions and pearls are<br>
typically shorter. The formatting has to conform to Springer’s<br>
guidelines. Regular research papers should be supported by proofs<br>
and/or experimental results. In case of lack of space, this supporting<br>
information should be made accessible otherwise (e.g., a link to a<br>
web page or an appendix, which does not count towards the<br>
page limit). However, it is the responsibility of the authors to<br>
guarantee that their paper can be understood and appreciated without<br>
referring to this supporting information; reviewers may simply choose<br>
not to look at it when writing their review.</p>
<p>For more details, see</p>
<p><a href="https://functional-logic.org/events/flops/2026/">https://functional-logic.org/events/flops/2026/</a></p>
<p>Papers should be submitted electronically at</p>
<p><a href="https://meteor.springer.com/FLOPS2026">https://meteor.springer.com/FLOPS2026</a></p>
<p>Reviewing will be single-blind.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION</p>
<p>The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series. We<br>
expect to invite the authors of a selection of the best papers to submit<br>
an extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue which will<br>
appear in the Science of Computer Programming journal.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12).</p>
<p>Abstracts due         Dec 8, 2025<br>
Submission deadline   Dec 15, 2025<br>
Notifications         Feb 2, 2026<br>
