<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>
Abstract submission:              25 May 2023<br>
Paper submission:                 1 June 2023<br>
Acceptance notification:       10 August 2023<br>
iFM 2023 main conference: 13-15 November 2023</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE<br>
In the last decades, we have witnessed a proliferation of approaches<br>
that integrate several modelling, verification and simulation<br>
techniques, facilitating more versatile and efficient analysis of<br>
software-intensive systems. These approaches provide powerful support<br>
for the analysis of different functional and non-functional properties<br>
of the systems, complex interaction of components of different nature as<br>
well as validation of diverse aspects of system behaviour. The iFM<br>
conference series is a forum for discussing recent research advances in<br>
the development of integrated approaches to formal modelling and<br>
analysis. The conference covers all aspects of the design of integrated<br>
techniques, including language design, verification and validation,<br>
automated tool support and the use of such techniques in software<br>
engineering practice. To credit the effort of tool developers, we use<br>
EAPLS artefact badging &lt;<a href="https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/">https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>Areas of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>* Formal and semi-formal modelling notations<br>
  * Combining formal methods with different performance, simulation and<br>
    system analysis techniques</p>
<p>* Program verification, model checking, and static analysis<br>
  * Theorem proving, decision procedures and SAT/SMT solving<br>
  * Runtime analysis, monitoring and testing<br>
  * Program synthesis<br>
  * Modelling, analysis and synthesis of cyber-physical, hybrid,<br>
    embedded, probabilistic, distributed or concurrent systems</p>
<p>* Abstraction and refinement<br>
  * Model learning and inference<br>
  * Approaches to integrating formal methods into software engineering<br>
    practice or industry</p>
<p>* Approaches to integrating formal methods into standardisation or<br>
    certification processes</p>
<p>* Formal methods for AI<br>
  * Tools and case studies supporting the integration of formal methods</p>
<p>PAPER CATEGORIES<br>
iFM 2023 solicits high-quality papers reporting research results and/or<br>
experience reports related to the overall theme of formal methods<br>
integration.</p>
<p>We accept papers in the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Regular papers (limit 16 pages) on</p>
<p>* original scientific research results<br>
    * tools, their foundation and evaluations<br>
    * applications of formal methods, including rigorous evaluations</p>
<p>(2) Short papers (limit 6 pages) on</p>
<p>* any subject of interest in the area of formal methods that can be<br>
      described with sufficient detail within the page limit</p>
<p>All page limits exclude the references. Appendices may be included, but<br>
they will only be read by a reviewer at their discretion.</p>
<p>Regular and short papers must be original, unpublished, and not<br>
submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will undergo a thorough<br>
review process. Submissions will be judged on the basis of significance,<br>
relevance, correctness, originality and clarity.</p>
<p>The submissions will be reviewed and selected for publication based on<br>
the above mentioned criteria as well as suitability to the conference’s<br>
technical program.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES<br>
Submissions for all categories should be made using the iFM 2023<br>
EasyChair site <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2023</a></p>
<p>Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files.</p>
<p>Springer requires that authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines<br>
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the <br>
preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their <br>
ORCIDs in their papers. After a paper is accepted, the corresponding author <br>
of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must <br>
complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author <br>
signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked <br>
on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating <br>
to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.</p>
<p>The conference proceedings will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes<br>
in Computer Science series. We will apply for a special issue of the Formal <br>
Aspects of Computing journal for extended versions of selected papers from <br>
iFM 2023, as well as a special issue of the Original Software Publication <br>
track in Science of Computer Programming (see EAPLS Artifact Badging below).</p>
<p>All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. At least one<br>
author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by the<br>
early registration date.</p>
<p>EAPLS ARTEFACT BADGING<br>
Reproducibility of experiments is crucial to foster an atmosphere of<br>
open, reusable and trustworthy research. To improve and reward<br>
reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of<br>
tool developers in our community, authors of accepted papers will be<br>
invited to submit possible artefacts associated with their paper for<br>
evaluation, and based on the level of reproducibility they will be<br>
awarded one or more badges. See <a href="https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/">https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/</a>. <br>
Artefact submission is optional and the result of the artefact evaluation <br>
will not alter the paper’s acceptance decision.</p>
<p>To credit the effort of tool developers, we plan to apply for a special<br>
issue of the Original Software Publication track in Science of Computer <br>
Programming. Authors of selected artefacts will be invited to contribute <br>
to this issue.</p>
