dear experts in writing academic papers connected to isabelle,</p>
<p>a reviewer of a paper using somewhat isabelle-inspired syntax complained<br>
about too much “type theory slang” that “makes it very hard for someone<br>
not deeply in that world”.  (i think this reviewer has likely not been<br>
asked to review papers on homotopy type theory.)</p>
<p>we promised this reviewer that we would make various changes and they<br>
graciously raised their -2 reject to a 0 neutral and our paper was<br>
accepted on the strength of the other reviews.</p>
<p>one of the changes we promised was that we would attempt to include<br>
better explanations of higher-order abstract syntax.</p>
<p>are there any papers that explain this aspect of isabelle in a way that<br>
you find particularly good?  we would like to see how they do it.  can<br>
you recommend good examples?  ideally short papers, as we only have 16<br>
pages lncs format.</p>
<p>thanks for any advice you can give.</p>
<p>best wishes,</p>
<p>joe</p>

Hello,</p>
<p>I don't know what your paper is about and what "type theory slang" it <br>
contains. I don't think anyone needs to know a lot of type theory to <br>
understand <em>applications</em> of Isabelle; papers <em>about</em> Isabelle itself <br>
may be another matter (albeit still fairly simple compared to, as you <br>
rightly said, something like Homotopy Type Theory). But then one would <br>
be justified in saying that the reader of such a paper can be expected <br>
to know a bit about types.</p>
<p>Well, it's hard to say without knowing the context of that remark. But I <br>
for one have never gotten such complaints even in non-theorem-proving <br>
venues like ISSAC. Perhaps you just had bad luck with your reviewer?</p>
<p>Anyway, regarding your question: could you explain what you mean by <br>
"higher-order abstract syntax" in the context of Isabelle? Are you <br>
talking about the way terms are represented in Isabelle internally?</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

Either you run into the wrong reviewer or you submitted to the wrong<br>
conference, but I am not going to debate about that.</p>
<p>Please feel free to check Isabelle papers published in ITP.</p>
<p>I ran into similar situations when I publish in certain  communities that<br>
are supposed to be Formal Methods communities, however they have a hard<br>
time to understand what Isabelle actually is.</p>
<p>They think that the executable document model that Isabelle offers, and its<br>
extenstion to a proof document for higher order logic (Isabelle/HOL), is<br>
just a kind of source code and should not appear in the paper.</p>
<p>I hope one day they understand what ISAR is, and that Isabelle offers a<br>
universal notation for logic when implemented on a machine, and it follows<br>
mike gordon book introduction to HOL to some extent.</p>
<p>But I will not spend my time convincing “formal methods” communities to<br>
understand that.</p>
<p>What I usually try to do is to translate what I  have to a text book like<br>
notations,eg., relational notations and a like.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Yakoub.</p>

<p>From: Tobias Nipkow &lt;<a href="mailto:nipkow@in.tum.de">nipkow@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
The use of higher-order abstract syntax, i.e. lambda terms, to express variable <br>
binding operators is absolutely standard and Isabelle is just one of many <br>
systems that employ this technique. Essentially, the idea goes back to Church: <br>
in his 1932 paper on lambda calculus he introduces constants for existential and <br>
universal quantifiers that take functions as arguments. The idea was (first?) <br>
implemented in Automath. The name probably goes back to Frank Pfenning's highly <br>
influential eponymous paper.</p>
<p>I am sure you are well aware of all of this. The idea of higher-order abstract <br>
syntax is really quite basic, once you understand lambda calculus, and I don't <br>
see that you need a lot of space to explain it. Most certainly there is nothing <br>
special about Isabelle in this respect - except that Larry was one of the first <br>
people to implement higher order unification as a means for automating <br>
deductions involving lamda the terms.</p>

yes, exactly.</p>
<p>i am wondering if there is a standard chunk of text (2 or 3 sentences, <br>
perhaps a displayed formula or 2) that can be given (with some <br>
variation) to help mathematicians read this stuff.</p>
<p>of course, i can write such explanations, but i was wondering if there <br>
were two or three papers that people thought did an especially good job <br>
of it.</p>
<p>thanks for any examples any of you can point me toward.</p>
<p>best wishes</p>

Let me echo Manuel's remark: "[ways to] help mathematicians read *this<br>
stuff*" would be much easier to provide if you'd tell us explicitly, by at<br>
least 2 or 3 examples, exactly what "this stuff" is. Go ahead and paste in<br>
a paragraph of the paper you wrote! Please!</p>
