<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>I noticed the following behavior: If I have a theorem /test///that uses <br>
/sorry/, then /thm_oracles test/ should (and usually does) mention <br>
/skip_proof/ to indicate that /sorry /was used. (And any other oracles <br>
that were used.)</p>
<p>However, when using the Types_To_Sets, the use of /sorry/ can be hidden. <br>
For example:</p>
<p>lemma test: ‹∃Rep Abs. type_definition Rep Abs {0::nat} ⟹ 1=2› sorry<br>
    lemmas test2 = test[cancel_type_definition]<br>
    thm_oracles test2<em>(</em> Only shows the oracle<br>
<strong>/cancel_type_definition/ not /skip_proof///</strong>*) *</p>
<p>The likely reason for this is that <br>
/Local_Typedef.cancel_type_definition/ takes the given theorem, checks <br>
whether it is suitable to derive the desired theorem, and then throws it <br>
away and only returns the desired theorem, created via oracle. The <br>
result is that the original theorem and its proof are lost from the <br>
proofterms.</p>
<p>This also has negative effects on a hypothetical external proofchecker <br>
(or proof-translator). If the original proofterm was still available, it <br>
could replay the proof of that and check externally whether <br>
/cancel_type_definition///did the right thing. (For example, I am <br>
working on a converter to Lean. In the calculus of constructions, what <br>
Types_To_Sets does it most likely provable, but one does need the full <br>
proof them.)</p>
<p>I see two possible fixes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Extend the datatype of proofterms in Isabelle such that the<br>
    constructor /Proofterm.Oracle/ has an additional argument of type<br>
    /thm list/ that can track all theorems that went into the oracle.<br>
    This would be very nice because it would provide a general framework<br>
    for oracles that has assumptions. But it needs changing the format<br>
    of proofterms and is not a local change to Types_To_Sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or, change Types_To_Sets only: Change the ML function<br>
    /cancel_type_definition_cterm/ /thm/ such that// when /thm/ is of<br>
    the form /∃Rep Abs. type_definition Rep Abs S ==&gt; P/, it returns not<br>
    /P/ as it does now, but instead /(//∃Rep Abs. type_definition Rep<br>
    Abs S ==&gt; P) ==&gt; P/. And then change /cancel_type_definition/ so<br>
    that it discharges the assumption using the theorem that was input.<br>
    Logically, this is not "more sound" than what is done previously,<br>
    but it makes sure the original theorem is still to be found in the<br>
    proofterm (and /thm_oracles/ finds it.) If needed, I could help out<br>
    this fix.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>
