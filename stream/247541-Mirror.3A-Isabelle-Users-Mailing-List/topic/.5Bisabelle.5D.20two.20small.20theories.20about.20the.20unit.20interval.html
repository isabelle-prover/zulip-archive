Dear all,</p>
<p>find attached two little theories related to fractional parts.<br>
The first one are useful facts about arithmetic of frac, which, somewhat <br>
surprisingly, seem not available in the current distribution.<br>
The second one contains motivation for the first one, namely the <br>
interpretation of the addition modulo one as an Abelian group.</p>
<p>Is this of a general interest?</p>
<p>Stepan</p>
<p>P.S.: I also have a third little theory showing that the unit interval <br>
is an abstract metric space with the obvious circular distance (the only <br>
nontrivial part being the triangle inequality). However,  importing the  <br>
"HOL-Analysis.Abstract_Metric_Spaces" takes quite some time, and the <br>
theory is used only twice in HOL, and never in AFP.<br>
BTW, the time required for import is hardly necessary. <br>
Abstract_Metric_Spaces.thy itself takes over 5 minutes on my machine, <br>
and it contains proofs requiring many seconds. These are mostly familiar <br>
time consuming smt one-liners most likely found by sledgehammer.<br>
For example, line 3995<br>
       by (smt (verit, ccfv_threshold) comp_apply f g Pi_iff <br>
uniformly_continuous_map_def)<br>
taking over 7 sec. can be reduced to under 100ms by<br>
   using f g<br>
   unfolding uniformly_continuous_map_def comp_apply Pi_iff<br>
   by metis.</p>

Dear Stepan, thanks for the fractional part material, which I’d like to incorporate into the repository. Also thanks for the suggestions to improve the build time of Abstract_Metric_Spaces, Which I have also incorporated. But remember, unless you are a developer (i.e. working with a regularly changing code base), you only ever have to build HOL-Analysis once.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see your third example. </p>

Dear Larry,</p>
<p>thanks for you feedback. I enclose the third theory (I should mention <br>
this is a joint work with Stepan Starosta). The theory also includes an <br>
alternative approach using quotient_type of reals. I will appreciate any <br>
comment concerning the comparison of the two approaches. My impression <br>
is that the locale  approach is (and is considered) the better and more <br>
flexible option, although it requires a lot of superscripts and carriers...<br>
As I mentioned in am older post (which went unnoticed) an intermediate <br>
goal was to show that an irrational number generates a dense subgroup of <br>
the real unit interval. As far as I can see, existing theories, <br>
including the abstract spaces are not of much help. I will be happy if I <br>
am wrong.</p>
<p>Two more comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>yes, I am aware of the possibility to build the heap of the persistent <br>
heap of HOL-Analysis. Just a side remark: if I am not missing something <br>
basic, this is inconvenient not only for development, but also for <br>
exploring. I imagine a situation in which I want to see or show somebody <br>
how reals are defined, running into "Cannot update finished theory" with <br>
very little possibilities, an have to restart, and wait anyway if I want <br>
to see more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in general, the situation is quite common that sledgehammer comes with <br>
some crazy looking smt proof which takes ages, but it is quite <br>
straightforward to unpack it into a super fast proof, which moreover <br>
gives the right insight. I wonder whether this process could be somehow <br>
facilitated. To start with, we use a macro written by Martin Raska which <br>
transforms "by (smt A B C)" into "using A B C by smt" (and the same for <br>
metis)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Stepan</p>
