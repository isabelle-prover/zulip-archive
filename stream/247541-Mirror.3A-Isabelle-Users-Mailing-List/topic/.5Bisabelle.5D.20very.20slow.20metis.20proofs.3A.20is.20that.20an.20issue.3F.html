<p>brings it down to practically zero.</p>

<p>Yes, some proof refactoring could be automated if one was to invest the <br>
time into writing a tool. Many heuristics could be used including AI, <br>
Sledgehammer, try0, and metis_instantiate. I personally like to use <br>
metis_instantiate and select some simple fact instantiation that <br>
simplify the proof search.</p>

I tuned another slow proof in HOL-Analysis.<br>
Using the timimg panel, I was surprised that this showed up:</p>
<ul>
<li>HOL-Analysis.Infinite_Sum<ul>
<li>91.8 command "text"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Does that have anything to do with the cite command in that text block?</p>

Hello,</p>
<p>as a big user of HOL-Analysis: yes, getting rid of a metis call that <br>
runs for this long is definitely a valuable improvement. This timing <br>
information has to be taken with a grain of salt, but 20s seems <br>
excessive even for an outlier.</p>
<p>As Martin pointed out, performance is not the only concern, but as far <br>
as readability and maintainability are concerned, metis calls are <br>
already pretty bad in my opinion, so anything you replace them with is <br>
unlikely to be worse in those regards.</p>
<p>@Martin: You mention "metis_instantiate". What is that? I couldn't find <br>
anything about it.</p>

<p>Fact instantiation is a new feature in Isabelle2025 implemented by Lukas <br>
Bartl both in Metis and Sledgehammer. It is described in the <br>
Sledgehammer documentation.</p>
<p>The metis option is documented in § 6.2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The metis method also supports the Isabelle option<br>
[[metis_instantiate]], which tells metis to infer and suggest<br>
instantiations of facts using of from a successful proof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sledgehammer option is documented in § 7.4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>instantiate [= smart_bool]<br>
Specifies whether Metis should try to infer variable instantiations<br>
be fore proof reconstruction, which results in instantiations of facts<br>
using of (e.g. map_prod_surj_on[of f A "f <code>A" g B "g </code>B"]). This can<br>
make the proof methods faster and more intelligible. If the option is<br>
set to smart (the default), variable instantiations are inferred only<br>
if proof reconstruction failed or timed out. (</p>
</blockquote>

Instantiations from Paramodulation Proofs in Isabelle/HOL.</p>

<p>It is the new secret weapon to simplify metis proofs. Once you have a metis <br>

<p>I wrote a tool for this once, but wasn't fully satisfied by the <br>
approach: It uses a build hook, which makes it very difficult to obtain <br>
local facts used in a proof. A better (but even less scalable) approach <br>
would be to use an interactive session for this. The second problem was <br>
an issue with threading, where after starting a large number of threads <br>
(to process many goals) the system became unresponsive.</p>
<p>To obtain a good ranking for proofs, one also needs to obtain data on <br>
which proofs are preferred. I attempted to get responses for this once <br>
(from the AFP editors) but didn't receive too many.</p>
<p>If someone wants to pick this up, I am happy to share the prototype.</p>
