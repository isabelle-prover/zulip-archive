                             Call for Papers</p>
<p>Workshop on Formal Verification of Physical Systems (FVPS 2021)</p>
<p>July 26 - 31, 2021<br>
                      Timișoara, Romania</p>
<p>Co-located with CICM 2021</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/cfp/FVPS-2021">https://easychair.org/cfp/FVPS-2021</a></p>
<p><a href="https://cicm-conference.org/2021/cicm.php?event=fvps&amp;menu=general">https://cicm-conference.org/2021/cicm.php?event=fvps&amp;menu=general</a><br>
=============================================================================</p>
<p>Theme<br>
=====<br>
One of the main issues behind many failing systems is the ad-hoc<br>
verification approach that involves a variety of formalism and techniques<br>
for the modeling and analysis of various components of the present-age<br>
(cyber)-physical systems. For example, control and communication protocols<br>
are usually modeled using automata theory, and thus analyzed using model<br>
checking techniques, while the modeling of physical aspects often requires<br>
multivariate calculus foundations, which are in turn analyzed using<br>
paper-and-pencil based analytical proofs, simulation or theorem proving.<br>
The fundamental differences between these modeling and analysis techniques<br>
limit us to analyze the whole system as one unit and thus miss many corner<br>
cases, which arise due to the operation of all the sub-components of the<br>
system together. One of the major concerns is that, despite the<br>
above-mentioned evident limitations in the analysis methods, many<br>
safety-critical systems, such as aerospace, smart-transportation,<br>
smart-grid and e-healthcare, are increasingly involving physical elements.<br>
Moreover, we are moving towards integrating more complex physical elements<br>
in our engineering systems. For example, we are moving towards Quantum<br>
Computers to meet the high-performance needs. Similarly, phonic components<br>
are increasingly being advocated and used in aerospace applications due to<br>
their lightweight and temperature independency compared to traditional<br>
electronics-based components. Finally, the impact of physical components is<br>
relevant to both safety and security of the overall system. For example,<br>
malfunction in sensor measurement may lead to safety issues whereas<br>
sophisticated physics-based side-channel (e.g., power and acoustic<br>
measurements) attacks lead to the security violation of the underlying<br>
system.</p>
<p>The focus of the workshop will be on formal verification techniques for the<br>
modeling, analysis and verification of safety and security critical<br>
physical systems. We encourage submissions on interdisciplinary approaches<br>
that bring together formal methods and techniques from other knowledge<br>
areas such as quantum computing, control theory, biology, optimization<br>
theory and artificial intelligence.</p>
