Conference: October 24-27, 2022</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<hr>
<p>ICFEM is an international leading conference series in formal methods and<br>
software engineering. Since 1997, ICFEM has been serving as an<br>
international forum for researchers and practitioners who have been<br>
seriously applying formal methods to practical applications. Researchers<br>
and practitioners, from industry, academia, and government, are encouraged<br>
to attend, present their research, and help advance the state of the art.<br>
ICFEM is interested in work that has been incorporated into real production<br>
systems, and in theoretical work that promises to bring practical and<br>
tangible benefit. ICFEM has been hosted in many countries around the world.<br>
Topics of Interest</p>
<hr>
<p>Authors are invited to submit high quality technical papers describing<br>
original and unpublished work in all theoretical aspects of software<br>
engineering. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstraction, refinement and evolution</li>
<li>Formal specification and modelling</li>
<li>Formal verification and analysis</li>
<li>Model checking</li>
<li>Formal approaches to software testing and inspection</li>
<li>Formal methods for self-adaptive systems</li>
<li>Formal methods for object-oriented systems</li>
<li>Formal methods for component-based systems</li>
<li>Formal methods for concurrent and real-time systems</li>

<li>Formal methods for cyber-physical systems</li>
<li>Formal methods for software safety and security</li>
<li>Formal methods for software reliability and dependability</li>
<li>Development, integration and experiments involving verified systems</li>
<li>Formal certification of products under international standards</li>
<li>Formal model-based development and code generation</li>
</ul>
<p>Publication</p>
<hr>
<p>The proceedings of the ICFEM 2022 symposium are planned to be published in<br>
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Springer). The authors of a selected<br>
subset of accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions of<br>
their papers to a special issue in journals indexed in the JCR. In<br>
particular, selected papers in the topics of the Journal of Logical and<br>
Algebraic Methods in Programming will be invited to a special issue.</p>
<p>Invited speakers</p>
<hr>
<p>Santiago Escobar (Universitat Politècnica de València)<br>
Xiaowei Huang (University of Liverpool)<br>
Yuan Feng (University of Technology Sydney)</p>
<p>Paper submission</p>
<hr>
<p>Submission should be done through the ICFEM 2022 submission page, handled<br>
by the EasyChair conference system:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfem2022">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfem2022</a>.</p>
<p>As in previous years, the proceedings will be published in the Springer<br>
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.</p>
<p>Papers should be written in English and should not exceed 16 pages<br>
(including references) in the Springer's LNCS format. Additional material<br>
may be placed in an appendix, to be read at the discretion of the reviewers<br>
and to be omitted in the final version. Formatting style files and further<br>
guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website (more<br>
