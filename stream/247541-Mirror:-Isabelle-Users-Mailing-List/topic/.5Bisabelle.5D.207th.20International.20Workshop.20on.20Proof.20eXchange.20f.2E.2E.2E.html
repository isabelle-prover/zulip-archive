<p>The Seventh International Workshop on<br>
      Proof eXchange for Theorem Proving (PxTP)</p>
<p><a href="https://pxtp.gitlab.io/2021">https://pxtp.gitlab.io/2021</a></p>
<p>21 July 2021, online</p>
<p>associated with the CADE-28 conference</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The PxTP workshop brings together researchers working on various<br>
   aspects of communication, integration, and cooperation between<br>
   reasoning systems and formalisms.</p>
<p>The progress in computer-aided reasoning, both automatic and<br>
   interactive, during the past decades, has made it possible to build<br>
   deduction tools that are increasingly more applicable to a wider range<br>
   of problems and are able to tackle larger problems progressively<br>
   faster. In recent years, cooperation of such tools in larger<br>
   verification environments has demonstrated the potential to reduce the<br>
   amount of manual intervention. Examples include the Sledgehammer tool<br>
   providing an interface between Isabelle and (untrusted) automated<br>
   provers, and collaboration of the HOL Light and Isabelle systems in<br>
   the formal proof of the Kepler conjecture.</p>
<p>Cooperation between reasoning systems relies on availability of<br>
   theoretical formalisms and practical tools for exchanging problems,<br>
   proofs, and models. The PxTP workshop strives to encourage such<br>
   cooperation by inviting contributions on suitable integration,<br>
   translation, and communication methods, standards, protocols, and<br>
   programming interfaces. The workshop welcomes developers of automated<br>
   and interactive theorem proving tools, developers of combined systems,<br>
   developers and users of translation tools and interfaces, and<br>
   producers of standards and protocols. We are interested both in<br>
   success stories and descriptions of current bottlenecks and proposals<br>
   for improvement.</p>
<h2>Topics</h2>
<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of<br>
   cooperation between reasoning tools, whether automatic or interactive.<br>
   More specifically, some suggested topics are:</p>
<p>* applications that integrate reasoning tools (ideally with<br>
     certification of the result);</p>
<p>* interoperability of reasoning systems;<br>
   * translations between logics, proof systems, models;<br>
   * distribution of proof obligations among heterogeneous reasoning<br>
     tools;</p>
<p>* algorithms and tools for checking and importing (replaying,<br>
     reconstructing) proofs;</p>
<p>* proposed formats for expressing problems and solutions for different<br>
     classes of logic solvers (SAT, SMT, QBF, first-order logic,<br>
     higher-order logic, typed logic, rewriting, etc.);</p>
<p>* meta-languages, logical frameworks, communication methods,<br>
     standards, protocols, and APIs related to problems, proofs, and<br>
     models;</p>
<p>* comparison, refactoring, transformation, migration, compression and<br>
     optimization of proofs;</p>
<p>* data structures and algorithms for improved proof production in<br>
     solvers (e.g., efficient proof representations);</p>
<p>* (universal) libraries, corpora and benchmarks of proofs and<br>
     theories;</p>
<p>* alignment of diverse logics, concepts and theories across systems<br>
     and libraries;</p>
<p>* engineering aspects of proofs (e.g., granularity, flexiformality,<br>
     persistence over time);</p>
<p>* proof certificates;<br>
   * proof checking;<br>
   * mining of (mathematical) information from proofs (e.g., quantifier<br>
     instantiations, unsat cores, interpolants, ...);</p>
<p>* reverse engineering and understanding of formal proofs;<br>
   * universality of proofs (i.e. interoperability of proofs between<br>
     different proof calculi);</p>
<p>* origins and kinds of proofs (e.g., (in)formal, automatically<br>
     generated, interactive, ...)</p>
<p>* Hilbert's 24th Problem (i.e. what makes a proof better than<br>
     another?);</p>
<p>* social aspects (e.g., community-wide initiatives related to proofs,<br>
     cooperation between communities, the future of (formal) proofs);</p>
<p>* applications relying on importing proofs from automatic theorem<br>
     provers, such as certified static analysis, proof-carrying code, or<br>
     certified compilation;</p>
<p>* application-oriented proof theory;<br>
   * practical experiences, case studies, feasibility studies.</p>
<h2>Submissions</h2>
<p>Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either<br>
   an extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15<br>
   pages). Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which<br>
   will select a balanced program of high-quality contributions. Short<br>
   submissions that could stimulate fruitful discussion at the workshop<br>
   are particularly welcome. We expect that one author of every accepted<br>
   paper will present their work at the workshop.</p>
<p>Submitted papers should describe previously unpublished work, and must<br>
   be prepared using the LaTeX EPTCS class (<a href="http://style.eptcs.org">http://style.eptcs.org</a>).<br>
   Papers will be submitted via EasyChair, at the PxTP'2021 workshop page<br>
   (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pxtp-7">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pxtp-7</a>).<br>
