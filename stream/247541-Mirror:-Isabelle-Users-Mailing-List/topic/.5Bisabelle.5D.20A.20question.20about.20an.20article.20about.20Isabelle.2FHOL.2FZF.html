<p>From: Mikhail Chekhov &lt;<a href="mailto:mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com">mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>I have an enquiry about one of the articles about Isabelle/HOL/ZF written<br>
by Alexander Krauss and Andreas Schropp : "A Mechanized Translation from<br>
Higher-Order Logic to Set Theory" [1]. Unfortunately, I am struggling to<br>
find the code and the results associated with the article. In the article,<br>
the authors state that the mechanized translation has been applied to the<br>
main HOL image and HOL’s number theory. Have these results ever appeared<br>
either in the main distribution of Isabelle or in the AFP? Has the ML code<br>
associated with the article ever appeared in the public domain? If so, can<br>
it still be found anywhere?</p>

T, Kittler J, Kleinberg JM, Mattern F, Mitchell JC, et al., editors.<br>
Lecture Notes in Computer Science; vol. 6172).</p>
<p>P.S. Unfortunately, I am not certain if I have up-to-date contact details<br>
of the authors. Given that the subject of the paper seems to be a<br>
reasonably fundamental work about Isabelle/HOL, I hope it is not<br>
inappropriate to post my enquiry on the mailing list.</p>

Hi Mikhail,</p>
<p>You do have the correct contact details, I was just too slow to respond, since I‘m currently traveling :-)</p>
<p>At the time, the sources for that experimental work were not published properly IIRC... I can try find them in my private archive when I‘m back in ~ two weeks, and I‘m happy to share them with you... but in any case it will be very hard to get them to work, since they are basen on a modified Isabelle version that was not an official release (although the changes related to the recording of type class inferences did make it into some later release...)</p>

Dear Alexander Krauss/All,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You do have the correct contact details, I was just too slow to respond,<br>
since I‘m currently traveling :-)</p>
<p>Please accept my apologies for the double posting. Although I received<br>
emails from you from your address at "<a href="http://in.tum.de">in.tum.de</a>" in the past, there was<br>
some genuine uncertainty in my mind about whether this address was still in<br>
use. In any case, I do not always receive replies and do not anticipate<br>
that all my emails will be answered. Also, I thought that there is a good<br>
chance that the code is still publicly available from an 'old repository<br>
that everyone at TUM knows about' :-).</p>
<p>At the time, the sources for that experimental work were not published<br>
properly IIRC... I can try find them in my private archive when I‘m back in<br>
~ two weeks, and I‘m happy to share them with you... but in any case it<br>
will be very hard to get them to work, since they are basen on a modified<br>
Isabelle version that was not an official release (although the changes<br>
related to the recording of type class inferences did make it into some<br>
later release...)</p>
<p>Given that the source code is not available publicly, of course, it is<br>
entirely up to you whether and/or when you wish to share it. However, I<br>
have to admit that it is likely that I will find it very helpful even<br>
without being able to run the entire study. As you may be aware, I am doing<br>
further work on Types-to-Sets and other related topics ([1], [2], [3], [4],<br>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/user9716869">https://gitlab.com/user9716869</a>) and some of the implemented features are<br>
closely related to the functionality described in [5] (e.g. elimination of<br>
overloading). I would like to ensure that there is no loss of functionality<br>
in comparison to what has been previously implemented in [5]. Also, without<br>
seeing the implementation, I feel that it is more likely that I might make<br>
some false claims in the literature review about what exactly has been<br>
achieved from the perspective of automation in [5]: while the background<br>
theory and the algorithms are described in detail, there is very little<br>
explanation given about the implementation/UI of the framework that you<br>
describe. Furthermore, I have a concern that it is not uncommon to describe<br>
only brief outlines of algorithms in publications, whereas the<br>
implementation may provide additional functionality/exception handling/etc.<br>
I was also slightly worried that if the code was available publicly, then<br>
someone else might have done further (perhaps, unpublished) work on it.</p>
