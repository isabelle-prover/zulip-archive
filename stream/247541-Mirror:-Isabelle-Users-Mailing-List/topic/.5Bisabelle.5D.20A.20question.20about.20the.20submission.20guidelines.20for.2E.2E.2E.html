<p>From: Mikhail Chekhov &lt;<a href="mailto:mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com">mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>I have a question about the "Submission Guidelines" for the AFP. At the<br>
moment, the guidelines contain the following clause:</p>
<p>I would like to understand what would be the right circumstances for making<br>
such exceptions. I am working on a certain applied formalization<br>
study/library for Isabelle/HOL. However, it is becoming resource hungry,<br>
and I find it convenient to break it into several smaller sessions while<br>
working. However, I doubt that any of these smaller parts,<br>
taken individually, are sufficiently interesting as independent AFP<br>
entries. Is performance/development time optimization a sufficiently good<br>
reason for allowing the submission of several sessions in one entry?</p>
<p>Lastly, in the future, should I direct the questions about the AFP to<br>
<a href="mailto:afp-submit@in.tum.de">afp-submit@in.tum.de</a>, or is it better/acceptable to post such queries on<br>
the mailing list?</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
Mikhail Chekhov</p>

<p>Both are fine. afp-submit is more private, but it’s good to have some of these questions here so they are more accessible.</p>

Dear Gerwin Klein/All,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>

<p>Please accept my apologies for not describing the issue in my original<br>
query in more detail. Indeed, I meant the performance during the<br>
interactive development phase. I suppose I neglected the idea that the AFP<br>
is meant to be used, primarily, for the publication of finished work,<br>
rather than as a repository for stable releases. I have formed such a<br>
biased impression because I noticed that several entries are updated quite<br>
regularly (e.g. ODE, ZFC in HOL and category3/bicategories). However, the<br>
answer that you have given, of course, is still applicable.</p>
<p>My own process these days is to have multiple sessions (when the<br>
development is large) until it has reached a maintenance phase, and then<br>
switch over. AFP submission is often (but not always) a good point for that.</p>
<p>This seems like a good and rather obvious solution to my problem.</p>
<p>Can I ask what the current processing time time is for the sessions you<br>
have?</p>
<p>I expect it to be somewhere between forty minutes and one hour on mid-range<br>
modern laptop hardware, but it is growing quite quickly (sorry for a vague<br>
order of magnitude estimate, it is difficult to be precise as it has been<br>
some time since it was possible to build all relevant sessions<br>
simultaneously). In any case, I am not yet certain whether I will ever wish<br>
to submit any of this work to the AFP: I might opt-out for a solution<br>
similar to <a href="https://isarmathlib.org/">https://isarmathlib.org/</a> (most of my own work is also,<br>
primarily, set-theory-based library material).</p>

You don't happen to have debug mode enabled, do you? Although then I<br>
would be surprised you can build them at all (they usually just crash<br>
for me).</p>
<p>What /are/ your hardware specs?</p>
<p>Or are you perhaps on Windows and have third-party anti-virus software<br>
enabled or something like that? Just a wild guess.</p>

Ok, so as summary from the discussion so far I would say for the AFP:</p>
<ul>
<li>sessions on the order of HOL-Algebra or HOL-Analysis are within the range for one session per entry</li>
<li>we’d expect a build time of maybe 10min +/- 5min for that</li>
<li>entries with build times of 1h or more on recent hardware would be good candidates to split up in some way (these are very rare)</li>
</ul>
<p>For working with something in the range of 1h, I would recommend multiple sessions for development, esp with memory constraints on the hardware (in my experience, memory size, e.g. 8GB vs e.g. 2GB can make a huge difference — so if you are looking to upgrade only something specific that is what I would go for).</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Gerwin</p>
