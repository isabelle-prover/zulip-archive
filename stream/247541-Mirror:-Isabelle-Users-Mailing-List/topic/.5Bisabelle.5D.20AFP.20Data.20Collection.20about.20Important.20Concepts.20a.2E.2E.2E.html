<p>From: Fabian Huch &lt;<a href="mailto:huch@in.tum.de">huch@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
To collect data on which concepts are important and which theorems are <br>
central in AFP entries, I have sent around some e-mails with suggestions <br>
and asking for feedback - the goal of this is to improve AFP navigation <br>
and ease of understanding (on the web page), by generating such <br>
suggestions for all entries.</p>
<p>If you've received such a mail, a reply would be greatly appreciated! <br>
Feel free to ask any questions here.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Fabian</p>

<p>From: "Eugene W. Stark" &lt;<a href="mailto:isabelle-users@starkeffect.com">isabelle-users@starkeffect.com</a>&gt;<br>
When you say "which theorems are central", do you mean "which are the main theorems", or do you mean,<br>
"which theorems are in some sense a central part of the reasoning"?  The suggestions you sent seem to<br>
be mostly things that are heavily used, rather than those that are the main points.</p>
<p>Some roughly similar clarification on "which concepts are important" would also be helpful.  I also<br>
do not have a clear idea as to how the suggestions here might have been generated or what the overall<br>
thrust of this is supposed to be.</p>

<p>I'm confused about this, because that's not what I would usually be interested in when I look at an AFP entry (or any formalisation, really). I'd want to see the top-level theorems.</p>
<p>Central to reasoning will be helper lemmas, maybe strengthened statements for induction or intermediate constructions, but why would I care about that unless I want to repeat the development? If I want to use an entry or understand what it proves, I'd need the top-level statements, any axioms/assumptions, and the definitions used in the top-level statement.</p>
<p>This may be somewhat different if the entry is a library, but then there are also not 5 central lemmas, but likely dozens of lemmas that I can now use.</p>

<p>There is also a hint many authors give, which is using "theorem" instead of "lemma" when they state something important. Of course, that's not used consistently, but if it can be extracted automatically, it might be helpful.</p>

I agree that most central theorems are not helpful for an overview - but <br>
they are important in understanding the dependency network. Only the <br>
"Important concepts" aspects is something to show on top level.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree.</p>
