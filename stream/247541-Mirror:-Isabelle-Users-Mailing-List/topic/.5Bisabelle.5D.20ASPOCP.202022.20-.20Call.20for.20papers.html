=================================================================================</p>
<p>AIMS AND SCOPE</p>
<p>Since its introduction in the late 1980s, Answer Set Programming (ASP) has <br>
 been widely applied to various knowledge-intensive tasks and combinatorial <br>
 search problems. ASP was found to be closely related to SAT, which led to a <br>
 new method of computing answer sets using SAT solvers and techniques adapted <br>
 from SAT. This has been a much studied relationship, and is currently extended <br>
 towards satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). The relationship of ASP to other <br>
 computing paradigms, such as constraint satisfaction, quantified Boolean <br>
 formulas (QBF), Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), first-order logic (FOL), <br>
 and FO(ID) is also the subject of active research. Consequently, new methods <br>
 of computing answer sets are being developed based on relationships to these <br>
 formalisms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the practical applications of ASP also foster work on <br>
 multi-paradigm problem-solving, and in particular language and solver <br>
 integration. The most prominent examples in this area currently are the <br>
 integration of ASP with description logics (in the realm of the Semantic Web) <br>
 and constraint satisfaction (which recently led to the Constraint Answer Set <br>
 Programming (CASP) research direction).</p>
<p>A large body of general results regarding ASP is available and several efficient <br>
 ASP solvers have been implemented. However, there are still significant <br>
 challenges in applying ASP to real life applications, and more interest in <br>
 relating ASP to other computing paradigms is emerging. This workshop will <br>
 provide opportunities for researchers to identify these challenges and to <br>
 exchange ideas for overcoming them.</p>
