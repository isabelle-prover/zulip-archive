<p>CALL FOR PAPERS - ATVA 2021</p>
<hr>
<p>The 19th International Symposium on Automated Technology for Verification and Analysis (ATVA 2021), 18 - 22 Oct 2021, Gold Coast, Australia. If the pandemic means that travelling is still an issue in October, we might change the plan and host the conference online.</p>
<p><a href="https://formal-analysis.com/atva/2021/">https://formal-analysis.com/atva/2021/</a></p>
<p>ATVA 2021 is the 19th in a series of symposia aimed at bringing together academics, industrial researchers and practitioners in the area of theoretical and practical aspects of automated analysis, synthesis, and verification of hardware, software, and machine learning (ML) systems. ATVA is a CORE Rank A conference.</p>

<hr>
<p>Submission and Publication</p>
<hr>
<p>ATVA welcomes submissions in the following two categories:<br>
1) Regular research papers (16 pages, including references)<br>
2) Tool papers (6 pages, including references)</p>
<p>Submissions must be in Springer's LNCS format. Additional material may be placed in an appendix, to be read at the discretion of the reviewers and to be omitted in the final version. Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website. Tool papers must include information about a URL from where the tool can be downloaded or accessed online for evaluation. The URL must also contain a set of examples and a user manual that describes the usage of the tool through examples. In case the tool needs to be downloaded and installed, the URL must contain instructions for installation of the tool on Linux/Windows/macOS.</p>
<p>Accepted papers in both categories will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference.</p>
<p>Authors should consult Springer's authors' guidelines (ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/svproc/guidelines/Springer_Guidelines_for_Authors_of_Proceedings_CS.pdf) and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.</p>
<p>Papers must be submitted through EasyChair.<br>
