<p>Heriot-Watt University has established a reputation for world-class<br>
teaching and leading-edge,<br>
relevant research, which has made it one of the top UK universities for<br>
innovation, business and industry.<br>
To celebrate our 2021 bicentenary of pioneering research, we have set<br>
ourselves the target of recruiting<br>
one hundred outstanding research academics between 2018 and 2021.</p>
<p>As part of this prestigious programme, the School of Mathematical and<br>
Computer Sciences (MACS)<br>
welcomes applications for the posts of Assistant / Associate Professor /<br>
Professor in Computer Science.<br>
We particularly welcome applicants with expertise in either:</p>
<p>(i) Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (which includes pervasive and<br>
ubiquitous systems, planning,<br>
data science and semantic web, autonomous agents, human-robot interaction,<br>
human computer interaction and multimodal interaction);</p>
<p>(ii) Security and Verification (including verification of system safety and<br>
security, cybersecurity,<br>
automated reasoning, theorem proving, programming languages and semantics,<br>
foundations of computer science).</p>
<p>In addition, and as part of the School’s on-going plans to open new joint<br>
Mathematics-CS and Statistics-CS posts,<br>
we encourage applicants who have interdisciplinary training or experience<br>
linking one of the outlined CS priority<br>
areas and topics in Mathematics and Statistics (including, but not limited<br>
to, algebra and category theory, discrete<br>
mathematics and logic, financial risk, cyber risk, actuarial and<br>
statistical data science, statistical machine learning,<br>
Bayesian computational methods).</p>
<p>The School strongly encourages and supports the generation of industry<br>
impact from research, and we welcome<br>
candidates with experience of working in industry on AI, data science,<br>
robotics, autonomous systems, verification<br>
or security projects or a strong track record of collaborating with<br>
industrial partners.</p>
<p>Exceptional candidates possessing an extensive track record of<br>
internationally excellent research and leadership<br>
may be considered for appointment at Chair level; candidates interested in<br>
the position at Chair level should in<br>
the first instance contact the Head of School, Prof Beatrice Pelloni,<br>
<a href="mailto:b.pelloni@hw.ac.uk">b.pelloni@hw.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<p>The School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences is committed to support<br>
family friendly work practices and<br>
part-time working options as part of our Athena Swan Bronze award<br>
(see<br>
<a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences/about/athena-swan.htm">https://www.hw.ac.uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences/about/athena-swan.htm</a>).</p>
<p>We especially encourage women and members of underrepresented groups to<br>
apply for this position.<br>
We welcome and will consider flexible working patterns e.g. part-time<br>
working and job share options.</p>
<p>ABOUT OUR TEAM:</p>
<p>The Department of Computer Scienceis internationally renowned for its<br>
world-class research across a number of areas,<br>
including artificial intelligence and machine learning, data integration,<br>
knowledge representation, visualization and analytics,<br>
natural language processing, formal methods, logic, type theory,<br>
programming languages, parallel computation, human-computer<br>
and human-robot interaction, and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Jointly with University of Edinburgh, we host the center for doctoral<br>
training “Edinburgh Centre for Robotics” and<br>
the UK’s first National Robotarium, that together form a £129M joint<br>
venture, a center of excellence for AI research on<br>
an international scale, and a research and innovation hub with &gt;150 staff<br>
and PhD students. In RCUK’s recent Grand Challenges Scheme:<br>
Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS), our academics form core teams in 2<br>
out of 7TAS nodes (each node is supported by a £3M research grant).<br>
The two nodes stand for“Trust” and “Governance” in Autonomous Systems.  Our<br>
grant funding in this area has also grown<br>
through being awarded jointly with another school at HWU an EPSRC<br>
Industrial Strategy Challenge Strategy Fund for<br>
the Robotics Hub for Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets (ORCA)<br>
worth £14.6M, which is one of the largest<br>
industrial strategy challenge funds awards in Scotland.</p>
<p>The department has strong collaboration with Industry. Since 2014, we have<br>
undertaken 107 projects with industrial partners,<br>
through our doctoral training centers (40 industrial partners), the ORCA<br>
hub (30 industrial partners), and the TAS nodes.<br>
Among our collaborators are Amazon Research, BP, Chevron, FiveAI, Horiba<br>
Mira, Imandra, Kawasaki, Kuka Robotics, Lloyds,<br>
Schlumberger, and many others.</p>
