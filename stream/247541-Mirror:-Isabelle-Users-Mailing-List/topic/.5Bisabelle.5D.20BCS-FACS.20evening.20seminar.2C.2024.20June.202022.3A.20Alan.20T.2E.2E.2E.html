Synopsis</p>
<p>Alan Turing's centenary was widely celebrated in 2012. It is now 110 years<br>
since Turing's birth. This talk explores some developments with respect to<br>
Turing, especially in the last decade. In particular, it presents some<br>
recent research on Turing's connections with Oxford, the speaker's home<br>
city.</p>
<p>Turing is well-known for his work at Cambridge, Bletchley Park, and<br>
Manchester, but there has been little evidence of his visiting Oxford.<br>
Turing arguably wrote the first formal methods paper on program proving and<br>
much later Oxford has been a major research hub for formal methods,<br>
initially through the leadership of Christopher Strachey, a colleague of<br>
Turing at Manchester, and the founder of the Programming Research Group at<br>
Oxford.<br>
About the speaker</p>
<p>Jonathan Bowen, FBCS FRSA, is an Emeritus Professor at London South Bank<br>
University, where he was Professor of Computing from 2000, and Chairman of<br>
Museophile Limited in Oxford (founded in 2002).</p>
<p>His main research interest has been in formal methods, especially the Z<br>
notation, but with wider computer science interests in software engineering<br>
and the history of computing.</p>
<p>He has held previous positions at Imperial College London, the Programming<br>
Research Group at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory, and the<br>
University of Reading. Starting in 2002, he has been Chair of the BCS-FACS<br>
Specialist Group. He co-organized a centenary celebration for Alan Turing<br>
at Oxford in 2012 and his books include "The Turing Guide" (Oxford<br>
University Press, 2017). He is a Life Fellow of the BCS and the Royal<br>
Society of Arts.</p>
