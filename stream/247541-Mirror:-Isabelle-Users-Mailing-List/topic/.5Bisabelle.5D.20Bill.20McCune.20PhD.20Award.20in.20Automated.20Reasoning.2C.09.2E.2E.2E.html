<p>From: Pascal Fontaine &lt;<a href="mailto:Pascal.Fontaine@inria.fr">Pascal.Fontaine@inria.fr</a>&gt;<br>
Automated Reasoning is the area of computer science dedicated to <br>
applying reasoning in the form of logic to computing systems.  The Bill <br>
McCune PhD Award in Automated Reasoning distinguishes each year a PhD <br>
thesis defended the previous year, for its substantive contributions to <br>
the field of Automated Reasoning, its theory, its implementation, and/or <br>
its application on important problems.  The Bill McCune PhD Award in <br>
Automated Reasoning is named after the American computer scientist <br>
William Walker McCune.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eligibility *</li>
</ul>
<p>Eligible for the award are those who successfully defended their PhD</p>
<ul>
<li>at an academic institution;</li>
<li>in the field of Automated Reasoning;</li>
<li>
<p>in the period from January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2020 (for the 2020 <br>
award);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the period from January 1, 2019 - December 31, 2019 (for the 2019 <br>
award).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The PhD students supervised by the Expert Committee members are not <br>
eligible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nomination *</li>
</ul>
<p>Candidates for the award must be nominated by their supervisor(s) and <br>
one additional independent researcher who reviewed/examined the thesis.<br>
Nominations are to be submitted via EasyChair, by March 15, 2021, using <br>
the link:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=mccuneaward20192020">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=mccuneaward20192020</a></p>
<p>The nomination must consist of a single PDF file containing</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a letter from the supervisor(s) describing why the thesis should be <br>
considered for the award and the relationship of the contributions to <br>
CADE/IJCAR;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a report from the nominating additional independent researcher who <br>
reviewed/examined the thesis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the thesis itself;</p>
</li>
<li>a copy of the PhD diploma;</li>
<li>and copy/copies of CADE/IJCAR papers of the nominee, if any, <br>
containing results published in the thesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The thesis will be evaluated with respect to its quality, originality <br>
and (potential) impact to the field of Automated Reasoning.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Procedure *</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nominations will be evaluated and compared by an international <br>
Expert Committee (see below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procedure to be followed is analogous to the review phase of a <br>
conference. The justification by the supervisor and the nominating <br>
additional independent researcher report will play an important role in <br>
the evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final decision is made by the Expert Committee at least one month <br>
before CADE/IJCAR being held.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The award consists of a certificate announcing the winner to have <br>
received the Bill McCune PhD Award in Automated Reasoning. The award <br>
will be announced at the respective year's CADE/IJCAR. The nominators of <br>
the winner will also receive a copy of this certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision of the Expert Committee is final and binding, and not <br>
subject to discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expert Committee *</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Expert Committee is formed by the board of CADE Trustees with the <br>
aim to reflect the broad diversity in the area of Automated Reasoning.  <br>
It is announced with the call for nominations, and thus formed before <br>
the call for nominations.  The Committee for the Bill McCune PhD Award <br>
2019 and 2020 consists of the following people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nikolaj Bjorner, Microsoft</li>
<li>Pascal Fontaine, University of Liege</li>
<li>Carsten Fuhs, Birkbeck, University of London</li>
<li>Cezary Kaliszyk, University of Innsbruck</li>
<li>Claudia Nalon, University of Brasilia</li>
<li>Giles Reger, The University of Manchester</li>
<li>Giselle Reis, CMU-Qatar</li>
<li>Andy Reynolds, The University of Iowa</li>
<li>Uwe Waldmann, MPI for Informatics</li>
</ul>
<p>The Expert Committee can seek additional expertise, even after the <br>
submission deadline for nominations.</p>
