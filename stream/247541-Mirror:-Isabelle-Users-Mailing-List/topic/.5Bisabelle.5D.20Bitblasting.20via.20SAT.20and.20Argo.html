<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:tals4@cam.ac.uk">tals4@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Isabelle users.</p>
<p>I've been doing some proofs in Isabelle about operations of a CPU<br>
architecture lately[1]. Sometimes this just requires bit-blasting, i.e.<br>
reduction of a word/bitvector problem to a boolean problem for <br>
sat-solving.<br>
I've got some satisfactory results using an adjusted version of the old<br>
Word_Bitwise and the Argo prover. I don't think there's currently a <br>
better<br>
approach in Isabelle, since replay of SMT word/bitvector proofs was <br>
never<br>
enabled. (Please tell me if I'm misinformed, I don't seem to be up to <br>
date<br>
about any of this, and there's a note about veriT and a session<br>
HOL-Word-SMT_Examples in the Isabelle 2021 NEWS that I don't <br>
understand.)</p>
<p>I'll try to make an adjusted/improved Word_Bitwise available in the<br>
future, but my version is still quite experimental.</p>
<p>I have been pleasantly surprised how effective Argo was for SAT-like <br>
problems.<br>
Given that, I'd like to make some suggestions, mostly about <br>
documentation.</p>
<p>I think that some kind of note should be added to the SAT theory, or the<br>
sat/satx methods and tactics, given that most users should just call <br>
argo<br>
directly. SAT is the logical place to look for a solver for sat-like <br>
problems,<br>
and the provided default SAT/CDCL solver used by the sat/satx methods is<br>
just not as good as the equivalent implemented within argo. Meanwhile <br>
there's<br>
and unsolved problem with explosion of the problem size in satx <br>
preprocessing.<br>
In principle an external solver might have power that an inbuilt one <br>
doesn't,<br>
but my quick investigation suggests that most of the supported external <br>
SAT<br>
solvers are obscure or historical.</p>
<p>Another minor documentation complaint is that Argo is pretty well <br>
documented in<br>
HOL/ex/Argo_Examples.thy, but it took me a while to think to look there. <br>
In<br>
particular, for medium-size SAT problems a user may have to increase <br>
argo_timeout,<br>
and it's not necessarily obvious where to find it. Perhaps a link to the <br>
examples<br>
in Argo.thy itself?</p>
<p>Finally, some practical issues. While argo generally performs well, in <br>
some<br>
situations I've seen a big difference between the speed of "apply <br>
(argo)" and<br>
"apply (intro impI; argo)". Note that I don't want to just apply <br>
clarsimp or<br>
similar here for various performance reasons, which is probably unusual.<br>
Anyway I don't really understand why an SMT/SAT tool would perform so <br>
differently<br>
for obviously similar goals. I've also discovered what is probably an <br>
outright bug.<br>
A particular kind of trivial premise seems to lead to ML exceptions of <br>
the form<br>
"Undeclared hyps: ..." or "forall_intr: variable .. free in <br>
assumptions". I think<br>
the second might be side-effect of the first. Again, simplification <br>
prevents this<br>
issue, but I have performance reasons to prefer to use the simplifier as <br>
little as<br>
possible.</p>
<p>I've checked these issues still exists in Isabelle 2021, and I attach a <br>
theory which<br>
demonstrates them. Are there any experts who might be interested in <br>
helping me debug<br>
these?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:tals4@cam.ac.uk">tals4@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Indeed. I attach the missing example theory, given that I bothered to<br>
generate it. Given that nobody else has replied, it's perhaps unlikely<br>
at this point that anyone is interested in investigating.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I've been taking another approach, and there are<br>
workarounds anyway, so it's unlikely that I'll be doing much <br>
investigating<br>
of possible improvements/fixes myself.</p>
<p>Thanks for following up,<br>
     Thomas.<br>
