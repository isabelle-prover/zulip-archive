CADE-28: Call for Papers, Workshops, Tutorials and Competitions</p>
<p>The 28th International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-28)<br>
Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA.  11-16th July 2021.<br>
<a href="http://www.cade-28.info">http://www.cade-28.info</a></p>
<p>CADE will carefully monitor the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, and take<br>
guidance from from the health authorities, to determine whether CADE-28 will be<br>
physical or online.</p>
<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br>
===============<br>
CADE is the major international forum for presenting research on all aspects of<br>
automated deduction. High-quality submissions on the general topic of automated<br>
deduction, including logical foundations, theory and principles, applications<br>
in and beyond STEM, implementations, and the use/contribution of automated<br>
deduction in AI, are solicited. CADE-28 aims to present research that reflects<br>
the broad range of interesting and relevant topics in automated deduction.</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract deadline:        15 February 2021</li>
<li>Submission deadline:      22 February 2021</li>
<li>Rebuttal phase:            2 April    2021</li>
<li>Notification:             19 April    2021</li>
<li>Final version:            31 May      2021</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions can be made in two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular papers. Up to 15 pages in LNCS style. Proofs of theoretical results<br>
   that do not fit in the page limit may be provided in an appendix. Reviewers<br>
   may consider additional material in appendices, but submissions must be self-<br>
   contained within the page limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short papers (including system descriptions, user experiences, domain models,<br>
   etc.) Up to 10 pages in LNCS style.<br>
Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere.<br>
They will be judged on relevance, originality, significance, correctness, and<br>
readability. If software or data is relevant to a paper, a link that provides<br>
access to the software/data must be provided to enable reproduction of results.<br>
The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors will<br>
have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may solicit<br>
further reviews after the rebuttal period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer LNCS/LNAI<br>
series. Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files can be obtained at<br>
<a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a><br>
Papers must be submitted to the CADE-28 track via<br>

<p>CALL FOR WORKSHOPS<br>
==================<br>
Workshop proposals for CADE-28 are solicited. The workshops will take place<br>
before the conference. Both well-established workshops and newer ones are<br>
encouraged. Similarly, proposals for workshops with a tight focus on a core<br>
automated reasoning specialization, as well as those with a broader, more<br>
applied focus, are welcome. Please provide the following information in your<br>
application document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop title.</li>
<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>
<li>Proposed workshop duration (from half a day to two days) and preferred day(s).</li>
<li>
<p>Brief description of the goals and the scope of the workshop. Why is the<br>
   workshop relevant to CADE?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the workshop new or has it met previously? In the latter case information<br>
   on previous meetings should be given (e.g., links to the program, number of<br>
   submissions, number of participants).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the plans for publication?</p>
</li>
<li>Short statement regarding plans in case of an online conference.</li>
</ul>
<p>CALL FOR TUTORIALS<br>
==================<br>
Tutorial proposals for CADE-28 are solicited. The tutorials will take place<br>
before the conference. Tutorials are expected to be either half-day or full-day<br>
events, with a theoretical or applied focus, on a topic of interest to CADE-28.<br>
Proposals should provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tutorial title.</li>
<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>
<li>Proposed tutorial duration (from half to one day) and the preferred day.</li>
<li>Brief description of the tutorial's goals and topics to be covered.</li>
<li>
<p>Whether or not a version of the tutorial has been given previously, and<br>
   if/how the intended presentation differs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short statement regarding plans in case of an online conference.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Within reason, CADE will take care of printing and distributing notes for<br>
tutorials that would like this service.</p>
<p>CALL FOR COMPETITIONS<br>
=====================<br>
The CADE ATP System Competition (CASC), which evaluates automated theorem<br>
proving systems for classical logics, has become an integral part of the CADE<br>
conferences. Further competition proposals are solicited. The goal is to foster<br>
the development of automated reasoning systems and applications, in all areas<br>
relevant to automated deduction in a broad sense. Proposals should include the<br>
following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competition title.</li>
<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>
<li>Duration and schedule of the competition.</li>
<li>Room/space requirements.</li>
<li>Description of the competition task and the evaluation procedure.</li>
<li>
<p>Is the competition new or has it been organized before? In the latter case<br>
   information on previous competitions should be given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What computing resources are required and how will they be provided?</p>
</li>
<li>Short statement regarding plans in case of an online conference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Important Dates</p>
<p>Workshop/Tutorials/Competitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission deadline:       16 November 2020</li>
<li>Notification:              11 December 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission Instructions</p>
<p>Proposals for workshops, tutorials, and competitions must be submitted to the<br>
CADE-28-WTC track via<br>
