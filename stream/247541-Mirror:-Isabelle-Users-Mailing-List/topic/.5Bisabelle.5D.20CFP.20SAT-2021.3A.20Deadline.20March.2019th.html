<p>From: Jesús Giráldez Crú &lt;<a href="mailto:jgiraldez@ugr.es">jgiraldez@ugr.es</a>&gt;<br>
24th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability<br>
Testing<br>
SAT-2021, July 5-9, 2021, Barcelona, Spain</p>
<p><a href="https://www.iiia.csic.es/sat2021">https://www.iiia.csic.es/sat2021</a></p>
<p>SAT 2021 welcomes scientific contributions addressing different aspects of<br>
the satisfiability problem, interpreted in a broad sense. Domains include<br>
MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints, Quantified Boolean Formulae<br>
(QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), as well as Constraint<br>
Satisfaction Problems (CSP). Topics include, but are not restricted to:</p>
<p>Theoretical advances;<br>
    Practical search algorithms;<br>
    Knowledge compilation;<br>
    Implementation-level details of SAT solving tools and SAT-based systems;<br>
    Problem encodings and reformulations;<br>
    Applications;<br>
    Case studies and reports on insightful findings based on rigorous<br>
experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>* Important Dates </strong>*</p>
<p>Abstract submission: March 15th<br>
    Paper submission: March 19th<br>
    Author response period: April 26-27th<br>
    Author notification: May 5th<br>
    Camera-ready: May 15th<br>
    Conference: July 5-9th</p>
<p><strong>* Submission and Publication </strong>*</p>
<p>Submissions to SAT 2021 are solicited in three paper categories, describing<br>
original contributions.</p>
<p>Long papers (9 to 15 pages, excluding references)<br>
    Short papers (up to 8 pages, excluding references)<br>
    Tool papers (up to 8 pages, excluding references)</p>
<p>All papers submissions are done exclusively via EasyChair in Springer’s<br>
LaTeX llncs2e style.</p>
<p>Long and short papers should contain original research, with sufficient<br>
detail to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. For papers<br>
reporting experimental results, authors are strongly encouraged to make<br>
their data and implementations available with their submission. Submissions<br>
reporting on case studies are also encouraged, and should describe details,<br>
weaknesses, and strengths in sufficient depth. Long and short papers will<br>
be evaluated with the same quality standards, and are expected to contain a<br>
similar contribution per page ratio.</p>
<p>Tool papers must obey to a specific content criteria. A tool paper should<br>
describe the implemented tool and its novel features. Here “tools” are<br>
interpreted in a broad sense, including descriptions of implemented<br>
solvers, preprocessors, etc., as well as systems that exploit SAT solvers<br>
or their extensions for use in interesting problem domains. A demonstration<br>
is expected to accompany a tool presentation. Papers describing tools that<br>
have already been presented previously are expected to contain significant<br>
and clear enhancements to the tool.</p>
<p>All accepted papers are expected to be published in the proceedings of the<br>
conference, which will be published within the Springer LNCS series.</p>
<p><strong>* Best Paper Awards </strong>*</p>
<p>Long and short papers may be considered for a Best Paper Award. If the main<br>
author is a student, both in terms of work and writing, the paper may be<br>
considered for a Best Student Paper Award.</p>
<p><strong>* Student Grants </strong>*</p>
<p>SAT 2021 will provide free registration to all the PhD students with an<br>
accepted paper.</p>
