<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>In order to leverage the synergies between various CS &amp; CE fields, the<br>
   program committees of a number of premier conferences have their<br>
   2022 events held at one venue (same location and dates). Thus,<br>
   this year, The Congress is composed of a number of tracks (joint-<br>
   conferences, sessions, workshops, poster and panel discussions);<br>
   all will be held simultaneously, same location and dates:<br>
   July 25-28, 2022. For the complete list of joint conferences, refer to:<br>
<a href="https://american-cse.org/csce2022/conferences">https://american-cse.org/csce2022/conferences</a> </p>
<p>This year's Congress will be a hybrid event that combines a "live"<br>
   in-person event with a "virtual" online component. We anticipate that<br>
   most speakers will physically be attending (ie, most talks are expected<br>
   to be face-to-face).</p>
<p>We anticipate having between 1,000 and 2,000 participants in the<br>
   Congress. The congress includes 20 major tracks, composed of: 122<br>
   technical, research, and panel sessions as well as a number of<br>
   keynote lectures. Last year, the Congress had attracted speakers,<br>
   authors and participants affiliated with over 158 different<br>
   universities (including many from the top 50 ranked institutions),<br>
   major IT corporations (including: Microsoft, Google, Apple, SAP,<br>
   Facebook, Oracle, Amazon, Yahoo, Samsung, IBM, Ebay, GE, Siemens,<br>
   Philips, Ericsson, BAE Systems, Hitachi, NTT, Twitter, Uber<br>
   Technologies, ...), major corporations (including: Exxon Mobil,<br>
   Johnson &amp; Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, PetroChina, GlaxoSmithKline, HSBC,<br>
   Airbus, Boeing, Hyundai, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, ...), government<br>
   research agencies (NSF, NIH, DoE, US Air Force, NSA National Security<br>
   Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, ...), US national laboratories<br>
   (including, NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ANL<br>
   Argonne National Lab, Sandia National Lab, ORNL Oak Ridge National Lab,<br>
   Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Lawrence Livermore National Lab,<br>
   Los Alamos National Lab, Pacific Northwest National Lab, ...), and a<br>
   number of Venture Capitalists as well as distinguished speakers<br>
   discussing Intellectual Property issues. Last year, 54% of attendees<br>
   were from academia, 25% from industry; 20% from government and funding<br>
   agencies; and 1% unknown. About half of the attendees were from<br>
   outside USA; from 69 nations.</p>
