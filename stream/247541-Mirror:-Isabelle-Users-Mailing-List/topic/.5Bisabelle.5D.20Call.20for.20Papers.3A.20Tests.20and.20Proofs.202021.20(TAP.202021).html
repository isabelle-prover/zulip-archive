<p>Part of STAF 2021<br>
=====================================================</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
<hr>
<p>Full Paper:             January 31, 2021<br>
Notification:           March 15, 2021<br>
Camera-Ready Version:   April 18, 2021<br>
Conference:             June 21-25, 2021</p>
<p>Aim and Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>The TAP conference promotes research in verification and formal<br>
methods that targets the interplay of proofs and testing: the<br>
advancement of techniques of each kind and their combination, with the<br>
ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.</p>
<p>Research in verification has seen a steady convergence of<br>
heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally<br>
distinct areas of testing (and dynamic analysis) and of proving (and<br>
static analysis). Formal techniques for counter-example generation<br>
based on, for example, symbolic execution, SAT/SMT-solving or model<br>
checking, furnish evidence for the potential of a combination of test<br>
and proof. The combination of predicate abstraction with testing-like<br>
techniques based on exhaustive enumeration opens the perspective for<br>
novel techniques of proving correctness. On the practical side,<br>
testing offers cost-effective debugging techniques of specifications<br>
or crucial parts of program proofs (such as invariants).  Last but not<br>
least, testing is indispensable when it comes to the validation of the<br>
underlying assumptions of complex system models involving hardware<br>
and/or system environments. Over the years, there is growing<br>
acceptance in research communities that testing and proving are<br>
complementary rather than mutually exclusive techniques.</p>
<p>The TAP conference aims to promote research in the intersection of<br>
testing and proving by bringing together researchers and practitioners<br>
from both areas of verification.</p>
<p>Topics of Interest</p>
<hr>
<p>TAP's scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology,<br>
including foundational work, tool development, and empirical<br>
research. Its topics of interest center around the connection between<br>
proofs (and other static techniques) and testing (and other dynamic<br>
techniques). Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the<br>
following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verification and analysis techniques combining proofs and tests</li>
<li>Program proving with the aid of testing techniques</li>
<li>
<p>Deductive techniques supporting the automated generation of test vectors<br>
   and oracles (theorem proving, model checking, symbolic execution, SAT/SMT<br>
   solving, constraint logic programming, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deductive techniques supporting novel definitions of coverage criteria,</p>
</li>
<li>Program analysis techniques combining static and dynamic analysis</li>
<li>Specification inference by deductive and dynamic methods</li>
<li>Testing and runtime analysis of formal specifications</li>
<li>Search-based technics for proving and testing</li>
<li>Verification of verification tools and environments</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of test and proof techniques in new domains,<br>
   such as security, configuration management, learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combined approaches of test and proof in the context of formal<br>
   certifications (Common Criteria, CENELEC, …)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case studies, tool and framework descriptions, and experience<br>
   reports about combining tests and proofs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission Instructions</p>
<hr>
<p>TAP 2021 accepts papers of four kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular research papers: full submissions describing original<br>
   research, of up to 16 pages (excluding references).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tool demonstration papers: submissions describing the design and<br>
   implementation of an analysis/verification tool or framework, of up<br>
   to 8 pages (excluding references). The tool/framework described in a<br>
   tool demonstration paper should be available for public use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short papers: submissions describing preliminary findings, proofs of<br>
   concepts, and exploratory studies, of up to 6 pages (excluding<br>
   references).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Journal-first extended abstracts, of up to 4 pages, summarizing<br>
   recently published articles in high-quality journals. The aim of<br>
   journal-first papers is to further enrich the program of TAP, as<br>
   well as to provide an more flexible path to dissemination of results<br>
   in the field. The summarized journal article should have been<br>
   published (or accepted) by 1 July 2020 or later, and report new<br>
   results (as opposed as simply extending prior conference work with<br>
   'appendix' material, or minor enhancements). Journal-first<br>
   submissions must be marked as such in the submission’s title, and<br>
   must explicitly include full bibliographic details (including a DOI)<br>
   of the journal publication they are based on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Accepted submissions will be published in Springer's LNCS<br>
series. Papers have to adhere to Springer's LNCS format and must be<br>
submitted in PDF format at the EasyChair submission site:</p>
