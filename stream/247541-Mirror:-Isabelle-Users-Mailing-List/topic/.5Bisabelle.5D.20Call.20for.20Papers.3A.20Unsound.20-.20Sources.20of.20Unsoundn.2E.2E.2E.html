                  First Call for Papers</p>
<p>Unsound:<br>
    1st Workshop on Sources of Unsoundness in Verification<br>
                    at SPLASH 2022<br>
<a href="https://2022.splashcon.org/home/unsound-2022">https://2022.splashcon.org/home/unsound-2022</a></p>
<p>Software and proof verification has grown significantly in the last 15 <br>
years.<br>
Growth has come to the point where verification systems are complex and <br>
manually proving the soundness of those verification systems sometimes <br>
exceeds what a single research group can understand and verify as <br>
correct.</p>
<p>Even formally defining soundness can be challenging and its definition <br>
is varying from system to system. Specific research groups can have very <br>
specific notions of soundness they focus on, but those can diverge from <br>
what the users expect, especially if the users come from a different <br>
verification environment or they are approaching verification for the <br>
first time.</p>
<p>Participants to Unsound will be able to share their experience and <br>
exploits on how different verification tools can either be broken or <br>
expose confusing behavior, likely to be unexpected by users.<br>
We think this would be greatly beneficial not only because it will help <br>
all of us to iron out those unsoundnesses but also because it will <br>
facilitate understanding of the foundational differences between the <br>
assumptions of the various research lines.</p>
<p>The current academic environment encourages us to talk about the success <br>
case of our work. In this workshop we want to address and learn from <br>
failure cases and we want to reinforce the bedrock of our understanding.<br>
In practice, when we divert our focus to a specific aspect of <br>
verification<br>
  we may (understandably) be less precise.<br>
For example, a line of research focusing on aliasing control in OO may <br>
be less precise when considering the implication in other areas, like <br>
termination.<br>
We believe that learning from the issues of many verification projects <br>
can broaden the attention of researchers to topics which so far escaped <br>
their focused area of research; e.g., from only type correctness to also <br>
avoiding stack overflows.</p>
<p>We believe that this environment would be particularly beneficial for <br>
young researchers that are in search of open questions in verification. <br>
This may provide a motivation to deep dive into the details of any <br>
particular tool, or to expand their individual area of expertise to get <br>
a wider and more objective and critical view of the whole area of <br>
verification.</p>
<p>We also wonder if in our fast expansion we accidentally glossed over <br>
some fundamental issue in verification, and if our mistake has now <br>
become engraved into the established wisdom and it is sometimes <br>
uncritically assumed as a valid reasoning stepping stone.</p>
<p>We are particularly interested in sources of unsoundness that are <br>
accidentally shared by many different unrelated research lines, and to <br>
develop an understanding on why this is the case.</p>
<p>The workshop would be its first instance and is meant to be welcoming<br>
for both people with strong theoretical skills, as well as people who<br>
just like hacking things. We do not expect fully polished submissions<br>
and we will not have formal proceedings. Students are especially welcome <br>
to attend.</p>
<h3>Examples for possible contributions would be:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Definition of sound and unsound and how they can diverge between <br>
tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divergences between user assumptions and actual definitions of <br>
soundness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common sources of unsoundness and why they emerge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugs and unsoundnesses in the process of extracting a concrete program<br>
    from a verified environment, e.g., from Coq to Haskell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logic errors in the specification of a verification tool, e.g., <br>
universe<br>
   inconsistencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugs in the implementation of proof checkers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overconfident generalizations of sound subsystems to larger settings, <br>
e.g., imperative techniques in OO settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disproving soundness statements in published papers about <br>
verification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding statements proven in published literature that should no <br>
longer be trusted because they relied on a broken verification system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simply proving False in a verification tool, in particular we are<br>
   interested in practical ways to trick available tools to accept wrong<br>
   statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breaking reasoning about programs with types by breaking the type<br>
   system of the programming language in new and interesting ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bad interactions between axiomatic choices in libraries used in <br>
proofs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impacts of the false sense of security when the chain of trust is <br>
broken by<br>
   subtle unsoundness in verification tools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contributions:</h3>
<p>Deadline: 2022-09-01 (23:59 AOE)<br>
Submissions should have 3 pages of text. Additional material <br>
(bibliography, related work, and code examples) will not count toward <br>
this limit.<br>
We strongly encourage authors to include instructions to reproduce <br>
results or exploits.</p>
<p>There will be a friendly peer review process, focusing on checking that <br>
the submitted material is appropriate for the workshop.</p>
<h4>Publication</h4>
<p>Informal proceedings will be made publicly available on the workshop web <br>
page. However, presentation at Unsound does not count as prior <br>
publication, and can later be published at a conference of the authors' <br>
choosing.</p>
<h3>Instruction to Authors</h3>
<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>Authors should be aware of ACM’s policies on plagiarism <br>
(<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism">https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism</a>).</p>
<p>Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers.</p>
<p>Papers must be submitted online at:<br>
<a href="https://unsound2022.hotcrp.com/">https://unsound2022.hotcrp.com/</a></p>
<h4>Formatting:</h4>
<p>Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted <br>
using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines. Authors should use the acmart <br>
format, with the acmsmall sub-format for ACM proceedings. For details, <br>
see:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format">http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format</a></p>
<p>It is recommended to use the review option when submitting a paper; this <br>
option enables line numbers for easy reference in reviews.</p>
