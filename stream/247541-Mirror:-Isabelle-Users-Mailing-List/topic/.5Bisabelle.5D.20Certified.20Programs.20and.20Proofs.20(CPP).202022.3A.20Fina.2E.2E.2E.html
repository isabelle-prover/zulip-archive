<p>From: Andrei Popescu &lt;<a href="mailto:andrei.h.popescu@gmail.com">andrei.h.popescu@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP) is an international conference on<br>
practical and theoretical topics in all areas that consider formal<br>
verification and certification as an essential paradigm for their<br>
work. CPP spans areas of computer science, mathematics, logic, and<br>
education.</p>
<p>CPP 2022 (<a href="https://popl22.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2022">https://popl22.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2022</a>) will be held on<br>
17-18 January 2022 and will be co-located with POPL 2022 in<br>
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. CPP 2022 is sponsored by<br>
ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGLOG.</p>
<p>CPP 2022 will welcome contributions from all members of the community.<br>
The CPP 2022 organizers will strive to enable both in-person and<br>
remote participation, in cooperation with the POPL 2022 organizers.</p>
<p>NEWS</p>
<p>If the authors of a CPP 2022 accepted paper will be unable or<br>
unwilling to travel to the conference, the organizers can confirm that<br>
this will not affect the paper’s publication in the proceedings, and<br>
the authors will be able to upload recorded talks that will be made<br>
publicly available.</p>

<p>DISTINGUISHED PAPER AWARDS</p>
<p>Around 10% of the accepted papers at CPP 2022 will be designated as<br>
Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the CPP<br>
program committee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to<br>
their relevance, originality, significance and clarity.</p>

<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>
<p>Prior to the paper submission deadline, the authors should upload<br>
their anonymized paper in PDF format through the HotCRP system at</p>
<p><a href="https://cpp2022.hotcrp.com">https://cpp2022.hotcrp.com</a></p>
<p>The submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient<br>
detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the<br>
contribution. They must be formatted following the ACM SIGPLAN<br>
Proceedings format using the acmart style with the sigplan option,<br>
which provides a two-column style, using 10 point font for the main<br>
text, and a header for double blind review submission, i.e.,</p>
<p>\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,anonymous,review]{acmart}\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}</p>
<p>The submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages, including tables and<br>
figures, but excluding bibliography and clearly marked appendices. The<br>
papers should be self-contained without the appendices. Shorter papers<br>
are welcome and will be given equal consideration. Submissions not<br>
conforming to the requirements concerning format and maximum length<br>
may be rejected without further consideration.</p>
<p>CPP 2022 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. To<br>
facilitate this, the submissions must adhere to two rules:<br>
(1) author names and institutions must be omitted, and<br>
(2) references to authors’ own related work should be in the third<br>
person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We<br>
build on the work of ...").</p>
<p>The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers<br>
come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make<br>
it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try.<br>
Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the<br>
submission or makes the job of reviewing it more difficult. In<br>
particular, important background references should not be omitted or<br>
anonymized. In addition, authors are free to disseminate their ideas<br>
or draft versions of their papers as usual. For example, authors may<br>
post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research<br>
ideas. POPL has answers to frequently asked questions addressing many<br>
common concerns:<br>
<a href="https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ">https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ</a></p>
<p>We strongly encourage the authors to provide any supplementary<br>
material that supports the claims made in the paper, such as proof<br>
scripts or experimental data. This material must be uploaded at<br>
submission time, as an archive, not via a URL. Two forms of<br>
supplementary material may be submitted:<br>
(1) Anonymous supplementary material is made available to the<br>
reviewers before they submit their first-draft reviews.<br>
(2) Non-anonymous supplementary material is made available to the<br>
reviewers after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have<br>
learned the identity of the authors.</p>
<p>Please use anonymous supplementary material whenever possible, so that<br>
it can be taken into account from the beginning of the reviewing<br>
process.</p>
<p>The submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy<br>
(<a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/</a>) and the<br>
ACM Policy on Plagiarism<br>
(<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism">https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism</a>). Concurrent<br>
submissions to other conferences, journals, workshops with<br>
proceedings, or similar forums of publication are not allowed. The PC<br>
chairs should be informed of closely related work submitted to a<br>
conference or journal in advance of submission. One author of each<br>
accepted paper is expected to present it at the (possibly virtual)<br>
conference.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION, COPYRIGHT AND OPEN ACCESS</p>
<p>The CPP 2022 proceedings will be published by the ACM, and authors of<br>
accepted papers will be required to choose one of the following<br>
publication options:<br>
(1) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a<br>
non-exclusive permission-to-publish license and, optionally, licenses<br>
the work under a Creative Commons license.<br>
(2) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive<br>
permission-to-publish license.<br>
(3) Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.</p>
<p>For authors who can afford it, we recommend option (1), which will<br>
make the paper Gold Open Access, and also encourage such authors to<br>
license their work under the CC-BY license. ACM will charge you an<br>
article processing fee for this option (currently, US$700), which you<br>
have to pay directly with the ACM.</p>
<p>For everyone else, we recommend option (2), which is free and allows<br>
you to achieve Green Open Access, by uploading a preprint of your<br>
paper to a repository that guarantees permanent archival such as arXiv<br>
or HAL. This is anyway a good idea for timely dissemination even if<br>
you chose option 1. Ensuring timely dissemination is particularly<br>
important for this edition, since, because of the very tight schedule,<br>
the official proceedings might not be available in time for CPP.</p>
<p>The official CPP 2022 proceedings will also be available via SIGPLAN<br>
OpenTOC (<a href="http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp">http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp</a>).</p>
<p>For ACM’s take on this, see their Copyright Policy<br>
(<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy">http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy</a>) and Author<br>
Rights (<a href="http://authors.acm.org/main.html">http://authors.acm.org/main.html</a>).</p>
