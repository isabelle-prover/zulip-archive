<p>From: Steve Zdancewic &lt;<a href="mailto:stevez@seas.upenn.edu">stevez@seas.upenn.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP) is an international conference on <br>
practical<br>
and theoretical topics in all areas that consider formal verification and<br>
certification as an essential paradigm for their work. CPP spans areas of<br>
computer science, mathematics, logic, and education.</p>
<p>CPP 2023 (<a href="https://popl23.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2023">https://popl23.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2023</a>) will be held on 16-17<br>
January 2023 and will be co-located with POPL 2023 in Boston, Massachusetts,<br>
United States. CPP 2023 is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM<br>
SIGLOG.</p>
<p>CPP 2023 will welcome contributions from all members of the community. <br>
The CPP<br>
2023 organizers will strive to enable both in-person and remote <br>
participation,<br>
in cooperation with the POPL 2023 organizers.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract Submission Deadline: 14 September 2022 at 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h)</li>
<li>Paper Submission Deadline: 21 September 2022 at 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h)</li>
<li>Notification (tentative): 21 November 2022</li>
<li>Camera Ready Deadline (tentative): 12 December 2022</li>
<li>Conference: 16-17 January 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>Deadlines expire at the end of the day, anywhere on earth. Abstract and<br>

<p>DISTINGUISHED PAPER AWARDS</p>
<p>Around 10% of the accepted papers at CPP 2023 will be designated as<br>
Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the CPP program<br>
committee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance,<br>
originality, significance and clarity.</p>

<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>
<p>Prior to the paper submission deadline, the authors should upload their<br>
anonymized paper in PDF format through the HotCRP system at</p>
<p><a href="https://cpp2023.hotcrp.com">https://cpp2023.hotcrp.com</a></p>
<p>The submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to<br>
allow the program committee to assess the merits of the contribution. <br>
They must<br>
be formatted following the ACM SIGPLAN Proceedings format using the <br>
acmart style<br>
with the sigplan option, which provides a two-column style, using 10 <br>
point font<br>
for the main text, and a header for double blind review submission, i.e.,</p>
<p>\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,anonymous,review]{acmart}\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}</p>
<p>The submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages, including tables and <br>
figures,<br>
but excluding bibliography and clearly marked appendices. The papers <br>
should be<br>
self-contained without the appendices. Shorter papers are welcome and <br>
will be<br>
given equal consideration. Submissions not conforming to the requirements<br>
concerning format and maximum length may be rejected without further<br>
consideration.</p>
<p>CPP 2023 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process <br>
following the<br>
process from previous years. To facilitate this, the submissions must <br>
adhere to<br>
two rules:<br>
(1) author names and institutions must be omitted, and<br>
(2) references to authors’ own related work should be in the third <br>
person (e.g.,<br>
     not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the <br>
work of<br>
     ...").</p>
<p>The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers <br>
come to an<br>
initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for<br>
them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done <br>
in the<br>
name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of <br>
reviewing it<br>
more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be<br>
omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors are free to disseminate <br>
their ideas<br>
or draft versions of their papers as usual. For example, authors may <br>
post drafts<br>
of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. Note <br>
that POPL<br>
2023 itself will employ full double-blind reviewing, which differs from the<br>
light-weight CPP process.  This FAQ from previous SIGPLAN conference <br>
addresses<br>
many common concerns:<br>
<a href="https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ">https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ</a></p>
<p>We strongly encourage the authors to provide any supplementary material that<br>
supports the claims made in the paper, such as proof scripts or experimental<br>
data. This material must be uploaded at submission time, as an archive, <br>
not via<br>
a URL. Two forms of supplementary material may be submitted:</p>
<p>(1) Anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers <br>
before<br>
they submit their first-draft reviews.</p>
<p>(2) Non-anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers<br>
after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have learned the<br>
identity of the authors.</p>
<p>Please use anonymous supplementary material whenever possible, so that <br>
it can be<br>
taken into account from the beginning of the reviewing process.</p>
<p>The submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy<br>
(<a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/</a>) and the ACM <br>
Policy<br>
on Plagiarism (<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism">https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism</a>). <br>
Concurrent<br>
submissions to other conferences, journals, workshops with proceedings, or<br>
similar forums of publication are not allowed. The PC chairs should be <br>
informed<br>
of closely related work submitted to a conference or journal in advance of<br>
submission. One author of each accepted paper is expected to present it <br>
at the<br>
(possibly virtual) conference.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION, COPYRIGHT AND OPEN ACCESS</p>
<p>The CPP 2023 proceedings will be published by the ACM, and authors of <br>
accepted<br>
papers will be required to choose one of the following publication options:</p>
<p>(1) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive<br>
     permission-to-publish license and, optionally, licenses the work <br>
under a<br>
     Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>(2) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive<br>
     permission-to-publish license.</p>
<p>(3) Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.</p>
<p>For authors who can afford it, we recommend option (1), which will make the<br>
paper Gold Open Access, and also encourage such authors to license their <br>
work<br>
under the CC-BY license. ACM will charge you an article processing fee <br>
for this<br>
option (currently, US$700), which you have to pay directly with the ACM.</p>
<p>For everyone else, we recommend option (2), which is free and allows you to<br>
achieve Green Open Access, by uploading a preprint of your paper to a <br>
repository<br>
that guarantees permanent archival such as arXiv or HAL. This is anyway <br>
a good<br>
idea for timely dissemination even if you chose option 1.</p>
<p>The official CPP 2023 proceedings will also be available via SIGPLAN OpenTOC<br>
(<a href="http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp">http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp</a>).</p>
<p>For ACM’s take on this, see their Copyright Policy<br>
(<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy">http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy</a>) and Author <br>
Rights<br>
(<a href="http://authors.acm.org/main.html">http://authors.acm.org/main.html</a>).</p>
