Special Issue on Theoretical and Practical Aspects of Unification</p>
<hr>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2020, Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence (AMAI)<br>
celebrates its 30th anniversary. Over the years, the journal has<br>
promoted better understanding of the application of quantitative,<br>
combinatorial, logical, algebraic and algorithmic methods to artificial<br>
intelligence areas as diverse as decision support, automated deduction,<br>
reasoning, knowledge-based systems, machine learning, computer vision,<br>
robotics and planning. AMAI special issues are intended to be<br>
collections of original research papers reflecting the intersection of<br>
mathematics and a focussed discipline demonstrating how each has<br>
contributed greatly to the other. A further goal of the journal is to<br>
close the gaps between the fields even further. Papers should report on<br>
current research in the appropriate areas, as well as more retrospective<br>
papers in which progress has been ongoing over a period of time.</p>
<p>The purpose of this special issue of AMAI is to promote research on<br>
theoretical and practical aspects of unification. Unification is<br>
concerned with the problem of making two terms equal, finding solutions<br>
for equations or making formulas equivalent. It is a fundamental process<br>
used in a number of fields of computer science, including automated<br>
reasoning, term rewriting, logic programming, natural language<br>
processing, program analysis, types, etc. The special issue is related<br>
to the topics of the 34th International Workshop on Unification - UNIF<br>
2020. Participants of the workshop, as well as other authors are invited<br>
to submit contributions.</p>
<p>EXAMPLES OF TOPICS</p>
<hr>
<p>This special issue focuses on advanced results on the topics of<br>
unification in a broad sense, which include, but are not limited to, the<br>
following:</p>
<p>- Unification algorithms, calculi and implementations<br>
  - Equational unification and unification modulo theories<br>
  - Unification in modal, fuzzy, temporal and description logics<br>
  - Anti-unification/generalization<br>
  - Semi-unification<br>
  - Narrowing<br>
  - Matching problems<br>
  - Unification in special theories<br>
  - Higher-order unification<br>
  - Combination problems<br>
  - Constraint solving<br>
  - Disunification<br>
  - Complexity issues<br>
  - Type checking and reconstruction<br>
  - Admissibility of inference rules<br>
  - Formalization of unification<br>
  - Tools<br>
  - Applications</p>
