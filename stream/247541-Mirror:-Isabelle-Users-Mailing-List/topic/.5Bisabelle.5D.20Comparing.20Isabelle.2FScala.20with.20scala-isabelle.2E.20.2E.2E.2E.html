<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I cannot fully answer that question because I was not able to find the <br>
documentation of Isabelle/Scala.</p>
<p>(Only the one in the system manual, which did not make clear to me what <br>
Isabelle/Scala supports.)</p>
<p>My impression of Isabelle/Scala is that it focuses a lot on the <br>
high-level operations (theory management, builds, etc.) but does not <br>
have support for operating on lower-level data.</p>
<p>For example, in scala-isabelle, you can directly and transparently work <br>
on terms, cterms, thms, etc. (For example, I can do something like <br>
"thm.proposition match { case Const("HOL.Trueprop", t) =&gt; do something <br>
with term t }". (And references on the scala side to Isabelle values can <br>
get automatically garbage collected etc.)</p>
<p>(And of course, this is extensible by ML code fragments in the Scala <br>
program.)</p>
<p>Of course, assuming that Isabelle/Scala allows to transfer data (e.g., <br>
XML trees) between Scala and Isabelle, and that it allows to execute ML <br>
code, it would be possible to do all those things also with <br>
Isabelle/Scala. But the question is whether that support is part of <br>
Isabelle/Scala, or is something that can be hypothetically implemented. <br>
The basic invocation and communication between Scala and Isabelle is <br>
just 1k LOC in scala-isabelle, so that's the smallest part of it.</p>
<p>In fact, I think that it would be easy to base scala-isabelle on a <br>
different communication protocol, e.g., Isabelle/Scala. However, I opted <br>
to make a simple lowlevel protocol instead because that way I got a <br>
factor 1000 improvement in roundtrip time over what Lars Hupel's <br>
libisabelle has. (And afaik, libisabelle was built on top of <br>
Isabelle/PIDE, not sure how this relates to Isabelle/Scala.)</p>
<p>That being said, I think it should not be hard to refactor <br>
scala-isabelle so that one can choose whether to use Scala/Isabelle or <br>
my own protocol for the communication.</p>
<p>All of this, of course, is under the assumption that I my guesses are <br>
right about what Isabelle/Scala does.</p>
<p>I would be happy if you can elucidate me as to what the purpose of <br>
Isabelle/Scala is, and what features it has.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

<p>The proper way is to define Isabelle/Isar commands in Isabelle/ML, and let the<br>
Isabelle/Scala front-end work in a high-level way with it.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 of the "system" manual describes a fairly simple and declarative<br>
server protocol to work with Isabelle documents: the socket-version works via<br>
JSON (e.g. for Python), but it is easier to work with the same in<br>
Isabelle/Scala (the Headless PIDE session).</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Some further side-remarks specifically for Isabelle2021 (see NEWS):</p>
<ul>
<li>General support for Isabelle/Scala system services, configured via the<br>
shell function "isabelle_scala_service" in etc/settings (e.g. of an<br>
Isabelle component); see implementations of class<br>
Isabelle_System.Service in Isabelle/Scala. This supersedes former<br>
"isabelle_scala_tools" and "isabelle_file_format": minor<br>
INCOMPATIBILITY.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various examples may be found by using Isabelle/jEdit hypersearch for the text<br>
"isabelle_scala_service" within all "settings" files in the $ISABELLE_HOME<br>
directory (and all subdirectories).</p>
<p>An alternative is to search for class instances of "Isabelle_System.Service"<br>
in *.scala files within $ISABELLE_HOME.</p>
<p>As an abstract example, a user-defined Isabelle/Scala module could register<br>
its own command-line tools or Isabelle server commands (for JSON access). The<br>
Scala implementation does the main system integration; if some mathematical<br>
logic is required, it will be done in an auxiliary theory context for the tool<br>
(e.g. embedded ML files to define Isar commands).</p>
<p>As a concrete example, consider Isabelle/Naproche in Isabelle2021-RC5. Follow<br>
the Documentation pointer to $ISABELLE_NAPROCHE/Ex.thy --- it contains some<br>
hints about the implementation at the bottom. Apart from Isabelle/ML and<br>
Isabelle/Scala, this involves another program implemented in Haskell. The<br>
latter uses Isabelle/Haskell library for basic communication with<br>
Isabelle/PIDE (even with properly checked antiquotations instead of freely<br>
invented string literals).</p>

<p>There can be several reasons (it depends on the project):</p>
<p>* We use Isabelle as part of a bigger application (e.g., I developed<br>
    the qrhl-tool theorem prover in Scala, and it uses Isabelle as a<br>
    component for reasoning about verification conditions).</p>
<p>* Scala is easier to debug and edit with modern IDEs. Isabelle/ML has<br>
    some support (e.g., ctrl-click is useful), but imho it does not come<br>
    close to the tool support that we have in modern IDEs.</p>
<p>* I want integration with GUI components. (E.g., I could imagine some<br>
    tool to interactively explore the structure of terms. This would be<br>
    possible with Isabelle/Scala, I think, but I would have to serialize<br>
    all possibly relevant information about the terms, send them over in<br>
    a bunch, and then deserialize them. Lots of boilerplate.)</p>
<p>About the antiquotation: This was just an illustrative example. You can <br>
also use antiquotations in Scala, so you could write something like <br>
/term match { case term"?x ==&gt; Trueprop ?y" =&gt; print(x); print(y) }/.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why give up static scopes and types by pretending that ML operations can<br>

</blockquote>
<p>Since Scala has a rich type system on its own, there is no need to give <br>
up on those things. ML types can be mirrored on the Scala side.</p>

<p>The choice is up to you. Within the regular Isabelle ecosystem, the proper<br>
language for heavy-duty symbolic logic is Isabelle/ML: it has been made<br>
precisely for that over 35 years. We could not crunch the great things in AFP<br>
without Isabelle/ML as it is today.</p>
<p>To conclude this overview of possibilities, here is a further NEWS entry from<br>
Isabelle2021:</p>
<p><strong>* ML </strong>*</p>
<ul>
<li>Antiquotations @{scala_function}, @{scala}, @{scala_thread} refer to<br>
registered Isabelle/Scala functions (of type String =&gt; String):<br>
invocation works via the PIDE protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that Isabelle/ML programs can appeal to operations in Scala, if<br>
that happens to be available on that side, e.g. for historical reaans or<br>
existing Java implementations. Thus the order of control is straight-forward:<br>
ML hands over to Scala like a regular function call, without any special<br>
programming tricks exposed outside.</p>
<p>An example application is Nitpick/Kodkod, which works either as a heavy JVM<br>
process or light Scala thread (both invoked from Isabelle/ML):</p>
<p><a href="https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle-release/file/Isabelle2021-RC5/src/HOL/Tools/Nitpick/kodkod.ML#l1003">https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle-release/file/Isabelle2021-RC5/src/HOL/Tools/Nitpick/kodkod.ML#l1003</a></p>
<p><a href="https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle-release/file/Isabelle2021-RC5/src/HOL/Tools/Nitpick/kodkod.scala">https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle-release/file/Isabelle2021-RC5/src/HOL/Tools/Nitpick/kodkod.scala</a></p>
<p>Side-remark: Originally I wanted to get rid of the JVM process for<br>
Isabelle2021, but this has to wait for the next release, due to remaining<br>
assumptions in the Kodkod implementation concerning the Java context<br>
(interrupts, threads, exit).</p>
<blockquote>

modern IDEs. Isabelle/ML has some support<br>
(e.g., ctrl-click is useful), but imho it<br>
does not come close to the tool support<br>
that we have in modern IDEs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term "modern" sounds very old-fashioned to me. Modern times have ended<br>
some decades ago; we now have the post-modern era.</p>
<p>For Isabelle projects, the Isabelle Prover IDE has very good integration of<br>
everything: Isar, ML, other sub-languages. I know this best and like this<br>
best. It is also quite easy to integrate your own sub-languages with PIDE<br>
support (implemented all in Isabelle/ML).</p>
<p>Isabelle/Scala is an exception: it is not (yet?) integrated into<br>
Isabelle/PIDE, but the "isabelle scala_project" tool allows to generate a<br>
Gradle project for use in IntelliJ IDEA: I do like that IDE, but that alone<br>
would never be a reason to disregard our fine Isabelle/ML working environment.</p>
<p>VSCode is another popular quasi-IDE option: Isabelle/VSCode is a minimal<br>
experiment, much more could be done. Generally, I see a lot of IDE concepts<br>
retrofitted into the VSCode editor project, but it might require 5-10 more<br>
years to become a proper IDE.</p>
