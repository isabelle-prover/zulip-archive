<p>From: David Kretzmer &lt;<a href="mailto:david.k@posteo.de">david.k@posteo.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>I am developing an executable operational semantics for a programming<br>
language in Isabelle/HOL. One area that makes me a bit uneasy is the<br>
existence of <code>undefined</code>. Since the occurrence of <code>undefined</code> may<br>
indicate a bug in the semantics (e.g., an off-by-one error when indexing<br>
into a list) and also raises an exception during execution, I would like<br>
to prove that any final execution state obtained by the transition<br>
relation is independent of <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<p>However, as <code>undefined</code> is a undetermined yet legal value there does not<br>
seem a way to express this property. The only alternative I see is to<br>
prove the much stronger property that any final execution state is part<br>
of a set of known, valid states. However, I would like to start with the<br>
simpler property (i.e., no <code>undefined</code>). Is this possible?</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
David</p>

Undefined means "underdefined" - it is some value, but we don't know which one. <br>
Proving that something is different from undefined is not very meaningful. For <br>
example, you can prove "Suc undefined ~= undefined", but what good does that do? <br>
You have to prove the "stronger property" you talk about.</p>

For polymorphic functions, one can at least prove parametricity, which<br>
(by some extra-logical meta argument) should imply that the function<br>
does not produce any "undefined"s unless they were already present in<br>
the input.</p>
<p>I don't think that is very applicable in your case though. And it might<br>
not be any more useful than just going through the definitions by hand<br>
and checking that they don't call any partial functions like "hd" (there<br>
are not /that/ many operations that can crash in the standard code setup<br>
for HOL, I think).</p>
<p>In any case, HOL is a logic, not a programming language. It doesn't have<br>
any notion of "execution". I therefore think that anything you do inside<br>
the logic will never be able to capture statements about what happens<br>
during execution faithfully.</p>
<p>Even if your definition logically does not produce "undefined", even if<br>
you prove that it always retuns "42", you could still have a code<br>
equation somewhere that does something silly like "if undefined =<br>
(undefined :: nat) then … else …" that crashes at run time. Or<br>
non-termination.</p>
<p>I think the only way to get any real guarantees would be to have a<br>
semantics of the target language (that you export your code into) and<br>
then reason about execution with that. Or do the opposite: take an<br>
implementation of your algorithm and prove it equivalent to the HOL<br>
definition through some verification framework.</p>
<p>Something like a verified code generator that certifies termination and<br>
exception-freedom would also work. I think Lars Hupel's verified code<br>
generator to CakeML went into that direction, but I don't know if he<br>
proved these properties. Plus it would probably not be able to handle an<br>
example as big as yours is likely to be.</p>

<p>From: David Kretzmer &lt;<a href="mailto:david.k@posteo.de">david.k@posteo.de</a>&gt;<br>
It is true that I'm currently using Isabelle/HOL with a mindset based on<br>
executable programming languages, and in this context "undefined" feels<br>
a bit like the danger of dereferencing an invalid pointer. However,<br>
since the exceptional behavior of "undefined" is only part of the target<br>
language it makes sense that you cannot reason about it in Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>Also, without code generation, I guess the only thing you care about a<br>
(function) definition is what you can prove about it. If the property<br>
you want to prove uses parts of the definition that unexpectedly depend<br>
on "undefined", then the proof may fail and you have to fix the<br>
definition. On the other hand, if "undefined" occurs only in parts of<br>
the definition that are irrelevant for the proof, then you don't care.</p>
<p>So the difference between the proof language perspective and the<br>
programming language perspective seems to be that in the former, you<br>
deal with "undefined" when you encounter it (in this sense "undefined"<br>
may just indicates an error in the definition, no different from other<br>
possible definition errors), while in the programming language<br>
perspective you want to ensure from the start that you <em>never</em> encounter<br>
"undefined".</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the detailed responses!</p>

Perhaps it would work better if you formalised a more traditional operational semantics, making explicit the idea of an execution becoming stuck (due to either an error in the semantics or a runtime error). Presumably an evaluation function could be refined from that.</p>

Do I understand correctly that by "more traditional" you mean defining<br>
the semantics by a transition relation using, e.g., an inductive<br>
predicate? Initially the semantics actually was defined using an<br>
inductive predicate, and then "undefined" is indeed not a problem.<br>
However, the semantics needs to detect and handle many different runtime<br>
errors, which led to many similar but slightly different rules in the<br>
transition relation. For me, defining the same semantics in a functional<br>
style was more concise.</p>
