<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>The calculational reasoning feature of Isabelle/Isar (commands "also" <br>
and "finally") is very useful for many complex calculations but I <br>
repeatedly found one area where it is hard to use.</p>
<p>Namely, when working with potentially undefined expressions (e.g., <br>
limits, series, integrals, suprema, division by zero, etc.).</p>
<p>(Side note: I am aware that Isabelle/HOL is total. I do not wish to <br>
resurrect the discussion whether things such as division by zero should <br>
have a fixed default value or not. When I say "undefined", I mean it in <br>
the sense of "the limit doesn't exist" etc. in common mathematical <br>
parlance, irrespective of how the HOL-constant is precisely defined. <br>
Also, my meaning of "undefined" has nothing to do with the existing <br>
HOL-constant "undefined".)</p>
<p>For example, in a mathematical proof involving series, I may have a <br>
calculation saying \ \sum_{ }^{ }f_i\le\sum_{ }^{ }g_i\le\sum_{ }^{ <br>
}h_i=z, with a comment explaining something like "here the left series <br>
exist because the right one exists". Or somewhat more formally, we <br>
consider each of the series as an expression that can be a number, or <br>
"undefined", and we interpret x\le y as meaning "if /y/ is defined, then <br>
/x/ is defined and x\le y".</p>
<p>When translating such proofs to Isabelle/HOL, I very often end up having <br>
to do the calculation twice. I do one part of the proof that has a <br>
sequence of steps of the form "summable h_i \implies summable g_i". And <br>
then once these are established, I do the steps "\sum_{ }^{ <br>
}g_i\le\sum_{ }^{ }h_i" etc. This increases duplication and reduces <br>
readability a lot. Especially when I have nested series (where the <br>
summands of a series might also be series that are potentially <br>
undefined), things get hard to read).</p>
<p>Instead of this, one could recreate what is implicitly done in the <br>
mathematical proof as follows:</p>
<p>* One rewrites the expressions \sum_{ }^{ }g_i (of type real) into<br>
    expressions of type "real option", returning None if the series does<br>
    not exist (or any of the summands does not exist).<br>
    (Essentially, treating the computation as something that happens in<br>
    the maybe-monad.)</p>
<p>* One defines a relation \le' on "real option" that has the meaning<br>
    "smaller-equal, and left is defined if right is" as described above.</p>
<p>There are two problems with that. First, one needs to define a lot of <br>
new relations (e.g., "smaller, left if right", "smaller-equal, right if <br>
left", "..., right if and only if left", etc.) I think this would not be <br>
a big one problem (e.g., one could have second order constants such as <br>
"left_if_right" mapping \le into \le' and define some appropriate <br>
syntactic sugar for readability).</p>
<p>The second problem is more substantial: Rewriting an expression of type <br>
"real" (or any other type involved in calculational reasoning) into <br>
"real option" is difficult. (Not conceptually difficult but difficult to <br>
do correctly.) \sum_{ }^{ }g_i would be replaced by "if summable g_i <br>
then Some \sum_{ }^{ }g_i else None". (This can be made more readable <br>
with a new constant "series_lifted", of course.) And even worse, <br>
something like \sum_i^{ }\left(g_i+\sum_j^{ }h_{ij}\right) becomes a <br>
very unreadable term since it is None if any of the inner series diverge <br>
or if the outer one diverges.</p>
<p>I would like to resolve these difficulties, and my idea is the following:</p>
<p>* Write an ML function "lift: term -&gt; term" that transforms normal<br>
    expressions (e.g., of type real) to "lifted" expression (of type<br>
    "real option").<br>
    This function would of course need some configuration, e.g., to know<br>
    that "series :: (nat real -&gt; real)" is something that can return<br>
    something "undefined" and under what conditions this happens.<br>
    This is the hard part and needs careful thinking about the details,<br>
    I think.</p>
<p>* Add some syntactic sugar and parse/print translations so that this<br>
    function would be applied when parsing terms.<br>
    (E.g., "\sum_{ }^{ }g_i\ \left[\le\right]_{\leftarrow}\ \sum_{ }^{<br>
    }h_i" might be replaced by something like "series_lifted g_i \le'<br>
    series_lifted h'" on parsing and translated back on printing, where<br>
    "series_lifted" is what the ML-function lift returns.)</p>
<p>* Add a bunch of additional lemmas to ease working with these things.<br>
    (E.g., trans-rules for constants such as \le'. And wrapper-lemmas<br>
    expressing existing results in terms of "series_lifted" etc., e.g.)</p>
<p>Before I set out on this endeavor, I would like to hear from others <br>
whether there are other, better approaches to deal with calculational <br>
reasoning in these situations. Or whether there are existing <br>
implementations of this or a similar idea (in Isabelle, or in other <br>
provers).</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

Dear Dominique,</p>
<p>just an observation: what you propose reminds me of what I suggested<br>
years ago for Matita/Coq</p>
<p>Claudio Sacerdoti Coen and Enrico Zoli. “A Note on Formalising<br>
Undefined Terms in Real Analysis”. In: PATE’07 (2007), p. 3. url:<br>
<a href="https://www.cs.unibo.it/˜sacerdot/PAPERS/pate07.pdf">https://www.cs.unibo.it/˜sacerdot/PAPERS/pate07.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed one needs multiple relations, but the interesting part is that<br>
one observes in practice in real-world proofs very long zig-zags of the<br>
form  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   etc. where &gt; means "if lhs is defined,<br>
rhs is" and &lt; the opposite. This allows to provide explicit proofs of<br>
definedness only at the peaks of the zig-zags, like mathematicians do<br>
informally.</p>
<p>At the time there were not many easy ways to automate what we proposed<br>
in Coq/Matita, but I think that nowadays it should be much simpler to<br>
do, letting the system infer automatically what decorations to use for<br>
relations and for the lemmas.</p>
<p>Since you are reviving my interest into that, please let me know if you<br>
plan to actually work on that for Isar.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
C.S.C.</p>
