<p>From: "Eugene W. Stark" &lt;<a href="mailto:isabelle-users@starkeffect.com">isabelle-users@starkeffect.com</a>&gt;<br>
The 45-line definition of function "resid" in the attached theory takes between 30 and 40 minutes<br>
to process.  This time increased very rapidly from a previous value of about 3 minutes when I added<br>
four clauses (the four preceding the final default clause).  The original definition was stated with<br>
"fun" but I split it up using "function" to try to see which part was consuming the time.<br>
About one minute is used to process the "function (sequential)" declaration, with the remainder of<br>
the time going to the proof of 46057 subgoals "by pat_completeness auto".  The termination proof<br>
does not take significant time.  I note that the time-consuming portion appears to be single-threaded.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do, or am I out of luck?  The 30-40 minute processing time is probably<br>
prohibitive for what I was trying to do, so it looks like I will have to abandon the generalization<br>
I was trying to make and revert to a simpler version that processes in reasonable time.</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions.<br>

Attached you find a version that works in reasonable time. I reduced the size of <br>
the patterns by replacing all "Var 0" by "vn" and testing if "vn ~= Var 0 \/ <br>
...". This got the number of cases just below 10.000. [I believe I did not <br>
change the meaning of the equations as a result]</p>
<p>Note that the problem of minimizing the number of cases is hard: <br>

Thanks!  The ideas for reducing the processing time are very helpful.</p>
<p>I think there is something else going on besides the sheer number of subgoals, because removing<br>
the last four clauses in my original example still leaves about 18,000 subgoals, but the processing<br>
time is only about 3 minutes.  I guess when the patterns are expanded to the next level of depth<br>
it applies a multiplicative factor to the time taken to discharge the subgoals.  One gets used to<br>
the function package often working so well that it is quite startling to see an exponential jump in<br>
processing time with relatively small changes to the definitions.</p>
<p>Right now I am confused, though, and I have to go back and re-do my homework on this definition.<br>
I hit a blocking point in the series of lemmas I was trying to generalize and I jumped to the conclusion<br>
that I had missed some critical pairs (hence the additional four clauses), but at this moment I am not<br>
so sure any more.</p>
<p>Anyway, your ideas at least provide me with some control over my fate.  Thanks again!</p>

Hmm, I wonder if some of the non-mandatory features of the function<br>
package (such as the generation of elimination rules) might affect the<br>
performance negatively here. Perhaps one could try to put an option into<br>
the function package to disable the generation of these and see what<br>
happens.</p>

I'm not so sure. It's difficult to assess because I for one cannot get<br>
it to build at all.</p>
<p>Even if I replace the "by pat_completeness auto" with "sorry", Isabelle<br>
just crashes after a few minutes. Both with x86_32 and x64. And that's<br>
on my beefy 32 GB machine.</p>
<p>If I replace it with a "apply pat_completeness apply auto oops" it runs<br>
for something like 20 minutes and then freezes up my PC and crashes<br>
(possibly killed by the OOM killer).</p>
<p>The function package does a lot of work after pattern completeness and<br>
non-overlappingness have been proven. This is the stuff that happens<br>
when you write "done". I for one think there is a good chance that this<br>
is just as expensive as the user-contributed proofs, if not more so.</p>

<p>Eugene and I could get up to "apply auto" in a matter of a very few minutes. It <br>
is the auto (I also tried simp_all) that kills us.</p>

<p>Maybe so, but we never got to "done".</p>
<p>With the simplified version (with 10.000 cases), "auto" takes 30+ secs, "done" <br>
