<p>CONFERENCE SCOPE AND PUBLICATION</p>
<p>FMCAD 2021 is the twenty-first in a series of conferences on the theory and<br>
applications of formal methods in hardware and system verification. FMCAD<br>
provides a leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for<br>
presenting and discussing groundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical<br>
results, and tools for reasoning formally about computing systems. FMCAD<br>
covers formal aspects of computer-aided system design including<br>
verification, specification, synthesis, and testing.<br>
FMCAD employs a rigorous peer-review process. Accepted papers are published<br>
by TU Wien Academic Press under a Creative Commons license (the authors<br>
retain the copyright) and distributed through the IEEE XPlore digital<br>
library. There are no publication fees. At least one of the authors is<br>
required to register for the conference and present the accepted paper. A<br>
small number of outstanding FMCAD submissions will be considered for<br>
inclusion in a Special Issue of the journal on Formal Methods in System<br>
Design (FMSD).</p>
<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST</p>
<p>FMCAD welcomes submission of papers reporting original research on advances<br>
in all aspects of formal methods and their applications to computer- aided<br>
design. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):* Model<br>
checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and reduction,<br>
compositional methods, decision procedures at the bit- and word-level,<br>
probabilistic methods, combinations of deductive methods and decision<br>
procedures.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Synthesis and compilation for computer system descriptions, modeling,<br>
specification, and implementation languages, formal semantics of languages<br>
and their subsets, model-based design, design derivation and<br>
transformation, correct-by-construction methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application of formal and semi-formal methods to functional and<br>
non-functional specification and validation of hardware and software,<br>
including timing and power modeling, verification of computing systems on<br>
all levels of abstraction, system-level design and verification for<br>
embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, automotive systems and other<br>
safety-critical systems, hardware-software co-design and verification, and<br>
transaction-level verification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience with the application of formal and semi-formal methods to<br>
industrial-scale designs; tools that represent formal verification<br>
enablement, new features, or a substantial improvement in the automation of<br>
formal methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application of formal methods to verifying safety, connectivity and<br>
security properties of networks, distributed systems, smart contracts,<br>
block chains, and IoT devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference/?conf=fmcad21Two">https://easychair.org/my/conference/?conf=fmcad21Two</a> categories of papers<br>
are invited: Regular papers, and Tool &amp; Case Study papers. Regular papers<br>
are expected to offer novel foundational ideas, theoretical results, or<br>
algorithmic improvements to existing methods, along with experimental<br>
impact validation where applicable. Tool &amp; Case Study papers are expected<br>
to report on the design, implementation or use of verification (or related)<br>
technology in a practically relevant context (which need not be<br>
industrial), and its impact on design processes.</p>
<p>Both Regular and Tool &amp; Case study papers must use the IEEE Transactions<br>
format on letter-size paper with a 10-point font size. Papers in both<br>
categories can be either 8 pages (long) or 4 pages (short) in length not<br>
including references. Short papers that describe emerging results,<br>
practical experiences, or original ideas that can be described succinctly<br>
are encouraged. Authors will be required to select an appropriate paper<br>
category at abstract submission time. Submissions may contain an optional<br>
appendix, which will not appear in the final version of the paper. The<br>
reviewers should be able to assess the quality and the relevance of the<br>
results in the paper without reading the appendix.</p>
<p>Submissions in both categories must contain original research that has not<br>
been previously published, nor is concurrently submitted for publication.<br>
Any partial overlap with published or concurrently submitted papers must be<br>
clearly indicated. If experimental results are reported, authors are<br>
strongly encouraged to provide the reviewers access to their data at<br>
submission time, so that results can be independently verified. The review<br>
process is single blind.</p>
<p>Authors of accepted contributions will be required to sign the FMCAD<br>
copyright transfer form found here: <a href="https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf">https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>STUDENT FORUM</p>
<p>Continuing the tradition of the previous years, FMCAD 2021 is hosting a<br>
Student Forum that provides a platform for graduate students at any career<br>
stage to introduce their research to the wider Formal Methods community,<br>
and solicit feedback.Submissions for the event must be short reports<br>
describing research ideas or ongoing work that the student is currently<br>
pursuing, and must be within the scope of FMCAD. Work, part of which has<br>
been previously published, will be considered; the novel aspect to be<br>
addressed in future work must be clearly described in such cases. All<br>
submissions will be reviewed by a select group of FMCAD program committee<br>
members.</p>
