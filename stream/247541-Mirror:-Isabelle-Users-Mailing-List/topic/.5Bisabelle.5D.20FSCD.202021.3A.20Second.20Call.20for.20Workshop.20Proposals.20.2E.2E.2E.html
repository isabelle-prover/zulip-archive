<p>Second Call for Workshop Proposals<br>
FSCD 2021<br>
<a href="https://fscd2021.dc.uba.ar">https://fscd2021.dc.uba.ar</a><br>
Buenos Aires, Argentina<br>
Main Conference: 19-22 July 2021<br>
Workshops: 17-18 and 23-24 July 2021</p>
<hr>
<p>FSCD 2021 will be the sixth edition of the International Conference<br>
on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction. Due to the<br>
Covid 19 pandemic situation, the 2021 edition of FSCD and its<br>
satellite workshops will be held online.</p>
<p>We invite proposals for workshops, tutorials or other satellite<br>
events, on any topic related to formal structures in computation,<br>
deduction and automated reasoning, from theoretical foundations to<br>
tools and applications.</p>
<p>Satellite events will take place online on the 17-18 and 23-24 July,<br>
before and after the main conference (19-22 July). It is expected<br>
that satellite events would run for 1 or 2 days, and be open to<br>
participants of parallel events.</p>
<p>PROPOSALS</p>
<hr>
<p>Proposals must be limited to three pages and should be submitted via<br>
EasyChair</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fscd2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fscd2021</a> (Workshops track)</p>
<p>Each proposal should consist of the following two parts.</p>
<p>1) A description part including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a short scientific justification of the proposed topic,<br>
   Its significance, and the particular benefits of the workshop to<br>
   the community, as well as a list of previous or related workshops<br>
   (if relevant);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a brief description (up to 120 words) of the event for the website<br>
   and publicity material.<br>
2) An organisational part including:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>contact information for the workshop organisers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>name of the organiser in the role of FSCD Workshops Scheduling<br>
   Committee member (*);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>estimate of the number of workshop participants;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>proposed format and agenda (e.g. paper presentations, tutorials,<br>
   demo sessions, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>potential invited speakers;</p>
</li>
<li>procedures for selecting papers and participants;</li>
<li>
<p>tentative schedule for paper submission and notification of<br>
   acceptance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plans for dissemination, if any (e.g. a journal special issue);</p>
</li>
<li>duration (which may vary from one day to two days);</li>
<li>preferred period (pre, or post main conference);</li>
<li>any other special requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>(*) The FSCD Workshops Scheduling Committee will include one of the<br>
organisers of each accepted workshop and have the role to concoct a<br>
scientifically coherent program of all workshops mitigating<br>
superpositions of connected talks. This organisational effort will<br>
require that each workshop finalise their selection of talks and<br>
invited speakers within a common pertinent deadline to be defined<br>
so that possible overlaps can be minimised. Please, consider this<br>
when preparing the tentative schedule of your workshop proposal.</p>
<p>The Organising Committee of FSCD will determine the final list of<br>
accepted workshops based on the recommendations from the Workshop<br>
Chairs and availability of space and facilities.</p>
<p>The organisers of satellite events are expected to create and<br>
maintain a website for the event; handle paper selection, reviewing<br>
and acceptance; draw up a tentative programme of talks; advertise<br>
their event though specialist mailing lists; prepare the informal<br>
pre-proceedings (if applicable) in a timely fashion; and arrange any<br>
post-proceedings. Some amount of financial support may be offered to<br>
workshops, depending on the number of participants.</p>
<p>The FSCD Organising Committee will handle promotion of the event on<br>
the main conference website; integration of the event's programme<br>
into the overall timetable; registration of participants; arrangement<br>
of an appropriate virtual meeting room and technical support will be<br>
provided by the FSCD organising committee.</p>
