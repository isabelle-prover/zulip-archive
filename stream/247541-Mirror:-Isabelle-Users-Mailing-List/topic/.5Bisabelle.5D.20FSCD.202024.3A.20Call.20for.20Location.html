<p>Call for Location for FSCD 2024</p>
<p>The FSCD conference covers all aspects of Formal Structures for<br>
Computation and Deduction from theoretical foundations to<br>
applications.  The annual FSCD conference comprises the main<br>
conference and a considerable number of affiliated workshops<br>
(expectedly, more than ten).</p>
<p>We invite proposals for locations to host the 9th FSCD International<br>
Conference to be held during the summer of 2024. Previous (and<br>
upcoming) FSCD meetings include:</p>
<p>FSCD 2016 in Porto (Portugal);<br>
FSCD 2017 in Oxford (UK) co-located with ICFP 2017;<br>
FSCD 2018 in Oxford (UK) as part of FLoC 2018;<br>
FSCD 2019 in Dortmund (Germany);<br>
FSCD 2020 in Paris (France) co-located with IJCAR 2020;<br>
FSCD 2021 in Buenos Aires (Argentina);<br>

as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Selected proposals are to be presented at the business meeting of FSCD<br>
2022 taking place at Haifa in August 2022.  The final decision about<br>
hosting and organising of FSCD 2024 will be taken by the SC after an<br>
advisory vote of the members of the community in attendance at the<br>
business meeting.</p>
