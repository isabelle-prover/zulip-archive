<p>Conference                      26th-28th September 2022</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction<br>
(MPC) aims to promote the development of mathematical principles and<br>
techniques that are demonstrably practical and effective in the<br>
process of constructing computer programs.</p>
<p>MPC 2022 will be held in Tbilisi, Georgia, on the 26th-28th September<br>
2022, and is co-located with the Computational Logic Autumn Summit&lt;<a href="http://viam.science.tsu.ge/clas2022/">http://viam.science.tsu.ge/clas2022/</a>&gt; (CLAS'22).</p>
<p>Previous conferences were held in Porto, Portugal (2019);<br>
Königswinter, Germany (2015); Madrid, Spain (2012);<br>
Québec City, Canada (2010); Marseille, France (2008);<br>
Kuressaare, Estonia (2006); Stirling, UK (2004); Dagstuhl, Germany (2002);<br>
Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000); Marstrand, Sweden (1998); Kloster Irsee,<br>
Germany (1995); Oxford, UK (1992); Twente, The Netherlands (1989).</p>
<p>SCOPE:</p>
<p>MPC seeks original papers on mathematical methods and tools put to use<br>
in program construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to<br>
support for program construction in programming languages and systems.<br>
Typical areas include type systems, program analysis and transformation,<br>
programming language semantics, security, and program logics. The notion<br>
of a 'program' is interpreted broadly, ranging from algorithms to hardware.</p>
<p>Theoretical contributions are welcome, provided that their relevance<br>
to program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome,<br>
provided that their mathematical basis is evident. We also encourage<br>
the submission of 'programming pearls' that present elegant and<br>
instructive examples of the mathematics of program construction.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION:</p>
<p>Submission is in two stages. Abstracts (plain text, maximum 250 words)<br>
must be submitted by 10th April 2022. Full papers (pdf, formatted using<br>
the llncs.sty style file for LaTex) must be submitted by 17th April 2022.<br>
There is no prescribed page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.<br>
Both abstracts and papers will be submitted using EasyChair.</p>
<p>Papers must present previously unpublished work, and not be submitted<br>
concurrently to any other publication venue. Submissions will be<br>
evaluated by the program committee according to their relevance,<br>
correctness, significance, originality, and clarity. Each submission<br>
should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms,<br>
clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is<br>
significant, and comparing it with previous work. Accepted papers must<br>
be presented in person at the conference by one of the authors.</p>
<p>The proceedings of MPC 2022 will be published in the Lecture Notes<br>
in Computer Science (LNCS) series, as with all previous instances<br>
of the conference.  Authors of accepted papers will be expected to<br>
transfer copyright to Springer for this purpose.</p>
<p>After the conference, authors of the best papers from MPC 2022<br>
will be invited to submit revised versions to a special<br>
issue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP).</p>
<p>For any queries about submission please contact the program chair,<br>

<p>CONFERENCE VENUE:</p>
<p>The conference will be held at the Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State<br>
University (TSU), which is the oldest and largest educational and<br>
research institution not only in Georgia, but also in the South Caucasus.<br>
The venue is located in the city center, with many hotels, pubs,<br>
restaurants, parks, other attractions (zoo, theaters, cinemas, opera,<br>
etc.) within walking distance.</p>
<p>Tbilisi International Airport is 15 km away from the city and offers<br>
direct connections to more than 30 destinations in Europe, Asia, and the<br>
Middle East. From the airport, the city can be reached by bus or taxi.<br>
Another option is to  fly to Kutaisi in the west of Georgia, where low<br>
budget air companies  (such as WizzAir) are operating. A shuttle bus from<br>
the Kutaisi airport to Tbilisi takes about 3 hours.</p>
<p>Georgia allows visa-free entry for nearly 100 countries around the world.<br>
