<p>SCOPE</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2020, Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence (AMAI)<br>
celebrated its 30th anniversary. Over the years, the journal has<br>
promoted better understanding of the application of quantitative,<br>
combinatorial, logical, algebraic and algorithmic methods to artificial<br>
intelligence areas as diverse as decision support, automated deduction,<br>
reasoning, knowledge-based systems, machine learning, computer vision,<br>
robotics and planning. AMAI special issues are intended to be<br>
collections of original research papers reflecting the intersection of<br>
mathematics and a focused discipline demonstrating how each has<br>
contributed greatly to the other. A further goal of the journal is to<br>
close the gaps between the fields even further. Papers should report on<br>
current research in the appropriate areas, as well as more retrospective<br>
papers in which progress has been ongoing over a period of time.</p>
<p>The purpose of this special issue of AMAI is to promote research on<br>
theoretical and practical aspects of symbolic computation in software<br>
science, combined with recent artificial intelligence techniques.<br>
Symbolic Computation is the science of computing with symbolic objects<br>
(terms, formulae, programs, representations of algebraic objects etc.).<br>
Powerful algorithms have been developed during the past decades for the<br>
major subareas of symbolic computation: computer algebra and<br>
computational logic. These algorithms and methods are successfully<br>
applied in various fields, including software science, which covers a<br>
broad range of topics about software construction and analysis.<br>
Meanwhile, artificial intelligence methods and machine learning<br>
algorithms are widely used nowadays in various domains and, in<br>
particular, combined with symbolic computation. Several approaches mix<br>
artificial intelligence and symbolic methods and tools deployed over<br>
large corpora to create what is known as cognitive systems. Cognitive<br>
computing focuses on building systems which interact with humans<br>
naturally by reasoning, aiming at learning at scale.</p>
<p>The special issue is related to the topics of the The 9th International<br>
Symposium on Symbolic Computation in Software Science - SCSS 2021.<br>
Participants of the symposium, as well as other authors are invited to<br>
submit contributions.</p>
