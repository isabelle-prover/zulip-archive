<p>==================================================</p>
<p>Call for Papers<br>
FM 2023: 25th International Symposium on Formal Methods</p>
<p>Lübeck, Germany, March 6-10, 2023<br>
<a href="https://fm2023.isp.uni-luebeck.de/">https://fm2023.isp.uni-luebeck.de/</a></p>
<p>==================================================</p>
<p>FM 2023 is the 25th international symposium in a series organised by<br>
Formal Methods Europe (FME), an independent association whose aim is to<br>
stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for software<br>
development. The FM symposia have been successful in bringing together<br>
researchers and industrial users around a programme of original papers<br>
on research and industrial experience, workshops, tutorials, reports on<br>
tools, projects, and ongoing doctoral research. FM 2023 will be both an<br>
occasion to celebrate and a platform for enthusiastic researchers and<br>
practitioners from a diversity of backgrounds to exchange their ideas<br>
and share their experiences.</p>
<p>=Important Dates=</p>
<p>Abstract submission:    September 4, 2022, 23:59 AoE (firm)<br>
Full paper submission:  September 11, 2022, 23:59 AoE (firm)<br>
Notification:       November 15, 2022<br>
Camera ready:       December 11, 2022<br>
Conference:         March 6-10, 2023</p>
<p>=Topics of Interest=</p>
<p>FM 2023 will highlight the development and application of formal methods<br>
in a wide range of domains including trustworthy AI, software,<br>
computer-based systems, systems-of-systems, cyber-physical systems,<br>
security, human-computer interaction, manufacturing, sustainability,<br>
energy, transport, smart cities, healthcare and biology. We particularly<br>
welcome papers on techniques, tools and experiences in interdisciplinary<br>
settings. We also welcome papers on experiences of applying formal methods <br>
in industrial settings, and on the design and validation of formal method <br>
tools.</p>
<p>The topics of interest for FM 2023 include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary formal methods: Techniques, tools and experiences<br>
demonstrating the use of formal methods in interdisciplinary settings.<br>
Formal methods in practice: Industrial applications of formal methods,<br>
experience with formal methods in industry, tool usage reports,<br>
experiments with challenge problems. The authors are encouraged to<br>
explain how formal methods overcame problems, led to improved designs,<br>
or provided new insights.</p>
<p>Tools for formal methods: Advances in automated verification, model<br>
checking, and testing with formal methods, tools integration,<br>
environments for formal methods, and experimental validation of tools.<br>
The authors are encouraged to demonstrate empirically that the new tool<br>
or environment advances the state of the art.</p>
<p>Formal methods in software and systems engineering: Development<br>
processes with formal methods, usage guidelines for formal methods, and<br>
method integration. The authors are encouraged to evaluate process<br>
innovations with respect to qualitative or quantitative improvements.<br>
Empirical studies and evaluations are also solicited.</p>
<p>Theoretical foundations of formal methods: All aspects of theory related<br>
to specification, verification, refinement, and static and dynamic<br>
analysis. The authors are encouraged to explain how their results<br>
contribute to the solution of practical problems with formal methods or<br>
tools.</p>
<p>We explicitly welcome submissions to the special FM 2023 session on <br>
"Formal methods meets AI", which is focused on formal and rigorous <br>
modelling and analysis techniques to ensuring safety, robustness etc. (trustworthiness) of AI-based systems.</p>
<p>=Submission Guidelines=</p>
<p>Papers should be original work, not published or submitted elsewhere, in<br>
Springer LNCS format, written in English, submitted through EasyChair:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2023</a></p>
<p>Each paper will be evaluated by at least three members of the Programme<br>
Committee. Authors of papers reporting experimental work are strongly<br>
encouraged to make their experimental results available for use by the<br>
reviewers. Similarly, case study papers should describe significant case<br>
studies, and the complete development should be made available at the<br>
time of review. The usual criteria for novelty, reproducibility,<br>
correctness and the ability for others to build upon the described work<br>
apply. Tool papers and tool demonstration papers should explain<br>
enhancements made compared to previously published work. A tool<br>
demonstration paper need not present the theory behind the tool, but can<br>
focus on the tool’s features, how it is used, its evaluation, and<br>
examples and screenshots illustrating the tool’s use. Authors of tool<br>
and tool demonstration papers should make their tool available for use<br>
by the reviewers.</p>
<p>We solicit various categories of papers:</p>
<p>Regular Papers (max 15 pages)<br>
Long tool papers (max 15 pages)<br>
Case study papers (max 15 pages)<br>
Short papers (max 6 pages), including tool demonstration papers.</p>
<p>Short papers present novel ideas (e.g., without an extensive experimental <br>
evaluation) or results that can well be presented in 6 pages. Short papers <br>
will be given short presentation slots at the conference.</p>
<p>All page limits do not include references and appendices.</p>
<p>For all papers, an appendix can provide additional material such as<br>
details on proofs or experiments. The appendix is not part of the page<br>
count and not guaranteed to be read or taken into account by the<br>
reviewers. Thus, it should not contain information necessary for the<br>
understanding and the evaluation of the presented work. Papers will be<br>
accepted or rejected in the category in which they were submitted and<br>
will not be moved between categories.</p>
<p>At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the<br>
paper at the conference as a registered participant.</p>
<p>=Best Paper Award=</p>
<p>At the conference, the PC Chairs will present an award to the authors of<br>
the submission selected as the FM 2023 Best Paper.</p>
<p>=Publication=</p>
<p>Accepted papers will be published in the Symposium Proceedings to appear<br>
in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Extended versions of selected <br>
papers will be invited for publication in a special issue of a journal.</p>
