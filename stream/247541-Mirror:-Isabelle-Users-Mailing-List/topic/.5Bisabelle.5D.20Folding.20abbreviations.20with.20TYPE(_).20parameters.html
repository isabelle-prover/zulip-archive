<p>From: Mikhail Mandrykin &lt;<a href="mailto:mandrykin@ispras.ru">mandrykin@ispras.ru</a>&gt;<br>
Hello!</p>
<p>I have a question about the current situation regarding abbreviations <br>
with dummy parameters of type "'a itself" e.g.<br>
⬚‹abbreviation "to_bounds TYPE('a::len) x ≡ uint (word_of_int x :: 'a <br>
word)"›<br>
Here "TYPE('a)" is used to pass the length of the machine word <br>
represented by the corresponding numeral type. It looks like a more or <br>
less proper way to define and use such abbreviations, in particular it's <br>
what Isabelle automatically does for abbreviations with hidden <br>
polymorphism: for<br>
⬚‹<br>
abbreviation "to_bounds' x ≡ uint (word_of_int x)"<br>
term to_bounds'<br>
›<br>
Isabelle gives ▩‹"to_bounds'" :: "'a itself ⇒ int ⇒ int"›.<br>
However, when I try to use such an abbreviation, it's not folded back <br>
when pretty-printing:<br>
⬚‹term "to_bounds TYPE(8) 534"›<br>
simply prints ▩‹"uint (word_of_int 534)" :: "int"› instead of <br>
▩‹"to_bounds TYPE(8) 534" :: "int"›. The question is whether there's <br>
some pragmatic reason for not fully supporting such abbreviations?</p>
<p>From technical point if view I looked at the implementation of constant <br>
abbreviation folding in Pure and the code looks somewhat dubious about <br>
that. On the one hand, Consts.abbreviate calls <br>
Term.close_schematic_term, which adds dummy "TYPE(_)" parameters to <br>
expose the hidden polymorphism in the RHS of the abbreviation. On the <br>
other hand, a local function strip_abss, which is used by <br>
Consts.abbreviate only strips parameters that occur in the RHS as term <br>
variables and does not take into account type variables. But those <br>
variables of type "'a itself" usually don't occur directly in the RHS <br>
and therefore the reverse abbreviation mechanism tries to fold an <br>
abstraction of the form "λ (_ :: 'a itself). t" instead of the term "t" <br>
and this is not how the unfolded abbreviation is actually represented. I <br>
though it might be better to explicitly support those parameters of type <br>
"'a itself" as instances of the singleton type Pure.type and try to fold <br>
"RHS ('a)" → "LHS v_1 ... v_n (Pure.type :: 'a) v_{n+1} ... v_m" (i.e. <br>
instantiate the LHS and RHS with the singleton Pure.type instead of the <br>
variable, if it does not occur in RHS as a variable), which is supported <br>
by Pattern.match_rew used in Proof_Context.contract_abbrevs. I <br>
implemented a patch based on this idea (attached as <br>
contract_TYPE_abbrevs.patch). It works for the example given above, some <br>
more examples that we have in our formalizations and also passes <br>
"regular" tests of building with "isabelle build -a" on my machine. A <br>
notable quirk of this approach is that it would also fold abbreviations <br>
even if the type does not occur in the RHS by introducing fresh type <br>
variables e.g. folding "f x" to "u TYPE(?'a) TYPE(?'b)" when given "u <br>
TYPE('a) TYPE('b) x ≡ f x". This can be prevented by checking occurrence <br>
of the type variable in the RHS, but I'm not sure how to treat such <br>
cases since they are quite strange anyway. So doesn't this approach have <br>
some undesirable pitfalls or the support was simply missing due to lack <br>
of use cases? The feature seems useful for handling types with phantom <br>
parameters that represent some additional information such as word or <br>
pointer type size.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Mikhail<br>
