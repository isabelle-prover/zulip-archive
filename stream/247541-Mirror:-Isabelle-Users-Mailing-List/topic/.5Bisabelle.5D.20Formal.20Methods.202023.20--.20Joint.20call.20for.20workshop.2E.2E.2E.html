<p>==================================================</p>
<p>FM 2023: 25th International Symposium on Formal Methods</p>
<p>Lübeck, Germany, March 6-10, 2023<br>
<a href="https://fm2023.isp.uni-luebeck.de/">https://fm2023.isp.uni-luebeck.de/</a></p>
<p>===  CALL FOR WORKSHOP &amp; TUTORIAL PROPOSALS  ===</p>
<p>==================================================</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>
================<br>
Submission of workshop proposals: June 10, 2022<br>
Notification of success of proposals (workshop): June 24, 2022<br>
Submission of tutorial proposals: July 1, 2022<br>
Notification of success of proposals (tutorial): July 15, 2022</p>
<p>PROPOSALS<br>
===========</p>
<p>We are now inviting proposals for workshops, tutorials (and other<br>
similar events) that will complement the main FM 2023 symposium. We<br>
encourage a diversity of topics relating to different ways of<br>
developing and using formal methods. Due to the growing interest in AI<br>
and machine learning-based software development, we particularly<br>
invite topics at the intersection of machine learning and formal<br>
methods.</p>
<p>The general purpose of workshops and tutorials is to provide an<br>
informal setting for participants to discuss technical issues,<br>
exchange research ideas and educational approaches, and to discuss<br>
and/or demonstrate applications. These may be driven by fundamental<br>
academic interests, or by needs from specific application domains.</p>
<p>A workshop is an event that involves an open call for contributions. A<br>
tutorial is an event based entirely on invited talks by the organizers<br>
or by invited speakers. Events that mix open and invited presentations<br>
will also be considered.</p>
<p>Workshops and tutorials will take place on March 6th &amp; 10th, 2023,<br>
flanking the main symposium. Each event (workshop or tutorial) should<br>
typically run for a half day or one day, but two-day events will also<br>
be considered. The FM 2023 organizing committee aims to contribute to<br>
at least partial support for one invited speaker per event.</p>
<p>==Submission Information==</p>
<p>Researchers and practitioners wishing to organize a workshop or<br>
tutorial are invited to submit proposals by e-mail to the Workshops &amp;<br>
Tutorials Chairs:</p>

<li>Martin Sachenbacher (<a href="mailto:sachenbacher@isp.uni-luebeck.de">sachenbacher@isp.uni-luebeck.de</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>=Workshop chairs=</p>
<ul>

<li>Volker Stolz (<a href="mailto:vsto@hvl.no">vsto@hvl.no</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>An event proposal should not exceed three pages and should include the<br>
following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Title and brief technical description of the event, specifying its<br>
goals and formal methods focus, and whether the event is a workshop,<br>
tutorial, or any other kind of event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The names and contact information (web page, email address) of the<br>
organizers. The organizers of a workshop will also be its Programme<br>
Committee (PC) chairs; in this case, the proposal may also list<br>
prospective international PC members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pointers to information about past editions of the event, if<br>
applicable. Workshop proposals should specify whether it has taken<br>
place before; how often it has been co-located with FM or with other<br>
conferences, and the number of participants in the most recent<br>
installments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A discussion of the proposed format and agenda (for example: paper<br>
presentations, tutorials, demo sessions, etc). The organizers are<br>
encouraged to describe their vision for an online event, should the<br>
need occur in light of the current global pandemic crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed duration: half or one day. Exceptionally, two-day<br>
events may be considered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential invited speaker(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workshop proposals should describe procedures for selecting papers<br>
and participants, including a tentative timeline for submission and<br>
notification of acceptance, and plans for the publication of<br>
proceedings, if any.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The organizers of the proposed events are expected to create and<br>
maintain a website for the event; handle paper selection, reviewing<br>
and acceptance; draw up a program of talks; advertise their event<br>
though specialist mailing lists; prepare the informal pre-proceedings<br>
(if applicable) in a timely fashion; and arrange any<br>
post-proceedings. FM 2023 will provide the facilities and handle the<br>
registrations for the events.</p>
