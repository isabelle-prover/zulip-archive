<p>CONFERENCE SCOPE AND PUBLICATION</p>
<hr>
<p>FMCAD 2022 is the twenty-second in a series of conferences on the theory<br>
and applications of formal methods in hardware and system<br>
verification. FMCAD provides a leading forum to researchers in academia<br>
and industry for presenting and discussing groundbreaking methods,<br>
technologies, theoretical results, and tools for reasoning formally<br>
about computing systems. FMCAD covers formal aspects of computer-aided<br>
system design including verification, specification, synthesis, and<br>
testing.</p>
<p>FMCAD employs a rigorous peer-review process. Accepted papers are<br>
published by TU Wien Academic Press under a Creative Commons license<br>
(the authors retain the copyright) and distributed through the IEEE<br>
XPlore digital library. There are no publication fees. At least one of<br>
the authors is required to register for the conference and present the<br>
accepted paper.</p>
<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST</p>
<hr>
<p>FMCAD welcomes submission of papers reporting original research on<br>
advances in all aspects of formal methods and their applications to<br>
computer-aided design. Topics of interest include (but are not limited<br>
to):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Model checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and<br>
reduction, compositional methods, decision procedures at the bit- and<br>
word-level, probabilistic methods, combinations of deductive methods<br>
and decision procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synthesis and compilation for computer system descriptions, modeling,<br>
specification, and implementation languages, formal semantics of<br>
languages and their subsets, model-based design, design derivation and<br>
transformation, correct-by-construction methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application of formal and semi-formal methods to functional and<br>
non-functional specification and validation of hardware and software,<br>
including timing and power modeling, verification of computing systems<br>
on all levels of abstraction, system-level design and verification for<br>
embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, automotive systems and other<br>
safety-critical systems, hardware-software co-design and verification,<br>
and transaction-level verification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience with the application of formal and semi-formal methods to<br>
industrial-scale designs; tools that represent formal verification<br>
enablement, new features, or a substantial improvement in the<br>
automation of formal methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application of formal methods to verifying safety, connectivity and<br>
security properties of networks, distributed systems, smart contracts,<br>
block chains, and IoT devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>
<hr>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmcad2022">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmcad2022</a></p>
<p>Two categories of papers are invited: Regular papers, and Tool &amp; Case<br>
Study papers. Regular papers are expected to offer novel foundational<br>
ideas, theoretical results, or algorithmic improvements to existing<br>
methods, along with experimental impact validation where<br>
applicable. Tool &amp; Case Study papers are expected to report on the<br>
design, implementation or use of verification (or related) technology in<br>
a practically relevant context (which need not be industrial), and its<br>
impact on design processes.</p>
<p>Both Regular and Tool &amp; Case study papers must use the IEEE Transactions<br>
format on letter-size paper with a 10-point font size. Papers in both<br>
categories can be either 8 pages (long) or 4 pages (short) in length not<br>
including references. Short papers that describe emerging results,<br>
practical experiences, or original ideas that can be described<br>
succinctly are encouraged. Authors will be required to select an<br>
appropriate paper category at abstract submission time. Submissions may<br>
contain an optional appendix, which will not appear in the final version<br>
of the paper. The reviewers should be able to assess the quality and the<br>
relevance of the results in the paper without reading the appendix.</p>
<p>Submissions in both categories must contain original research that has<br>
not been previously published, nor is concurrently submitted for<br>
publication. Any partial overlap with published or concurrently<br>
submitted papers must be clearly indicated. If experimental results are<br>
reported, authors are strongly encouraged to provide the reviewers<br>
access to their data at submission time, so that results can be<br>
independently verified. The review process is single blind.</p>
<p>Authors of accepted contributions will be required to sign the FMCAD<br>
copyright transfer form found here:<br>
<a href="https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf">https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>STUDENT FORUM</p>
<hr>
<p>Continuing the tradition of the previous years, FMCAD 2022 is hosting a<br>
Student Forum that provides a platform for graduate students at any<br>
career stage to introduce their research to the wider Formal Methods<br>
community, and solicit feedback.</p>
<p>Submissions for the event must be short reports describing research<br>
ideas or ongoing work that the student is currently pursuing, and must<br>
be within the scope of FMCAD. Work, part of which has been previously<br>
published, will be considered; the novel aspect to be addressed in<br>
future work must be clearly described in such cases. All submissions<br>
will be reviewed by a select group of FMCAD program committee members.</p>
