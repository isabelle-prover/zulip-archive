I am digesting specification of quicksort <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/library/HOL/HOL-Imperative_HOL/Imperative_Quicksort.html">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/library/HOL/HOL-Imperative_HOL/Imperative_Quicksort.html</a> and I have question:</p>
<p>is it OK (acceptable by AFP standards) to specify algorithm as definition (e.g. swap) or is it strongly required that the final algorithm is specified as function (e.g. quicksort)?</p>
<p>According to tutorial, definition is not for recursive functions and it does not create proof obligation for termination. As I can see from the example, then Isabelle can still prove lemmas and theorms about definitions (maybe with additional assumptions).</p>
<p>So - as I understand: if the formalized algorithm is expected to be partially correct only (without the proof of termination) then it is OK that Isabelle theory specifies this algorithm (and its relevant sub-algorithms) as definition and proves theorems about this definition that resembles the partial correctness proofs.</p>
<p>So - the specification of some algorithm as function is required only in the case when total correctnes should be proved.</p>
<p>And just for clarification: is it really true, that the fun/function keyword requires that the specification of the function with fun/function is recursive, i.e., that the specified function should appear in the right hand side for at least one pattern-matching-clause? As can be understood from the tutorials then fun/function is for recursive definitions specifically, but nonetheless, Isabelle allows to write:</p>
<p>function two_integer_max_case :: "nat ⇒ nat ⇒ nat" where<br>
"two_integer_max_case a b = (case a &gt; b of True ⇒ a | False ⇒ b)"<br>
by pat_completeness auto<br>
termination by auto</p>
<p>And Isabelle also provides suggestions for the proof. But maybe it is just misleading - one should not expect that such function can be defined in such way...</p>

<p>Alex,</p>
<p>you seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what's happening<br>
here. On the level of the logic, 'fun' and 'function' are strictly<br>
generalizations of 'definition'. When Isabelle doesn't require a<br>
termination proof, that's because it's trivial, not because the problem<br>
of termination is ignored.</p>
<p>In fact, termination isn't only required for total correctness, but also<br>
for logical consistency. Consider:</p>
<p>function foo where<br>
  "foo x = (¬ foo x)"<br>
  by pat_completeness auto<br>
termination sorry</p>
<p>theorem False<br>
proof -<br>
  have *: "a = (¬ a) ⟹ False" for a<br>
    by simp<br>
  show False by (fact *[OF foo.simps])<br>
qed</p>
<p>When both 'definition' and 'fun' accept a formula, the difference comes<br>
down to how proof automation will treat your function (by default) —<br>
if you 'fun foo', the defining formula will become a fact named<br>
foo.simps. As the name suggests, it will be added to the simpset and the<br>
simplifier will unfold it by default. By contrast, for a<br>
'definition foo', the fact is called foo_def and isn't added to the<br>
simpset.</p>
<p>I presume that the reason the tutorial says that 'fun' should only be<br>
used for recursive definitions, is that if you use it for non-recursive<br>
ones, your intermediate goals will get needlessly large, and thus not<br>
very readable.</p>
<p>After all, if a function is defined by pattern matching and a subformula<br>
of the goal matches that pattern, then unfolding the application is<br>
probably a good idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>function two_integer_max_case :: "nat ⇒ nat ⇒ nat" where<br>
"two_integer_max_case a b = (case a &gt; b of True ⇒ a | False ⇒ b)"<br>
by pat_completeness auto<br>
termination by auto</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In light of the above, function definitions with proofs this trivial<br>
should really use the 'fun' keyword instead. Indeed, use 'function' only<br>
when 'fun' is having trouble with the termination proof.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And just for clarification: is it really true, that the fun/function keyword requires that the specification of the function with fun/function is recursive, i.e., that the specified function should appear in the right hand side for at least one pattern-matching-clause?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you've demonstrated, this is not the case. In fact, there are<br>
situations where a function is non-recursive, and yet 'fun' is a better<br>
tool for the job than 'definition'. Consider</p>
<p>fun pred :: "nat =&gt; nat" where<br>
  "pred 0 = 0" |<br>
  "pred (S n) = n"</p>
<p>Defining this function with 'definition' would require an explicit<br>
'case' expression.</p>
<p>Hope that helps,<br>
