<p>AIMS AND SCOPE</p>
<p>The use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for <br>
specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer <br>
science as well as in many fields of computational research and <br>
engineering. Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer <br>
structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other <br>
domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical <br>
environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. Often, these <br>
graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and <br>
evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by <br>
rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation <br>
form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means <br>
for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of <br>
certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new <br>
insights.</p>
<p>The International Conference on Graph Transformation aims at fostering <br>
exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds <br>
working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to <br>
their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to <br>
classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a <br>
well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform <br>
to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas.</p>
<p>The 15th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2022) <br>
will be held in Nantes, France, as part of STAF 2022 (Software <br>
Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place <br>
under the auspices of EATCS and IFIP WG 1.3. Proceedings will be <br>
published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) <br>
series.</p>

<p>SPECIAL INTEREST TOPIC OF ICGT 2022: EXECUTABLE APPLIED CATEGORY THEORY</p>
<p>A special focus of this conference will consist of new approaches to <br>
formalizing the knowledge in the research field of graph transformation <br>
theory via proof assistants such as Coq. Referring to the homepage of <br>
the GReTA-ExACT workgroup for further information [1], a long-term goal <br>
of this kind of approach will consist in establishing a Coq-enriched <br>
wiki for our research field akin to the nLab. This platform will serve <br>
as a sustainable mechanism for curating applied and mathematical <br>
knowledge in graph transformation research, and eventually as a research <br>
tool in its own right, notably through the provision of interactive <br>
database-supported proof construction. Another avenue of research will <br>
concern executable applied category theory (ExACT), i.e., code <br>
extraction from formalized categorical structures, with the perspective <br>
of curating a database of correct-by-construction reference prototype <br>
algorithms for various forms of graph transformation semantics and <br>
graph-like data structures. To introduce the initiative and facilitate <br>
the broad involvement of the ICGT community and collect feedback from <br>
participants regarding the scope and format of such a wiki project, a <br>
peer-reviewed brainstorming session is planned as one of the events at <br>
the conference.</p>
<p>KEYNOTE</p>
<p>In line with this special focus, we are delighted to announce a keynote <br>
to be held by Christian Doczkal (Max-Planck Institute for Security and <br>
Privacy, Bochum, Germany). Christian Doczkal will present his work on a <br>
library of formalized graph theory results in Coq and share some of the <br>
lessons learned along the way.</p>

<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers can be submitted via EasyChair [2] using Springer’s LNCS format <br>
(cf. LNCS Overleaf template [3]). For regular and tool demonstration <br>
papers, simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or <br>
submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is not <br>
allowed. The page limits are strict and include references. At least one <br>
author for each accepted paper must register before the early <br>
registration deadline and present the paper during the conference [4].</p>
<p>Papers are solicited in three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular papers (limited to 16 pages in Springer LNCS format) describe <br>
innovative contributions and are evaluated with respect to their <br>
originality, significance, and technical soundness. We also solicit case <br>
studies describing applications of graph transformation in any <br>
application domain. Additional material intended for reviewers but not <br>
for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly marked <br>
appendix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tool presentation papers (limited to 8 pages in Springer LNCS format) <br>
demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A <br>
tool presentation paper may have an appendix with a detailed demo <br>
description (up to 4 pages), which will be reviewed but not included in <br>
the proceedings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New ideas papers (limited to 2 pages in Springer LNCS format) report <br>
on relevant contributions to the theory or applications of graph <br>
transformation, which may have been published (or accepted for <br>
publication) in a peer-reviewed conference other than ICGT, as a book <br>
chapter or journal article since 2018. Papers in this category will be <br>
selected for presentation at the conference according to their relevance <br>
to the graph transformation community, and they will be considered for <br>
the special issues. Submissions will consist of a 2-page abstract. In <br>
case of extended abstracts of published papers, the submission must <br>
refer to the published paper and include the original paper in PDF.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SPECIAL ISSUE</p>
<p>Authors of the best papers at the conference will be invited to prepare <br>
and submit extended journal versions to be considered for publication in <br>
a special issue after an independent round of peer review. The special <br>
issue will be published in the Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods <br>
in Programming (Elsevier).</p>
