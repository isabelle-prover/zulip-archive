<p>ITP2021: Interactive Theorem Proving, 12th International Conference <br>
2021, June 29-July 1, Rome, Italy <br>
<a href="http://easyconferences.eu/itp2021/">http://easyconferences.eu/itp2021/</a> [1]  </p>

<p>CALL FOR WORKSHOPS </p>
<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all topics related to <br>
interactive theorem proving, ranging from theoretical foundations to <br>
implementation aspects and applications in system verification, <br>
security, and formalization of mathematics. The 12th ITP conference, <br>
ITP 2021, will be held in Rome between 29 June and 1 July. <br>
It will be co-located with LICS and ICTCS conferences. </p>
<p>ITP will carefully monitor the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, <br>
and take guidance from the health authorities to determine whether <br>
ITP21 will be held physically, virtually, or in a hybrid manner. </p>
<p>Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for <br>
co-located workshops on topics relating to interactive theorem <br>
proving. Workshops can target the ITP community in general, focus on a <br>
particular ITP system, or highlight more specific issues or recent <br>
developments. Proposals for in-depth tutorials or tool introductions <br>
are also welcome. </p>
<p>Co-located events will take place on 28 June and 2 July and <br>
will be held on the same premises as the main conference. In case of  <br>
needs, we are ready to discuss and try to accommodate requests for  <br>
two-day workshops. Conference facilities are offered free of charge to  <br>
one of the organizers and one of the invited speakers. Workshop-only  <br>
attendees will enjoy a significantly reduced registration fee. </p>
<p>Detailed organizational matters such as paper submission and review <br>
process, or publication of proceedings, are up to the organizers of <br>
individual workshops. All accepted workshops will be expected to have <br>
their program ready by 4 June, 2021. </p>
<p>Proposals for workshops should contain at least the following pieces <br>
of information: </p>
<p>* name and contact details of the main organizer(s)<br>
    * (if applicable:) names of additional organizers</p>
<p>* title and organizational style of the workshop (tutorial, public<br>
workshop, project workshop, etc.)   * preferred length of the workshop<br>
(half day or full day)<br>
    * estimated number of attendees<br>
    * short (up to one page) description of the topic</p>
<p>* (if applicable:) pointers to previous editions of the workshop, or<br>
to similar events   * (if applicable:) special needs for an online event</p>
<p>Proposals should be submitted by email to  <br>
<a href="mailto:itp2021-workshops@easyconferences.eu">itp2021-workshops@easyconferences.eu</a>, <br>
no later than 11 January, 2021. <br>
Selected workshops will be notified by 15 January, 2021. </p>
