<p>From: Mikhail Mandrykin &lt;<a href="mailto:mandrykin@ispras.ru">mandrykin@ispras.ru</a>&gt;<br>
Hello!</p>
<p>Recently, I experimented with implementation of Isabelle proof methods, <br>
commands and proof elements to learn Isabelle internals more deeply as <br>
we plan to implement Isabelle commands and methods for our program <br>
verification framework. At some point, I encountered quite puzzling <br>
behavior of commands <code>done</code>, <code>by</code> and <code>qed</code> with respect to implicit <br>
exporting of the resulting goal state (actually, the protected initial <br>
statement as a theorem) into the outer context. I attached an example <br>
exposing the various behaviors. The question is whether these various <br>
differences in behavior are expected, especially the situation when the <br>
proof is successfully finished inside jEdit, but then fails during build <br>
by <code>isabelle build</code> command. I understand that normally Isabelle methods <br>
do not introduce local assumptions or fixed variables, so this seems not <br>
really critical (no intent to actually implement such methods for the <br>
users), but it would help with the general understanding to know whether <br>
this is totally unspecified to introduce those assumptions or is merely <br>
a pragmatic constraint</p>

This is not possible in Pure, but in HOL the Hilbert epsilon operator <br>
can be used to extract the corresponding witness. I actually implemented <br>

directly refines the statement using the obtained epsilon-expressions. <br>
However, I myself did not fully understand the limitations of the proof <br>
methods since they are actually context-tactics and can return a <br>
modified context as a result, but I had not found any real examples of <br>
methods that would alter the context in any way other than by <br>
introduction of cases. So indeed, the logical context is never modified, <br>
only the extra-logical part is changed. The sample method <br>
<code>hilbert_guess</code> (in Proof_Context.thy) thus is not a proper method as it <br>
breaks this convention by introducing obtained facts into the logical <br>
context. So when I tried to compile the resulting tutorial document I <br>

<a href="https://forge.ispras.ru/projects/isabelle-tutorial/repository/isabelle-tasks">https://forge.ispras.ru/projects/isabelle-tutorial/repository/isabelle-tasks</a> <br>
. Currently, we switched to different parts of our framework <br>
(implementing the shallow embedding and the translator), so the tutorial <br>
is currently not actively used, but may soon be needed as constructing <br>
the embedding also requires the use of custom automated proofs.</p>

<p>In Isabelle2020 it seems to be slight incompatibility in the definition <br>

the development version (would-be 2021) by removing an extra premise <br>

internally and only alter the context for extra-logical purposes e.g.<br>
remembering a counterexample model extracted from an SMT solver (Z3).<br>
The repository with the tutorial is available at<br>
<a href="https://forge.ispras.ru/projects/isabelle-tutorial/repository/isabelle-tasks">https://forge.ispras.ru/projects/isabelle-tutorial/repository/isabelle-tasks</a> <br>
. Currently, we switched to different parts of our framework<br>
(implementing the shallow embedding and the translator), so the<br>
tutorial is currently not actively used, but may soon be needed as<br>
constructing the embedding also requires the use of custom automated<br>
proofs.</p>

<p>I understand that&gt; normally Isabelle methods do not introduce local<br>
assumptions or fixed<br>
variables, so this seems not really critical (no intent to actually <br>
implement<br>
such methods for the users), but it would help with the general <br>
understanding<br>
to know whether this is totally unspecified to introduce those <br>

is merely a pragmatic constraint</p>

<p>Yes, proof methods cannot extend the logical context and expect to<br>
work properly.</p>
<p>There are certain principles how proof contexts are <br>
constructed/deconstructed<br>
by the Isar language, according to its structure. Some of this is <br>
explained in<br>
the "implementation" manual, but the general principle of survival <br>
is to do<br>
this in the "usual way", e.g. by looking at existing implementations <br>
in the<br>
sources.</p>
<p>Your theory "Bug" looks very non-standard in various respects. Can <br>
you say,<br>
what you are actually trying to do?</p>
