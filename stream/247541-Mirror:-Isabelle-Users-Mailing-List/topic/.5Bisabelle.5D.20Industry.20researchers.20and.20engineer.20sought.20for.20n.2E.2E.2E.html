<h1>A Gentle Invitation into Theorem Proving towards Formal Hardware</h1>
<p>Verification #</p>
<p>What is the nature of human reasoning and problem solving? How can<br>
machines exploit the known skills of problems solving to solve new<br>
problems automatically? Is it possible to work out general patterns of<br>
discovery and reasoning, such that machines can develop new methods and<br>
systems? We try to answer these problems and shrink the gap between<br>
machine learning and human wisdom.</p>
<p>Mathematical discovery and reasoning is considered the most creative<br>
activity of human wisdom. Mathematicians have been investigating the<br>
nature of human reasoning and problem solving since classical Greece.<br>
Even if the development of interactive theorem provers provides rigorous<br>
tools for people to formalise mathematics and to verify hardware and<br>
software designs, there is still a big gap between human reasoning and<br>
mechanical theorem proving: precious human intelligence is wasted on<br>
proving tedious and trivial lemmas, which are indispensable for machines<br>
to check the correctness and the integrity of a proof, but are quite<br>
obvious for well-educated mathematicians or computer scientists. Even<br>
worse, it is hard to recover the original intentions by reading these<br>
mechanical proofs.</p>
<p>During the first year of this project, we will focus on developing an<br>
automated theorem prover towards human reasoning. Except the automation<br>
of proof strategies and skills, the main planned innovation is: deriving<br>
theories automatically. We want to investigate and implement such a<br>
mechanism: to generate conjectures from cases, concepts, proofs, and<br>
known theorems, then produce automatically human readable and machine<br>
checkable proofs. We also plan to design and implement the mechanism to<br>
discover and exploit morphisms between algebraic structures, so as to<br>
simplify proofs by making use of abstract domains. It doesn't mean that<br>
we don't need human interference; on the contrary, we want to make use<br>
of human experience whenever possible --- machines will learn from<br>
humans when, for example, they are stuck, the computation diverges, the<br>
solution space is too big, and so on. We believe that human skills of<br>
problem solving will enable machines to think like us and to make<br>
plausible reasoning at the end.</p>
<p>We will soon open the following positions for this project. There will<br>
be a competitive salary and benefits package in line with top tier<br>
industrial R&amp;D positions in UK.</p>
<p>Work Location: Edinburgh UK</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Two Full-Time Research Associates on Theoretical Computer Science. RA<br>
is supposed to hold a PhD degree. RA is required to have strong computer<br>
science background and has to be familiar with all branches of computer<br>
science in general. Research experience of formal verification, theorem<br>
provers, machine learning, programming languages, or compilers is<br>
necessary. RA will be responsible for the design and implementation of<br>
the proposed automated theorem prover, and its applications in automated<br>
formal verification of hardware and software designs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Full-Time Senior Software Engineer. SE is supposed to hold a BSc or<br>
MSc degree. SE is required to be familiar with the imperative<br>
programming languages like Python, the functional programming languages<br>
like Haskell, and the web programming languages like JavaScript. The<br>
development experience of programming languages is preferred. SE is<br>
responsible for the implementation, testing, and release of the proposed<br>
automated theorem prover.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, we are recruiting interns on mathematics or computer science. We<br>
hope you can help create benchmarks or libraries, and improve the design<br>
and implementation of the tool. You are required to have a strong<br>
mathematical background. Basic programming skills of Haskell and Python<br>
are necessary. Knowledge of recursive functions, Lambda calculus, formal<br>
logics, type theory, or category theory is preferred.</p>
<p>You are very welcome to join us on this ambitious exploration journey.</p>
<p>Informal enquiries on details of the project and these positions can be<br>
made to:</p>
