I fear that there are no canonical references for any of these – at<br>
least not that I know of.</p>
<p>You can cite Isabelle as a whole, or you can try to specifically cite<br>
e.g. the generated HTML [1] or the proof document [2]. For HOL-Analysis,<br>
there is also a manual [3] (which only contains the most important bits).</p>
<p>There was an idea in the past to publish some kind of overview of<br>
HOL-Analysis but this will require a lot more cleaning up first.</p>
<p>The filter paper that you gave as a reference fo the standard library<br>
only covers a very small part of the standard library, of course, namely<br>
filters. I always give that reference whenever I talk about limits or<br>
topological concepts (which inevitably involve filters in Isabelle), but<br>
for anything else, it hardly makes sense to cite that.</p>
<p>The measure theory paper should be cited when talking about measure<br>
theory, probability theory, and Lebesgue integration.</p>
<p>Sorry for the following rambly bit:</p>
<p>It's generally a bit of a problem that working on the standard library<br>
is a somewhat thankless task. It's hard to get any publications out of<br>
it (which are the bread and butter in academia) because all you're doing<br>
is formalising routine stuff – often not even very difficult stuff, just<br>
a lot of it. And there's not anything interesting to be said about it in<br>
a paper. You can write tens of thousands of lines of library material<br>
without the people deciding whether or not to give you a grant or tenure<br>
or whatever taking notice of it. The best one can usually hope for is to<br>
mention it in a paper on some more interesting application.</p>
<p>The situation is of course even worse for library maintenance and – as<br>
Makarius reminds us occasionally – infrastructure tasks. There's no<br>
glory in keeping the machine running – but if it stops, people show up<br>
at your door and complain.</p>
<p>Well, I personally am doing all right I think; I've struck a good<br>
balance between library work and publishable things, but I still think<br>
it's a problem in general.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

Euclidean spaces". It appears that this list also implicitly includes some<br>
material on vector spaces. The type classes that they mention seem to<br>
correspond to a significant part of the standard library that I need to<br>
discuss in my own development. In any case, this is merely an explanation<br>

<p>Luckily for me, however, your comments are hardly applicable to my own<br>
situation. I need to cite the various libraries that are available in the<br>
main distribution of Isabelle in my work on Types-to-Sets. In essence, as<br>
part of this work, I demonstrate how one can synthesize something similar<br>
to (a small part of) HOL-Algebra from the type classes in the standard<br>
library in a semi-automated manner. Moreover, I use the elements of both<br>
libraries in certain explanations/examples. Thus, this work hardly falls<br>
into the category of library development/maintenance.</p>

Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>I thought the biggest contribution of formalizing math theorems was<br>
supposed to verify the correctness of their informal proofs, where<br>
mathematicians sometimes may overlook some subtle details which may<br>
eventually turn the whole proof into false statements.</p>
<p>Of course, mistakes in the proofs of classical results (which must be old<br>
and fundamental enough to be able to be covered) must be very rare. But if<br>
anything of this kind is discovered by a proof engineer, the work should be<br>
publicable (to mathematicians), isn't it?  Or let's take one step back, if<br>
the theorem statements are correct but the proof in textbooks are wrong,<br>
and the proof engineer gives a correct one, this should also be something<br>
notable, right?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chun Tian</p>

i’ve heard it said that Shankar found holes in Gödel’s proof of his incompleteness theorem. Shakar’s thesis involved a machine-check (via one of the boyer-moore theorem provers) of that proof.  Don’t worry, the theorem is still true.</p>

<p>I cannot remember any problem like that ever arising with textbook<br>
maths. These things are usually hundreds of years old and extremely well<br>
understood. Sure, there might be a problem with the proof in one<br>
particular textbook, but then there are a hundred other textbooks with<br>
different proofs.</p>
<p>Even if you do find a mistake in something like that, I don't think many<br>
people would find it very significant if there are other books that<br>
don't have that mistake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if anything of this kind is discovered by a proof engineer, the work<br>
should be publicable (to mathematicians), isn't it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, indeed such things have happened. I recall Sébastian Gouëzel<br>
finding a mistake in a published maths proof that was nontrivial to fix,<br>
and he then published a paper with the original author of that proof in<br>
order to fix it. However, this was hardly "standard library material".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or let's take one<br>
step back, if the theorem statements are correct but the proof in<br>
textbooks are wrong, and the proof engineer gives a correct one, this<br>
should also be something notable, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That depends on whom you ask. "Proof engineers" like us tend to be<br>
extremely pedantic about what constitutes a correct proof.<br>
Mathematicians are more flexible; usually, if the "proof" conveys the<br>
right idea to the reader, it is considered a correct proof. Even if<br>
there are some (fixable) arithmetic mistakes in it, or maybe a few cases<br>
were missed, or there are some gaps that you have to think about for a<br>
bit as a reader.</p>
<p>The majority of the "mistakes" that one finds with formalisation are of<br>
this nature because there are so many of them. I think I haven't done a<br>
formalisation of any big-ish result that hasn't turned up at least one<br>
such issue. "Genuine" mistakes are much rarer especially in "standard<br>
library material", but I expect they are more prevalent in cutting-edge<br>
mathematical research.</p>
<p>By the way, there is an overview thread on Mathoverflow about mistakes<br>
found using ITPs:</p>

Well I would hardly consider Gödel's incompleteness theorems<br>
standard-library material, nor is their formalization a routine task.</p>
<p>"Standard library material", to me, is things like undergraduate-level<br>
algebra, analysis, and number theory. Basic group and ring theory,<br>
L'Hospital's theorem, greatest common divisor, that sort of stuff.<br>
Nobody doubts that it can be done and many such things have been done<br>
before and there is nothing to be learnt from doing them.</p>
<p>30 years ago, formalising such results was perhaps a great achievement<br>
worthy of publication, but these days not so much. Especially if it was<br>
already done in another system – even though a Coq library doesn't help<br>
Isabelle users much, someone still /has/ to do it in Isabelle.</p>
<p>(Just to be clear: I'm not saying such routine things /should/ be<br>
publishable, at least not in the same venues as "novel" formalisations.<br>
I'm just saying it's a pity because such unglamorous things also need to<br>
be done and there is currently no mechanism to reward it.)</p>

You can try looking at the author lists of the files in question (at the<br>
very beginning of each file). These typically list the people who first<br>
worked on these topics, although perhaps not everyone who contributed<br>
material and maintained the libraries since. I at least only add my name<br>
to the list if I make same very significant additions to a file.</p>
<p>Much of our analysis was also (at least initially) ported from HOL<br>
Light, so the authors of HOL Light's analysis library (probably mostly<br>
John Harrison?) also deserve a lot of credit for Isabelle's library.</p>
<p>By the way, as I see it, the main reason why this filter paper was<br>
worthy of publication is that it (to my knowledge) introduced<br>
filter-based topology into the ITP world, which makes so many things<br>
much more convenient and is /not/ simply a routine formalization of some<br>
well-known maths. Filters are known in mathematics, but mathematicians<br>
do not use them in undergraduate textbooks on analysis. And there's the<br>
description of the type class hierarchy, which is also an ITP issue that<br>
goes a bit beyond routine formalisation of maths and has more of a<br>
"software engineering" flavour.</p>
<p>It is always good if one can include such aspects in formalisations.<br>
Clemens Ballarin also recently had a paper on formalising standard group<br>
theory that focused heavily on what a convenient idiomatic<br>
representation in "modern" Isabelle/HOL could look like.</p>

This brings up the interesting point of the gauge integral. It has its fans and John Harrison was clearly convinced. But I’ve since gotten the impression that for mainstream mathematicians, the Lebesgue integral is the only integral. (E.g. it’s the foundation of measure theory and everything built upon that.) So now we have two theories of integration and unfortunately many developments use both sorts of integrals. Transitioning to a 100% Lebesgue integral library will require a huge amount of absolutely thankless work.</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
It certainly has its advantages. The multivariate change of variables as<br>
ported from HOL Light has a very nice, general, and simple form for the<br>
Gauge integral:</p>
<p>theorem has_absolute_integral_change_of_variables:<br>
  fixes f :: "real^'m::{finite,wellorder} ⇒ real^'n" and g ::<br>
"real^'m::_ ⇒ real^'m::_"<br>
  assumes S: "S ∈ sets lebesgue"<br>
    and der_g: "⋀x. x ∈ S ⟹ (g has_derivative g' x) (at x within S)"<br>
    and inj: "inj_on g S"<br>
  shows "(λx. ¦det (matrix (g' x))¦ *⇩R f(g x)) absolutely_integrable_on S ∧<br>
           integral S (λx. ¦det (matrix (g' x))¦ *⇩R f(g x)) = b<br>
     ⟷ f absolutely_integrable_on (g <code> S) ∧ integral (g </code> S) f = b"</p>
<p>It demands measurability of the integration domain and injectivity and<br>
differentiability of the variable change. You don't even need g to be C1<br>
or g^-1 to be differentiable.</p>
<p>For the Lebesgue integral, the situation is a lot worse. There are<br>
various different forms of change of variables, and all of them (except<br>
the linear one) are univariate and have various additional side<br>
conditions like monotonicity. I've done several proofs where the only<br>
recourse seemed to be to convert Lebesgue to Gauge, apply COV there, and<br>
convert back.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure whether that is inherently so or simply because no<br>
one has sat down and proved a sufficiently general version of change of<br>
variables for the Lebesgue integral. But I think when I last discussed<br>
this with someone, they (perhaps Fabian Immler?) said that that you<br>
probably need at least some additional preconditions for Lebesgue…</p>
<p>By the way, to make matters worse, there are also things like the<br>
integral of sin(x)/x from -∞ to ∞, which are Gauge-integrable but not<br>
Lebesgue-integrable and which /do/ come up in mathematics.<br>
Mathematicians will then simply call these "improper integrals" and<br>
implicitly take the limit of the integral from -a to a for a → ∞. And<br>
then there's the Cauchy Principal Value, which (as Wenda pointed out to<br>
me) is not subsumed by the Gauge integral but apparently an entirely<br>
different generalisation of Lebesgue integrals…</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
John Harrison kindly pointed out something that I should have spotted<br>
myself: the version of change of variables that we have in Isabelle and<br>
HOL Light is technically about the Gauge integral, but it demands<br>
absolute integrability. Absolute Gauge-integrability is equivalent to<br>
Lebesgue-integrability, so at the end of the day, it really is a theorem<br>
about change of variables for Lebesgue integration. He also said that to<br>
the best of his knowledge, the proof does not use any Gauge-specific things.</p>
<p>His version is considerably sharper than that found in most textbooks.<br>
The only one that is essentially equivalent to his knowledge is the one<br>
from Fremlin's "Measure Theory" volume 2, theorem 263D, p312.</p>
<p>By the way, another issue with COV that we should resolve eventually is<br>
that our current version works on "real ^ 'n" like in HOL Light, whereas<br>
the more idiomatic thing to do would be "'a :: euclidean_space". This<br>
can either be done by generalising the existing proof or trying to lift<br>
the result using types-to-sets.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
