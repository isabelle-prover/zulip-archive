I am running Isabelle2021-RC1 under Ubuntu 20.04.  Is there any way to limit the memory use<br>
of the "veriT" prover?  It seems not to be a very good citizen in this respect: when it is<br>
run from the "try" command it seems willing to grow its address space even to significantly<br>
exceed the total amount of system RAM.  For example, I just observed a virtual address space<br>
of 37.8GB on a system with 32GB total RAM and of course Java, poly, and various other things<br>
were also running, so this is unsupportable.  When this occurs, the system is sent into a<br>
thrashing mode, from which it is difficult even to get back control of the desktop so that<br>
the offending process can be identified and killed.  So some ability to impose a limit is<br>
needed here.</p>

Hi Eugene,</p>
<p>I never use "try", so I need some more information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are you talking about one veriT thread  that used so much memory or <br>
more than one veriT thread?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on what theory was this? I would like to reproduce that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was the real memory usage? Virtual memory is pretty meaningless: <br>
I have a program that has a virtual memory usage of 256G but uses only 9M...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the trashing is not too hard to reproduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it still happen if you deactivate veriT in sledgehammer by adding:<p>ML ‹<br>

<p>I am not sure that I understand this question.  Threads share a single address space, so the amount of memory used<br>
is not a property of a single thread, but of a process.  If you are asking about processes, then it was one veriT<br>

<p>Again, I don't know what you mean by "real memory usage".  Unless a program uses some tricks such as sparse<br>
address spaces (which can be useful in some kind of in-memory database situations), the virtual memory will be the<br>
sum of the code, data, heap and stack sizes.  Code and read-only data can be shared between processes, but this is<br>
not an issue here because there is only one veriT process, and I don't think any shared libraries used would be<br>
contributing to the issue.  The usage in question is almost certainly dynamic memory usage; i.e. heap.</p>
<p>Linux utilities such as "top" and "ps" do report "virtual size" and "resident-set size".  The resident-set size<br>
would be the amount of actual RAM currently in use by the process.  This number is obviously limited by the<br>
amount of installed RAM and once it reaches a certain level there can essentially not be any further increases,<br>
though the size of the virtual address space can continue to increase if there is available swap.<br>
In the case of the example I cited, the RSS reached about 26GB, which took up enough of the system RAM so that<br>
there was severe thrashing.</p>

One additional data point:  The excessive memory consumption issue is not limited to sledgehammer --<br>
it can occur even when there is simply a use in an Isar proof of smt that specifies "verit".<br>
The problem does not occur with proofs that already succeed in a short period of time; it happens when<br>
you invalidate some portion of the proof by editing, so that the particular smt proof doesn't work<br>
any more.  This means that you can spam your whole session (if not your whole computer) if you happen<br>
to make some changes that trigger uncontrolled memory use by veriT in subsequent proofs that<br>
used to work before you made the changes.</p>
<p>This is very much making me want a way to limit the memory use, otherwise I have to figure out how to<br>
disable veriT completely.</p>

Hi Eugene,</p>
<p>I believe that there are two different problems here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>tactics running forever and using a lot of memory. This already<br>
    happens with metis or blast. However, this behavior might be new for<br>
    smt, because the smt_timeout was disabled<br>
    (<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/478b7599a1a0">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/478b7599a1a0</a>) and smt<br>
    solver are a lot more powerful than metis/blast. This is not<br>
    specific to veriT and can happen with Z3 too.</p>
<p>*   Solution: Set the smt_timeout to some reasonable value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Sledgehammer problem that I cannot reproduce. It is hard to know<br>
    what is really happening here, because I would not be surprised that<br>
    the problem is actually the opposite: Isabelle uses tons of memory<br>
    and is not able to kill veriT within the timeout and, therefore,<br>
    veriT has a lot more time to use memory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The motivation for 1 is avoiding timeouts that are hardware dependent <br>
(e.g., if you run things on a raspberry pi).</p>
<p>For 2, can you give me the ouput of the sledgehammer_params command?</p>

Metis and blast run in ML, so are limited by the size of the ML heap.  Poly accepts a parameter that allows<br>
you to limit the size of the ML heap.  Similarly, Java accepts a parameter that allows you to limit the size<br>
of its heap.  The problem here is that now there are additional processes getting fired off that can consume<br>
memory voraciously, and there is no way to limit it.  There is only a certain amount of RAM on the system,<br>
and if each process uses as much as it wants with no limitation, then the RAM will become overcommitted and<br>
the system unstable.  It would be best if there were a single limit to the total amount of memory used by<br>
all Isabelle-related processes, but that is a more complex thing to implement and a fallback is to make it<br>
possible to place limits on the less-essential tools (e.g. smt solvers) that can cause trouble.</p>

I think it might be worth mentioning that there are good ways to set<br>
resource limits on processes in any given OS. I've got consistent <br>
results<br>
from ulimit on linux in the past (in a non-Isabelle project that run<br>
thousands of SMT queries). It might be possible to add such limits to<br>
the veriT tasks as they're created, if necessary by wrapping the veriT<br>
binary in a script.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>

It's likely there's a Windows feature similar to ulimit, but I<br>
have no idea what it might be. I quickly checked whether python's<br>
setrlimit was considered "portable", and it doesn't appear to be<br>
the case.</p>
<p>Even if a portable version exists, I can't think of a sensible<br>
default value. A sufficiently advanced user could already apply<br>
this on a compatible platform by fiddling with the contents of<br>
Isabelle's contrib directory, I think, so maybe there's no need<br>
for any action.</p>

The idea came from me. Having a tactic operate with a timeout seems quite fragile. This adds a layer of randomness to Isabelle. In each AFP entry's ROOT file, there's a timeout for the entire session, which is a good practical compromise, but if we start having timeouts in every individual tactic, we might get all sorts of random failures. Other tactics like "auto" or "metis" don't have timeout.</p>
<p>If this is the only or best way to reduce veriT's memory usage, we could consider reverting 478b7599a1a0, but this seems dubious to me.</p>

Hi,</p>

<p>Perhaps a compromise would be to activate timeouts only for the <br>
interactive session? I find that the most annoying thing about timeouts <br>
is that they can make a build of large heaps fail because the computer <br>
goes into swapping. While in the interactive session, timeouts could be <br>
nice so that the computer does not go into expensive infinite loops when <br>
something changes during editing. And since the interactive session is <br>
usually edited by the same person who inserts the timeout, it's then up <br>
to each person whether they want to use a timeout or not. (And <br>
unpredictability is less of a problem during the interactive editing.)</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

For my part, it is formally OK to do nothing for the release.</p>
<p>It is up to the SMT + veriT experts to say if there is something severely<br>
wrong that needs to be changed for the Isabelle2021 release. RC5 is planned<br>
for 08-Feb-2021. The final release approx. 1 week later.</p>
