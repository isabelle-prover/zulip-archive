<p>From: "Eugene W. Stark" &lt;<a href="mailto:isabelle-users@starkeffect.com">isabelle-users@starkeffect.com</a>&gt;<br>
This is not necessarily new behavior to Isabelle2021-RC1, but I just observed a reason that<br>
explains why it occurs, and might lead someone to be able to fix it.</p>
<p>Not infrequently, sledgehammer will report "Try this: using X Y Z ... by presburger", but when you<br>
actually insert this, the proof fails.  In the past, I have observed that the result can often be<br>
salvaged by using "metis" in place of "presburger" (though for the cases where this arises, which<br>
do not actually involve Presburger arithmetic, presburger can often be much, much faster than other<br>
methods).</p>
<p>Today I just noticed that whether or not presburger succeeds can sometimes be sensitive to the<br>
ordering of the assumptions in the "using" clause that precedes "by presburger".  I confirmed that,<br>
in at least one instance where the "using X Y Z ... by presburger" did not succeed, that it<br>
did succeed when the assumptions were permuted.  More specifically, I applied sledgehammer to<br>
something of the form:</p>
<p>using A B C ...</p>
<p>I received the suggestion "using X Y Z ... by presburger", but "using A B C ... X Y Z ... by presburger"<br>
did not succeed.  However after permuting "A B C ... X Y Z ..." appropriately, presburger did succeed.</p>
<p>I don't know if proof methods are permitted to be sensitive to the order of assumptions in the context.<br>
I would think that this would not be desirable.  In any case, it seems that one class of failures of<br>
"by presburger" suggestions returned by sledgehammer are due to presburger having such a sensitivity.</p>
