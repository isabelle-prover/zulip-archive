<p>From: Claude Marche &lt;<a href="mailto:Claude.Marche@inria.fr">Claude.Marche@inria.fr</a>&gt;<br>
Temporary engineer positions at Inria are available for the<br>
``ProofInUse'' consortium.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to forward this announce to anybody possibly interested</p>
<p>== ProofInUse in short ==</p>
<p>The ProofInUse consortium is a laboratory for research and development<br>
in the domain of high-assurance software. It is joint between several<br>
academic and industrial partners. The general objective of ProofInUse<br>
is to provide software verification tools, based on mathematical<br>
proof, to industry users.</p>
<p>The objective of ProofInUse is to significantly increase the<br>
capabilities and performances of verification environments proposed or<br>
internally used by the partners. Beyond a common interest in formal<br>
verification techniques, the members of ProofInUse share a common<br>
interest in the generic environment Why3 for deductive program<br>
verification, developed in the Toccata research group. In particular,<br>
ProofInUse aims at integration of verification techniques at the<br>
state-of-the-art of academic research, via the Why3 environment.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://proofinuse.gitlabpages.inria.fr/">https://proofinuse.gitlabpages.inria.fr/</a></p>
<p>== Expectations from the candidates ==</p>
<p>We seek for candidates with as much experience and skills as possible<br>
in several domains among : development using the OCaml language ;<br>
techniques for evaluation, compilation and/or transformation of<br>
programs ; formal methods for software engineering ; formal logics ;<br>
static analysis of programs ; computer-assisted theorem proving ; use of <br>
formal<br>
proof environments.</p>
<p>We expect some experience in the field of formal methods of software<br>
engineering in a general sense. The typical candidate would be someone<br>
who recently defended a master's thesis or a PhD in a related<br>
domain.</p>
<p>The research part of the job is significant, the work being expected<br>
to lead to academic publications, as exemplified by the publications<br>
of the former engineers of ProofInUse (see<br>
<a href="https://proofinuse.gitlabpages.inria.fr/dissemination.html">https://proofinuse.gitlabpages.inria.fr/dissemination.html</a>).  The<br>
development activities include a participation to the development of<br>
Why3, for which we are interested in candidates with experience in<br>
OCaml programming, or similar functional programming languages, and in<br>
the practice of shared development using git.</p>
<p>Some skills in the use of a formal proof environment will be a plus.</p>
<p>== How to apply</p>
<p>The engineer positions should be filled as soon as possible.</p>
