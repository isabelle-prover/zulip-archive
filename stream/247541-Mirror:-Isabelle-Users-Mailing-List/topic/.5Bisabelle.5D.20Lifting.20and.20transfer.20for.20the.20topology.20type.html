<p>From: Wenda Li &lt;<a href="mailto:wl302@cam.ac.uk">wl302@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear lifting-and-transfer experts,</p>
<p>I am considering to set up the lifting-and-transfer package for the topology type in “HOL-Analysis.Abstract_Topology”. This requires defining a “relator” to relate two topologies under some relation:</p>
<p>definition rel_topology:: "('a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool) ⇒<br>
    'a topology ⇒ 'b topology ⇒ bool" where<br>
  "rel_topology R T1 T2 = undefined”</p>
<p>And this relator should ideally satisfy the following properties:</p>
<p>lemma rel_topology_eq [relator_eq]: "rel_topology (=) = (=)"<br>
  sorry</p>
<p>lemma rel_topology_mono [relator_mono]: "rel_topology A ≤ rel_topology B"<br>
  if le: "A ≤ B"<br>
  sorry</p>
<p>lemma rel_topology_distr [relator_distr]:<br>
  "rel_topology A OO rel_topology B = rel_topology (A OO B)"<br>
  sorry</p>
<p>definition topo_map::"('a ⇒ 'b) ⇒ 'a topology ⇒ 'b topology" where<br>
  "topo_map f T1 = undefined"</p>
<p>lemma Quotient_topology[quot_map]:<br>
  assumes "Quotient R Abs Rep T"<br>
  shows "Quotient (rel_topology R) (topo_map Abs) (topo_map Rep) (rel_topology T)"<br>
  sorry</p>
<p>I have been attempting to imitate the lifting setup for filters:</p>
<p>definition map_filter_on :: "'a set ⇒ ('a ⇒ 'b) ⇒ 'a filter ⇒ 'b filter" where<br>
  "map_filter_on X f F = Abs_filter (λP. eventually (λx. P (f x) ∧ x ∈ X) F)”</p>
<p>inductive rel_filter :: "('a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool) ⇒ 'a filter ⇒ 'b filter ⇒ bool" for R F G where<br>
 "rel_filter R F G”<br>
if "eventually (case_prod R) Z" "map_filter_on {(x, y). R x y} fst Z = F" "map_filter_on {(x, y). R x y} snd Z = G”</p>
<p>because both ‘a topology and ‘a filter are constructed from ‘a set set but with different constraints. However, unlike filters it appears quite hard to define a map from one topology to another while satisfying the map compositionality as on filters:</p>
<p>lemma map_filter_on_comp: "map_filter_on X f (map_filter_on Y g F) = map_filter_on Y (f ∘ g) F"<br>
  if "g ` Y ⊆ X" and "eventually (λx. x ∈ Y) F"</p>
<p>I was wondering if it is at all possible to define a relator for the topology type.</p>
<p>Any hint or comment would be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Wenda</p>

<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Wenda,</p>
<p>I had the same need recently, and I wrote the definition of <br>
"rel_topology" (together with various transfer and parametricity <br>
theorems) for it:</p>
<p>definition rel_topology :: ‹('a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool) ⇒ ('a topology ⇒ 'b<br>
    topology ⇒ bool)› where<br>
       ‹rel_topology R S T ⟷ (rel_fun (rel_set R) (=)) (openin S) (openin T)<br>
      ∧ (∀U. openin S U ⟶ Domainp (rel_set R) U) ∧ (∀U. openin T U ⟶<br>
    Rangep (rel_set R) U)›</p>
<p>The first condition on the rhs says that the "openin" predictate relates <br>
as one would expect.</p>
<p>However, that turned out to be insufficient (e.g., for proving <br>
‹(rel_topology R ===&gt; rel_set R) topspace topspace›). So I am <br>
additionally requiring that the open sets are in the domain/range of the <br>
underlying relation. (Your email is quite timely, I added this <br>
correction yesterday evening! :) )</p>
<p>This definition seems to work (in the sense that I have managed to prove <br>
various nontrivial transfer theorems, including for infinite sums w.r.t. <br>
different topologies.</p>
<p>You can find the whole thing here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dominique-unruh/afp/blob/registers-infinite/thys/Hilbert_Space_Tensor_Product/Misc_Tensor_Product.thy">https://github.com/dominique-unruh/afp/blob/registers-infinite/thys/Hilbert_Space_Tensor_Product/Misc_Tensor_Product.thy</a></p>
<p>(This is work in progress. But the part relating to rel_topology does <br>
not have any sorry's as far as I can tell (since yesterday! :D). The <br>
repo is a clone of the AFP but I think you can just extract the <br>
Hilbert_Space_Tensor_Product directory on its own and it should work <br>
with the normal release AFP.)</p>
<p>I have not tried to prove the lemmas you write below yet.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

Dear Dominique,</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your prompt reply! And I am so lucky to have you happen to think about the same problem :-)</p>
<p>Your definition of rel_topology is awesome, but I am afraid that with it we still cannot derive the monotonicity lemma: "A ≤ B ⟹ rel_topology A ≤ rel_topology B”.</p>
<p>My intention with the list of properties I described in the previous email is that we can then freely lift from the topology type similar to set/list:</p>
<p>typedef (overloaded) ('a, 'b) poly_inst ("(_ ⇒⇩p /_)" [1, 0] 0) =<br>
  "UNIV:: ('a ⇒ 'b) set"<br>
  by auto<br>
setup_lifting type_definition_poly_inst</p>
<p>lift_definition PiE⇩p :: "'a set ⇒ ('a ⇒ 'b set) ⇒ ('a ⇒⇩p 'b) set" is<br>
  "λs f. PiE s f" .</p>
<p>text ‹This definition is only possible if we have @{thm Quotient_topology}›<br>
lift_definition product_topology⇩p<br>
  :: "('a ⇒ 'b topology) ⇒ 'a set ⇒ ('a ⇒⇩p 'b) topology" is<br>
  "λf s. product_topology f s" .</p>
<p>Nevertheless, being able to prove this number of non-trivial transfer theorems is perhaps the best we can do for now...</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Wenda</p>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@andreas-lochbihler.de">mail@andreas-lochbihler.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Wenda, Dominique and Manuel,</p>
<p>The first attempt at defining a relator for a type is usually to follow the structure of <br>
the types it is built from. Joshua Schneider and I had an ITP paper on that topic a few <br>
years ago: Relational parametricity and quotient preservation for modular (co)datatypes <br>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94821-8_24">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94821-8_24</a></p>
<p>For rel_topology, we'd get what was Dominique's first attempt:</p>
<p>rel_topology R S T = (rel_fun (rel_set R) (=)) (openin S) (openin T)</p>
<p>since openin is the representation morphism of type 'a set =&gt; bool. The above paper gives <br>
sufficient conditions on when Wenda's desired properties are satisfied (especially section <br>
5 on subtypes). However, rel_topology_mono will certainly not hold with this definition. <br>
The reason is that the type variable 'a in <code>'a set =&gt; bool</code> occurs in a negative position, <br>
  so this approach will yield a contravariant functor, for which the relator is anti-monotone:</p>
<p>R &lt;= S ==&gt; rel_topology S &lt;= rel_topology R</p>
<p>Accordingly, you'd be looking for a contravariant map function for the quotient <br>
preservation theorem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this approach sometimes does not give the right relator. For example, I <br>
originally defined rel_filter following this approach: <br>
<a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/annotate/5431e1392b14/src/HOL/Topological_Spaces.thy#l2285">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/annotate/5431e1392b14/src/HOL/Topological_Spaces.thy#l2285</a><br>
However, this did not give the nice theorems for rel_filter that we have today in <br>
Isabelle. As discussed at the end of Section 5 in the above paper, the current relator is <br>
stronger and thereby eliminates some junk. In <br>
<a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/1d005f514417">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/1d005f514417</a>, I've switched out the old <br>
definition for the new one.</p>
<p>In particular, the definition via a mapper gives the desired properties a lot more <br>
directly than if we try to define the relator directly. So it may be worth to look for a <br>
suitable map function (and decide whether it should be co- or contravariant).</p>
<p>On 06.05.22 15:07, Manuel Eberl wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also failed miserably trying to define one for the "measure" type once.</p>
<p>I can well imagine that. <code>'a measure</code> consists of the sigma algebra <code>sets</code> and the measure <br>
function <code>emeasure</code>. Let's just look at the types:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sets :: "'a measure =&gt; 'a set set"<br>
emeasure :: "'a measure =&gt; 'a set =&gt; ennreal"</p>
<p>Here, the type variable 'a occurs in <code>sets</code> in a positive position and in <code>emeasure</code> in a <br>
negative position. This means that if we define the relator according to the types, we're <br>
setup for failure. We get neither monotonicity nor anti-monotonicity and the mapper will <br>
only work for isomorphism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I mean, I could define one that works for two types that are completely isomorphic, but <br>
that's probably not as general as what we really want to have.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One could try to get out of this problem via the isomorphism between sets and predicates. <br>
If we understood the set to be measured as a predicate, i.e., the indicator function, then <br>
all occurrences of 'a would be covariant again and there would be hope.</p>
<p>emeasure' :: "'a measure =&gt; ('a =&gt; bool) =&gt; ennreal"</p>
<p>This duality between sets and predicates w.r.t. co/contravariance was one of the main <br>
reasons why we have re-introduces a separate type <code>set</code> for sets about 10 years ago. (In <br>
2008, the set type constructor had been replaces as a type synonym: 'a set = 'a =&gt; bool) <br>
Unfortunately, when a new definition is made involving sets or predicates, we typically do <br>
  not consider the co/contravariance aspect when we make a decision whether a parameter <br>
should be a set or a predicate. We are mostly guided by the mathematical practice or <br>
convenience of the notation. Of course, it's possible to define a relator on <code>'a set</code> that <br>
treats sets like predicates (see rel_pred in SPMF.thy), but that doesn't work well with <br>
the transfer and lifting packages. They do not support several relators for a type, and <br>
that's usually where my attempts in this direction have hit a wall. Proper support for <br>
this duality would require a substantial rewrite of these packages.</p>
<p>I haven't yet thought about how a mapper or relator for topologies or measures could look <br>
like. However, both topologies and measures typically consider only a well-behaved <br>
functions (continuous or measurable) whereas the transfer and lifting packages always work <br>
with the full function space, i.e., over the category SET. I don't know what complication <br>
this brings along.</p>
<p>I hope that the above thoughts give you some inspiration where to look for solutions.</p>
<p>Andreas</p>

<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Wenda,</p>
<p>Your definition of rel_topology is awesome, but I am afraid that with it we<br>
still cannot derive the monotonicity lemma: "A ≤ B ⟹ rel_topology A ≤<br>
rel_topology B”.</p>
<p>I think that specific problem should be relatively easy to fix by replacing<br>
"(rel_fun (rel_set R) (=)) (openin S) (openin T)" by "rel_set (rel_set R)<br>
(Collect (openin S)) (Collect (openin T))". (I.e., we see the topology not<br>
as a predicate over sets but a set of sets (which is anyway more in line<br>
with usual language.) This would be monotonous.</p>
<p>However, that would not address the other lemmas you wanted.</p>
<p>I worked on it some more since your reply, and I think I have a much more<br>
satisfactory approach.</p>
<p>Caveat: I have not formalized anything of what I write below in Isabelle. I<br>
have handwritten proofs for the claims but they are not carefully checked<br>
so the claims I am giving might not be correct. I am not including the<br>
proofs in this email because is would take too long to write them in a<br>
readable form. (But I can of course provide them if we need them.)</p>
<p>The first step was to define a <em>map_topology</em> function. I believe the<br>
natural way to map topologies is the following (e.g. here<br>
&lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space#Topological_constructions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space#Topological_constructions</a>&gt;):<br>
For a surjective function [image: f:X\to Y], given a topology T on X, you<br>
get a topology f(X) on Y by defining: [image: U\in f\left(X\right)] iff [image:<br>
f^{-1}\in X].</p>
<p>However, the requirement that [image: f] is surjective is awkward in our<br>
context because we do not want to add conditions in the various relator<br>
theorems. So my solution is to [image: f\left(T\right)] be not a topology<br>
on [image: Y] but a topology on [image: \text{im}f]. (I.e., with<br>
topspace [image:<br>
\text{im}f].) More precisely, for [image: f:X\to Y] we define [image:<br>
\overline{f}] as follows:</p>
<p>[image: U\in\overline{f}\left(T\right)]   iff   [image:<br>
f^{-1}\left(U\right)\cap\text{top}\left(T\right)\in T] and [image:<br>
U\subseteq f\left(\text{top}\left(T\right)\right)].</p>
<p>(In Isabelle, we would write [image: \overline{f}] as *map_topology<br>
f*.) ([image:<br>
\text{top}\left(T\right)] denotes the topspace of [image: T].)</p>
<p>This construction has the following desired properties:  [image:<br>
\overline{\text{id}}=\text{id}].   [image: \overline{f\circ<br>
g}=\overline{f}\circ\overline{g}].    [image:<br>
\text{top}\left(\overline{f}\left(T\right)\right)=f\left(\text{top}\left(T\right)\right)].<br>
  If [image: f=g] on [image: \text{top}\left(T\right)], then [image:<br>
\overline{f}\left(T\right)=\overline{g}\left(T\right)].</p>
<p>We can not define <em>rel_topology.</em> The idea how to do it is inspired by the<br>
way relations on sets are lifted to relations on probability distributions<br>
(e.g., in probabilistic relational Hoare logic). It is also similar to how<br>
<em>rel_filter</em> is defined. The basic idea is to say that two topologies are<br>
related (for some relation [image: R]) if there is a topology on pairs (I<br>
call it the witness-topology) such that the witness-topology in a certain<br>
sense satisfies [image: R] and the two topologies are the left/right<br>
projection of the joint-topology. Specifically, we define:</p>
<p>For topologies [image: A,B],    [image: \left(A,B\right)\in R]     iff<br>
   [image:<br>
\exists T^{\ast}.\ \ \ \text{top}\left(T^{\ast}\right)\subseteq R\ \<br>
\wedge\ \ \ \overline{\text{fst}}\left(T^{\ast}\right)=A\ \ \ \wedge\ \<br>
\overline{\text{snd}}\left(T^{\ast}\right)=B]</p>
<p>Concerning the properties you desired:</p>
<p>lemma rel_topology_eq [relator_eq]: "rel_topology (=) = (=)"<br>
  sorry</p>
<p>Holds. (Witness-topology for the [image: \Leftarrow]-direction is [image:<br>
\overline{\text{double}}\left(A\right)] where [image:<br>
\text{double}\left(x\right):=\left(x,x\right)].)</p>
<p>lemma rel_topology_mono [relator_mono]: "rel_topology A ≤ rel_topology B"<br>
  if le: "A ≤ B"</p>
<p>Holds trivially by definition.</p>
<p>lemma rel_topology_distr [relator_distr]:<br>
  "rel_topology A OO rel_topology B = rel_topology (A OO B)"</p>
<p>I do not know whether it holds. It looks like a difficult one to me. Is it<br>
an important property?</p>
<p>lemma Quotient_topology[quot_map]:<br>
  assumes "Quotient R Abs Rep T"<br>
  shows "Quotient (rel_topology R) (topo_map Abs) (topo_map Rep)<br>
(rel_topology T)"</p>
<p>Holds. The proof is more involved. (Quotient involves a number of<br>
properties, and for most of them one has to choose the witness-topology<br>
suitably.) But if I am not mistaken, it all works fine with a bit of work.</p>
<p>[For my own reference: Quicknotes 2022, p.95–100.]</p>
<p>I think this is better than the definition that I am currently using. (The<br>
definition I use right now works for my purposes, but it may not be<br>
sufficient for other purposes. And since one cannot use two relators for<br>
the same typo (I think), it would be good to have only one (good)<br>
definition of *rel_topology *throughout all Isabelle theories.</p>
<p>So if you feel that this is worth pursuing, maybe we can coordinate further<br>
off-list? (I would also like to avoid duplicating work if we both develop<br>
lifting of topologies.)</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>
