<p>From: "\"Daggitt, Matthew\"" &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,<br>
 It has been drawn to the organisers' attention that the paper submission deadline for MPC 2022&lt;<a href="https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/mpc22/">https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/mpc22/</a>&gt; lies over the Easter weekend which is a public holiday in some parts of the world. To avoid disrupting people's well-earned holidays and to increase the number of submissions, we are extending the deadlines for both abstract and paper submission by 12 days. The new dates are therefore:</p>
<p>*   Abstract submission - 22nd of April (anywhere on Earth)<br>
  *   Paper submission - 29th of April (anywhere on Earth)</p>
<p>Many thanks,<br>
Katya and Matthew</p>
