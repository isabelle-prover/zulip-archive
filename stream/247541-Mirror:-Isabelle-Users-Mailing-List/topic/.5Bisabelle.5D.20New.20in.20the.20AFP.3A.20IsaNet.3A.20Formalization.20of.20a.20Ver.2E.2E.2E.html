IsaNet: Formalization of a Verification Framework for Secure Data Plane Protocols</p>
<p>Tobias Klenze and Christoph Sprenger</p>
<p>Today's Internet is built on decades-old networking protocols that lack <br>
scalability, reliability and security. In response, the networking community has <br>
developed path-aware Internet architectures that solve these issues while <br>
simultaneously empowering end hosts. In these architectures, autonomous systems <br>
authorize forwarding paths in accordance with their routing policies, and <br>
protect paths using cryptographic authenticators. For each packet, the sending <br>
end host selects an authorized path and embeds it and its authenticators in the <br>
packet header. This allows routers to efficiently determine how to forward the <br>
packet. The central security property of the data plane, i.e., of forwarding, is <br>
that packets can only travel along authorized paths. This property, which we <br>
call path authorization, protects the routing policies of autonomous systems <br>
from malicious senders. The fundamental role of packet forwarding in the <br>
Internet's ecosystem and the complexity of the authentication mechanisms <br>
employed call for a formal analysis. We develop IsaNet, a parameterized <br>
verification framework for data plane protocols in Isabelle/HOL. We first <br>
formulate an abstract model without an attacker for which we prove path <br>
authorization. We then refine this model by introducing a Dolev--Yao attacker <br>
and by protecting authorized paths using (generic) cryptographic validation <br>
fields. This model is parametrized by the path authorization mechanism and <br>
assumes five simple verification conditions. We propose novel attacker models <br>
and different sets of assumptions on the underlying routing protocol. We <br>
validate our framework by instantiating it with nine concrete protocols variants <br>
and prove that they each satisfy the verification conditions (and hence path <br>
authorization). The invariants needed for the security proof are proven in the <br>
parametrized model instead of the instance models. Our framework thus supports <br>
low-effort security proofs for data plane protocols. In contrast to what could <br>
be achieved with state-of-the-art automated protocol verifiers, our results hold <br>
for arbitrary network topologies and sets of authorized paths.</p>
