Residuated Transition Systems<br>
Eugene W. Stark</p>
<p>A residuated transition system (RTS) is a transition system that is equipped <br>
with a certain partial binary operation, called residuation, on transitions. <br>
Using the residuation operation, one can express nuances, such as a distinction <br>
between nondeterministic and concurrent choice, as well as partial commutativity <br>
relationships between transitions, which are not captured by ordinary transition <br>
systems. A version of residuated transition systems was introduced in previous <br>
work by the author, in which they were called “concurrent transition systems” in <br>
view of the original motivation for their definition from the study of <br>
concurrency. In the first part of the present article, we give a formal <br>
development that generalizes and subsumes the original presentation. We give an <br>
axiomatic definition of residuated transition systems that assumes only a single <br>
partial binary operation as given structure. From the axioms, we derive notions <br>
of “arrow“ (transition), “source”, “target”, “identity”, as well as <br>
“composition” and “join” of transitions; thereby recovering structure that in <br>
the previous work was assumed as given. We formalize and generalize the result, <br>
that residuation extends from transitions to transition paths, and we <br>
systematically develop the properties of this extension. A significant <br>
generalization made in the present work is the identification of a general <br>
notion of congruence on RTS’s, along with an associated quotient construction.</p>
<p>In the second part of this article, we use the RTS framework to formalize <br>
several results in the theory of reduction in Church’s λ-calculus. Using a de <br>
Bruijn index-based syntax in which terms represent parallel reduction steps, we <br>
define residuation on terms and show that it satisfies the axioms for an RTS. An <br>
application of the results on paths from the first part of the article allows us <br>
to prove the classical Church-Rosser Theorem with little additional effort. We <br>
then use residuation to define the notion of “development” and we prove the <br>
Finite Developments Theorem, that every development is finite, formalizing and <br>
adapting to de Bruijn indices a proof by de Vrijer. We also use residuation to <br>
define the notion of a “standard reduction path”, and we prove the <br>
Standardization Theorem: that every reduction path is congruent to a standard <br>
one. As a corollary of the Standardization Theorem, we obtain the Leftmost <br>
Reduction Theorem: that leftmost reduction is a normalizing strategy.</p>
