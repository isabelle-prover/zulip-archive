<p>ASSISTANT PROFESSOR / ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR<br>
                                          in COMPUTER SCIENCE<br>
                            ("BICENTENARY RESEARCH LEADER")<br>
             HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY, EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND, UK<br>
                         SALARY: £60,000 -£42,000 per annum<br>
                   START DATE: FROM MARCH 2022 (NEGOTIABLE)<br>
             CLOSING DATE FOR APPLICATIONS: 15 DECEMBER 2021</p>
<p>JOB DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Heriot-Watt University has established a reputation for world-class<br>
teaching and leading-edge, relevant research,<br>
which has made it one of the top UK universities for innovation, business<br>
and industry.</p>
<p>To celebrate our bicentenary of pioneering research, we recruit outstanding<br>
research academics, <em>Bicentenary Research Leaders</em>,<br>
some of whom will be associated with the new National Robotarium (NR) and<br>
the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics (ECR).<br>
We welcome applicants for this post and in particular research leaders in<br>
the field of trustworthy autonomous systems.<br>
As both trust and autonomy can take many forms, we are interested in a<br>
range of research areas, leading examples being:</p>
<p>- Verification (automated and interactive theorem proving,<br>
   (probabilistic) model checking, SMT solvers),</p>
<p>- Validation (programming languages infrastructure, integrated<br>
   simulation),</p>
<p>- Security for Complex Autonomous Systems (robustness against<br>
   adversaries, security and autonomous cars)</p>
<p>- Interpretable/Explainable/Property-driven Machine Learning.</p>
<p>The "Bicentenary Research Leader" positions are permanent<br>
research-intensive posts, with the expectation that the successful<br>
candidates will devote most of their time to develop cutting-edge research<br>
ideas and lead large research projects.</p>
<p>ABOUT OUR TEAM:</p>
<p>The Department of Computer Science is internationally renowned for its<br>
world-class research across a number of areas,<br>
including artificial intelligence and machine learning, data integration,<br>
knowledge representation, visualization and analytics,<br>
natural language processing, formal methods, logic, type theory,<br>
programming languages, parallel computation,<br>
human-computer and human-robot interaction, and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Jointly with the School of Engineering at Heriot-Watt and the School of<br>
Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, we host<br>
the center for doctoral training “Edinburgh Centre for Robotics” and the<br>
UK’s first National Robotarium, that together form a<br>
£129M joint venture, a center of excellence for AI research on an<br>
international scale, and a research and innovation hub<br>
with &gt;150 staff and PhD students. In RCUK’s recent Grand Challenges Scheme:<br>
Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS),<br>
our academics form core teams in 2 out of 7 TAS nodes (each node is<br>
supported by a £3M research grant). The two nodes<br>
stand for “Trust” and “Governance” in Autonomous Systems.   Our grant<br>
funding in this area has also grown through being<br>
awarded, jointly with the School Of Engineering at HWU an EPSRC Industrial<br>
Strategy Challenge Strategy Fund for<br>
the Robotics Hub for Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets (ORCA)<br>
worth £14.6M, which is one of the largest<br>
industrial strategy challenge funds awards in Scotland.</p>
<p>The department has strong collaboration with Industry. Since 2014, we have<br>
undertaken 107 projects with industrial partners,<br>
through our doctoral training centers (40 industrial partners), the ORCA<br>
hub (30 industrial partners), and the TAS nodes.<br>
Among our collaborators are Amazon Research, BP, Chevron, FiveAI, Horiba<br>
Mira, Imandra, Kawasaki, Kuka Robotics,<br>
Lloyds, Schlumberger, and many others.</p>
<p>The School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences has an Athena SWAN Bronze<br>
Award and is committed to an equality charter,<br>
which includes having a diverse and inclusive workforce, and to offering<br>
equality of opportunity to all<br>
(see<br>

).<br>
We particularly encourage applications from women, and we welcome requests<br>
for flexible working arrangements and<br>
endeavour to accommodate them, whenever possible.</p>
