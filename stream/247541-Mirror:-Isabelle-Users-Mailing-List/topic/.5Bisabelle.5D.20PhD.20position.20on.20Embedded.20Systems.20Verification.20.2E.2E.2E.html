<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:lammich@in.tum.de">lammich@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
We are looking for a PhD candidate for a 4-year project on Formal Methods for<br>
Embedded Systems, as part of SAVES (ScAlable Verification of industrial<br>
Embedded control Systems), a collaboration with the University of Münster (WWU<br>
Münster). You will be working on the SAVES project, carried out in<br>
collaboration with prof. dr. Paula Herber (University of Twente / WWU<br>
Münster).</p>
<p>The overall goal of SAVES is to investigate methods and tools to establish<br>
correctness of embedded systems. With trends such as Industry 4.0, the<br>
internet of things, and autonomous driving, the complexity of embedded systems<br>
is steadily increasing. A prerequisite to ensure the correct functioning of<br>
industrial embedded systems under all circumstances is a clear understanding<br>
of the models and languages that are used in the development process. Formal<br>
methods provide a basis to make the development process systematic, well-<br>
defined, and automated. However, for many industrially relevant languages and<br>
models, the semantics are only informally defined. Together with the limited<br>
scalability of formal design and verification techniques, this makes the<br>
formal verification of industrial embedded control systems a difficult<br>
challenge, which can not be solved satisfactory with currently available<br>
methods and tools. At the same time, we see that in the area of deductive<br>
program verification, powerful techniques and tools have been developed to<br>
reason about software with unbounded parameters, for example the VerCors tool<br>
suite. In this project, we will extend these techniques with concepts to cope<br>
with heterogeneity, concurrency, and real-time to make them suitable for<br>
industrial embedded systems.</p>
<p>The PhD candidate hired at the University of Twente will be supervised by<br>
Marieke Huisman and Paula Herber and will work on extensions of the methods<br>
and tools developed in the FMT group for embedded systems, in close<br>
collaboration with the Embedded Systems group in Münster.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT</p>
<p>In the Formal Methods and Tools (FMT) research group, formal techniques and<br>
tools are developed and used as a means to support the development of<br>
software. Our central goal is to increase the reliability of the software that<br>
we rely on, as individuals and as society. We primarily target complex<br>
concurrent ICT systems, embedded in a technological context or in a<br>
distributed environment.</p>
<p>The FMT group is part of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics<br>
and Computer Science (EEMCS) at the University of Twente. The FMT group also<br>
participates in the Digital Systems Institute (DSI).</p>
<p>Our institute was ranked first at the most recent research national<br>
assessment.</p>
<p>ORGANIZATION</p>
<p>The faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science<br>
(EEMCS) uses mathematics, electronics and computer technology to contribute to<br>
the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). With ICT<br>
present in almost every device and product we use nowadays, we embrace our<br>
role as contributors to a broad range of societal activities and as pioneers<br>
of tomorrow's digital society. As part of a people-first tech university that<br>
aims to shape society, individuals and connections, our faculty works together<br>
intensively with industrial partners and researchers in the Netherlands and<br>
abroad, and conducts extensive research for external commissioning parties and<br>
funders. Our research has a high profile both in the Netherlands and<br>
internationally. It has been accommodated in three multidisciplinary UT<br>
research institutes: Mesa+ Institute, TechMed Centre and Digital Society<br>
Institute.</p>
<p>As an employer, the EEMCS Faculty offers jobs that matter. We equip you as a<br>
staff member to shape new opportunities both for yourself and for our society.<br>
With our Faculty, you will be part of a leading tech university that is<br>
changing our world for the better. We offer an open, inclusive and<br>
entrepreneurial climate, in which we encourage you to make healthy choices,<br>
for example, with our flexible, customizable conditions.</p>
