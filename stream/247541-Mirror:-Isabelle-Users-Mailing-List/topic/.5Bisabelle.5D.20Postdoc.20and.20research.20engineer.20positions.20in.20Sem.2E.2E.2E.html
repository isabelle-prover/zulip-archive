Postdoc and research engineer positions in Semantics and Verification for<br>
Secure Systems Software</p>
<p>Advert: <a href="http://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk/job/28012/">http://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk/job/28012/</a><br>
Closing date: 13 January 2021</p>
<p>Are you interested in developing and applying semantics and verification<br>
techniques to radically improve the foundations and security of mainstream<br>
computer systems? We are looking for postdoctoral researchers and research<br>
assistants to do exactly that, in a wide range of topics.</p>
<p>In recent years, working with Arm, IBM, RISC-V International, the CHERI<br>
team, the C and C++ standards committees, and others, we have shown how one<br>
can develop and use authoritative semantics for full-scale architecture and<br>
language definitions, including instruction-set architectures of ARMv8-A,<br>
RISC-V, and CHERI in our Sail metalanguage (<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/</a>), our Cerberus C semantics (<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/</a>), and relaxed-memory concurrency<br>
models at the architecture and C/C++ language levels. These use a<br>
combination of semantic definitions made executable as test oracles, test<br>
generation, symbolic execution, and mechanised proof; they have resolved<br>
many questions about what these fundamental abstractions are or should be;<br>
and they can enable both lightweight formal engineering and full<br>
verification of key parts of real systems.</p>
<p>We now aim to build above this in two related projects, for CHERI and Arm<br>
system software.</p>
<p>(1) CHERI verification. CHERI (<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-941.pdf">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-941.pdf</a>,<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/</a>) extends<br>
conventional hardware Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs) with new<br>
architectural features, using capabilities, to enable fine-grained memory<br>
protection and highly scalable software compartmentalization. The CHERI<br>
project is led by Robert Watson, Simon Moore, and Peter Sewell at the<br>
University of Cambridge and Peter Neumann at SRI International. CHERI<br>
allows historically memory-unsafe programming languages such as C and C++<br>
to be adapted to protect against many currently widely exploited security<br>
vulnerabilities, and enables the fine-grained decomposition of<br>
operating-system (OS) and application code, to limit the effects of<br>
security vulnerabilities. CHERI is a hardware/software/semantics co-design<br>
project, bringing together computer architecture, systems software,<br>
security, and semantics.</p>
<p>In October 2019, Arm announced Morello (<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-morello.html">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-morello.html</a>),<br>
an experimental CHERI-extended, multicore, superscalar ARMv8-A processor,<br>
System-on-Chip (SoC), and prototype board. Morello is a part of the UKRI<br>
£187M Digital Security by Design Challenge (DSbD), supported by the UK<br>
Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, including a commitment of over £50M by<br>
Arm. Morello will support industrial-scale evaluation of CHERI, with a view<br>
to mass-market adoption - which would transform the security landscape.</p>
<p>We have previously developed rigorous engineering methods (<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-formal.html">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-formal.html</a>)<br>
to precisely define the CHERI ISA, for CHERI-MIPS and CHERI-RISC-V<br>
variants, and to prove (in Isabelle) that they satisfy key intended<br>
security properties (<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/cheri-formal.pdf">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/cheri-formal.pdf</a>).<br>
We are now collaborating with Arm and researchers at the University of<br>
Edinburgh to do the same for the full Morello CHERI ARMv8 ISA, building on<br>
our Sail ARMv8-A ISA semantics, and to study the semantics and security of<br>
higher-level languages and system software above CHERI, building also on<br>
our Cerberus C semantics (<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/</a>).<br>
Morello and this verification aim to improve the security of all Arm mobile<br>
device software.</p>
<p>(2) Arm system software verification. This ongoing project, in<br>
collaboration with Google and with researchers at MPI-SWS, Radboud, SNU,<br>
and Aarhus, aims to establish correctness and security properties of key<br>
hypervisor system software above the ARMv8-A ISA semantics mentioned above,<br>
integrated with the ARMv8-A concurrency architecture (including both the<br>
previous "user-mode" models and the system concurrency semantics, being<br>
developed in collaboration with Arm) (<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/armv8-mca/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/armv8-mca/</a>). The Cambridge work is led by<br>
Peter Sewell, Neel Krishnaswami, and Robert Watson. Here too, there is the<br>
prospect of the resulting system being very widely deployed.</p>
<p>We are looking for postdocs and research assistants to contribute to all<br>
aspects of both projects. You should have a strong background in semantics<br>
and verification, the motivation and flexibility to develop practical ways<br>
to use them at scale for real systems, and experience in one or more of:</p>
<ul>
<li>interactive theorem proving, in Coq and/or Isabelle (we use both)</li>
<li>program logics (especially separation logics and Iris)</li>
<li>relaxed-memory concurrency</li>
<li>low-level system software</li>
<li>programming language semantics and type systems</li>
<li>program analysis</li>
<li>model checking</li>
<li>computer security</li>
<li>functional programming</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also seeking candidates with a research engineering focus, to assist<br>
in the development of robust and widely usable tools based on the above.<br>
For this, you should have experience in functional programming, especially<br>
OCaml.</p>
<p>For more details of our recent work, see (<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/</a>),<br>
and especially the REMS (<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/index.html">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/index.html</a>)<br>
and CHERI (<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/</a>)<br>
projects, which are both lively and effective collaborations.</p>
<p>The positions are available to start as soon as possible. For candidates<br>
with substantial relevant expertise, we may be able to appoint at the<br>
Senior Research Associate level.</p>
<p>Research Assistant (without PhD): £26,715-£30,942, Research Associate (with<br>
PhD): £32,816-£40,322, or Senior Research Associate: £41,526-£52,559.<br>
