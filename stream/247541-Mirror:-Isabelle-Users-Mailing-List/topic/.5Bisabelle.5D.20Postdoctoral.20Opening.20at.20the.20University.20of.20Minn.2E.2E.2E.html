<p>From: Gopalan Nadathur via Cl-isabelle-users &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Applications are invited for a one-year postdoctoral position at the<br>
University of Minnesota. The position is available immediately;<br>
applications will be reviewed as they are received.</p>
<p>The project within which the appointment is to be made concerns the<br>
development of a framework that supports the encoding of rule-based<br>
relational specifications and the process of reasoning about such<br>
specifications through the encoding. An emphasis in the project is the use<br>
of the so-called higher-order abstract syntax approach to representing<br>
objects that embody a binding structure. In recent work, we have developed a<br>
new logic &lt;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00111">https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00111</a>&gt; for articulating properties of<br>
LF specifications, which has provided the basis for a proof assistant<br>
called Adelfa &lt;<a href="http://adelfa.cs.umn.edu">http://adelfa.cs.umn.edu</a>&gt; for reasoning about such<br>
properties. In other work, we are developing the capability to reason about<br>
linear logic specifications within the Abella proof assistant<br>
&lt;<a href="https://abella-prover.org/">https://abella-prover.org/</a>&gt; and are also using this system to explore the<br>
benefits of higher-order representations of syntax in the verification of<br>
compilers and transformers for functional programming languages. The<br>
successful candidate will be expected to participate in and help lead the<br>
work in some of these directions.</p>
<p>To be suitable for the position, the candidate should be broadly conversant<br>
with the areas of computational logic and programming languages and should<br>
have the mathematical and programming skills necessary for conducting<br>
research in them. Some particular facets that would be help in engaging<br>
immediately with the research problems are a prior exposure to a proof<br>
assistant or logical framework such as Coq, Isabelle or Abella, programming<br>
experience with a functional language such as OCaml, an understanding of<br>
proof theoretic treatments of aspects such as fixed-point definitions, and<br>
familiarity with issues related to proof search in sequent calculi and<br>
similar logical systems.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me (Gopalan Nadathur, <a href="mailto:ngopalan@umn.edu">ngopalan@umn.edu</a>) for<br>
more details about the position. To view the official announcement, please<br>

<p>This site also provides details about how to apply and serves as the portal<br>
for applications. A prerequisite for employment in this capacity is a<br>
doctoral degree in Computer Science or closely related field.</p>
