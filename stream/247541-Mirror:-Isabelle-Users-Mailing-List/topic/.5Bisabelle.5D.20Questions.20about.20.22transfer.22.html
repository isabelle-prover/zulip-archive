<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>I recently did some experiments with the "transfer" command, but there<br>
are a few things that I don't quite understand, so here are a few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It seems to me that "transfer" always transfers theorems<br>
"left-to-right". For the "transferred" attribute, there is<br>
"untransferred" – is there a similar thing for "transfer" as well?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relatedly, is there an easy idiomatic way to use "flipped" relators?<br>
The following does not work:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>lemma<br>
  assumes [transfer_rule]: "rel_set r X Y"<br>
  shows   "rel_set (λy x. r x y) Y X"<br>
  by transfer_prover</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Sometimes, it is more convenient to prove transfer rules for<br>
functions following the pattern</li>
</ol>
<p>lemma<br>
  assumes [transfer_rule]: "r1 a b" "r2 c d"<br>
  shows   "r3 (f a c) (f' b d)"</p>
<p>but if I declare that lemmas as a transfer_rule, it is not used. I have<br>
to explicitly prove "(r1 ===&gt; r2 ===&gt; r3) f f'" from this for it to be<br>
used. Is there some way around this?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>There is currently no relator for measures. I came up with the<br>
following one, which works well for my purposes, but I think it is not a<br>
good relator because it only makes sense for bi-unique relators on the<br>
values.</li>
</ol>
<p>definition rel_measure :: "('a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool) ⇒ ('a measure ⇒ 'b measure ⇒<br>
bool)" where<br>
  "rel_measure r M1 M2 ⟷<br>
     rel_set r (space M1) (space M2) ∧<br>
     rel_set (rel_set r) (sets M1) (sets M2) ∧<br>
     (rel_set r ===&gt; (=)) (emeasure M1) (emeasure M2)"</p>
<p>The definition of rel_pmf suggests something involving product measures<br>
would be the right way to go.</p>
<p>On a related note: suppose I defined my simple relator and then later on<br>
someone else defines another relator for measures. Would the rules then<br>
clash? Would one have to remove all the rules for my relator for things<br>
to still work smoothly?</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Is there any trick for proving transfer rules for constants defined<br>
by "inductive" or "fun" that I am unaware of? Doing the induction proofs<br>
manually is very tedious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The constant "has_derivative" is not parametric (I think) because<br>
e.g. for "(f has_derivative D) at_top" you get "Lim (λx. x)", which<br>
equal to "THE x. False". However, in practice, F is always of the form<br>
"at x within A" and then has_derivative is parametric. But if I prove<br>
the transfer rule</p>
<p>(r ===&gt; r) ===&gt; (r ===&gt; r) ===&gt; r ===&gt; rel_set r ===&gt; (=))<br>
(λf D x A. (f has_derivative D) (at x within A))<br>
(λf D x A. (f has_derivative D) (at x within A))</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>for some suitable relator r, it does not get used. The transfer package<br>
insists on a relator for "has_derivative". Of course, if I do an<br>
auxiliary definition for this and fold it before applying transfer, it<br>
works, but then I have a useless auxiliary function cluttering the<br>
namespace.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>In measure theory, there is the definition</p>
<p>nn_integral :: 'a measure ⇒ ('a ⇒ ennreal) ⇒ ennreal<br>
nn_integral M f =<br>
  Sup (simple_integral M `<br>
  {g. simple_function M g ∧ g ≤ f})</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I was able to prove</p>
<p>lemma transfer_nn_integral [transfer_rule]:<br>
  assumes [transfer_rule]: "bi_unique r"<br>
  shows "(rel_measure r ===&gt; (r ===&gt; (=)) ===&gt; (=))<br>
         nn_integral nn_integral"</p>
<p>but I needed some trickery to avoid "bi_total r" due to the use of<br>
"Collect". The reason why it works is that "simple_integral" only<br>
evaluates the function on values from "space M", so we can replace the<br>
set in question by</p>
<p>{g. simple_function M g ∧ (∀x. x ∉ space M ⟶ f x = 0) ∧<br>
      ∀x∈space M. g x ≤ f x}</p>
<p>which can be shown (with quite a bit of pain!) to be parametric.</p>

<p>From: Mikhail Chekhov &lt;<a href="mailto:mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com">mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Manuel Eberl/All,</p>
<p>I will allow myself to provide a few remarks as a regular user of the<br>
transfer infrastructure. Certainly, my own understanding of the framework<br>
is still somewhat limited. However, hopefully, my advice will help to get<br>
rid of the questions that are less difficult.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>It seems to me that "transfer" always transfers theorems<br>
"left-to-right". For the "transferred" attribute, there is<br>
"untransferred" – is there a similar thing for "transfer" as well?</li>
</ol>
<p>Similar questions have been asked before and the answer seems to be<br>
negative (<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2019-July/msg00013.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2019-July/msg00013.html</a><br>
).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Sometimes, it is more convenient to prove transfer rules for<br>
functions following the pattern<br>
lemma<br>
  assumes [transfer_rule]: "r1 a b" "r2 c d"<br>
  shows   "r3 (f a c) (f' b d)"<br>
but if I declare that lemmas as a transfer_rule, it is not used. I have<br>
to explicitly prove "(r1 ===&gt; r2 ===&gt; r3) f f'" from this for it to be<br>
used. Is there some way around this?</li>
</ol>
<p>In certain circumstances, the rules stated in a similar format can be used.<br>
For example,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>context<br>
  includes lifting_syntax<br>
  fixes r1 r2 r3 :: "'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool"<br>
    and f :: "'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ 'a" and f' :: "'b ⇒ 'b ⇒ 'b"<br>
  assumes [transfer_rule]: "bi_unique r3"<br>
    and [transfer_rule]: "r1 a b ⟹ r2 c d ⟹ r3 (f a c) (f' b d)"<br>
begin</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  assumes [transfer_rule]: "r1 a b" "r2 c d"<br>
  shows "f' b d = f' b d"<br>
  by transfer (rule refl)</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>In this case, "r1 a b" and "r2 c d" are treated as side conditions, and the<br>
transfer infrastructure has some limited support for such unconventional<br>
side conditions (however, I am not certain as to what is the extent of such<br>
support).</p>
<p>If it is more convenient to prove a transfer rule in the form that you have<br>
stated, then you can always use (intro rel_funI) to perform the conversion,<br>
e.g.</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  includes lifting_syntax<br>
  shows "(r1 ===&gt; r2 ===&gt; r3) f f'"<br>
  apply(intro rel_funI)<br>
  (<em>⋀x y xa ya. r1 x y ⟹ r2 xa ya ⟹ r3 (f x xa) (f' y ya)</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Is there any trick for proving transfer rules for constants defined<br>
by "inductive" or "fun" that I am unaware of? Doing the induction proofs<br>

</ol>
<p>Yes, there is: see<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-January/msg00072.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-January/msg00072.html</a>.<br>
I would like to add to the suggestion in the post that, technically, there<br>
is little that is stopping one from recovering the original definitional<br>
axiom in Isabelle/ML using Thm.axiom (e.g. see the implementation of UD in<br>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/user9716869/Isabelle-Complement-Library">https://gitlab.com/user9716869/Isabelle-Complement-Library</a>, but keep in<br>
mind that it is still in a reasonably rough experimental state) instead of<br>
using the collection of theorems associated with nitpick. Providing further<br>
automation for this is on my own "to do" list, but it has a very low<br>
priority. If you decide to make an attempt to generalize/automate this<br>
idea, I would highly appreciate it if you could let me know about this to<br>
avoid possible duplication of efforts.</p>

</ol>
<p>I cannot be certain, but it appears that a pattern similar to the one that<br>
you suggest was used in published work by those whom I would consider to be<br>
well-versed in the functionality of transfer (e.g. see the code associated<br>
with [1]). Thus, it is likely that the problem does not have a generic<br>
solution. However, I would be happy to be wrong about this, as my own work<br>
would benefit from having such a solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context, I wonder if the types of algorithms used in the work of<br>
Peter Lammich (e.g. [2] and other related articles) would handle this<br>
scenario. I would certainly appreciate any comments from him.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li>Is there any way of telling the transfer package that some rules have<br>
higher priority than others?</li>
</ol>
<p>A slightly hacky way would be to simply rearrange the transfer_raw<br>
programmatically, as you need. Practically, in most circumstances, this<br>
should not be needed. One can always write lemmas [transfer_rule] =<br>
(<em>relevant rules that need to have a higher priority</em>). The duplicates will<br>
not be produced: the theorems in transfer_raw will simply be rearranged<br>
with the restated rules at the top of the list.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yours doesn't look right. The relators coming out of the BNF package are all defined via <br>
the product, namely find a value z over pairs whose projections are the original two <br>
values x and y to be related such that the elements in z are contained in the relation r. <br>
While these definitions are canonical, they are hardly intuitive for custom type <br>
constructors and usually unwieldy to work with. For probability spaces, this product is <br>
commonly called a probabilistic coupling and I believe this would also be the right <br>
relator definition for general measures.</p>
<p>For rel_pmf, you find the characterization theorem in the AFP in <br>
MFMC_Countable.Rel_PMF_Characterization. Essentially, it says that rel_pmf R p q iff <br>
measure p A &lt;= measure q (R `` A) for all A. I'm pretty sure that such a characterization <br>
can be generalized to arbitrary measures. Strassen has proven a number of theorems in that <br>
direction (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2238148">https://www.jstor.org/stable/2238148</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a related note: suppose I defined my simple relator and then later on<br>
someone else defines another relator for measures. Would the rules then<br>
clash? Would one have to remove all the rules for my relator for things<br>
to still work smoothly?</p>
<p>You'd get a clash for some things. In general, you want to register a few theorems for a <br>
relator (e.g., [relator_eq], [relator_mono], [quot_map]) and some of these attributes <br>
allow only one theorem per type constructor. So you can't register theorems for both <br>
relators. The plain transfer machinery can cope with several relators for the same type <br>
constructor (except for the function type) and I've used that occasionally. However, you <br>
have to be very careful to not end up with an exponentially large search space for transfer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Is there any trick for proving transfer rules for constants defined<br>
by "inductive" or "fun" that I am unaware of? Doing the induction proofs<br>
manually is very tedious.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have looked into this previously. For inductive, I had a few ideas but eventually <br>
realized that it doesn't play well together with the current architecture of transfer. The <br>
problem is that like for the predicate compiler, an inductive definition may have <br>
different computational interpretations (modes in logic programming speak) and those <br>
interpretations lead to different relators in the resulting transfer rule (predicates vs. <br>
sets). While it's possible to convert between predicates and sets, this requires <br>
additional assumptions about the relations (typically bi_totality). However, as transfer <br>
does not really support multiple relators for the same type constructor, such a solution <br>
would be problematic. Moreover, there may be exponentially many transfer rules for an <br>
inductive predicate, in particular if you do a higher-order mode analysis similar to <br>
Lukas' work for the predicate compiler, so we'd end up creating an exponential number of <br>
transfer rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>The constant "has_derivative" is not parametric (I think) because<br>
e.g. for "(f has_derivative D) at_top" you get "Lim (λx. x)", which<br>
equal to "THE x. False". However, in practice, F is always of the form<br>
"at x within A" and then has_derivative is parametric. But if I prove<br>
the transfer rule</p>
<p>(r ===&gt; r) ===&gt; (r ===&gt; r) ===&gt; r ===&gt; rel_set r ===&gt; (=))<br>
 (λf D x A. (f has_derivative D) (at x within A))<br>
 (λf D x A. (f has_derivative D) (at x within A))</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>for some suitable relator r, it does not get used. The transfer package<br>
insists on a relator for "has_derivative". Of course, if I do an<br>
auxiliary definition for this and fold it before applying transfer, it<br>
works, but then I have a useless auxiliary function cluttering the<br>
namespace.</p>
<p>The transfer package's algorithm assumes that the transferred term preserves function <br>
applications and abstractions, i.e., those are always transferred with rel_funI and <br>
rel_funD. Therefore, you cannot have a compound term on the left-hand side of a transfer <br>
rule; it will virtually never trigger. (The exception is if you have a constant on the <br>
right-hand side and use the untransferred attribute.) So your only chance here is to <br>
introduce an auxiliary constant and fold the definition before applying transfer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are other algorithms that one could use to support such compound terms. For example, <br>
Peter Lammich's Autoref tool supports compound terms in transfer rules, but that's not <br>
integrated with transfer.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>In measure theory, there is the definition</p>
<p>nn_integral :: 'a measure ⇒ ('a ⇒ ennreal) ⇒ ennreal<br>
 nn_integral M f =<br>
   Sup (simple_integral M `<br>
   {g. simple_function M g ∧ g ≤ f})</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I was able to prove</p>
<p>lemma transfer_nn_integral [transfer_rule]:<br>
   assumes [transfer_rule]: "bi_unique r"<br>
   shows "(rel_measure r ===&gt; (r ===&gt; (=)) ===&gt; (=))<br>
          nn_integral nn_integral"</p>
<p>but I needed some trickery to avoid "bi_total r" due to the use of<br>
"Collect". The reason why it works is that "simple_integral" only<br>
evaluates the function on values from "space M", so we can replace the<br>
set in question by</p>
<p>{g. simple_function M g ∧ (∀x. x ∉ space M ⟶ f x = 0) ∧<br>
       ∀x∈space M. g x ≤ f x}</p>
<p>which can be shown (with quite a bit of pain!) to be parametric.</p>
<p>Is there some trick to make any of this easier?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think so. These complications are very typical of proving transfer rules. More <br>
precisely, they just show how many shortcuts we're taking in our definitions in HOL <br>
because HOL is a logic of total functions. In ordinary mathematics, we'd say that <code>f</code> and <br>
<code>g</code> are only defined on <code>space M</code>. So the universal quantifier that's implicit in the <br>
original definition's <code>g &lt;= f</code> would range only over <code>space M</code> anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li>Is there any way of telling the transfer package that some rules have<br>
higher priority than others?</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally something that I can answer positively. "transfer" uses the [transfer_rule]s in <br>
inverse order, i.e., theorems that are declared as [transfer_rule] later have higher priority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
Andreas</p>

Dear All,</p>
<p>I would like to thank Andreas Lochbihler for providing a more elaborate<br>
answer in the following post:<br>

I believe that there is one notable difference in our answers. More<br>
specifically, the answer that was given by Andreas Lochbihler to question 5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there any trick for proving transfer rules for constants defined<br>

<p>I have looked into this previously. For inductive, I had a few ideas but<br>
eventually<br>
realized that it doesn't play well together with the current architecture<br>
of transfer. The<br>
problem is that like for the predicate compiler, an inductive definition<br>
may have<br>
different computational interpretations (modes in logic programming speak)<br>
and those<br>
interpretations lead to different relators in the resulting transfer rule<br>
(predicates vs.<br>
sets). While it's possible to convert between predicates and sets, this<br>
requires<br>
additional assumptions about the relations (typically bi_totality).<br>
However, as transfer<br>
does not really support multiple relators for the same type constructor,<br>
such a solution<br>
would be problematic. Moreover, there may be exponentially many transfer<br>
rules for an<br>
inductive predicate, in particular if you do a higher-order mode analysis<br>
similar to<br>
Lukas' work for the predicate compiler, so we'd end up creating an<br>
exponential number of<br>
transfer rules.</p>

using the collection of theorems associated with nitpick. Providing further<br>

idea, I would highly appreciate it if you could let me know about this to<br>
avoid possible duplication of efforts.</p>
<p>I would like to make an attempt to resolve any confusion that this<br>
discrepancy may have caused. The scope of my answer was significantly more<br>
narrow. More specifically, my answer assumes that, given a constant c<br>
(defined as an inductive predicate), there is a term t (normally, also<br>
defined with the help of an inductive predicate), a parametricity relation<br>
R for the type of c, constructed under the assumption that the relators for<br>
every non-nullary type constructor are known in advance and some side<br>
conditions on the involved relations, also known in advance. Then, if the<br>
transfer rule R t c exists under the aforementioned side conditions, then<br>
its proof can often be automated using the transfer prover, assuming the<br>
existence of the transfer rules for the constant lfp under compatible side<br>
conditions, as showcased in<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-January/msg00072.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-January/msg00072.html</a>.<br>
The transfer rules for the lfp can often cover a significant number of<br>
similar applications, possibly allowing for some degree of proof<br>
automation. However, of course, as can be inferred from the answer given by<br>
Andreas Lochbihler, it is hardly a fundamental solution. After all, the OP<br>
asked for a 'trick' that could help to reduce the size of the proof, and I<br>
tried to oblige by providing a trick :-).</p>

<p>In this case, "r1 a b" and "r2 c d" are treated as side conditions, and<br>
the transfer infrastructure has some limited support for such<br>
unconventional side conditions (however, I am not certain as to what is the<br>
extent of such support).</p>
<p>If it is more convenient to prove a transfer rule in the form that you<br>

conversion, e.g.</p>
<p>lemma<br>

<li>In measure theory, there is the definition<br>
  nn_integral :: 'a measure ⇒ ('a ⇒ ennreal) ⇒ ennreal<br>

evaluates the function on values from "space M", so we can replace the<br>

  {g. simple_function M g ∧ (∀x. x ∉ space M ⟶ f x = 0) ∧<br>

<p>I cannot be certain, but it appears that a pattern similar to the one that<br>
you suggest was used in published work by those whom I would consider to be<br>
well-versed in the functionality of transfer (e.g. see the code associated<br>
with [1]). Thus, it is likely that the problem does not have a generic<br>
solution. However, I would be happy to be wrong about this, as my own work<br>
would benefit from having such a solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context, I wonder if the types of algorithms used in the work of<br>
Peter Lammich (e.g. [2] and other related articles) would handle this<br>
scenario. I would certainly appreciate any comments from him.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li>Is there any way of telling the transfer package that some rules have<br>
higher priority than others?</li>
</ol>
<p>A slightly hacky way would be to simply rearrange the transfer_raw<br>
programmatically, as you need. Practically, in most circumstances, this<br>
should not be needed. One can always write lemmas [transfer_rule] =<br>
(<em>relevant rules that need to have a higher priority</em>). The duplicates will<br>
not be produced: the theorems in transfer_raw will simply be rearranged<br>
with the restated rules at the top of the list.</p>
