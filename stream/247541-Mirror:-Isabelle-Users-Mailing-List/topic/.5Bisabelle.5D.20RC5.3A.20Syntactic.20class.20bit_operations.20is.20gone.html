Hi List.</p>
<p>In 2020, there used to be a purely syntactic class for bitwise<br>
operations: </p>
<p>HOL/Word/Bits.bit_operations</p>
<p>This class is gone in RC5, and the closest match seems to be the class<br>
semiring_bit_operations in Library/Bit_Operations.thy, but this has<br>
axioms.</p>
<p>This new class binds the infix syntax for (AND), (OR), (XOR) to these<br>
axioms.</p>
<p>I thought it would be standard to define syntactic type classes for<br>
infix syntax first, and then add the axioms.</p>
<p>In my application, I cannot use the semiring_bit_operations class, as I<br>
cannot define a mask function. However, I'd like to use the convenient<br>
syntax, which is now somewhat blocked.</p>

<p>No.  In ancient times this was the only possibility, and hence there are<br>
many syntactic type classes in HOL like plus, minus, times etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes they are necessary to accomplish a particular hierarchy, AFAIR<br>
for gcd, lcm etc.</p>
<p>Syntax type classes typically forces many manual type constraints.  You<br>
can see the traces e.g. in the upcoming AFP, entry Word_Lib, theory<br>
Word_Syntax.thy</p>

<p>My llvm formalization uses words of variable but fixed bit-length.<br>
I have the operation width :: ll_word =&gt; nat, that gives the width, and<br>
operations are only defined between words of the same width ... but<br>
this is deeply embedded, rather than shallowly in the type system, such<br>
that I can store those words in my deeply embedded LLVM value model.</p>
<p>I had instantiated all the syntactic word classes, but now, I cannot<br>
define mask :: nat =&gt; ll_word, as it would have to 'guess' a width.<br>
Also, I doubt that the axioms hold unconditionally.</p>

<p>That's a different story.  I definitely don't argue to eliminate the<br>
traditional syntactic type classes from HOL.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Note that mask is logically a plain definition in this type class (see<br>
the Guide.thy in AFP session Word_Lib for the rationale behind).  So, it<br>
might be sufficient for a formal definition without a semantic<br>
meaningful content.</p>
<p>But the main issue seems to me indeed the quasi-partiality of AND OR<br>
XOR.  I don't see a way to make this compatible to the class specification.</p>
<p>So, the bundle seems the way to go for now.  Since there is some<br>
rationale to put the most important bit operations into HOL-Main, I once<br>
thought to organize all infix syntax on bits in bundles anyway, to not<br>
clutter the syntactic space of HOL-Main.  If this is once accomplished<br>
after the release, the infix syntax is completely free.</p>

<p>I don't see that point.  The syntax woule be totally organized in<br>

<p>Ok, now I understand that these operations are inherently partial and<br>
hence there are no unguarded properties.</p>
<p>In the current state of affairs most lemmas</p>
<p>"… AND … OR … XOR … = …"</p>
<p>are valid <em>without</em> any type annotation due to the algebraic foundation<br>
of the underlying type class.  This should eliminate the felt need for<br>
yet another infix syntax for word types only as seen in<br>
Word_Lib/Word_Syntax.thy (which, by the way, is not found in typical<br>
programming languages).  Hence I want to maintain that.</p>
<p>A compromise could be to have a syntactic class but by default a<br>
stronger constraint.  I will investigate that in the future.</p>
