<p>From: Lukas Stevens &lt;lukas.stevens+isabelle-users@in.tum.de&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>when using records a common theme is to just update some fields of a <br>
record and leave the others at is. To this end, many functional <br>
languages have a record update syntax, e.g. in OCaml you can write {bar <br>
with x = 1} to obtain a new record that has all the same values as bar <br>
except for x. As far as I can see, Isabelle/ML currently has no such <br>
syntax which can lead to quite a bit of bloat. For a pathological <br>
example, see src/Provers/order.ML where multiple functions are declared <br>
that each just update one field of the record, but you still have to <br>
explicitly provide all the other fields. It would be nice to have this <br>
build into the language. An even more flexible solution would be to <br>
implement this as an ML antiquotation; however, this requires the <br>
ability to introspect the type of a record to obtain a list of all the <br>
record members. I am not sure if this is currently (or at all) possible.</p>
<p>Is there any interest in having such a language construct?</p>
<p>Lukas</p>

<p>From: Lukas Stevens &lt;lukas.stevens+isabelle-users@in.tum.de&gt;<br>
Thanks for the answer and the additional practical hints.</p>
<p>Of course, the example is, as I said, pathological but you will find<br>
clumsy usage of records in other places as well.</p>
<p>I agree with you that introducing a new language feature would not be a<br>
good idea. Lenses would probably be a nice and flexible solution. The<br>
problem with those is that you have to write quite a bit of boilerplate<br>
if you can't generate them automatically. To generate them<br>
automatically, one could define an ML antiquotation that reads a record<br>
type definition and defines the record type while automatically<br>
generating the code for the lens as well. Or is there a way to generate<br>
the lens for an existing record type (which would make it more flexible)?</p>

<p>What is your own application like? Is it more like the 19-tuple in<br>
src/Provers/order.ML or like the 8-tuple in src/Pure/variable.ML (or even less<br>
complex)?</p>
<p>I do see slight inconveniences in using records in SML and thus Isabelle/ML,<br>
but the overall balance is still quite good (compared to related or unrelated<br>
inconveniences in Scala, Haskell, OCaml).</p>

<p>In the meantime I have also spent more thoughts on the general problem of<br>
records in SML.</p>
<p>I don't want to see genuine language extensions: this would further weaken the<br>
language and its few implementations. SML is de-facto a dead language (like<br>
classical Latin), and hypothetical discussions and proposals like<br>
<a href="https://smlfamily.github.io/successor-ml">https://smlfamily.github.io/successor-ml</a> are not going to change that after<br>
several decades.</p>
<p>I also don't want to see fancy workarounds like in MLton<br>
<a href="http://mlton.org/FunctionalRecordUpdate">http://mlton.org/FunctionalRecordUpdate</a> --- that is a somewhat different<br>
culture from Isabelle/ML. Why make a relatively simple problem harder than it<br>
really is?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I see a prospect of future refinements of Isabelle/ML as follows:</p>
<p>* The very essence of a record in SML is the list (or set) of fields, not<br>
the concrete field types. Field names are global, without scope, but field<br>
types are determined by type-inference in a particular scope of ML text.</p>
<p>* There could be an antiquotation @{record RECORD = FIELDS ...} to define a<br>
named set of fields within the Isabelle/ML compiler context.</p>
<p>* The existing antiquotation @{apply m(n)} could be generalized to @{apply<br>
RECORD(FIELD)}.</p>
<p>* There could be a few more antiquotations, e.g. @{make RECORD} for a<br>
function that composes a record from its fields.</p>

The application is exactly src/Provers/order.ML but I'd like to refactor<br>
the interface of the prover to reduce boilerplate on the ML side of<br>
things. Reducing boilerplate when instantiating the prover would also be<br>
great. One way is, as you suggested, to just use tables instead of<br>
records. This would increase the opaqueness of the code since it hides<br>
which theorems are needed exactly. Another way would be to use the<br>
antiquotations you proposed. Especially the generalised antiquotation<br>
would be great and also make sense since records can be viewed as tuples<br>

then operates "under a morphisms" to move it from the abstract context to<br>
application contexts.</p>
<p>Then the record disappears altogether and is replaced by fancy operations on<br>
logical context elements (due to locale interpretation). An example for this<br>
approach is src/HOL/Tools/semiring_normalizer.ML but it has its own added<br>
complexity.</p>

"update"; the odd dummy_thm will disappear, it is replaced by an undefined<br>
table entry).</p>
<p>As you proceed to explore order.ML and learn idiomatic use of Isabelle/ML, you<br>
will find more and more ways to make the implementation  concise and to the point.</p>
<p>(The file name should be actually order_tac.ML in correspondence to structure<br>
Order_Tac in it.)</p>
<p>There is yet another perspective on the problem: type less_arith is like an<br>
algebraic structure with "laws" for operations (=), (&lt;=), (&lt;). This could in<br>
principle become an axiomatic specification as a locale context, and the tool<br>
then operates "under a morphisms" to move it from the abstract context to<br>
application contexts.</p>
<p>Then the record disappears altogether and is replaced by fancy operations on<br>
logical context elements (due to locale interpretation). An example for this<br>
approach is src/HOL/Tools/semiring_normalizer.ML but it has its own added<br>
complexity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another way would be to use the<br>
antiquotations you proposed. Especially the generalised antiquotation<br>
would be great and also make sense since records can be viewed as tuples<br>
with names instead of indices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now I recommend to concentrate on the core problems of the application,<br>
and ignore accidental inconveniences of records in Isabelle/ML.</p>
