<p>From: Favonia via Cl-isabelle-users &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
We are hiring a research programmer at University of Minnesota to work with<br>
us on building next-generation proof assistant technology (broadly defined)<br>
based on homotopy type theory and cubical type theory. The ideal candidate<br>
would have some knowledge and interest in homotopy and cubical type theory,<br>
combined with concrete experience implementing type theoretic proof<br>
assistants using modern algorithms, such as bidirectional type checking and<br>
normalization-by-evaluation.</p>
<p>You will be exposed to the latest research in the field and can get<br>
involved in theoretical development of the research ideas. We welcome<br>
applicants who do not have a Ph.D. degree---a BA/BS degree is sufficient.</p>
<p>The research project is funded by the AFOSR through their MURI program, and<br>
your official affiliation would be the University of Minnesota with Favonia<br>
being your supervisor. However, you will frequently meet and collaborate<br>
with other researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, Wesleyan<br>
University, University of San Diego, and other institutions. Especially<br>
during the COVID-19 pandemic, most activities will be online, though you<br>
will have to be physically in the US. (We may be able to sponsor visas.<br>
Contact Favonia &lt;<a href="mailto:kbh@umn.edu">kbh@umn.edu</a>&gt; for details.)</p>
<p>We are interviewing candidates on a rolling basis until a match is found.<br>
Candidates applying by the end of March (2021/3/31) would be given priority.</p>
<p>Here is the official link for application:<br>
<a href="https://hr.myu.umn.edu/jobs/ext/339220">https://hr.myu.umn.edu/jobs/ext/339220</a> Please also drop an email to Favonia<br>
&lt;<a href="mailto:kbh@umn.edu">kbh@umn.edu</a>&gt; so that we can confirm that your application correctly enters<br>
the system. If you are a current employee of the University of Minnesota,<br>
please use <a href="https://hr.myu.umn.edu/jobs/int/339220">https://hr.myu.umn.edu/jobs/int/339220</a> instead.</p>
<h1>Some further information</h1>
<ul>
<li>What is the annual salary?</li>
</ul>
<p>About $60,000 USD.</p>
<ul>
<li>When is the expected start date?</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as you are ready.</p>
<ul>
<li>How long does this position last?</li>
</ul>
<p>The position will last as long as the project can support it and benefit<br>
from it. However, the expectation is that you will be in this position<br>
around 1-3 years (negotiable) and may choose to leave early (for example,<br>
to start a Ph.D.). Your official contract will be one-year but renewable.</p>
<ul>
<li>I see that there’s a “work experience” requirement. What counts as “work<br>
experience”?</li>
</ul>
<p>This requirement exists to satisfy an administrative requirement of the job<br>
code at the University of Minnesota. We will recognize a wide range of<br>
activities as “work experience”, such as contributions on GitHub during<br>
weekends. <strong>Please document related activities in your CV.</strong> If you are not<br>
sure if something counts as work experience, please ask Favonia &lt;<a href="mailto:kbh@umn.edu">kbh@umn.edu</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>.</p>

<ul>
<li>I have more questions!</li>
</ul>
<p>Please send an email to Favonia &lt;<a href="mailto:kbh@umn.edu">kbh@umn.edu</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Favonia<br>
