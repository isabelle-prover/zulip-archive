<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:tals4@cam.ac.uk">tals4@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
I've been solving some word problems bitwise using the new bit_simps <br>
named<br>
theorem set.</p>
<p>It's handy that this solves the old headache of trying to remember the<br>
(eccentric) names of all the relevant theorems. I've used this in manual <br>
proofs<br>
and also gone as far as implementing a replacement for the old <br>
Word_Bitwise,<br>
avoiding bit lists and instead just rewriting with bit_simps.</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest some minor tweaks, and I'm interested in any <br>
discussion<br>
about that. I also think my additions might be worth adding to Isabelle, <br>
which<br>
perhaps might involve follow-up on the isabelle-dev list.</p>
<p>The bit_simps theorems simplify manual bitwise proofs. I'd suggest that <br>
perhaps<br>
the bitwise theorems in the old-style compatibility theories should also <br>
be<br>
added to the set, e.g. rules about test_bit and shiftl in<br>
Traditional_Infix_Syntax.</p>
<p>Some of the generic theorems in bit_simps are a bit more awkward than <br>
the<br>
word-specific theorems they replace.</p>
<p>In particular, there's a common pattern of testing whether 2 ^ n = 0 on <br>
the<br>
right hand side. I think that this should be given a name, e.g. a new <br>
constant<br>
bit_exists. Rewrites for this constant (e.g. a variant of<br>
Word.exp_eq_zero_iff) could be faster than expanding 2 ^ n to a concrete <br>
value.<br>
It would also avoid an issue in which bit_simps converts bit properties <br>
to word<br>
equalities, and thus cannot be used at the same time as handy rewrites <br>
(e.g.<br>
Word.bit_word_eqI) which rewrite word equalities to bit equalities.</p>
<p>Another minor inconvenience is that the bit_simps rewrites for shiftr1 <br>
and<br>
drop_bit might introduce impossible bit checks on the right hand side, <br>
without<br>
rechecking 2 ^ n = 0 etc. My new bitwise expansion gadget needs an extra <br>
phase<br>
to clean up impossible bit checks, for instance.</p>
<p>This alternative bitwise expansion needs far less supporting theory. <br>
Instead<br>
of list operations, a new constant called the carry value is used to <br>
capture<br>
the way carry bits ripple up through an addition. The various word <br>
inequalities<br>
can also be rewritten as functions of the carry value. The theory about<br>
carry_val runs to roughly 150 lines, and I propose adding it to Word.thy<br>
itself.</p>
<p>The new bitwise gadget runs to a few hundred lines of ML code, mostly <br>
doing<br>
special treatment of let-bindings. These are used to capture common <br>
subterms<br>
and avoid term size explosion. It turns out that avoiding duplication is <br>
a<br>
crucial design goal, one that was not understood in the previous<br>
implementation. I attach my current working version in case anyone is<br>
interested. I'm interested in whether there are any obvious obstacles to<br>
including that in Isabelle in a future version.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
     Thomas.</p>
