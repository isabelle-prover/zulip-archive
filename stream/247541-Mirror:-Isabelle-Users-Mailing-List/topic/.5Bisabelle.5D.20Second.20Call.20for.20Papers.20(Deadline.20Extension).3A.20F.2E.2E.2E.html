<p>=========================================================</p>
<p>Call for Papers: Formal Methods Teaching Workshop and Tutorial (FMTea 2021)</p>
<p>21 November 2021, <em>online</em></p>
<p>Co-located with the 24th International Symposium on Formal Methods, FM 2021</p>
<p>FMTea21 is a one-day combined workshop and tutorial that brings together<br>
researchers and educators working on formal methods to share their<br>
experiences<br>
in teaching formal methods, discuss key challenges, and stimulate<br>
collaboration<br>
that can lead to ways to reboot the presence of formal methods in curricula.</p>
<p>FMTea21 will be an online event at the 24th International Symposium on<br>
Formal<br>
Methods, FM2021. More details can be found on the workshop website:</p>

</ul>
<p>Objectives and Scope<br>
========================</p>
<p>Formal Methods provide software engineering with tools and techniques for<br>
rigorously reasoning about the correctness of systems. While in recent years<br>
formal methods are increasingly being used in industry, university<br>
curricula are<br>
not adapting at the same pace. Some existing formal methods classes<br>
interest and<br>
challenge students, whereas others fail to ignite student motivation. It is<br>
thus<br>
important to develop, share, and discuss approaches to effectively teach<br>
formal<br>
methods to the next generations. This discussion is now more important than<br>
ever<br>
due to the challenges and opportunities that arose from the pandemic, which<br>
forced many educators to adapt and deliver their teaching online. Exchange<br>
of<br>
ideas is critical to making these new online approaches a success and<br>
having a<br>
greater reach.</p>
<p>Topics<br>
========================</p>
<p>In the workshop part of the event, we welcome papers detailing experiences<br>
with<br>
FM Teaching, including papers discussing successes and failures of various<br>
methods, case studies, tools, etc. Given the increasing importance of online<br>
teaching and self-learning, we also welcome reports of experiences with<br>
online<br>
teaching, including experiences with teaching formal methods via MOOCs. We<br>
invite novel papers that cover, but are not limited to, the following<br>
aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experiences and proposals related with "traditional" FM learning and<br>
teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiences and proposals related with online FM learning and teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrating/embedding FM teaching/thinking within other computer science<br>
courses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching FM for industry</p>
</li>
<li>Innovative learning and teaching methods for FM</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission Details<br>
========================</p>
<p>FMTea21 invites high quality papers reporting on opinions, approaches, and<br>
experiences related to the topic of teaching Formal Methods. Each submitted<br>
paper will be reviewed by at least three PC members. As in previous events,<br>
the<br>
conference proceedings will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in<br>
Computer<br>
Science series. All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not<br>
submitted<br>
for publication elsewhere. Submissions must be in PDF format, using the<br>
Springer<br>
LNCS style files. Papers should not exceed 15 pages in length. Submissions<br>
should be made using the FMTea21 Easychair web site:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmtea21">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmtea21</a></p>
<p>All accepted papers must be remotely presented at the workshop. Authors<br>
must be<br>
prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one author of each<br>
accepted paper must register to the conference by an early date, to be<br>
indicated<br>
by the FM2021 organizers, and present the paper.</p>
<p>Organization<br>
========================</p>
<p>FMTea21 is organized by FME’s Teaching Committee, whose broad aim is to<br>
support<br>
a worldwide improvement in learning Formal Methods, mainly by teaching but<br>
also<br>
via self-learning. To that end, the committee manages a list of FM courses<br>
taught worldwide (<a href="https://fme-teaching.github.io">https://fme-teaching.github.io</a>) and plans to collect other<br>
resources as well, such as FM case studies, FM inspirational papers, etc.</p>
