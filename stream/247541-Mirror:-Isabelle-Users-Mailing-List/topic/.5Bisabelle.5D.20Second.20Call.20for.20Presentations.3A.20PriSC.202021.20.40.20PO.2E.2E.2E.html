<p>================================================<br>
Call for Presentations: PriSC 2021 @ POPL 2021<br>
================================================</p>
<p>The emerging field of secure compilation aims to preserve security<br>
properties of programs when they have been compiled to low-level<br>
languages such as assembly, where high-level abstractions don’t exist,<br>
and unsafe, unexpected interactions with libraries, other programs,<br>
the operating system and even the hardware are possible. For unsafe<br>
source languages like C, secure compilation requires careful handling<br>
of undefined source-language behavior (like buffer overflows and<br>
double frees). Formally, secure compilation aims to protect high-level<br>
language abstractions in compiled code, even against adversarial<br>
low-level contexts, thus enabling sound reasoning about security in<br>
the source language. A complementary goal is to keep the compiled code<br>
efficient, often leveraging new hardware security features and<br>
advances in compiler design. Other necessary components are<br>
identifying and formalizing properties that secure compilers must<br>
possess, devising efficient security mechanisms (both software and<br>
hardware), and developing effective verification and proof techniques.<br>
Research in the field thus puts together advances in compiler design,<br>
programming languages, systems security, verification, and computer<br>
architecture.</p>
<p>5th Workshop on Principles of Secure Compilation (PriSC 2021)<br>
=============================================================</p>
<p>The Workshop on Principles of Secure Compilation (PriSC) is a<br>
relatively new, informal 1-day workshop without any proceedings. The<br>
goal is to bring together researchers interested in secure compilation<br>
and to identify interesting research directions and open challenges.<br>
The 5th edition of PriSC will be held on January 17 online,<br>
together with the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of<br>
Programming Languages (POPL), 2021.</p>
<p>Important Dates<br>
===============</p>
<ul>
<li>Fri 30 Oct 2020: Submission deadline</li>
<li>Wed 25 Nov 2020: Notification</li>
<li>Sun 17 Jan 2021: Workshop</li>
</ul>
<p>Presentation Proposals and Attending the Workshop<br>
=================================================</p>
<p>Anyone interested in presenting at the workshop should submit an<br>
extended abstract (up to 2 pages, details below) covering past,<br>
ongoing, or future work. Any topic that could be of interest to secure<br>
compilation is in scope. Secure compilation should be interpreted very<br>
broadly to include any work in security, programming languages,<br>
architecture, systems or their combination that can be leveraged to<br>
preserve security properties of programs when they are compiled or to<br>
eliminate low-level vulnerabilities.  Presentations that provide a<br>
useful outside view or challenge the community are also welcome. This<br>
includes presentations on new attack vectors such as<br>
microarchitectural side-channels, whose defenses could benefit from<br>
compiler techniques.</p>
<p>Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attacker models for secure compiler chains.</li>
<li>
<p>Secure compiler properties: fully abstract compilation and similar<br>
properties, memory safety, control-flow integrity, preservation of<br>
safety, information flow and other (hyper-)properties against<br>
adversarial contexts, secure multi-language interoperability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure interaction between different programming languages: foreign<br>
function interfaces, gradual types, securely combining different<br>
memory management strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforcement mechanisms and low-level security primitives: static<br>
checking, program verification, typed assembly languages, reference<br>
monitoring, program rewriting, software-based isolation/hiding<br>
techniques (SFI, crypto-based, randomization-based,<br>
OS/hypervisor-based), security-oriented architectural features such as<br>
Intel’s SGX, MPX and MPK, capability machines, side-channel defenses,<br>
object capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental evaluation and applications of secure compilers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof methods relevant to compilation: (bi)simulation, logical<br>
relations, game semantics, trace semantics, multi-language semantics,<br>
embedded interpreters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal verification of secure compilation chains (protection<br>
mechanisms, compilers, linkers, loaders), machine-checked proofs,<br>
translation validation, property-based testing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Guidelines for Submitting Extended Abstracts<br>
============================================</p>
<p>Extended abstracts should be submitted in PDF format and not exceed 2<br>
pages (references not including). They should be formatted in<br>
two-column layout, 10pt font, and be printable on A4 and US Letter<br>
sized paper. We recommend using the new acmart LaTeX style in sigplan<br>
mode.</p>
<p>Submissions are not anonymous and should provide sufficient detail to<br>
be assessed by the program committee. Presentation at the workshop<br>
does not preclude publication elsewhere.</p>
