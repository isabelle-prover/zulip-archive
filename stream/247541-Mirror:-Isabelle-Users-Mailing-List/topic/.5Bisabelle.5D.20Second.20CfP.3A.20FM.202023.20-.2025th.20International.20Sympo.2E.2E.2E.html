<p>Call for Papers<br>
FM 2023: 25th International Symposium on Formal Methods</p>
<p>Lübeck, Germany, March 6-10, 2023<br>
<a href="https://fm2023.isp.uni-luebeck.de/">https://fm2023.isp.uni-luebeck.de/</a> &lt;<a href="https://fm2023.isp.uni-luebeck.de/">https://fm2023.isp.uni-luebeck.de/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>==================================================</p>
<p>FM 2023 is the 25th international symposium in a series organised by<br>
Formal Methods Europe (FME), an independent association whose aim is to<br>
stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for software<br>
development. The FM symposia have been successful in bringing together<br>
researchers and industrial users around a programme of original papers<br>
on research and industrial experience, workshops, tutorials, reports on<br>
tools, projects, and ongoing doctoral research. FM 2023 will be both an<br>
occasion to celebrate and a platform for enthusiastic researchers and<br>
practitioners from a diversity of backgrounds to exchange their ideas<br>
and share their experiences.</p>

Conference:              March 6-10, 2023</p>
<p>=Topics of Interest=</p>
<p>FM 2023 will highlight the development and application of formal methods<br>
in a wide range of domains including trustworthy AI, software,<br>
computer-based systems, systems-of-systems, cyber-physical systems,<br>
security, human-computer interaction, manufacturing, sustainability,<br>
energy, transport, smart cities, healthcare and biology. We particularly<br>
welcome papers on techniques, tools and experiences in interdisciplinary<br>
settings. We also welcome papers on experiences of applying formal methods <br>
in industrial settings, and on the design and validation of formal method <br>
tools.</p>
<p>The topics of interest for FM 2023 include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary formal methods: Techniques, tools and experiences<br>
demonstrating the use of formal methods in interdisciplinary settings.<br>
Formal methods in practice: Industrial applications of formal methods,<br>
experience with formal methods in industry, tool usage reports,<br>
experiments with challenge problems. The authors are encouraged to<br>
explain how formal methods overcame problems, led to improved designs,<br>
or provided new insights.</p>
<p>Tools for formal methods: Advances in automated verification, model<br>
checking, and testing with formal methods, tools integration,<br>
environments for formal methods, and experimental validation of tools.<br>
The authors are encouraged to demonstrate empirically that the new tool<br>
or environment advances the state of the art.</p>
<p>Formal methods in software and systems engineering: Development<br>
processes with formal methods, usage guidelines for formal methods, and<br>
method integration. The authors are encouraged to evaluate process<br>
innovations with respect to qualitative or quantitative improvements.<br>
Empirical studies and evaluations are also solicited.</p>
<p>Theoretical foundations of formal methods: All aspects of theory related<br>
to specification, verification, refinement, and static and dynamic<br>
analysis. The authors are encouraged to explain how their results<br>
contribute to the solution of practical problems with formal methods or<br>
tools.</p>
<p>We explicitly welcome submissions to the special FM 2023 session on <br>
"Formal methods meets AI", which is focused on formal and rigorous <br>
modelling and analysis techniques to ensuring safety, robustness etc. <br>
(trustworthiness) of AI-based systems.</p>
<p>=Submission Guidelines=</p>
<p>Papers should be original work, not published or submitted elsewhere, in<br>
Springer LNCS format, written in English, submitted through EasyChair:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2023</a> &lt;<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2023</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Each paper will be evaluated by at least three PC members. Authors of <br>
papers reporting experimental work are strongly encouraged to make their <br>
experimental results available for use by the reviewers. Case study papers <br>
should describe significant case studies, and the complete development <br>
should be made available at the time of review. The usual criteria for <br>
novelty, reproducibility, correctness and the ability for others to build <br>
upon the described work apply. Tool papers and tool demonstration papers <br>
should explain enhancements made compared to previously published work. <br>
A tool demonstration paper need not present the theory behind the tool, <br>
but can focus on the tool’s features, how it is used, its evaluation, and<br>
examples and screenshots illustrating the tool’s use. Authors of tool<br>
and tool demonstration papers should make their tool available for use<br>
by the reviewers and are highly encouraged to participate in the artefact<br>
evaluation once their paper is accepted.</p>
<p>We solicit various categories of papers:</p>
<p>Regular Papers (max 15 pages)<br>
Long tool papers (max 15 pages)<br>
Case study papers (max 15 pages)<br>
Short papers (max 6 pages), including tool demonstration papers.</p>
<p>Short papers present novel ideas (e.g., without an extensive experimental <br>
evaluation) or results that can well be presented in 6 pages. Short papers <br>
will be given short presentation slots at the conference.</p>
<p>All page limits do <em>not</em> include references and appendices.</p>
<p>For all papers, an appendix can provide additional material such as<br>
details on proofs or experiments. The appendix is not part of the page<br>
count and is not guaranteed to be read or taken into account by the<br>
reviewers. Thus, it should not contain information necessary for the<br>
understanding and the evaluation of the presented work. Papers will be<br>
accepted or rejected in the category in which they were submitted and<br>
will not be moved between categories.</p>
<p>At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the<br>
paper at the conference as a registered participant.</p>
<p>=Double Blind Review Process=</p>
<p>FM 2023 will employ a double-blind review process except for (a) long <br>
tool papers and (b) short tool demonstration papers. Other short papers <br>
will be subject to a double-blind policy.</p>
<p>The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:<br>
(a) Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body <br>
of their submission.<br>
(b) Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves <br>
is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed <br>
to “our prior work”.<br>
(c) Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, <br>
datasets).<br>
(e) You are encouraged to submit a link to a Web site or repository <br>
containing supplementary material (raw data, datasets, experiments, etc.), <br>
as long as it is blinded. The visit of such sites should not be needed <br>
to conduct the review. The PC will not necessarily consider it in the <br>
paper review process. For more information, please read </p>
<p>How to disclose data for double-blind review and make it archived open data upon acceptance &lt;<a href="https://ineed.coffee/post/how-to-disclose-data-for-double-blind-review-and-make-it-archived-open-data-upon-acceptance">https://ineed.coffee/post/how-to-disclose-data-for-double-blind-review-and-make-it-archived-open-data-upon-acceptance</a>&gt;. </p>
<p>As an alternative to having an external link, the submission form provides <br>
an option to attach a replication package.<br>
(f) Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead <br>
provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to <br>
understand the context of the paper.<br>
(g) Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the <br>
origin of their work.</p>
<p>The double-blind process is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be <br>
maintained during the reviewers’ discussion period. Authors with further <br>
questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC <br>
chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-blind review <br>
process will be desk-rejected.</p>
<p>To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions <br>
with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double <br>
submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, <br>
not to unrefereed forums (e.g. <a href="http://arXiv.org">arXiv.org</a> &lt;<a href="http://arxiv.org/">http://arxiv.org/</a>&gt;). To check for plagiarism issues, <br>
the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.</p>
<p>To facilitate double-blind reviewing, we advise the authors to postpone <br>
publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the <br>
notification of acceptance. However, if the authors have already published <br>
a version of their paper to arXiv or similar sites, we request authors to <br>
use a different title for their submission, so that author names are not <br>
inadvertently disclosed, e.g., via a notification on Google Scholar.</p>
<p>=Best Paper Award=</p>
<p>At the conference, the PC Chairs will present an award to the authors of<br>
the submission selected as the FM 2023 Best Paper.</p>
<p>=Publication=</p>
<p>Accepted papers will be published in the Symposium Proceedings to appear<br>
in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Extended versions of selected <br>
papers will be invited for publication in a special issue of a journal.</p>
