Dear all,</p>
<p>I am currently formalizing the base logic of the Iris separation logic <br>
framework in Isabelle and found that some theoretic constructs can be <br>
expressed quite well as semantic subtypes (mostly some specialized <br>
function types). After reading about how to work with subtypes, quotient <br>
types and the lifting/transfer packages as well as experimenting with a <br>
few simple logical extensions to the base logic I am a bit unsure, <br>
whether it would be easier to express the subtype semantics as simple <br>
predicates over the raw type.</p>
<p>My use cases for subtpyes are on the one hand for defining the assertion <br>
language and on the other hand for the underlying generic structure (so <br>
called cameras).<br>
I found that subtypes and lifting seem to be a rather standard technique <br>
for formalizing assertions (e.g. the separation logic of Imperativ HOL <br>
uses them). Yet, this approach requires to also lift many lemmas <br>
necessary for a good automation. This might be even worse than for <br>
Imperative HOL as the Iris assertions contain more custom connectives. <br>
The subtype in question can be found at [1] and a "paper formalization" <br>
of the assertion language can be found at [2] in section 5.<br>
The other use case might be similar to some mathematical constructions. <br>
I defined the camera structure as a type class which requires functions <br>
that are of a specific subtype, see [3]. In this case, the lifting and <br>
lowering seems to only decrease the readability without providing better <br>
usability.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear some opinions on whether these use cases make sense for <br>
semantic subtypes with lifting or whether the necessary overhead could <br>
be too much in the long run. On a related note, what are the experiences <br>
of others with semantic subtpyes and are there any good rules of thumb <br>
for when to use them?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance and sorry for the horrific WIP proofs in other <br>
parts of the work.<br>

<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:lammich@in.tum.de">lammich@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Florian,</p>
<p>I agree with your observation that, when using subtypes, a lot of<br>
boilerplate can be generated by having to transfer all necessary<br>
concepts from the base-type. There are two exterme approaches here<br>
(that, of course, can be combined):</p>
<p>1) try to be minimalistic, only lift/transfer the very basic facts, and<br>
prove everything else without breaking the subtype barrier again.</p>
<p>2) prove everything on the rep-type, and then lift/transfer everything.</p>
<p>while 1 definitely causes less boilerplate, setting up automation when<br>
the automation for the rep-type is already well established (like for<br>
sets) can be a pain. On the other hand, for things like separation<br>
logic, there usually is a not-too-big set of basic rules, from which<br>
you can derive the others. This can even be done generically, using<br>
type-classes like in <br>
<a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Separation_Algebra.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Separation_Algebra.html</a> (and a few<br>
extensions of that here: <br>
<a href="https://www21.in.tum.de/~lammich/isabelle_llvm/Isabelle_LLVM/Sep_Algebra_Add.html">https://www21.in.tum.de/~lammich/isabelle_llvm/Isabelle_LLVM/Sep_Algebra_Add.html</a><br>
)</p>
<p>Moreover, 1) has the advantage that one gains a better understanding of<br>
the logic one is formalizing, basically finding a minimal (small)<br>
complete set of rules, rather than producing ad-hoc rules from the<br>
underlying rep-type.</p>
<p>Finally, considering the alternative of not using subtypes at all, but<br>
keeping the invariants in predicates: while this may seem to be easier<br>
for proving/developing in an early stage, as it reduces lift/transfer<br>
boilerplate in particular at an early stage of the development,<br>
rules with explicit invariants are much harder to use. So you are<br>
pushing technical debt to later stages of the development, when you<br>
start to use your own rules more frequently.</p>
<p>Thus, while an explicit invariant approach might be the way to get<br>
started quickly and with less overhead (which gives you more<br>
flexibility to play around and try things), at some point you want to<br>
transition to subtypes (ideally when you have your small complete set<br>
of rules). Of course, you can lift/transfer the concepts at this stage<br>
at only boilerplate cost, keeping the initial development intact.</p>
