<p>From: Mikhail Chekhov &lt;<a href="mailto:mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com">mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>I have several questions about the availability of certain types of proof<br>
methods for Isabelle (I guess, these questions can also be seen as<br>
reference requests).</p>
<p>I am working on a certain applied formalization study. This work is carried<br>
out in the object logic ZFC in HOL. The type of reasoning that it requires<br>
is very similar to the type of reasoning that is used in HOL-Algebra. When<br>
I started my work on this project, I relied, primarily, on the tools that<br>
combine classical reasoning with simplification, such as <em>auto</em>. However, I<br>
found myself struggling more and more in my attempts to provide appropriate<br>
sets of simp/intro/dest/elim rules that would not cause significant delays<br>
and loops when solving typical set-based goals. Besides, my proof code<br>
seemed to be unnecessarily verbose. However, please do not view this as a<br>
criticism of the aforementioned proof tools: I can hardly claim to have an<br>
extensive knowledge of the analytical properties of the involved algorithms.</p>
<hr>
<p>Problem 1</p>
<p>From the manual of the simplifier: "conditions in conditional rewrite rules<br>
are solved recursively before the rewrite rule is applied". Empirically, I<br>
have established that it could be useful to be able to treat rewriting in<br>
the same manner as intro-resolution, allowing the side conditions of the<br>
rewrite rules to be resolved both using rewriting or intro-resolution after<br>
the application of the rewrite rule to a given goal (of course, this is<br>
also meant to be done recursively). I devised a prototype method based on<br>
this algorithm (CS in<br>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/user9716869/Isabelle-Complement-Library">https://gitlab.com/user9716869/Isabelle-Complement-Library</a>). For my own<br>
needs, practically, I found this type of 'coupling' of rewriting and<br>
intro-resolution to be exceptionally capable at solving complex goals in<br>
comparison with some of the existing tools that seem to combine<br>
simplification and classical reasoning that I tried before (by now, for my<br>
own needs, I rely on the methods provided by CS almost exclusively in a<br>
reasonably sizeable development).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my formal background in the area of the algorithms that are<br>
used in the common proof tools is, somewhat, limited (I have always been<br>
far more interested in the applications of the proof assistants to the<br>
development of formally verified software and applied formalization of<br>
mathematics, rather than the technology behind them). Thus, I have little<br>
doubt that I have reinvented the wheel. My primary question is whether any<br>
of the existing proof tools already provide access to the algorithm that I<br>
have described.</p>
<hr>
<p>Problem 2</p>
<p>I would like to know if there exist any reasonably generic proof tools for<br>
Isabelle that would take into account associativity implicitly. Somehow,<br>
when performing rewriting, I would like to be able to treat ((ab)c)d,<br>
(ab)(cd), ... as members of the same equivalence class with respect to the<br>
relation induced by the associativity. Therefore, if there is an additional<br>
rewrite rule b(cd)=e (again, treated with respect to the same equivalence<br>
relation), it would be immediately applicable to any form of abcd,<br>
immediately yielding ae. Intuitively, it seems that this strategy could<br>
work rather well for the types of problems that I am facing regularly, and<br>
I am considering implementing it within the scope of the aforementioned<br>
proof tools. However, I am slightly concerned about whether there already<br>
exist canonical implementations or better alternative solutions (please<br>
note, however, that my setting is, effectively, a partial semigroup).</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
Mikhail Chekhov</p>

Dear Mikhail, this sounds intriguing, though intro-resolution and conditional rewriting will behave similarly in many cases. Do you have simple examples to demonstrate where intro-rewriting works better? I imagine they may involve variable instantiation (i.e. P(x) ==&gt; l=r, where x is not mentioned in l).</p>

Dear Lawrence Paulson,</p>

<p>Would it possible to suggest a reference that explains this in more detail?<br>
I have a certain degree of familiarity with the conventional theory of<br>
abstract/term rewriting, but I am not certain how would one go about<br>
establishing analytical properties of a set of intro+simp rules for a<br>
method like auto.</p>

<p>Effectively, you have already proposed one such example. An expanded<br>
variant stated in Isabelle/HOL can be found in Appendix A after my<br>
signature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, I use this type of pattern quite frequently in my work. For<br>
example, I have introduced predicates that indicate that a given entity is<br>
a function from a to b. Also, similar predicates exist for<br>
injective/surjective/bijective functions and, even more generally, for<br>
various specific arrows in arbitrary categories. Practically, I found it<br>
unwieldy to use different predicates to distinguish the arrows with a<br>
specified domain or codomain only, or stating their domain/codomain<br>
explicitly in the statements of theorems, or using additional<br>
'composability' predicates: when using the latter two methodologies it also<br>
seems to be difficult to establish a good set of rewriting/introduction<br>
rules for reasons unrelated to the choice of the method/strategy for<br>
rewriting/introduction. Besides, the chosen methodology leads to (what I<br>
would consider being) a very natural textbook-like style of presentation.<br>
For example, to state that the horizontal composition of (horizontally<br>
composable) natural isomorphisms is a natural isomorphism, I may use<br>
something similar to (α is a size parameter; see<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_2-category">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_2-category</a> for the source of the<br>
inspiration for the notation):</p>
<p>assumes "𝔐 : 𝔉' ↦iso 𝔊' : 𝔅 ↦↦⇘α⇙ ℭ"<br>
    and "𝔑 : 𝔉 ↦iso 𝔊 : 𝔄 ↦↦⇘α⇙ 𝔅"<br>
  shows "𝔐 ∘ 𝔑 : 𝔉' ∘ 𝔉 ↦iso 𝔊' ∘ 𝔊 : 𝔄 ↦↦⇘α⇙ ℭ"</p>
<p>However, given these conventions, a natural form of the associativity law<br>
for the horizontal transformations now looks like</p>
<p>assumes "𝔏 : 𝔉'' ↦ 𝔊'' : ℭ ↦↦⇘α⇙ 𝔇"<br>
    and "𝔐 : 𝔉' ↦ 𝔊' : 𝔅 ↦↦⇘α⇙ ℭ"<br>
    and "𝔑 : 𝔉 ↦ 𝔊 : 𝔄 ↦↦⇘α⇙ 𝔅"<br>
  shows "(𝔏 ∘ 𝔐) ∘ 𝔑 = 𝔏 ∘ (𝔐 ∘ 𝔑)"</p>
<p>This does cause a problem when trying to use it in conjunction with<br>
intro-resolution and conditional rewriting. However, cs_concl copes with it<br>
reasonably well for relatively complex use cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is another practical aspect that may lead to problems when using<br>
intro-resolution + simp: I am not certain whether it is a good idea to<br>
maintain a large collection of theorems that state how various predicates<br>
are related to each other in the form of a simpset. Consider the following<br>
example:</p>
<p>context<br>
  fixes P Q R f b<br>
  assumes [intro, cs_intros]: "P x ⟹ Q x"<br>
    and [intro, cs_intros]: "Q x ⟹ R x"<br>
    and [simp, intro, cs_simps]: "R x ⟹ f x = b"<br>
    and Qb: "Q b"<br>
begin</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  assumes "P x"<br>
  shows "Q (f x)"<br>
  using assms Qb oops (<em>by simp, auto, force, fast, fastforce, blast</em>)</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  assumes "P x"<br>
  shows "Q (f x)"<br>
  using assms Qb by (cs_concl cs_simp: cs_simps cs_intro: cs_intros)</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>In this case, if  "P x ⟹ Q x" and "Q x ⟹ R x" are part of the simpset, then<br>
the example works. However, I am not certain whether one can always<br>
replace/augment intro with simp in this way and how practical is it in<br>
general. Is it possible to build upon this example to ensure that<br>
simp rules cannot be used instead of introduction? Could simp eliminate the<br>
side conditions that one does not want to be eliminated when proving other<br>
theorems? I thought that I have observed such problems with this<br>
methodology when working with simp/auto, but I cannot find a way to produce<br>
a minimal example in this instance. Perhaps, there was a way around them.<br>
However, one of the most pleasant aspects of the strategy employed in<br>
cs_concl is that one no longer needs to think about whether a rule should<br>
be declared as simp, intro, or both. Effectively, intro-resolution is used<br>
exclusively, making it easier to predict how the method will behave with a<br>
given set of rules.</p>

Dear Lawrence Paulson/All,</p>
<p>Once again, I apologize for my haste. It seems that I have developed a bad<br>
habit of trying to minimize the time spent on writing the replies for the<br>
mailing list, leading to various embarrassing misprints and mistakes. Of<br>
course, the excerpt "a natural form of the associativity law for the<br>
horizontal transformations" should read "a natural form of the<br>
associativity law for the horizontal composition of natural<br>
transformations". I noticed that there is quite a number of other minor<br>
inconsistencies and misprints in my last email. However, hopefully, they do<br>
not interfere with the meaning that I was trying to convey.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
Mikhail Chekhov</p>

It sounds like you’ve been able to combine your proof method with Isabelle2020 in order to create your category theory development. And a usable formalisation of category theory would be an impressive achievement.</p>
<p>Maybe the way forward is for you to complete your example and contribute it to the AFP. Material from AFP entries sometimes finds its way into the Isabelle sources, and a fully-worked example would give us a good basis for evaluating this idea.</p>

Dear Lawrence Paulson/All,</p>
<p>I would like to make one minor remark with regard to the last quoted<br>
statement. The method that I was referring to in my original post (albeit,<br>
for now, in a very rough zero-order form) is available from the, so-called,<br>
Isabelle Complement Library (<br>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/user9716869/Isabelle-Complement-Library">https://gitlab.com/user9716869/Isabelle-Complement-Library</a>). It is likely<br>
that I will be looking to submit this library to the AFP in a reasonable<br>
time frame as part of another project, not related to my work on the<br>
formalization of category theory. Thus, I anticipate that it will be<br>
possible to evaluate the idea related to the method fairly soon. However, I<br>
would be extremely surprised if there was anything original about it: to<br>
me, it seems like it combines rewriting and introduction in the simplest<br>
and the most natural manner. Thus, I am still hopeful that a more mature<br>
implementation of this algorithm is already available somewhere.</p>

Hi Mikhail.</p>
<p>I think it's worth mentioning a simple trick relevant to associativity.</p>
<p>As you say, the problem is, how do you apply a rewrite of the form<br>
"b . c = r" to a goal "a . b . c . d"? It's annoying to have to instruct<br>
Isabelle to somehow gather the b and c together. Let's suppose "." is<br>
associative and that "a . b . c . d" is syntax for "a . (b . (c . d))".<br>
The simple trick is to also derive the rule "b . c . x = r . x".<br>
This modified rule will apply to the original goal in normal form <br>
without<br>
having to first gather "(b . c)" together.</p>
<p>The variant form of each rule can usually be derived as a one-liner, <br>
since<br>
it just amounts to generalising via some congruence and then rewriting <br>
into<br>
normal form. Here's a worked example for conjunction, which works in <br>
Isabelle/HOL:</p>
<p>lemma less_and_greater:<br>
   fixes x :: nat<br>
   shows "(x &lt; y ∧ x &gt; y) = False"<br>
   by auto</p>
<p>lemmas conj_left_cong = conj_cong[OF _ refl]</p>
<p>lemmas less_and_greater2 = less_and_greater[THEN conj_left_cong, <br>
simplified conj_assoc]</p>
<p>lemma<br>
   fixes x :: nat<br>
   shows<br>
   "~ (A ∧ (B ∧ x &lt; y) ∧ (x &gt; y ∧ x ≤ Suc 12) ∧ C)"<br>
   apply (simp only: conj_assoc)<br>
   apply (simp only: less_and_greater2)<br>
   apply simp<br>
   done</p>
<p>From time to time somebody asks about rewriting modulo associativity<br>
and commutativity, which might sometimes be really useful. My <br>
understanding<br>
is that this problem has been studied in other tools, that solutions <br>
exist,<br>
that performance is a major issue, and that no implementation for<br>
Isabelle currently exists.</p>
