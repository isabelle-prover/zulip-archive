Dear Aaron Crighton/All,</p>
<p>I would like to offer several comments with regard to your query. However,<br>
please do not treat this as an official reply, as I am merely an<br>
independent user of Isabelle, and I am not affiliated with the<br>
developers/maintainers.</p>
<p>Firstly, the definition that you have chosen looks slightly odd. I believe<br>
that a conventional form of the definition would be closer to the following<br>
definition:</p>
<p>locale abstract_localization = ring_hom_cring R S h +<br>
mult_submonoid_of_crng R D<br>
  for eT :: "'e itself" and R and S and h and D +<br>
  assumes localization_units: "h <code> D ⊆ Units S"
  assumes localization_universal_property:
    "⋀(T::'e ring) ψ.
      ⟦ cring T; ψ ∈ ring_hom R T; ψ </code> D ⊆ Units T⟧ ⟹<br>
        (<br>
          ∃!φ::'c⇒'e.<br>
            φ ∈ ring_hom S T ∩ extensional (carrier S) ∧<br>
            (∀a ∈ carrier R. φ (h a) = ψ a)<br>
        )"</p>
<p>In this case, the type of T is still fixed, but the type variable<br>
associated with the type of T is independent of the type variables<br>
associated with the type of R.</p>
<p>This definition does not work, however, because the locale fixes a type for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the elements of the ring T in the axiom, and so the axiom only applies to<br>
rings of this type. Of course this means that there will be many instances<br>
of this locale satisfied by rings S which are not the localization of R.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that you may have exaggerated the problem, but I do not<br>
have complete confidence in anything that is stated below.</p>
<p>When you provide an instantiation of abstract_localization, you provide a<br>
lemma like</p>
<p>lemma (in eq_obj_rng_of_frac) eq_obj_rng_of_frac_abstract_localization:<br>
  fixes eT :: "'e itself"<br>
  shows "abstract_localization TYPE('e) R rec_rng_of_frac<br>
rng_to_rng_of_frac S"<br>
  ―‹Follows Theorem 4.5 in Thomas W. Hungerford's Algebra.›<br>
sorry<br>
(*I did sketch the proof for my own needs, and can provide it upon request,<br>
but it is very rough*)</p>
<p>The lemma eq_obj_rng_of_frac_abstract_localization proves that the<br>
constructions from the theory Localization in the AFP satisfy the universal<br>
property, as defined above. Once the lemma is proven, it is possible to<br>
instantiate it for any type variable 'e:</p>
<p>abstract_localization TYPE(?'e) R rec_rng_of_frac rng_to_rng_of_frac S</p>
<p>Thus, in a certain meta-sense, it does hold for rings with elements of<br>
arbitrary types. Suppose, you have also proven abstract_localization_Q<br>
below:</p>
<p>context eq_obj_rng_of_frac<br>
begin</p>
<p>context<br>
  fixes Q :: "'c ring"<br>
    and t :: "'a ⇒ 'c"<br>
begin</p>
<p>thm eq_obj_rng_of_frac_abstract_localization</p>
<p>lemma abstract_localization_Q:<br>
  fixes eT :: "'e itself" and fT :: "'f itself"<br>
  shows "abstract_localization TYPE('e) R Q t S"<br>
  sorry</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>I believe (but not entirely certain) that it should be possible to prove<br>
that Q and rec_rng_of_frac are isomorphic by<br>
instantiating abstract_localization_Q<br>
and eq_obj_rng_of_frac_abstract_localization for suitable types via<br>
instantiations like</p>
<p>interpret cd:<br>
    abstract_localization ‹TYPE('c)› R rec_rng_of_frac rng_to_rng_of_frac S<br>
    by (rule eq_obj_rng_of_frac_abstract_localization)<br>
   interpret Q_aa: abstract_localization ‹TYPE(('a × 'a) set)› R Q t S<br>
    by (rule abstract_localization_Q)<br>
  interpret Q_cc: abstract_localization ‹TYPE('c)› R Q t S<br>
    by (rule abstract_localization_Q)</p>
<p>Thence, the universal property should work as expected across types.<br>
Nonetheless, I believe that it is not possible to state a single theorem in<br>
the logic that captures this: one needs to instantiate<br>
abstract_localization for every construction independently and then prove<br>
the relevant theorems for the specific definitions (I believe that the<br>
following post is relevant in this context:<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-September/msg00097.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-September/msg00097.html</a>.<br>
Still, some aspects of this problem can be automated in Isabelle/ML.<br>
For example, see<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2020-July/msg00050.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2020-July/msg00050.html</a>,<br>
where I showcase an attempt to develop a meta-category theory that could<br>
work across types in HOL by using schematic polymorphism. However,<br>
following this attempt, I arrived at the conclusion that "applied category<br>
theory" can hardly be done in pure HOL conveniently (I would like to be<br>
proven wrong though). Nonetheless, it can be done conveniently (to a point)<br>
in ZFC in HOL, e.g. see<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2021-March/msg00022.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2021-March/msg00022.html</a><br>
(otherwise you may wish to look at other strong foundational systems<br>
already implemented in Isabelle, e.g.<br>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/cezaryka/tyset/src">https://bitbucket.org/cezaryka/tyset/src</a>,<br>

<p>Hello Everyone,<br>
I have been working on a project in HOL-Algebra and have encountered an<br>
issue with a certain kind of construction I'd like to perform. I would like<br>
to prove some lemmas and perform constructions involving ring<br>
localizations. I understand that there is an AFP submission which<br>
constructs the localization of a ring at a multiplicative subset, but I was<br>
hoping I could formulate an abstract locale for a ring R and a localization<br>
of that ring in terms of the universal property of localizations. This<br>
would be desirable because in many cases the localization of a ring can<br>
arise in ways other than the canonical construction (such as when one is<br>
already working with a local ring). In my case, I would like to be able to<br>
view localizations of the integers as subrings of the field of rational<br>
numbers. My first attempt at this definition was:<br>
locale abstract_localization = ring_hom_cring R S h +<br>
mult_submonoid_of_crng R D for<br>
                                R and S and h and D<br>
+  assumes localization_universal_property:<br>
        "⋀T ψ. ⟦ cring T; ψ ∈ ring_hom R T; ψ ` D ⊆ Units T⟧ ⟹<br>
          (∃! φ. φ ∈ ring_hom R S ∩ extensional (carrier R) ∧<br>
          (∀ a ∈ carrier R. φ (h a) = ψ a))  "<br>
This definition does not work, however, because the locale fixes a type<br>
for the elements of the ring T in the axiom, and so the axiom only applies<br>
to rings of this type. Of course this means that there will be many<br>
instances of this locale satisfied by rings S which are not the<br>
localization of R.<br>
One workaround for this that I have considered would be to replace my<br>
axiom with the assertion that my ring is isomorphic to the concrete<br>
construction of the localization from the AFP, and then prove a lemma which<br>
states that the universal property above is necessary and sufficient for<br>
verifying an instance of this locale.<br>
I was wondering if anyone might have any thoughts on a general way to do<br>
this kind of construction, or if there are reasons why this construction is<br>
suboptimal in HOL-Algebra.<br>
Thanks for your consideration,<br>
Aaron</p>

Dear All,</p>
<p>I noticed that I forgot to provide references for my previous post on the<br>
mailing list and also that there is at least one case of the misuse of<br>
terminology.</p>
<p>Thus, the sentence "I believe (but not entirely certain) that it should be<br>
possible to prove that Q and rec_rng_of_frac are isomorphic by<br>
instantiating abstract_localization_Q<br>
and eq_obj_rng_of_frac_abstract_localization for suitable types via<br>
instantiations like..." should read "I believe (but not entirely certain)<br>
that it should be possible to prove that Q and rec_rng_of_frac are<br>
isomorphic by instantiating abstract_localization_Q<br>
and eq_obj_rng_of_frac_abstract_localization for suitable types via<br>
<em>interpretations</em> like".</p>
