<p>From: AARON CRIGHTON &lt;<a href="mailto:crightoa@mcmaster.ca">crightoa@mcmaster.ca</a>&gt;<br>
Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>I have been working on a project in HOL-Algebra and have encountered an<br>
issue with a certain kind of construction I'd like to perform. I would like<br>
to prove some lemmas and perform constructions involving ring<br>
localizations. I understand that there is an AFP submission which<br>
constructs the localization of a ring at a multiplicative subset, but I was<br>
hoping I could formulate an abstract locale for a ring R and a localization<br>
of that ring in terms of the universal property of localizations. This<br>
would be desirable because in many cases the localization of a ring can<br>
arise in ways other than the canonical construction (such as when one is<br>
already working with a local ring). In my case, I would like to be able to<br>
view localizations of the integers as subrings of the field of rational<br>
numbers. My first attempt at this definition was:</p>
<p>locale abstract_localization = ring_hom_cring R S h +<br>
mult_submonoid_of_crng R D for<br>
                                R and S and h and D</p>
<ul>
<li>assumes localization_universal_property:<br>
        "⋀T ψ. ⟦ cring T; ψ ∈ ring_hom R T; ψ ` D ⊆ Units T⟧ ⟹<br>
          (∃! φ. φ ∈ ring_hom R S ∩ extensional (carrier R) ∧<br>
          (∀ a ∈ carrier R. φ (h a) = ψ a))  "</li>
</ul>
<p>This definition does not work, however, because the locale fixes a type for<br>
the elements of the ring T in the axiom, and so the axiom only applies to<br>
rings of this type. Of course this means that there will be many instances<br>
of this locale satisfied by rings S which are not the localization of R.</p>
<p>One workaround for this that I have considered would be to replace my axiom<br>
with the assertion that my ring is isomorphic to the concrete construction<br>
of the localization from the AFP, and then prove a lemma which states that<br>
the universal property above is necessary and sufficient for verifying an<br>
instance of this locale.</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone might have any thoughts on a general way to do<br>
this kind of construction, or if there are reasons why this construction is<br>
suboptimal in HOL-Algebra.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration,</p>
<p>Aaron</p>
