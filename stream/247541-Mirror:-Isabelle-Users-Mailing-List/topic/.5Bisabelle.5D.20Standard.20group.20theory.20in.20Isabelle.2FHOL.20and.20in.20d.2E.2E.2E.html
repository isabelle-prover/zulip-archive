<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
First, thank you very much for the extensive explanation, and the reference to Ballarin's paper at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-019-09537-9">https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-019-09537-9</a> &lt;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-019-09537-9">https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-019-09537-9</a>&gt;, which I have read.</p>
<p>Let me focus on two points on how abstract algebra is implemented in Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>A. Using locales and meta-logical implication for expressing type dependencies</p>
<p>Best suited for comparison is the monoid definition</p>
<p>locale monoid =<br>
    fixes M and composition (infixl "·" 70) and unit ("1")</p>
<p>assumes composition_closed: "[ a ∈ M; b ∈ M ] 􏰀⇒ a · b ∈ M"</p>
<p>and unit_closed: "1 ∈ M"</p>
<p>and associative:"[ a ∈ M ; b ∈ M ; c ∈ M ] 􏰀⇒ (a · b) · c = a · (b · c)"    </p>
<p>and left_unit:"a ∈ M 􏰀⇒ 1 · a = a"<br>
        and right_unit:"a ∈ M 􏰀⇒ a · 1  = a" </p>
<p>as presented by Ballarin (p. 3) and similar to that actually used in HOL-Algebra<br>
<a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/library/HOL/HOL-Algebra/Group.html">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/library/HOL/HOL-Algebra/Group.html</a><br>
since the group definition itself there has only an abbreviated definition as monoid + inverse element.</p>
<p>The dependencies (Isabelle: "fixes") are the same as in this expression of R0:</p>
<h2>Group property identity element only (with identity element abstracted)</h2>
<p>:= GrpIdO [λgτ .<a href="http://og(ggg)">λlggg.[λeg.GrpIdyo](og)</a>]</p>
<h1>wff 270 : [λg.[λl.[λe.GrpIdy]]]o\3(\4\4\3)τ := GrpIdO</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf#page=362">https://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf#page=362</a> &lt;<a href="https://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf#page=362">https://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf#page=362</a>&gt;</p>
<p>The variables bound by lambda are: g, l, e<br>
meaning the set (carrier, type), the operation, and the identity element (unit),<br>
and correspond to: M, composition (infixl "·" 70), and unit ("1") in this example.<br>
The type dependency here is represented by g which occurs both at the type level and the term level (type abstraction): [λgτ .[λlggg.[λeg. ...]]]</p>
<p>Since type abstraction is not available in Isabelle/HOL, one cannot naturally express the closure of the operation with the typed expression lggg (l : g -&gt; g -&gt; g),<br>
but one has to use the assumption composition_closed: "[ a ∈ M; b ∈ M ] 􏰀⇒ a · b ∈ M"<br>
contrary to the concept of type theory to code such type assumptions syntactically as types.<br>
Using the element relation of set theory (a ∈ M) or some alternative formulation (Ma) is what you usually want to avoid in type theory.<br>
Moreover, since the symbol ⇒ is the meta-logical implication (‘meta-implication’) of Isabelle's meta-logic (and not the logical implication of the object logic Isabelle/HOL), it becomes clear that the formal system (simple or polymorphic type theory) itself is insufficient, but some extension, in this case Isabelle's meta-logic, is required for expressing this type restriction.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simple or polymorphic type theory (e.g., Q0, HOL, HOL4) alone is clearly insufficient for expressing abstract algebra (e.g., group theory).</li>
<li>
<p>At least some kind of extension is required, in this case Isabelle's meta-logic is employed<br>
    (using the ‘meta-implication’ as described on p. 4 of <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-130.pdf">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-130.pdf</a> &lt;<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-130.pdf">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-130.pdf</a>&gt;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even then – with the use of some extension (as a workaround) – the coding of the type restrictions is very clumsy in comparison to the natural expression using type abstraction and the substitution of types via lambda conversion (e.g., with N for the natural numbers you would have: [λgτ .[λlggg.[λeg. ...]]]N = [λlNNN.[λeN. ...]], i.e., the closure of the operation l and of the identity element e as syntactical prerequisites).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, what could be easily and naturally represented with type abstraction within the formal language, in Isabelle/HOL also requires the meta-logic as an extension for implementing only a workaround, and moreover requires maybe some dependencies encoded in the "locales".</p>
<p>"Locales are extra-logical. The functors they represent are not encoded in Isabelle’s logic. Instead, whenever a locale is visited—that is, a context block entered—the locale is activated:<br>
– The locale graph is traversed and all reachable locale instances are activated recursively.<br>
– The body of the locale is added to the context, making its declarations available." (Ballarin's paper, p. 5)</p>
<p>"Locales provide means for structuring formal developments, but they do not change the underlying logic, so they do not increase expressiveness. This is a fundamental limitation. On the other hand, locales work on top of any logic provided there is substitution [6, Section 3.1], so they could be provided for a wide range of provers." (p. 26)</p>
<p>It seems that the substitution of types via lambda conversion (using type abstraction) here is replaced by locales.</p>
<p>B. Instantiation</p>
<p>Some substitution must take place in the step from the theorem of the uniqueness of the identity element in groups to that of a particular group.<br>
How is this done in Isabelle/HOL?<br>
Presumably this also requires Isabelle's meta-logic.</p>
<p>How can one obtain the fully expanded internal version of a statement as shown on p. 19 of Ballarin's paper?</p>
