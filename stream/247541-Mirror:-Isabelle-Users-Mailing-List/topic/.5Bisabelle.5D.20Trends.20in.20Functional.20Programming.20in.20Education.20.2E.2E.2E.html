TFPIE 2022 Call for papers<br>
<a href="https://wiki.tfpie.science.ru.nl/TFPIE2022">https://wiki.tfpie.science.ru.nl/TFPIE2022</a><br>
(February 11th 2022, Krakow, Poland co-located with TFP 2022 and Lambda<br>
Days)</p>
<p>TFPIE 2022 welcomes submissions describing techniques used in the<br>
classroom, tools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any<br>
creative use of functional programming (FP) to aid education in or outside<br>
Computer Science. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>FP and beginning CS students<br>
  FP and Computational Thinking<br>
  FP and Artificial Intelligence<br>
  FP in Robotics<br>
  FP and Music<br>
  Advanced FP for undergraduates<br>
  FP in graduate education<br>
  Engaging students in research using FP<br>
  FP in Programming Languages<br>
  FP in the high school curriculum<br>
  FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics<br>
  FP and Philosophy<br>
  The pedagogy of teaching FP<br>
  FP and e-learning: MOOCs, automated assessment etc.<br>
  Best Lectures - more details below</p>
<p>In addition to papers, we are requesting best lecture presentations. What's<br>
your<br>
best lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a fun way to<br>
present FP<br>
concepts to novices or perhaps an especially interesting presentation of a<br>
difficult topic? In either case, please consider sharing it. Best lecture<br>
topics<br>
will be selected for presentation based on a short abstract describing the<br>
lecture and its interest to TFPIE attendees. The length of the presentation<br>
should be comparable to that of a paper. In addition, the speaker can<br>
provide<br>
commentary on effectiveness or student feedback.</p>
<p>Submissions</p>
<p>Potential presenters are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-6 pages)<br>
or<br>
a draft paper (up to 20 pages) in EPTCS style. The authors of accepted<br>
presentations will have their preprints and their slides made available on<br>
the workshop's website. Papers and abstracts can be submitted via easychair<br>
at the following link:</p>

<p>After the workshop, presenters are invited to submit (a revised version of)<br>
their<br>
article for the formal review. The PC will select the best articles for<br>
publication<br>
in the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).<br>
Articles rejected for presentation and extended abstracts will not be<br>
formally reviewed by the PC.</p>
<p>Important Dates:</p>
