Dear All,</p>
<p>I have two weakly related questions with regard to the availability of<br>
certain functionality from the public interface associated with the<br>
Isabelle/ML infrastructure of the standard distribution of Isabelle:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I would like to understand if it is possible to tell whether a given<br>
attribute is a declaration attribute, a rule attribute, or a mixed<br>
attribute after its construction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would like to understand whether it is possible to compare proof<br>
contexts in a manner similar to which theories can be compared using the<br>
functions Context.eq_thy, Context. proper_subthy and Context.subthy. Do<br>
there, by any chance, exist diagnostic theory/context difference<br>
functions, allowing for listing the exact specific changes introduced by a<br>
modification of a theory/context?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the functionality that is described in the questions above is not<br>
available, I would like to convert the questions into a feature request, if<br>
possible.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
Mikhail Chekhov</p>

Hi Mikhail,</p>
<p>overall, I think it is best if you expose in a few sentences what you<br>
want to achieve in the end – as you will see from my terse replies below<br>
the mechanisms you request are conceptually not available in the system,<br>
but typically this can be resolved by reshaping the genuine problem<br>
after having a different perspective on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>I would like to understand if it is possible to tell whether a given<br>
attribute is a declaration attribute, a rule attribute, or a mixed<br>
attribute after its construction.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Traditionally, attributes are mainly observable by their effect, not by<br>
their construction – although AFAIK more structure has emerged for the<br>
benefit of the module systems (locales, bundles).</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">

contexts in a manner similar to which theories can be compared using the<br>
functions Context.eq_thy, Context. proper_subthy and Context.subthy. Do<br>
there, by any chance, exist diagnostic theory/context difference<br>
functions, allowing for listing the exact specific changes introduced by<br>
a modification of a theory/context? </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Those operations are a mere technical device to manage the theory graph,<br>
not a means to build applications on it.  Since the managements of proof<br>
contexts is less involved, they get along without it.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

Dear Florian Haftmann/All,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>

<p>I will act upon your request and provide more background for my questions.<br>
However, please note that I accept the comments in your last email as a<br>
reply, i.e. the functionality is not available and there are no immediate<br>
plans to introduce it. This information is sufficient to allow me to make<br>
the relevant design decisions with regard to the applications that I am<br>
working on.</p>

<p>In certain applications, I allow the users to provide their own attributes<br>
as inputs to a command. These attributes are applied to a theorem/context<br>
within the scope of an application of a certain algorithm. I would like to<br>
be able to restrict the attributes that the users can provide to rule<br>
attributes. Being able to introduce this condition makes the design of the<br>
system easier: unfortunately, it is substantially more difficult (if not<br>
entirely impossible) to support arbitrary context modifications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given what has been stated, it seems that my options are to either restrict<br>
the attributes to a given pre-determined subset of standard rule attributes<br>
or to allow arbitrary attributes, but state in the documentation that only<br>
the rule attributes are supported fully.</p>

<p>The functionality that I seek could be useful for the purpose of designing<br>
tests for my applications. For example, it would be useful to be able to<br>
state that a given function/module does not modify the proof context under<br>
certain inputs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context, I wonder what are the usual software<br>
engineering/management practices that are followed when working<br>
on/extending the Isabelle/ML system associated with the standard<br>
distribution? Do there exist unit test frameworks specifically designed for<br>
Isabelle/ML? Does there exist any infrastructure that would enable<br>
black-box testing of Isabelle's commands/methods/attributes? (I am aware<br>
that proving is preferred to testing in the world of functional<br>
programming, but, in my view, this approach is impractical for the UI<br>
design in Isabelle/ML, given the existing state of the art).</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
Mikhail Chekhov</p>
