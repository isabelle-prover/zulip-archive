UNIF 2021 - 35th International Workshop on Unification<br>
             18th of July 2021, Buenos Aires, Argentina<br>
<a href="https://www.uoh.cl/unif-2021/">https://www.uoh.cl/unif-2021/</a></p>
<p>SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>UNIF 2021 is associated with FSCD 2021 and will be a purely virtual event.</p>
<p>TOPIC:</p>
<p>Unification is concerned with the problem of identifying given (first-<br>
or higher-order) terms, either syntactically or modulo a theory. It is<br>
a fundamental technique that is employed in various areas of Computer<br>
Science and Mathematics. In particular, unification algorithms are key<br>
components in completion of term rewriting systems, resolution-based<br>
theorem  proving, and logic programming. But unification is, for<br>
example, also investigated in the context of natural language<br>
processing, program analysis, types, modal logics, and in knowledge<br>
representation.</p>
<p>UNIF 2021 is the 35th in a series of annual workshops on unification<br>
and related topics. Just as its predecessors', the purpose of UNIF 2021<br>
is to bring together researchers interested in unification theory and<br>
its applications, as well as closely related topics, such as matching<br>
(i.e., one-sided unification), anti-unification (i.e., the dual<br>
problem to unification), disunification (i.e., solving equations and<br>
inequations) and the admissibility problem (which generalizes<br>
unification in modal logics). It will provide a forum for presenting<br>
recent (even unfinished) work, and discuss new ideas and trends in<br>
this and related fields.</p>
<p>Topics of interest of the workshop include syntactic and equational<br>
unification algorithms, matching and constraint solving, unification<br>
in modal, temporal, and description logics, higher order unification,<br>
narrowing, disunification, anti-unification, complexity issues,<br>
combination methods, implementation techniques, and applications.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>Paper submission: April 16, 2021<br>
Notification of acceptance: May 21, 2021<br>
Final version of accepted papers: June 18, 2021<br>
Workshop dates: July 18, 2021</p>
<p>SUBMISSION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Following the tradition of UNIF, we call for submissions of extended<br>
abstracts (5 pages) in EasyChair style, to be submitted electronically<br>
as PDF through the EasyChair submission site:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2021</a></p>
<p>Abstracts will be evaluated by the Program Committee (if necessary<br>
with support from external reviewers) regarding their significance for<br>
the workshop. We also allow submission of work presented/submitted<br>
in/to another conference.</p>
<p>Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop and made<br>
available at the Web-page of UNIF 2021.</p>
<p>Depending on the number and quality of submitted papers, a special<br>
issue of a journal is planned after the workshop, with full versions<br>
of the papers going through the reviewing process according to the<br>
standards of the chosen journal (e.g., AMAI, JAR, JLC, MSCS).</p>
