How to deal with short proofs like "by blast"?<br>
They leave gaps in the knowledge of reader, force one to re-prove theorems.</p>
<p>I mean the best option is to obtain some information about proof. (Not just<br>
"Yes, proved" or "No")</p>
<p>I understand that sometimes this proofs are results of oracles, but the aim<br>
is to obtain more verbose proof.</p>
<p>a) Did someone considered unfolding such short proof to something in<br>
Isar-style? ( from ... have ... qed.)</p>
<p>b) The other option is to obtain a term from proved theorem. How to do this?</p>
<p>Let's use this example from Isabelle/ZF  (ZF-ex).</p>

Dear Georgy</p>
<p>Just to clarify one point: blast doesn’t use oracles and overall the significance of oracles in Isabelle proofs is small. I understand that for a beginner it could be interesting and instructive to see a blast proof broken into smaller parts, but (unfortunately) it’s rare for Isabelle’s automation to prove anything that isn’t obvious. Our problem really is that many obvious facts can only be proved with elaborate formal arguments that take much time and labour to construct.</p>
<p>To take your example: if ∀x ∈ S. ∀y ∈ S. x ⊆ y then clearly all elements of S must equal one another, from which the conclusion ∃z. S ⊆ {z} obviously follows. I agree it is impressive that blast can prove this in a single step. </p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
To add to what Larry said: unlike systems like Coq or Lean, Isabelle<br>
does not allow you to look at ‘the proof’ that was constructed by<br>
default. The reason for that is that Isabelle's design differs from<br>
those systems a lot. In Coq, proof terms fall out of the system<br>
basically for free anyway. In Isabelle, you can get something like this,<br>
but you have to do extra implementation work and invest extra CPU time<br>
and memory to get it. So usually, it's not done at all.</p>
<p>There /is/ an Isabelle feature called ‘proof terms’ that you can switch<br>
on and then you can look at the ‘proof’ (in some sense) that was found,<br>
even if it was constructed by blast or auto. But this proof will usually<br>
be big, cluttered with ‘unnecessary’ steps, and completely unreadable<br>
for a human, much like e.g. SMT proofs that you can get from Z3. Because<br>
proof terms are more of an afterthought in Isabelle, none of the<br>
automation even tries to produce small and beautiful proof terms.</p>
<p>However, generally, Isabelle's automation does not perform magic. It<br>
really is surprisingly simple. It is a combination of a good library of<br>
rewrite rules, simple general-purpose automation for classical<br>
reasoning, some specialised decision procedures, and some specialised<br>
rewriting procedures. Blast, for instance, is ‘just’ a Tableaux solver,<br>
if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>The situation is a bit different with provers like "smt" and "metis".<br>
Sledgehammer calls occasionally produce very puzzling one-line proofs<br>
that I find very hard to retrace by hand. Sledgehammer does have an<br>
"Isar proof generation" feature that tries to produce more structured<br>
proofs, but I never really got it to produce anything illuminating and<br>
often it fails entirely. I have no idea how it works either.<br>
Sledgehammer, all in all, indeed feels a bit magical – unlike the more<br>
pedestrian methods like blast and auto.</p>
<p>(@everone else: Please do correct me if I am wrong; I am not really an<br>
expert on this automation. Some of it is probably almost as old as I am<br>
and my understanding of it is sometimes rather vague.)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

Thanks for the feedback!</p>
<p>Indeed, it is more psychological/ philosophical effect.<br>
I think, a fact is understood completely when it's proven.<br>
(Maybe it's just an irrational fear of loosing control over proofs and a<br>
fear of degrading right into a mindless trying of different tactics.)</p>
<p>I didn't mean that that obvious proof should be separated into parts, I was<br>
just curious about technical possibilities of reviving proofs. But, I<br>
agree, the possible drawback is that proof may not be elegant or even not<br>
human-readable, so it's complicated issue.</p>

Also important to note: back around 1977, Robin Milner introduced the LCF architecture (with an abstract type of theorems defined within a strongly typed functional programming language, namely ML) with the specific aim of eliminating the need to store proofs. He had observed a simple fact: proofs take up too much memory. Since then, you may retort, memory capacity has increased by three or four orders of magnitude. But so have our proofs.</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Indeed they have!</p>
<p>I wonder if the memory requirements of storing proof terms for<br>
everything is a problem for systems that do this. I vaguely recall Leah<br>
Neukirchen giving a talk about proofs by reflection in Coq and listed<br>
"saves memory because there are no proof terms associated with the<br>
theorem" as an advantage – so that seems to indicate that proof term<br>
size can indeed cause performance problems in Coq.</p>
<p>However, I think the performance situation in these systems is not quite<br>
as bad as it is in Isabelle (with proof terms enabled) because they have<br>
definitional equality and implicit normalisation, which Isabelle does<br>
not. In Isabelle, every rewrite step must be recorded explicitly.</p>
<p>In any case, I have it on good authority that some people are planning<br>
to improve proof terms in Isabelle, so let's see what comes out of that.<br>
Mario Carneiro seemed quite interested in them for the purpose of<br>
importing Isabelle proofs into other systems.</p>
<p>Still, considering the fact that whenever our tools become more<br>
capable/performant, proof applications seem to scale up almost<br>
immediately until they are again at the very limit of what the system<br>
can do, it is probably a good thing that we can just "switch off" proof<br>
terms if we have to.</p>

<p>From: Mario Carneiro &lt;<a href="mailto:di.gama@gmail.com">di.gama@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Mario Carneiro is watching this thread with great interest. :) I think that<br>
the fact that proof terms in isabelle are large is very correlated with the<br>
fact that they are not stored. (A good comparison is the observation that<br>
software is still about as fast from the user perspective as it was 20<br>
years ago, even though the processor and memory capacity has increased by<br>
orders of magnitude over the period. We've just managed to fill the<br>
available capacity with more work and less efficient software, with the<br>
reasoning that a human can't tell the difference between 10 milliseconds<br>
and 3 nanoseconds.) I personally have no doubts that it is possible to<br>
improve on the current situation by several orders of magnitude, although I<br>
don't know how feasible they are given the current architecture and social<br>
context. The general attitude that proof terms "don't matter" is terribly<br>
destructive to attempts to work on improving their efficiency, though. They<br>
enable all manner of proof export, cross linking of libraries, and external<br>
checking. I don't plan to settle for less than the entire standard<br>
library + AFP, but as I understand it this is completely out of the range<br>
of feasibility of the current proof term mode, because too much processing<br>
is spent putting things into lambda calculus rather than just logging<br>
kernel calls.</p>
<p>To give some sense of what I think is possible, I have managed to enable<br>
proof export for the cadical SAT solver such that the runtime is not much<br>
affected (+0-10%), and the resulting proof checking time is also<br>
negligible. Disk space can be a problem for large automated proofs,<br>
assuming you aren't doing any proof processing, but it is easier to make a<br>
tradeoff of disk space for more implicit data starting from a fully<br>
elaborated proof baseline, plus disk space is relatively cheap so I'm not<br>
overly concerned about this. Of course it would be better if the proofs<br>
were actually optimized, but I'll take what I can get.</p>

This observation may be true for Microsoft Word, but it is certainly not true for Isabelle. I don’t have the precise numbers at my fingertips but I recall for example that the MicroJava session took about 45 minutes to run in the late 1990s. And here it is today:</p>
<p>Finished HOL-MicroJava (0:01:10 elapsed time, 0:05:44 cpu time, factor 4.90)</p>
<p>That is an improvement of nearly 2 orders of magnitude, partly achieved through parallelism (by a factor of almost 5).</p>

If you look at the same program over time, it will appear to get faster<br>
because the hardware is changing and the software isn't. Similarly here, if<br>
you look at the MicroJava session over time it has improved. But I would<br>
bet there are other sessions that exist now that also take 45 minutes,<br>
perhaps even more. They just use different proof methods and prove<br>
different things. In one sense this is certainly a gain - we can now use<br>
methods that would not be practical in the past, and tackle much bigger<br>
problems now than before. But it is this exact fact that means that<br>
computer systems will always live at human timescales, because we don't<br>
optimize past the point that we can notice the difference, and we don't<br>
attempt to run programs that take too long (depending on the context that<br>
upper bound might be 1 second or 30 seconds for an editor action, several<br>
minutes for a theory compiled on the spot, and hours to weeks for a full<br>
development).</p>

It is a common view that improvements in software performance have come for free from hardware improvements alone. But in the case of Isabelle a simple calculation shows that this is no explanation. A processor in the late 1990s might have a clock speed of 400 MHz. Simply multiplying by today’s speedup factor of 40 would suggest that today we have a 16 GHz processor, so obviously something else is going on. In the case of Isabelle it’s the huge investment in parallelism.</p>
<p>I was curious to see how many really big problems there are in the AFP. It turns out that there are only six (out of 547) in the “slow” category. The slowest of these (Iptables_Semantics) has a time limit of 17 hours. It’s a far cry from the era in which running jobs overnight was a regular necessity.</p>
<p>Given the major role of proof objects in Coq, we can be sure that they are optimised to the maximum extent. Yet it’s clear that Coq users try to avoid creating proof objects altogether. Formalisations minimise the role of proof objects by working as much as possible with primitive recursive functions (which are evaluated within the kernel and don’t create proof objects).</p>

It should be mentioned that the slow iptables session, as far as I<br>
understand, is an application of generated code (a piece of software<br>
that was verified in Isabelle/HOL) to a really big example application,<br>
and that is the only thing that is slow about it. Not the actual proofs.</p>
<p>For Flyspeck, it is somewhat similar. I think this is some kind of<br>
exhaustive search procedure that is proven correct and then the<br>
generated code is executed, and that is what is so slow about it.</p>
<p>Neither of these actually involve Isabelle itself in the slow bits.</p>
<p>I don't know about the other ones, but I think those might actually be<br>
actual Isabelle proofs that are a bit slow.</p>
<p>Of the four others, two take about 30 minutes and two take about 60<br>
minutes, with 8 threads each. That's not so bad. Bicategories and<br>
JinjaThreads are probably slow because they are just huge (in terms of<br>
lines of code). With ConcurrentGC and AODV I don't really know why they<br>
are so slow. Perhaps they use an exorbitant amount of automated case<br>
distinctions?</p>

Just to be sure: Something like a proof object is nevertheless created<br>
when a proof method is invoked, right? My understanding was that<br>
following the LCF approach means that Isabelle will never trust methods<br>
like <code>blast</code> to produce correct results but always require them to<br>
provide proof objects that are then checked by a minimal trusted kernel<br>
for correctness. Is this the case, or did I misunderstand something?</p>

No proof objects are created. Soundness is enforced through the abstract type discipline.</p>
<p>Here is an analogy: imagine a programming project that requires a dictionary datatype. Somebody implements the dictionary￼￼ using red-black trees, hash tables or whatever, and provides an interface with abstract operations such as the empty dictionary, insert, lookup, update, delete. Those operations are the only means available to work with dictionaries outside the data structure definition itself, and in that way the integrity of the internal representation is protected￼. Provided that the code implementing the representation is correct, and assuming of course a type-safe programming language, all dictionary operations are guaranteed to deliver the correct results regardless of how many errors there may be in other parts of the program.</p>
<p>Maintaining a separate audit trail for each dictionary would provide a means of checking the dictionary operations at runtime (in particular to verify that lookup delivers correct results), but it's unnecessary and would cause the program to quickly run out of memory.</p>
<p>Proof objects are precisely such audit trails. That they are unnecessary (and indeed unaffordable) was Robin Milner's insight, around 1975. It is noteworthy that in proof assistants such as Coq that represent propositions by types, great efforts are made to use Bool or Prop rather than Type in order to keep proof objects to a minimum.</p>

Thanks a lot for your explanation.</p>
<p>I don’t want to claim that I fully understand Isabelle’s technique<br>
already, but I hope I got the essence of it.</p>
<p>My understanding is as follows: You could let proof methods build proof<br>
objects whose correctness you check afterwards. Proof objects would be<br>
of some algebraic data type, and you would use the data constructors of<br>
this type to build proof objects. To get to the Isabelle style, you<br>
essentially replace these data constructors by operations of an abstract<br>
data type whose values correspond to proofs. The properties of the<br>
abstract data type ensure that it is impossible for you to construct<br>
incorrect proofs. Is that roughly how it works?</p>
<p>In any case, it’s reassuring that in Isabelle there is indeed only this<br>
small kernel you have to trust.</p>
<p>All the best,<br>
Wolfgang</p>

Interesting analogy!</p>
<p>From what I understand, the invocations of the functions you use for<br>
constructing a new fact collectively form a proof of this fact, but no<br>
actual data resembling the proof is ever constructed by these functions.</p>
<p>All the best,<br>

Dear Wolfgang,</p>
<p>In most systems (at least in Isabelle and HOL Light) there<br>
is a switch that you can turn on/off to allow you to store<br>
the proof object in memory, but in normal operation this<br>
switch is always off.</p>

<p>That image is evocative but doesn’t indicate how you prevent the “someone” from writing a faulty proof. Here is Milner himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we’re not so concerned with checking or generating proofs as with performing proofs. Thus, we don’t normally store or display proofs but only the results of them - i.e. theorems. These form an abstract type on which the only allowed operations are the inference rules …; this ensures that a well-typed program cannot perform faulty proofs (it may not prove the theorem expected but the result will be a theorem!). If extra security or formal proof-checking is desired, full proofs are easily generated -- only minor changes in the implementation of the abstract type for theorems would be required. The principal aims then in designing ML were to make it impossible to prove non-theorems yet easy to program strategies for performing proofs.</p>
