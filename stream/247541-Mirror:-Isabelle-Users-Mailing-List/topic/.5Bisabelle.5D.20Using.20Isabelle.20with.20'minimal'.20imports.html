<p>From: David Fuenmayor &lt;<a href="mailto:davfuenmayor@gmail.com">davfuenmayor@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
I would like to use Isabelle with the 'minimal' possible library imports<br>
(and therefore not importing Main).<br>
By 'minimal' I mean this: using Isabelle as a proof assistant for simple<br>
type theory (+ choice, prefix polymorphism, etc.) in such a way that<br>
Nitpick and the integration with external ATPs (via Sledgehammer + proof<br>
reconstruction with metis, smt &amp; co.) still work, and nothing more.</p>
<p>One motivation is (i) being able to invoke Sledgehammer with as few facts<br>
as possible, without "polluting" invocations with facts from the libraries<br>
(for which I have no use at present). Other motivation (ii) is improving<br>
performance in general (also for Nitpick), e.g. when using Isabelle in<br>
headless mode.</p>
<p>I know that for (i) one can manually select which facts are passed to<br>
Sledgehammer (though I wouldn't like to always think about this). As for<br>
(ii) I would like to know whether there are (or not) any differences.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help (and happy Christmas time!)</p>
<p>David</p>

The minimal import of Isabelle is Pure. However, sledgehammer and <br>
nitpick are implemented in HOL. You can import just those tools and <br>
their dependencies; you don't need to use Main. But if you want to have <br>
those tools in another object logic, you'll have to implement them there.</p>

<p>For that, build a minimal session which contains just the (closure of) <br>
imports of those tools.</p>

<p>You can easily achieve this by writing a sledgehammer' command which <br>
excludes the facts that you don't want.</p>

I would be surprised if this minimal system delivered many benefits. On the other hand, it would be interesting to find out. I hope you will report back with some measurements in a couple of months.</p>

<p>This is not officially supported. The canonical entry points for Isabelle<br>
applications are:</p>
<p>* Pure: minimal higher-order logic as a logical framework for object-logics,<br>
or complete different applications based on ML and lambda-calculus.</p>
<p>* Main: full higher-order logic with "batteries included", i.e. many<br>
fundamental concepts expected from logic and functional programming (this is<br>
not yet "library").</p>
<p>* Complex_Main: add-ons to Main from classic mathematics (rat, real, complex).</p>
<p>Anything between Pure -- Main -- Complex_Main is an implementation detail, and<br>
to be considered "private" (as in a Java or Scala library).</p>
<p>Only on top of HOL Main and Complex_Main we can speak of genuine libraries:<br>
here you import the subgraphs that you require.</p>
<p>Sometimes such libraries are wrapped-up in a similar manner as Main, e.g.<br>
HOL-Analysis.Analysis: It would be better if Isabelle would support an<br>
official "private" marker to theories and libraries would use that.</p>

<p>Isabelle tools are normally constructed to work in large theory contexts,<br>

works substantially better, just by stripping away things.</p>

<p>Fact selection is a special topic for Sledgehammer. The makers of that great<br>

<p>From: David Fuenmayor &lt;<a href="mailto:davfuenmayor@gmail.com">davfuenmayor@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks for the answers. I understand that there is little that can be done<br>
for my case.</p>
<p>I found out that by importing only the theory "Nitpick" I can get to run<br>
all of my current experiments (a formalization of basic topology).<br>
In fact, I noticed that I don't even need to import theory "Sledgehammer",<br>
which is a direct import of theory "List", since the latter ends up being a<br>
transitive dependency of "Nitpick".<br>
I must admit that I don't always understand the reasons behind these<br>
dependencies. In any case, it seems that I just cannot use nitpick without<br>
loading a lot of HOL libraries (sets, lists, numbers, etc) and<br>
infrastructure (for codegen, lifting, etc,) for which I don't have any use<br>
in my work.</p>
<p>@Fabian:<br>
You can easily achieve this by writing a sledgehammer' command which<br>
excludes the facts that you don't want.</p>
<p>Right. I think I will now manually put my facts in "named_theorems" and<br>
pass exclusively the latter to sledgehammer.</p>

Anyway, what exactly do you mean by "performance ... in headless mode"? What<br>
is the hardware behind that? Something like Raspberry Pi or a regular cloud<br>

<p>I am working with container-based, pay-as-you-go (aka. "serverless")<br>
computing infrastructure. For instance, in AWS Fargate you pay per used<br>
vCPU and GB RAM (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/pricing/">https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/pricing/</a>), also in AWS<br>
Lambda computing nodes start already with 128Mb RAM (<br>
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/">https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/</a>). Other providers (azure, google.<br>
etc.) have similar offerings. Cloud computing is forcing software engineers<br>
to become stingy again!</p>
<p>Fact selection is a special topic for Sledgehammer. The makers of that great<br>
tool can tell you what are potential approaches to improve on that.</p>
<p>I have to admit that mesh, mepo &amp; co. do a great job! So I have been able<br>
to mindlessly hammer my way through so far :)</p>
