Dear HOL4 and Isabelle community,</p>
<p>the sole purpose of this email is to have your attention on a recent pull<br>
request on HOL4:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL/pull/845">https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL/pull/845</a></p>
<p>where I was trying to formalize Fubini's theorem (in Lebesgue Integrals)<br>
but was blocked somehow by HOL4's new arithmetic definitions of extended<br>
reals (extreal), i.e. the addition/subtraction of infinities.</p>
<p>In short words, I feel that the statements of this classical result<br>
(Fubini's theorem) by <em>Guido Fubini</em> (1879-1943) are not sufficient,<br>
because its proof seems inevitably relied on the forbidden part of extreal<br>
arithmetics.   As a result, Fubini's theorem in its original statements has<br>
been or (can be) formalized in Isabelle/HOL, Lean and Mizar, but not in<br>
latest HOL4 where <code>PosInf + NegInf</code> is unspecified.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your opinions and comments!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chun Tian</p>

Hello,</p>
<p>I find this a bit odd and I think that abstractly, there should be no<br>
problem here.</p>
<p>Your assumptions include</p>
<p>(AE y::(Y,B,v). integrable (X,A,u) (λx. f (x,y)))<br>
(AE x::(X,A,u). integrable (Y,B,v) (λy. f (x,y)))</p>
<p>And you say you need to add the assumptions</p>
<p>∀y. y ∈ Y ⇒ ∫⁺ (X,A,u) (λx. (abs ∘ f) (x,y)) ≠ +∞<br>
∀x. x ∈ X ⇒ ∫⁺ (Y,B,v) (λy. (abs ∘ f) (x,y)) ≠ +∞</p>
<p>The former implies the "almost everywhere" form of the latter. So,<br>
suppose X' and Y' are the subsets of X and Y where it doesn't hold, why<br>
don't you just w.l.o.g. assume f to be zero on (X'×Y)∪(X×Y')? That does<br>
not change the value of the integral – since both measures are<br>
sigma-finite, and X' and Y' are null sets, (X'×Y)∪(X×Y') is also a null set.</p>
<p>Not saying that this is the easiest way to do it, but it should work.</p>
<p>In Isabelle, the situation is quite a bit different. Most of the heavy<br>
lifting is done with non-negative integrals (nn_integral), which work on<br>
extended non-negative reals, which are a much nicer algebraic structure<br>
than "normal" extended reals.</p>
<p>The "normal" integral (lebesgue_integral) does not even return extended<br>
reals, but normal reals, and is undefined (or rather always returns 0)<br>
if the function is not integrable (i.e. if the nn_integral of the<br>
absolute value is ∞).</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, results for lebesgue_integral usually follow<br>
fairly easily from those of nn_integral. Especially because<br>
integrability is just measurability + "nn_integral ≠ ∞" so the results<br>
for nn_integral allow you to show integrability easily, and once you<br>
have shown integrability, lebesgue_integral behaves fairly nicely.</p>
<p>(I've only contributed a little bit to this library, most of the work<br>
was done by Johannes Hölzl, so the above is just my impression from<br>
using and browsing the library)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>please be noticed that</p>
<p>(AE y::(Y,B,v). integrable (X,A,u) (λx. f (x,y)))<br>
(AE x::(X,A,u). integrable (Y,B,v) (λy. f (x,y)))</p>
<p>are conclusions of Fubini's theorem.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the definition of integrability, besides the finiteness of<br>
nn_integral (pos_fn_integral in HOL4) of the positive and negative parts,<br>
also includes the measurability of the involved functions. And actually the<br>
measurability is the main problem:</p>
<p>[integrable_def]  Definition<br>
      ⊢ ∀m f.<br>
            integrable m f ⇔<br>
            f ∈ Borel_measurable (m_space m,measurable_sets m) ∧<br>
            ∫⁺ m f⁺ ≠ +∞ ∧ ∫⁺ m f⁻ ≠ +∞</p>
<p>One may think that, if two functions f and g only differ at a null set<br>
(i.e. they're a.e.-equivalent), and one of them, say f, is measurable, then<br>
so is the other.  But this is actually not true. In fact, this argument is<br>
only true if the involved measure space is complete (i.e. all subsets of<br>
null sets are null sets too).  However their integrations are the same<br>
(when they're integrable). See the following two theorems in HOL4:</p>
<p>[integral_cong_AE]  Theorem<br>
      ⊢ ∀m f g. measure_space m ∧ (AE x::m. f x = g x) ⇒ ∫ m f = ∫ m g</p>
<p>[integrable_eq_AE]  Theorem<br>
      ⊢ ∀m f g.<br>
            complete_measure_space m ∧ integrable m f ∧<br>
            (AE x::m. f x = g x) ⇒<br>
            integrable m g</p>
<p>To see a counterexample (of integrable_eq_AE when <code>complete_measure_space</code><br>
is replaced by just <code>measure_space</code>), see the following artificial example<br>
given by Prof. Massimo Campanino (University of Bologna):</p>
<p>"I think I found an example using Cantor set C which has 0 Lebesque<br>
measure. Let f and g  both be equal to 1 on the complementary set of C. We<br>
can decompose C as the union of two disjoint non-measurable sets C_1 and<br>
C_2  using a modification of the standard example of non-measurable subset<br>
of [0, 1]. Let f be equal to 0 ang g be equal to 1/3 on C_1 and to 2/3 on<br>
C_2."</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>If f and g are both measurable functions, then {x | f x = g x /\ x IN<br>
m_space m} (abbrev: {f = g}) must be a measurable set. However, if you have<br>
just f a measurable function, and {f = g} a measurable set, then it is NOT<br>
true that g is a measurable set, UNLESS m is a complete measure space.</p>
<p>But actually I just got a new idea to resolve my problem:</p>
<p>Although the value of <code>PosInf + NegInf</code>, etc. are not specified (in latest<br>
HOL4), but if I let <code>x = PosInf + NegInf</code> in a proof, and then do a case<br>
analysis on <code>x</code>, there must be only three possibilities: x = PosInf, x =<br>
NegInf, x = Normal r, where r is an arbitrary normal real number.   But I<br>
do have proven the involved theorems under all these 3 cases (with very<br>
different proofs, sometimes), thus in theory I also have a proof when<br>
<code>PosInf + NegInf</code> is unspecified!</p>
<p>What I have just benefited from logic is that the same logical term cannot<br>
equal to different values in the same proof.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

I don't understand that statement at all. Did you mean "it is NOT true<br>
that g is a measurable function"? If yes, then, well, of course not,<br>
since {f = g} could be the empty set (which is certainly measurable) and<br>
then obviously the measurability of f does not tell you anything about<br>
g. Not sure why you are bringing this up.</p>
<p>In any case, all I said in my last email was that you should be able to<br>
easily prove</p>
<p>⊢ ∀a f g h. sigma_algebra a ∧ f ∈ Borel_measurable a ∧ g ∈<br>
Borel_measurable a ⇒ (λx. f x − g x) ∈ Borel_measurable a</p>
<p>no matter what ∞ + -∞ is defined as (including undefined, which is just<br>
some globally fixed value in HOL). But perhaps that is the same<br>
realisation that you also had in your last email.</p>

Not that easy, or just impossible. However, if f and g are positive and<br>
negative parts of the same function (h), then the theorem indeed holds<br>
without any extra antecedents:</p>
<p>[IN_MEASURABLE_BOREL_PLUS_MINUS]  Theorem<br>
      ⊢ ∀a f.<br>
            f ∈ Borel_measurable a ⇔<br>
            f⁺ ∈ Borel_measurable a ∧ f⁻ ∈ Borel_measurable a</p>
<p>My previous idea actually doesn't work. The problem is that, not only ∞ +<br>
-∞, but also the other three cases (-∞ + ∞, ∞ - ∞, -∞ - -∞) will also<br>
involve when you actually try to prove that proposition, and these four<br>
cases have in total 3^4 possible value combinations, none leads to any<br>
inconsistency.</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
The way that measurability of subtraction on ereals is proven in<br>
Isabelle strongly suggests to me that it does not depend on any<br>
particular choice of what ∞ - ∞ and -∞ - (-∞) are. I quickly checked it<br>
by defining my own ereals and leaving it undefined, and all those proofs<br>
still work fine.</p>
<p>In case you are interested in /how/ this is proven in Isabelle: You take<br>
the following lemma:</p>
<p>lemma borel_measurable_ereal2:<br>
  fixes f g :: "'a ⇒ ereal"<br>
  assumes f: "f ∈ borel_measurable M"<br>
  assumes g: "g ∈ borel_measurable M"<br>
  assumes H: "(λx. H (ereal (real_of_ereal (f x))) (ereal (real_of_ereal<br>
(g x)))) ∈ borel_measurable M"<br>
    "(λx. H (-∞) (ereal (real_of_ereal (g x)))) ∈ borel_measurable M"<br>
    "(λx. H (∞) (ereal (real_of_ereal (g x)))) ∈ borel_measurable M"<br>
    "(λx. H (ereal (real_of_ereal (f x))) (-∞)) ∈ borel_measurable M"<br>
    "(λx. H (ereal (real_of_ereal (f x))) (∞)) ∈ borel_measurable M"<br>
  shows "(λx. H (f x) (g x)) ∈ borel_measurable M"<br>
proof -<br>
  let ?G = "λy x. if g x = ∞ then H y ∞ else if g x = - ∞ then H y (-∞)<br>
else H y (ereal (real_of_ereal (g x)))"<br>
  let ?F = "λx. if f x = ∞ then ?G ∞ x else if f x = - ∞ then ?G (-∞) x<br>
else ?G (ereal (real_of_ereal (f x))) x"<br>
  { fix x have "H (f x) (g x) = ?F x" by (cases "f x" "g x" rule:<br>
ereal2_cases) auto }<br>
  note * = this<br>
  from assms show ?thesis unfolding * by simp<br>
qed</p>
<p>Then you note that the conversions between "real" and "ereal" (which are<br>
called "ereal :: real ⇒ ereal" and "real_of_ereal :: ereal ⇒ real" in<br>
Isabelle) are unconditionally Borel-measurable.</p>
<p>For the first one, that should be obvious. For the second one, note that<br>
"real_of_ereal" is clearly a continuous map from "UNIV - {±∞} :: ereal"<br>
to "UNIV :: real" and then still Borel-measurable on the entire Borel<br>
space of ereal because there are only countable many (namely 2)<br>
exceptional points.</p>
<p>I don't see why this kind of argument should not work in HOL4. This does<br>
not even assume that "∞ - ∞ = -∞ - (-∞)" or anything of the sort. It<br>
only assumes that "∞ - ∞" is some arbitrary but globally fixed value –<br>
surely that is the case in HOL4's logic.</p>

Well, if you want to do it the "proper" way, you need a logic with an<br>
explicit notion of undefinedness. Or some form of dependent types,<br>
perhaps. But I think even in Coq and Lean they often go for the "let's<br>
pick a convenient dummy result" approach as opposed to the "let's<br>
restrict the function's input to a subtype" approach when it comes to<br>
questions like "what is the integral of a non-integrable function".</p>
<p>(I don't have any hard data for that, just from anecdotes I recall from<br>
talking to people, but I'm sure someone will contradict me if the above<br>
is wrong.)</p>
<p>In Isabelle/HOL, the current consensus seems to be that convenient dummy<br>
values are the best way to go. We've yet to encounter a situation where<br>
they are a problem (and I for one do not think there is one) and they<br>
make life much easier.</p>
<p>For instance, if you define something like "ln x = (THE y. x = exp y)",<br>
the ln of all non-positive numbers is completely unspecified. If you add<br>
a "if x ≤ 0 then undefined else …", it's still unspecified, but you at<br>
least know that "ln x1 = ln x2" for any non-positive numbers x1, x2.<br>
That might sound silly to you, but the nice thing is that this allows<br>
you to prove that ln is measurable on the reals, whereas the other thing<br>
does not.</p>
<p>Of course, you could do all the maths you can do with that definition<br>
also with the previous one, but things just become a lot messier because<br>
you then have to talk about measurability on a subspace and some of the<br>
automation will probably not work anymore etc. So why not make your life<br>
a bit easier?</p>
<p>All in all, I think this fixation on defining things the "proper" way is<br>
unnecessary. But don't get me wrong, I totally understand where it is<br>
coming from, and I do think it is a legitimate view.</p>
