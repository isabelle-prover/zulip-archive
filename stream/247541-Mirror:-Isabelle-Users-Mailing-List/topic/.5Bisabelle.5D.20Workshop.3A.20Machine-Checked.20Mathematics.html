<p>From: Kevin Kappelmann &lt;<a href="mailto:kevin.kappelmann@tum.de">kevin.kappelmann@tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>Rob Lewis (CC) has been trying to send below announcement to the mailing <br>
list, but it seems like his attempts aren't going through. So I offered <br>
to forward it on his behalf:</p>
<hr>
<p>Sander Dahmen, Assia Mahboubi, and I have been planning a workshop for a <br>
while at the Lorentz Center in Leiden. Pandemic planning is impossible <br>
and the workshop keeps changing shape. But we can finally be certain <br>
enough to announce: we will be hosting a virtual workshop, <br>
Machine-Checked Mathematics, March 2-4! It will happen European <br>
afternoons, in an attempt to be accessible by as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Our workshop is organized around the idea of a “library showcase.” Proof <br>
assistant users from different communities will introduce the audience <br>
to some definition, design decision, abstraction, tool, or other feature <br>
of their library that is particularly good at serving some purpose. <br>
These showcases will be demo-style, with plenty of time for questions <br>
and discussion. We strongly encourage interacting with the presenters <br>
during these demos.</p>
<p>The goal of these showcases is not for people to describe an entire <br>
library or present a formal paper. The formalized mathematics community <br>
is small and fragmented into even smaller communities by prover choice. <br>
We want to spur discussion of how good ideas can be adopted or adapted <br>
across community boundaries.</p>
<p>We're still confirming and scheduling speakers. A preliminary schedule <br>
is on our website: <a href="https://lean-forward.github.io/lorentz-center-meeting/">https://lean-forward.github.io/lorentz-center-meeting/</a><br>
The event is officially happening through the Lorentz Center, so if <br>
you're interested, please register as soon as possible at <br>

<p>Hope to see many of you there!</p>
<p>-Rob (and Sander and Assia)</p>
