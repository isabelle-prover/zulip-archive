Hi, I've noticed that lately every single time<br>
I use Sledgehammer, cvc4 always returns the message "the prover <br>
crashed".<br>
e, z3, vampire either give me proofs or time out.</p>
<p>cvc4 simply never works and if my memory serves me well this<br>
issue must have started with Isabelle 2021.</p>
<p>Any insights?</p>
<p>Many thanks<br>
Best wishes,<br>
Angeliki</p>

From my point of view, it is definitely the case that the Sledgehammer provers crash more frequently<br>
and produce failed proofs more frequently in Isabelle2021 than they did in Isabelle2020.  However,<br>
taking the whole set of tools in Sledgehammer as an ensemble, much more amazing results are produced<br>
in Isabelle2021 than in previous versions.  The SMT provers can routinely produce "one-liners" that<br>
replace tens of lines (or more) of written-out Isar code.  (Of course, you have to throw away all the<br>
failed proofs and take the ones that work.)  This capability makes Sledgehammer extremely useful in<br>
an approach to proof development where the human prover can make proposals for "big steps" in a proof,<br>
with the expectation that if a proposed assertion is in fact true, then an SMT prover driven from'<br>
Sledgehammer has a very good chance of being able to verify this.</p>
<p>My personal experience is that SMT-based proofs tend to be rather more fragile with respect to changes<br>
in the underlying definitions that proofs based on the less-powerful methods, so once a proof has<br>
been sketched out and verified with the help of Sledgehammer, it is well worth the extra effort to go<br>
through and eliminate the uses of SMT and in the process identify reasoning patterns that can be<br>
codified in simplification rules, etc.  Nevertheless it is quite a boon to be able to verify a proof plan<br>
in "big chunks" and then come back and refine it, knowing already that it has been verified that<br>
the proof is correct in outline.</p>
<p>For me, the most annoying new behavior in Sledgehammer in Isabelle2021 is the tendency in certain<br>
situations to claim to have found a proof and then to spit out Isar code that doesn't even "show"<br>
the lemma that was supposed to have been proved.  This is apparently some kind of issue in replaying<br>
in the proof kernel the results of the SMT searches, but as I have very little understanding of<br>
how that all works, I will stop there.  Would it be so difficult to ensure that any proposed Isar<br>
proofs really do "show" the lemma that they are supposed to be showing?  I tried early on after<br>
the release of Isabelle2021 to capture examples of this, but as it didn't seem like it was helping,<br>
I gave up on that for the moment.</p>
<p>I also frequently see failures of the SMT solvers with segmentation faults.  These no doubt<br>
represent programming errors in the SMT solvers.  The wisdom of an LCF-style system with a<br>
"trusted kernel" proves itself over and over again by making it possible to accomplish something<br>
useful with very powerful, but potentially buggy, tools.</p>
<p>I find it generally very difficult "in the heat of the moment" when working on a theory<br>
of several thousand lines that depend on a context of tens of thousands lines of other theories,<br>
to capture useful repeatable instances of the various ways in which Sledgehammer fails.<br>
The randomness in the Sledgehammer procedures, which I think probably derives not only from<br>
randomness in the SMT solvers themselves, but also from fact caching mechanisms that at<br>
work in Isabelle, makes repeatability problematic in many cases.  I would be interested to hear<br>
from the developers any advice as to how I might be able to provide them with useful failure<br>
cases to help reduce the number of bugs overall.</p>
<p>Finally, the timing figures produced by Sledgehammer currently have very little connection to<br>
reality, in my opinion.  I generally select a particular proposed proof based on the length and<br>
content of the list of facts used, rather than paying too much attention to the timing figures.<br>
The discrepancy between the timings reported by Sledgehammer when the proof is proposed and<br>
the time available from Isabelle/JEdit seems to have become larger with Isabelle2021, however<br>
at around the time of the release of Isabelle2021 I started to use a 10-core processor for<br>
development, so it is possible that the increased discrepancies have something to do with tallying<br>
the time used by the larger number of threads.</p>
