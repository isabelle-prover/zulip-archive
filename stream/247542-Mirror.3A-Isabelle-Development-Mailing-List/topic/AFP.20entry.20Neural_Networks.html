Neural_Networks is badly broken. I took a look and the failure is in a proof that tests whether a certain generated construction is equal to an explicit construction. They are supposed to be literally identical and are not. I think we should get back to the authors to find out why it failed and how it can be made robust.</p>

Hi,<br>
I did a first investigation. Overall, this part of the theory is <br>
intended to serve as regression test. Thus, it worked as it should: <br>
acting as early warning for subtle changes that otherwise would go <br>
undetected, potentially creating "bit rot".</p>
<p>The change is actually due to a difference in Poly/ML used in Isabelle <br>
2025 vs the current development version (and, 2025-1, for that matter). <br>
Namely:</p>
<p>ML\&lt;open&gt;<br>
     PackReal32Little.fromBytes (Word8Vector.fromList [0wxC5, 0wx10, <br>
0wxE8, 0wx3B])<br>
\&lt;close&gt;</p>
<p>returns a different value, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isabelle 2025:           val it = 0.007082077209: PackReal32Little.real</li>
<li>Isabelle development/2025-1:      val it = 0.007082077: <br>
PackReal32Little.real</li>
</ul>
<p>As the rule-of-thumb regarding the precision of 32 IEEE-745 floating <br>
point numbers is around 7-8 decimal digits, the new behaviour is OK. <br>
Hence, the fix to get the AFP entry working again is to update the <br>
theories to reflect the new values.</p>
<p>We will take care of this tomorrow.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Achim (and Amy)</p>

<p>I find it surprising that the meaning of a specific bit pattern as a real number according to an established floating-point standard can change from year to year. How do we know it won't change again?</p>
