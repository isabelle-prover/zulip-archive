<strong>* Isabelle/jEdit Prover IDE </strong>*</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for screen reader technology via Java Accessibility API<br>
(JAAPI), for blind or visually impaired users. Tested with:</p>
<ul>
<li>NVDA (Windows), see <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org">https://www.nvaccess.org</a></li>
<li>JAWS (Windows), see <a href="https://support.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS">https://support.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS</a></li>
<li>VoiceOver (macOS), builtin Command-F5</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This refers to Isabelle/d83e23a67e9c. The most relevant source file is here <br>
<a href="https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle/file/d83e23a67e9c/src/Tools/jEdit/src/jedit_accessible.scala">https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle/file/d83e23a67e9c/src/Tools/jEdit/src/jedit_accessible.scala</a> <br>
--- plus a few patches on the jEdit code base.</p>
<p>It is an initial result of an ongoing project (from Sep-2025 to Sep-2026) with <br>
Johannes Kepler University Linz, which is about Isabelle/MAWEN, an accessible <br>
learning environment for mathematics.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we had initial attempts with Isabelle/VSCode: it was first <br>
successful (by mere luck) and later stopped working due to arbitrary changes <br>
to the very dynamic code base of VSCode. We did not want to make ourselves <br>
depend on such a "super cool" project, so we revisited the ancient JAAPI for <br>
Java/Swing instead. Hardly anybody knows about, but it turned out pretty clean <br>
and straightforward to use. Each of the different screen readers requires some <br>
minor tinkering to make it work smoothly.</p>
<p>As usual for Java/Swing, the "proof of existence" is provided by IntelliJ <br>
IDEA, which is both a major Java IDE and a major Swing application. IntelliJ <br>
works quite well with screen readers, as if that could be to be expected by <br>
default --- but it is actually quite unusual.</p>
