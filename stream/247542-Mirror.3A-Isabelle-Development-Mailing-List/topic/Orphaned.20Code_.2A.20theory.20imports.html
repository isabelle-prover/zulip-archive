In AFP entries Separation_Logic_Imperative_HOL, CAVA_Automata, <br>
Collections and Ordinary_Differential_Equations, there were some <br>
(indirect) imports of Code_* theories from HOL-Library where actually no <br>
code generation was involved.</p>
<p>I have removed these in <br>
<a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/isa-afp/afp-devel/-/commit/ccc0b81823579c3d522a916b165bcc0bdf0d1ffb">https://foss.heptapod.net/isa-afp/afp-devel/-/commit/ccc0b81823579c3d522a916b165bcc0bdf0d1ffb</a> <br>
with no directly observable effect, but since these imports have been in <br>
place for quite a long time there might be applications where it is <br>
appropriate to explicitly import HOL-Library.Code_Target_Numeral and <br>
similar.</p>

Hi Florian</p>
<p>This sounds like a very fragile (and dangerous) change. It will affect <br>
all code-exports in theories that depend on the changed theories.</p>
<p>The observable effects may only be in the performance (and bindings to <br>
external code), which you won't see in the standard AFP tests.</p>
<p>I do not understand why you got rid of the Code_Target_ICF theory (and <br>
you could, along the same lines, get rid of CAVA_Code_Target). These <br>
theories where meant to provide a default sensible setup for the code <br>
generator, by combining several Code_Target theories. You have now <br>
removed that abstraction, and inlined it where it was used</p>

Hi Peter,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The combination of several theories over time has boiled down to <br>
HOL-Library.Code_Target_Numeral as the only one. This is an official <br>
hook which users can import if they want that particular setup. This is <br>
a deliberate decision not supposed to be obscured by transitive imports.</p>
<p>Why? Changing the code setup if non-monotonous. Technically, you get a <br>
default setup if you do nothing special, and you may change that default <br>
setup by importing particular theories. But then there is no supported <br>
way back again.</p>
<p>Admittedly I have recently blurred that simple picture by introducing <br>
HOL-Library.Code_Bit_Shifts_for_Arithmetic, but this is likely to be <br>
transient situation: if this theory proves what it promises it could be <br>
incorporated into HOL-Library.Code_Target_Numeral.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>CAVA_Code_Target is still there.</p>

<p>Indeed. One of my aims is to get rid of transitive, unintentional <br>
imports of HOL-Library.Code_Target_Numeral. I had a look at the <br>
immediate neighborhood of the affected places and tried best to identify <br>
spots where the import of HOL-Library.Code_Target_Numeral is intentional <br>
/ appropriate, but the situation got very intricate over the years and <br>
there might be subtle dependency paths.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>There is an important observable effect of AFP test performance: the <br>
duration of the long sessions as well as the ability to test the whole <br>
AFP within reasonable time and resource limits.</p>
<p>Of course there is a chance applications may degrade in performance <br>
unnoticed, but for actively maintained applications there are still a <br>
few months before the next release where things can be ironed out.</p>
<p>There have been so many re-arrangements of that material in recent times <br>
that the change in question only adds modestly to that general risk.</p>
