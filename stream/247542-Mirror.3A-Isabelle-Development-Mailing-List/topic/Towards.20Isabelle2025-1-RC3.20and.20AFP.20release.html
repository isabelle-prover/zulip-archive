<p><strong>From:</strong> Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;</p>
<p>My original plan was to publish the next release candidate yesterday, but I <br>
was too busy elsewhere and a few notable points are still open. It will happen <br>
within a few days.</p>
<p>We are already &gt; 3 weeks into the official release process, and the <br>
isabelle-dev repository is still blocked. I usually try to keep that state of <br>
uncertainty at approx. 2 weeks (which is already quite a lot). Sometimes <br>
people get uneasy to push changes that are for the next release onto it.</p>
<p>The fork of isabelle-dev vs. isabelle-release should have happened for RC2, <br>
but without AFP moving as well, it would merely cause even more confusion. So <br>
what is the current plan AFP? We have again a situation of "several weeks <br>
delay for no particular reasons", do we?</p>

<p>There's no reason why there should be urgency to add new features for after the current release into the repo right now. It’s easy in distributed version control to wait with such merges. It’s good that we have the fork process, but that should be a safety feature, not an excuse for chaos.</p>

<p>I’ve been busy elsewhere as well, but we can do the AFP fork soon. Let me announce it for Mon, we’ll see if that sparks the usual last minute panic requests.</p>

<p>Great.</p>
<p>So I can announce RC3 with the repository fork for Mon 01-Dec-2025 or Tue <br>
02-Dec-2025 at 11:00 RBT (Royal Bavarian Time). I will tell later which day it <br>
will be.</p>
<p>The fork will happen at the same time. Anything still happening on <br>
isabelle-dev until the fork is for Isabelle2025-1 release: It should be <br>
finalization / polishing of already present things, no new "features", no "bug <br>
fixes" for old problems from past releases.</p>

<p>Gerwin, we do have a big chaos already: more and more post-release changes on <br>
isabelle-dev are coming in. (These are things that are not strictly necessary <br>
to turn RC2 into a proper stable release eventually.)</p>
<p>From long years of experience as release manager, that is caused by having &gt; <br>
2 weeks of "uncertainty" on the status of isabelle-dev: Is it before or after <br>
the release? How does it relate to afp-devel? Shall I push now or much later?</p>
<p>We cannot change that situation for now, but I am hoping for next time, which <br>
means that the Isabelle release schedule is properly aligned with AFP <br>
beforehand --- it will save a lot of time for both of us.</p>
<p>Right now, I will merely apply the specification of the "before-vs-after <br>
release point" semantically to current isabelle-dev vs. isabelle-release, with <br>
the side-condition that the persistent history is not messed up unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Thus the feature additions by Tobias shortly after RC2 are included by <br>
accident, because they are already on isabelle-release: 58fc6856e31a <br>
concerning HOL-Library.While, 65734c8badd5 concerning newly introduced <br>
HOL-Library.Time_Functions. Obscure corners of HOL-Library are not main HOL, <br>
after all.</p>
<p>Other changes and feature additions by Martin and Jasmin on main HOL <br>
(concerning cvc5 and metis) are not included: 764bc386d7dc etc. and a12a78878d4a.</p>
<p>The fork-point for the release shall be:</p>
<p>changeset:   83654:52cd371a36dd<br>
user:        wenzelm<br>
date:        Wed Nov 26 20:00:47 2025 +0100<br>
files:       Admin/Mercurial/mercurial-6.1.4-hgweb.patch<br>
description:<br>
adhoc patch for hgweb.wsgi: provide "hg clone" via HTTP without suffering from <br>
Denial-of-Service attacks on website content (e.g. by Non-Intelligent Agents);</p>
<p>I will write a formal posting later today, to explain the status of the <br>
different repositories, as usual. In particular, changes for the release need <br>
to be sent to me via email, and <em>not</em> pushed onto isabelle-dev at the same time.</p>
<p>We are already late in the release process, and the year is approaching its <br>
end. I hope to be able to publish the final and ultimate release until <br>
17-Dec-2025, still within the plan that was published some months ago: <br>
<a href="https://sketis.net/2025/plan-for-isabelle2025-1-december-2025">https://sketis.net/2025/plan-for-isabelle2025-1-december-2025</a></p>
<p>Here is also a notable quotation from that post:</p>
<p>"""<br>
Important: Contributors need to have things ready for RC1 or RC2. There need <br>
to be several weeks left to consolidate everything, before the release becomes <br>
final and unchangable (until the subsequent release).<br>
