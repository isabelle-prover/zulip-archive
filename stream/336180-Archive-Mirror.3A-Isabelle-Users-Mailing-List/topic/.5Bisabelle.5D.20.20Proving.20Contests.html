<p>From: José Manuel Rodriguez Caballero &lt;<a href="mailto:josephcmac@gmail.com">josephcmac@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Nice project. My idea of an International Olympiad in Isabelle are a little<br>
bit different. Indeed, I can summarize my vision as follows:</p>
<p>1) There will be some publicity about the International Olympiad some<br>
months before its date. The publicity should be mainly addressed to<br>
undergraduate and high school students. People interested in the Olympiad<br>
should summit their email addresses in a website. People working with<br>
Isabelle in an official research project, e.g., a Master, a PhD, a<br>
professor or a professional programmer, are not allowed to apply in order<br>
to guarantee more space for beginners.</p>
<p>2) The day of the Olympiad, a thy-file with a theorem followed by sorry<br>
will be sent to each one of the email addresses.</p>
<p>3) People can submit their solutions until 6 hours after their received the<br>
email  with the problem (5 hours to solve the problem and 1 hour to make a<br>
break, I guess). Solutions sent after the deadline will be automatically<br>
ignored.</p>
<p>4) An automatic system (software) will discriminate the invalid solutions,<br>
e.g., using sorry somewhere, from the valid solutions. After that, it will<br>
make an ordering according to the running time of each valid solution.</p>
<p>5) Finally, an email with the ranking of his/her solution will be<br>
automatically sent to each participant. The participants having ranking 1,<br>
2, 3 will receive a prize.</p>
<p>When I think about such an international project, I am mainly concerned<br>
with people living in economically less developed countries. The idea is<br>
that a person from such countries, having the dream of winning an<br>
International Olympiad in Isabelle will have a motivation to improve<br>
himself/herself in this field. Of course, classification by countries<br>
should be avoided and people from highly developed countries should be<br>
allowed to participate as well.</p>
<p>This is just a dream, I have not enough free time to do something about it.<br>
My inspiration are the IOI: <a href="https://ioinformatics.org/">https://ioinformatics.org/</a></p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
José M.</p>
