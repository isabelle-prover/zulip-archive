Hi Peter,</p>
<p>I am not an expert in this but here is some information.</p>
<p>Peter Chapman writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a series of methods to apply which looks something like this</p>
<p>apply (rule ((basic)+)?, ((conjL)+)?, ((disjR)+)?, ...)</p>
<p>Is there anyway that I can rename the above to something, say  <br>
bigRule, so that</p>
<p>apply (rule bigRule)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this can be done, but must be done on the ML-level.</p>
<p>Judging from your apply-line, you want to apply rule basic as often as <br>
possible (possibly not at all), after this you want to do the same <br>
with rule conjL, and so on. To keep things in line with Isabelle-<br>
terminology (and for understanding the documentation), let's call <br>
basic, conjL, disjR.... <em>theorems</em>. I guess they are axioms or lemmas <br>
in your proof-script and such things are in Isabelle called <br>
theorems, or short thm ;o)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>executes the first line?  I had an attempt using ML as</p>
<p>ML {* fun PETER (basic, impR, impL, conjL, disjR, false, conjR,  <br>
disjL) = REPEAT (EVERY [basic, impR, impL, conjL, disjR, false,  <br>
conjR, disjL]); *}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This already goes in the right direction. You have to write what<br>
is called in Isabelle a tactical. EVERY and REPEAT are building<br>
blocks for tacticals. This is described in chapter 4 of the Isabelle-<br>
reference and also in 3.2 (look at the Isabelle webpage). First <br>
applying a theorem, like basic and disjL, is done with rtac. For <br>
example, for </p>
<p>lemma "A /\ B"<br>
    apply(rule conjI)    </p>
<p>you can also do the following </p>
<p>lemma "A /\ B"<br>
    apply(tactic {* rtac conjI 1 *})</p>
<p>to achieve pretty much the same on the ML-level (conjI is the theorem<br>
that is applied, 1 refers to the first subgoal and "tactic {* *}" is a <br>
wrapper to call some ML-code from a proof-script). </p>
<p>You want to apply "rtac conjI 1" as often as possible including<br>
the possibility of not at all. For this you have to use REPEAT. For<br>
example</p>
<p>lemma "(A /\ B) /\ C"<br>
    apply(tactic {* REPEAT (rtac conjI 1) *})</p>
<p>applies theorem conjI twice producing the goals A, B and C. Next you<br>
want to do such things with a sequence of theorems. For this you<br>
can use EVERY (this takes a list of tactics and applies them one<br>
after the other. For example</p>
<p>lemma "(A \/ B) /\ C"<br>
    apply(tactic {* EVERY [REPEAT (rtac conjI 1), REPEAT (rtac disjI2 1)] *})</p>
<p>first takes apart the conjunction and then applies theorem disjI2,<br>
i.e. produces goals B and C. With a bit of ML-hackery you can <br>
scale this up to your example and introduce some bigrule-shorthand. </p>
<p>However, from what you are writing I guess you just want to try out<br>
some rules on a goal and take it apart when a safe rule applies;<br>
and repeat this process recursively with all the subgoals. This is not <br>
quite what your apply-line achieves (because of the imposed ordering). <br>
If this is what you want, I would write </p>
<p>REPEAT (FIRST [rtac conjI1 1,.....])</p>
<p>Hope this is helpful. The code above only works on the first subgoal. <br>
You might, however, like to apply your tactical to all subgoals that<br>
have arisen in this process of taking goals apart. This can all be done <br>
with tacticals. However, be aware that writing tacticals can be a bit <br>
of a black art. ;o) Good luck</p>
<p>Christian</p>
