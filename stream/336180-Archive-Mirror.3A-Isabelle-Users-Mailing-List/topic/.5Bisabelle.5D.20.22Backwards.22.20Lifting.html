<p>From: Mario Alvarez &lt;<a href="mailto:mmalvare@eng.ucsd.edu">mmalvare@eng.ucsd.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle Users,</p>
<p>Let me apologize in advance if this question reflects some fundamental<br>
misunderstandings about Isabelle's Lifting and Transfer facilities. I am<br>
still new to them and, while I've read the documentation about them, I<br>
still feel shaky about my intuitions.</p>
<p>My mental model of the Lifting package is the following: if for some types<br>
typeb and typea I can prove</p>
<p>"type_definition Rep Abs A" (for Rep :: typeb =&gt; typea, Abs : typea =&gt;<br>
typeb, A :: typea set)</p>
<p>then I can feed this theorem to the Lifting tool to lift definitions that<br>
talks about the concrete type A to definitions that talk about the abstract<br>
type B. (And I can use Transfer to assist in proving theorems about the<br>
functions I derive this way).</p>
<p>My question is whether Isabelle contains any support for automated lifting<br>
when the relationship is reversed. That is, suppose I have a suite of<br>
definitions for the "abstract" type B and I want to "lower" them to<br>
definitions on type A (where we know the same type_definition fact<br>
indicated above).</p>
<p>It seemed to me that there probably wasn't a way to do this in general.<br>
Although in some concrete cases it does seem that there is something sane<br>
you can do - for instance, we could prove "type_definition Some<br>
(case_option undefined id) {x . ∃ y . x = Some y}". And then map_option<br>
would seem to be the "lowering" function we'd be looking for.</p>
<p>However, I saw the description of the "Transfer.transferred" attribute in<br>
isar-ref, and, while I did not fully understand it, it seemed like it might<br>
be something akin to what I was looking for. It at least made me question<br>
whether there is something sane that can be done in the "reverse" direction<br>
in the general case.</p>
<p>So my question is basically</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is there anything sane that can be done in general when it comes to this<br>
sort of "lowering"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does Isabelle have any automation that supports such "lowering" in a<br>
similar way to its support for Lifting?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regardless of the answers to 1 and 2, what exactly does<br>
"Transfer.transferred" do?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Mario</p>

Dear Mario,</p>
<p>I’m not an export on transfer on my own, but merely a user.</p>
<p>From my experience transfer-lifting mostly works uni-directional.<br>
However, there is an attribute “untransferred” that permits to go in<br>
the other direction. Example:</p>
<p>typedef large_nat = "{ x :: nat. x ≥ 5 }" by auto</p>
<p>setup_lifting type_definition_large_nat</p>
<p>lift_definition sq_large_nat :: "large_nat ⇒ large_nat" is "λ x. x * x"<br>
  by (meson leD leI le_less_trans le_square)</p>
<p>lift_definition get_nat :: "large_nat ⇒ nat" is "λ x. x" .</p>
<p>lemma sq_20: "get_nat (sq_large_nat x) ≥ 20" <br>
proof (transfer)<br>
  (* this is the standard direction *)<br>
  fix x :: nat<br>
  assume "5 ≤ x" <br>
  hence "5 * 5 ≤ x * x"<br>
    using mult_le_mono by blast<br>
  thus "20 ≤ x * x" by auto <br>
qed</p>
<p>(* and now we can go in the other direction *)<br>
thm sq_20[untransferred] (* results in 5 ≤ x ⟹ 20 ≤ x * x *)</p>
<p>Best,<br>
René</p>

<p>From: Mario Alvarez &lt;<a href="mailto:mmalvare@eng.ucsd.edu">mmalvare@eng.ucsd.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi René,</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. I guess perhaps I was confused about the difference<br>
between "transferred" and "untransferred" (although I have to admit I'm<br>
still not clear on what "untransferred" does, since I had thought that it<br>
did more or less what you described "transferred" as doing in your example.)</p>
<p>I'd still appreciate it if anyone could help me out with an intuition for<br>
what "untransferred" does, but I think I've gotten the main thing I wanted<br>
to know from René's reply; namely, that I can only lift definitions one way<br>
(using Lifting) but that (at least under some circumstances) I can transfer<br>
<em>facts</em> about my lifted constants in the reverse direction.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Mario</p>
