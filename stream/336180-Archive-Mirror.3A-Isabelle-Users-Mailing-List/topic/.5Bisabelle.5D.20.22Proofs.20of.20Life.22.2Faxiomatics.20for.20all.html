<p>From: Rene Vestergaard &lt;<a href="mailto:renevestergaard@acm.org">renevestergaard@acm.org</a>&gt;<br>
I've been unable to find a venue that's prepared to take on the task of <br>
reviewing the work. The little feedback I've been able to obtain seems <br>
to indicate that the desk/chief editors were unwilling to go ahead with <br>
work that does not fit within their prior experiences. Of course, this <br>
leaves no room for multi- and antedisciplinary[*] efforts like Proofs of <br>
Life. My suggestions of an editor group have been roundly ignored.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of places with a proven record for mixed work?</p>
<p>Outside-the-box thoughts?</p>
<p>[The arXiv version is up to v3. The changes have mostly been about <br>
background and, in particular, about translating axiomatic reasoning and <br>
its meta-theory-carried implications into the languages of the other <br>
naturally-involved subjects. The manuscript is slightly too big for most <br>
wide-audience venues as it stands.]</p>

<p>ABSTRACT<br>
We axiomatize the molecular-biology reasoning style, show compliance of <br>
the standard reference: Ptashne, A Genetic Switch, and present <br>
proof-theory-induced technologies to help infer phenotypes and to <br>
predict life cycles from genotypes. The key is to note that <br>
`reductionist discipline' entails constructive reasoning: any proof of a <br>
compound property can be decomposed to proofs of constituent properties. <br>
Proof theory makes explicit the inner structure of the axiomatized <br>
reasoning style and allows the permissible dynamics to be presented as a <br>
mode of computation that can be executed and analyzed. Constructivity <br>
and execution guarantee simulation when working over domain-specific <br>
languages. Here, we exhibit phenotype properties for genotype reasons: a <br>
molecular-biology argument is an open-system concurrent computation that <br>
results in compartment changes and is performed among processes of <br>
physiology change as determined from the molecular programming of given <br>
DNA. Life cycles are the possible sequentializations of the processes. A <br>
main implication of our construction is that formal correctness provides <br>
a complementary perspective on science that is as fundamental there as <br>
for pure mathematics. The bulk of the presented work has been verified <br>
formally correct by computer.</p>
