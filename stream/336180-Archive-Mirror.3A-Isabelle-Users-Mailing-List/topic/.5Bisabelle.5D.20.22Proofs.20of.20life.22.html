<p>ESSENCE<br>
Mathematics-style correctness works for molecular biology and enables <br>
phenotype and life-cycle prediction from genotypes. Formally, <br>
reductionist science involves constructive reasoning, i.e., executable <br>
simulation.</p>
<p>SIGNIFICANCE<br>
Axiomatic reasoning provides an alternative perspective that allows us <br>
to address long-standing open problems in biology. Our approach is <br>
supported by meta-theory and likely applies to any reductionist discipline.</p>
<p>ABSTRACT<br>
Science relies on external correctness: statistical analysis and <br>
reproducibility, with ready applicability but inherent false <br>
positives/negatives. Mathematics uses internal correctness: conclusions <br>
must be established by detailed reasoning, with high confidence and deep <br>
insights but not necessarily real-world significance. Here, we formalize <br>
the molecular-biology reasoning style; establish that it constitutes an <br>
executable first-principle theory of cell behaviors that admits <br>
predictive technologies, with a range of correctness guarantees; and <br>
show that we can fully account for the standard reference: Ptashne, A <br>
Genetic Switch. Everything works for principled reasons and is presented <br>
within an open-ended meta-theoretic framework that seemingly applies to <br>
any reductionist discipline. The framework is adapted from a <br>
century-long line of work on mathematical reasoning. The key step is to <br>
not admit reasoning based on an external notion of truth but work only <br>
with what can be justified from considered assumptions. For molecular <br>
biology, the induced theory involves the concurrent running/interference <br>
of molecule-coded elementary processes of physiology change over the <br>
genome. The life cycle of the single-celled monograph organism is <br>
predicted in molecular detail as the aggregate of the possible <br>
sequentializations of the coded-for processes. The difficult question of <br>
molecular coding, i.e., the specific means of gene regulation, is <br>
addressed via a detailed modeling methodology. We establish a <br>
complementary perspective on science, complete with a proven correctness <br>
notion, and use it to make progress on long-standing and critical open <br>
problems in biology.</p>

<p>I agree. Indeed, I cancelled my independent research project about<br>
detection of cancer cells using proof assistants for lack of funding. Here<br>
is the link to my cancelled campaign:<br>
<a href="http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/1176467506/cancer-vs-mathematics/">http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/1176467506/cancer-vs-mathematics/</a></p>
<p>My idea was as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A medical doctor takes a sample of cells from a part of the patient's<br>
body that he/she suspects it is cancerous.</p>
<p>(2) A machine transfers the chemical structure of the ATP molecules from<br>
the cells to a computer.</p>
<p>(3) A proof assistant take as input an ATP molecule and it returns TRUE if<br>
it is generated by respiration, otherwise, it returns FALSE (in this case,<br>
the ATP was generated by fermentation).</p>
<p>(4) According to Warburg's theory, the proportion of values TRUE and FALSE<br>
will determines if the sample is cancerous or not.</p>
<p>I was interested in developing a library in Isabelle/HOL for step (3), but<br>
maybe someone else will do it in the future: I have not material conditions<br>
to adventure in an independent scientific research.</p>
<p>The naked mole rats are the living proof that Warburg was right: these<br>
animals cannot develop cancer, because their cells are adapted to both the<br>
ATP generated by respiration and the ATP generated by fermentation.<br>
