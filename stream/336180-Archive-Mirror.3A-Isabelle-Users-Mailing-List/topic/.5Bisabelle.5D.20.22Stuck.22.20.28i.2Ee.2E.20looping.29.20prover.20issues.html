<p>From: "Eugene W. Stark" &lt;<a href="mailto:stark@cs.stonybrook.edu">stark@cs.stonybrook.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Since there is a thread going about various kinds of hanging, I would<br>
like to ask about behavior that I have experienced (with Isabelle2014).<br>
Basically the symptom is that the prover becomes unresponsive, though JEdit<br>
does still respond.  Often, the entire buffer becomes highlighted in pink,<br>
and many times it is impossible to continue without exiting JEdit<br>
(thereby exiting the prover) and restarting.  While in the stuck state,<br>
the prover (Poly process) exhibits constant CPU consumption.  It does not<br>
appear to be a thrashing issue because the disk traffic is low and CPU<br>
utilization high.</p>
<p>I have only rarely seen this problem on my home system, which is a year-old<br>
i5 processor with four cores (I am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) and 8GB RAM.<br>
However, it occurs much more often on my office machine, which is a venerable<br>
32-bit, one-core system with 2GB (also running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS).<br>
In fact, it is pretty much impossible to use "try" on that machine because<br>
it almost always results in a stuck prover.  Once the situation has arisen,<br>
attempting to delete the "try" from the JEdit buffer does not successfully<br>
cancel the ongoing proof attempt.</p>
<p>I would be interested to know what I should be looking for in order to try<br>
to solve this.  When I noticed it this morning on my home system, it appeared<br>
to be because there were several threads occupied by various proof attempts<br>
(I think "blast") that did not terminate.  In this particular case I was<br>
able to recover by erasing the "by blast" lines, but when things are truly<br>
stuck (especially on the one-core system) this does not help.</p>
<p>Another situation I have gotten into that produced similar symptoms is when<br>
I inadvertently created recursive simplifier rules.  However, I don't think<br>
this is usually the issue.</p>
<p>My question is: is it supposed to be possible for prover threads to hang<br>
around indefinitely (purple mark in right margin and proof method highlighted<br>
in purple) without timing out in some reasonable period?  If so, why,<br>
and what should I look for to try to fix the problem?  If not, then this would<br>
seem to be an issue that should be looked into.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>This description generally sounds like a forced break due to the Poly/ML <br>
process doing garbage collection in a tight memory situation.  The <br>
automatic heap resizing usually stays below the available physical memory, <br>
to avoid disk thrashing for VM use, but this comes at the cost of quite <br>
aggressive attempts to reclaim heap space. It can take 0.5 to 1 min to do <br>
so, and the grey-pink to disappear.</p>

<p>That machine is indeed very old and small.  I've just made some <br>
experiments with Isabelle2015-RC1 on some virtual machine of that size. <br>
It basically works for things like HOL/Library or HOL/Decision_Procs, but <br>
is not much fun.</p>
<p>It becomes impossible if the Linux system is actually running a 64bit OS. <br>
In that case you should make sure that the 32bit C/C++ libraries are <br>
installed, to avoid doubling memory usage of the Poly/ML process.</p>
<p>These days the bottom line is at approx. 2 cores, 4 GB -- i.e. the oldest <br>
machine that I happen to have around for testing (from 2009).</p>

<p>Of course, proof tools can hang around indefinitely in their potential <br>
non-termination. This is inherent in the game we are playing here.  E.g. <br>
an ill-behaved "by simp" or "by blast" will continue sucking up CPU <br>
resources, until it is removed from the proof document.</p>
<p>The "auto" tools of the IDE are slightly different (auto quickcheck, auto <br>
methods etc.): they have a builtin timeout.  Sometimes it can still take <br>
longer than expected to terminate non-terminating tools.  I think that <br>
"auto methods" is particularly dangerous here, but it is not enabled by <br>
default.  (It is a variant of 'try'.)</p>
<p>Note that Isabelle2015-RC1 has various refinements in the scheduling of <br>
tasks.  So it is worth trying to see if it makes a difference -- or if it <br>
has newly introduced problems in the attempt to solve old problems.</p>

BTW, Windows 7 works quite well for such old hardware: the IDE is also a <br>
bit more smooth, since the graphics sub-system is better supported by <br>
Java/AWT.</p>

As a potentially useful point of information regarding the subject problem,<br>
after reading some recent messages on the list that talked about the possibility<br>
of changing the maximum number of prover threads, I went on my office machine<br>
(the very old one-core Xeon with hyperthreading), changed the number of threads<br>
to 2 (it was 0) and did a "isabelle build -s HOL".  Now when I run Isabelle and do:</p>
<p>ML {* Multithreading.max_threads_value () *}</p>
<p>it reports 2 instead of 1.  In addition, it is now possible to cancel ongoing<br>
"try" without the looping/hanging occurring as it was before the change.<br>
The machine is slow, obviously, but it is usable.</p>
<p>So I think there might be an issue (in Isabelle2014) that shows up when the<br>
maximum number of prover threads is 1.  Maybe this information will help to<br>
identify it or at least help somebody else in the same situation.</p>
