Dear list members,</p>
<p>A few days ago I got the email copied below.  And I don't<br>
very well know what to say to it.  Does anyone here have<br>
a good answer to Arnold's query?</p>
<p>(I'm cross-posting this to a couple of mailing lists.  So my<br>
excuses for the duplication, but I'm really curious whether<br>
there is anything interesting to say to this question.)</p>

I think it depends on whether you adopt the proposal in its extreme  <br>
form or in a limited form. No single formal system suffices for the  <br>
formalisation of all of mathematics, but well-known systems including  <br>
higher order logic (which is actually fairly weak) suffice to  <br>
formalise immense chunks of mathematics. Even if we restrict ourselves  <br>
to the algebra and analysis typically taught to mathematics  <br>
undergraduates in the first couple of years, I think the great  <br>
majority of this material has never been formalised.<br>

<p>From: Randy Pollack &lt;<a href="mailto:rpollack@inf.ed.ac.uk">rpollack@inf.ed.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
If the question is "what to suggest to Arnold Neumaier", here is my<br>
suggestion: work on specific project(s) while keeping dreams of large<br>
scale formalized textbook mathematics in mind for the future.</p>
<p>There are projects on formalizing specific mathematics, such as<br>
Flyspeck, clearly inspiring and useful for the long term goal of<br>
formal mathematics.  Equally, much tool development needs doing before<br>
large scale textbook mathematics is feasibly formalizable: large scale<br>
libraries, search, cooperative working (like a WIKI).  Much to do in<br>
automation, decision procedures, ...  Even syntax notations in<br>
existing tools are inadequate for really large scale formalization.<br>
Foundations: as Larry said, HOL <em>suffices</em> to formalize immense chunks<br>
of mathematics, but that doesn't mean that it is the right choice.<br>
HOL (as we know it) could use more polymorphism.  HOL suffices, but is<br>
not convenient, when you want to do induction over the height of<br>
derivations of some inductively defined relation.  Modularity in HOL<br>
is (at best) second class.  Binding: nominal Isabelle is a great tool,<br>
but I wouldn't say that formalization of binding is a done deal.  And<br>
so forth.  Many of these suggestions offer possibilities for<br>
collaboration, such as Flyspeck.</p>
<p>Best,<br>

Subject: The QED Project</p>
<p>Freek,</p>
<p>are there still activities related to the QED Project<br>
<a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/qed/">http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/qed/</a><br>
I am contemplating writing a grant application for something going<br>
in a similar direction, and would like to know about which people to<br>
contact for possible collaboration.</p>
<p>What is your current assessment of what it takes to realize an<br>
updated version of the QED project?</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Arnold</p>
