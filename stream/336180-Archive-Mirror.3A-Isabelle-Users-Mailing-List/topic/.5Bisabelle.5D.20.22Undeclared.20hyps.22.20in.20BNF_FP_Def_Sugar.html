<p>From: Lars Hupel &lt;<a href="mailto:hupel@in.tum.de">hupel@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear BNF implementers,</p>
<p>I'm currently working on some Isabelle/ML code which produces a bunch of<br>
datatype specifications, ultimately calling<br>
'BNF_FP_Def_Sugar.co_datatypes' for all of them. This generally works<br>
fine, but there appears to be some corner case. I've attached a minimal<br>
failing example. Loading this with Isabelle2015 gives the following error<br>
message related to the declaration of the second data type:</p>
<p>Undeclared hyps:<br>
    size_String0 &#8801; size_String0<br>
  The error(s) above occurred for the goal statement&#8962;:<br>
  map_pre_Rational0 id = id</p>
<p>(and some more along the same lines)</p>
<p>If I put a call to 'Local_Theory.restore' in between, the error<br>
disappears. (Not that I have any idea why.)</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars<br>

Hello again,</p>
<p>I have found another one of those corner cases. This time, it looks like I<br>
might be using the ML interface wrong. Once again, I've attached a theory<br>
reproducing the error.</p>
<p>It appears that there is some difference between dealing with a finished<br>
theory and a non-finished theory. Makarius, maybe you could shed some<br>
light on this. Is it generally not supported to modify finished theories<br>
in Isabelle/ML?</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars<br>

<p>From: Lars Hupel &lt;<a href="mailto:hupel@in.tum.de">hupel@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
After some more investigation, I think I can answer that myself: Yes,<br>
there is a difference. If I, instead of using a finished theory directly,<br>
first call 'Theory.begin_theory', everything works as expected.</p>
<p>The underlying problem in the source file I attached wasn't that the<br>
datatype wasn't being created, but rather that it was created without<br>
qualification. (It was just called 'String0'.) I've seen similar things<br>
with 'Local_Theory.define', that after some switching between local and<br>
global theories the naming discipline stopped making sense, i.e. morphisms<br>
producing unqualified constant names. I still don't know whether this is<br>
expected or not, but after looking at the implementation manual I think it<br>
probably is (Sec 1.1.1):</p>
<p>The begin operation starts a new theory by importing several parent<br>
theories<br>
  and entering a special mode of nameless incremental updates, until the<br>
final<br>
  end operation is performed.</p>
<p>I couldn't find anything about the 'end' operation though.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Local_Theory.restore essentially introduces a command-transaction <br>
boundary, so the two invocations in ML behave like two Isar commands <br>
within a theory file. I can't explain the deeper reason of the problem <br>
seen here -- there might be something wrong with the context-discipline of <br>
the BNF implementation, which is rather complex.</p>
<p>Dmitriy Traytel has recently updated that for the coming release, see <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/7b915ca69af1">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/7b915ca69af1</a></p>
<p>The motivation for that change was to allow the name space management of <br>
Isabelle2015 via "context begin private/qualified ... end" work for <br>
(co)datatype definitions as well, although a few more changes in the <br>
repository were required to get it into proper shape (e.g. 2618e7e3b5ea).</p>
<p>As it happens, these changes also make the problems exposed in the example <br>
disappear. This might be an accident, though, and the true reasons for the <br>
breakdown still lingering in the dark.</p>
<p>For now I recommend to keep the Local_Theory.restore workaround and try <br>
again when the first release candidates for Isabelle2016 emerge, <br>
presumably at the start of the year 2016.</p>

<p>That is an accidental effect of continuing updates after end_theory (of <br>
the existing theory Main), which is treated like a formal "extend" <br>
operation.  Thus the naming policy is reset to a global default, without <br>
any theory prefix yet.</p>
<p>There could be more explicit checks and error messages.  I used to have <br>
that on my TODO list until approx. 15 years ago, and then removed it for <br>

<p>I would find more of these checks very helpful, since in my work I'm often<br>
exercising parts of the system in perhaps unintended ways.</p>
