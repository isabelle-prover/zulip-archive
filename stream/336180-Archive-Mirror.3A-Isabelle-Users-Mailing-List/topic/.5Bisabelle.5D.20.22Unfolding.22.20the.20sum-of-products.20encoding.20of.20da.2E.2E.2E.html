<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hallo,</p>
<p>I have been playing around with some analytic combinatorics lately,<br>
asking questions like ‘How many values are there of a given datatype<br>
with a certain size?’</p>
<p>For this, it is very convenient to view the definition of the algebraic<br>
datatype in terms of a (possibly recursive) sum of products. For<br>
instance, for binary trees, I have the following "encodings":</p>
<p>datatype 'a bintree = Leaf 'a | Node "'a bintree" "'a bintree"</p>
<p>primrec encode_bintree :: "'a bintree ⇒ 'a + 'a bintree × 'a bintree" where<br>
  "encode_bintree (Leaf x) = Inl x"<br>
| "encode_bintree (Node l r) = Inr (l, r)"</p>
<p>fun decode_bintree :: "'a + 'a bintree × 'a bintree ⇒ 'a bintree" where<br>
  "decode_bintree (Inl x) = Leaf x"<br>
| "decode_bintree (Inr (l, r)) = Node l r"</p>
<p>Essentially, I exploit the fact that ‘α bintree’ is a fixed point of<br>
'λα. α + (α bintree)²' and therefore ‘α bintree’ is isomorphic to ‘α + α<br>
bintree × α bintree’.</p>
<p>My question is now: is there an easy way to generate these encode/decode<br>
isomorphisms automatically and prove that they are inverses of one<br>
another? Is there perhaps a similar construction inside the internals of<br>
the datatype package already?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>The BNF package internally generates such unfolding and folding constants. They are called <br>
ctor_&lt;typename&gt; and dtor_&lt;typename&gt;. Internally, it also proves that they are inverses of <br>
each other, but AFAIK these theorems are only made available if the attribute bnf_note_all <br>
is set at the declaration time of the datatype.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
Andreas</p>

Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>Andreas gave you the most important pointer. Since you seem to be envisioning an ML command for generating them automatically, I suspect you will want to access the ML interfaces of the BNF package directly, and not use "bnf_note_all" (which is mostly useful for debugging and/or for sketching BNF extensions).</p>
<p>The low-level theorems you'd need, e.g. "ctor_dtor", are stored in the BNF (co)datatype database:</p>
<p>ML {*<br>
    BNF_FP_Def_Sugar.fp_sugar_of @{context} @{type_name bintree}<br>
    |&gt; the<br>
    |&gt; #fp_res<br>
    |&gt; #ctor_dtors<br>
    |&gt; hd<br>
    *}</p>
<p>You might find the code in "~~/src/HOL/Library/bnf_lfp_countable.ML" a useful source of inspiration. The "mk_encode_funs" function constructs a "to_nat" function for a datatype (LFP) from "to_nat" functions about the types on which it depends. If you find that of any interest, I can send you the (more readable) theory files that mock up the construction performed at the ML level.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I'm tempted to rename "ctor" to "in" and "dtor" to "out", in keeping with some of the literature, to avoid any confusion between the actual high-level constructors (called "ctr"s in the code and some theorems) and the low-level constructors. If anybody is against this renaming, please speak out now.</p>
<p>Jasmin</p>

I am against the renaming. Note that “in” is a keyword in ML and you would need to start decorating the identifiers in the ML code with “x”, “‘“ or “0”. Also in/out are much less symmetric than ctor/dtor. We have actual code that is parametric in the view (there the name xtor is used).</p>

<p>We have clashes with many other names, e.g. "rec" (a keyword, or a recursor), "map", "fold" (ML functions one does not want to shadow), even "in"... (Grep "recx", "mapx", "foldx", "inx".) Such clashes, and their crude fix with an "x", are not pretty, but they are a reasonable price to pay for having the right names at the Isar level.</p>
<p>But there is in fact a possible confusion at the ML level, which is much worse than the inelegant "inx": "in" is already used in the code for set membership (\&lt;in&gt;), e.g.</p>
<p>val inx = mk_in Asets sets T;</p>
<p>So maybe statu quo is best for now.</p>

<p>"in/out" are semantically very symmetric. I invented "xtor" out of sheer desperation and would happily trade it against "inout" or "io" or even "thru".</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks, that already looks like pretty much exactly what I want.</p>
<p>Another problem is that I need a kind of parameterised ‘size’ function, <br>
which simply adds together the size of all the contained objects while <br>
ignoring the structure of the datatype itself.</p>
<p>Essentially, for a datatype ‘α foo’ with a single type parameter, the <br>
behaviour should be something like</p>
<p>size_foo sz x = setsum sz (set_foo x)</p>
<p>Or, in other words: I would something that works like datatype's builtin <br>
size_foo, but without counting the structure of the datatype itself. <br>
(e.g. I would the size of ‘[0,0,0]’ to be 0, not 3)</p>
<p>How would I best go about doing something like this generically for <br>
datatypes with arbitrarily many type parameters? This is not a very <br>
urgent question; the above construction with set_foo works fine for one <br>
parameter and one parameter is all I currently need, but it would be <br>
nice to know.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>There is no generic construction like that at the moment in BNF, but it would be easy to <br>
define. Have you looked at how the existing size function works? For polymorphic types <br>
like 'a list, there is a more general function size_list which takes a size function for <br>
the type argument. The size_list function sums the given function over all elements of a <br>
list and then adds the list structure to it. So if you just want the sum over the <br>
elements, how about using list_size f xs - size xs? Alternatively, you can also copy the <br>
size plugin and change it to produce the function you need.</p>
<p>Of course, this only works for datatypes for which the size plugin can generate size <br>
functions. For example, I have not yet tried whether there is also a size function if the <br>
datatype contains finite sets and multisets.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

<p>Interesting examples. These actually work, thanks to a hook in the "size" plugin:</p>
<p>HOL$ grep BNF_LFP_Size <em>/</em>thy<br>

<p>If you define type U by nesting through type T, the "size" function of U will depend on "size_T" -- hence there is a connection between the two. The lack of uniformity of the old definition is visible in examples such as</p>
<p>(* with Isabelle2014 *)</p>

<p>The tone of some of your emails reveals a cavalier attitude towards the people who work or worked for or with you. We have had instances of passive-aggressive emails from your part regarding minor points of datatypes (minor compared with the scale of the whole BNF entreprise), some of it on-list, some off-list. You will remember how this ended. Because you had the courage to apologize, you came out of the deal as an (even) greater man in my eyes than before.</p>
<p>I had reasons to believe this would be the first and last time we would be going into that loop, but alas the same nonconstructive pattern is arising again -- and again in connection with the datatypes.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate if you could keep your comments -- whether on-list or off-list -- to objective observations, as opposed to a procès d'intention. I don't know what I've done to you to deserve this; clearly, I must have done something to annoy you, but I doubt it has anything to do with the "size" function. I would appreciate if you could tell it to me frankly off-list rather than through insinuations on-list.</p>

<p>For the record: I did not change the source code. The code for the new package had to be rewritten from scratch (a few hundred lines), and we had to choose how to design it. Compatibility was a high concern, but I failed to realize that this apparently minor issue would have any impact at all on existing formalizations (failing to think that anything of the form "0 &lt;= ..." is trivial to prove), while leading to (in my eyes) a cleaner approach. Implementing the old approach wouldn't have been harder; but it just felt "uglier" and "wrong". Now I know better.</p>
<p>Overall, we managed to achieve very high levels of backward compatibility and actually pulled it off. The ongoing "Nominal2" vs. "Nominal" is reminder of how hard it is to subsume and replace an existing Isabelle package. We (I) have made bona fide errors along the way, but I think our record is remarkable and deserves more praise than criticism.</p>

Dear Jasmin,</p>
<p>The only point I was trying to make is a very general one: In the absence of <br>
external documentation, the source code should be taken seriously or questioned <br>
but not just changed. I am sure we agree on this but in the light of the size <br>
discussion I felt it was worth reemphasizing on the list. No insult intended.</p>

<p>I don't have a strong position about these names. Just a historic note: These were initially called "fold" and "unfold," <br>

<p>We have clashes with many other names, e.g. "rec" (a keyword, or a recursor), "map", "fold" (ML functions one does not want to shadow), even "in"... (Grep "recx", "mapx", "foldx", "inx".) Such clashes, and their crude fix with an "x", are not pretty, but they are a reasonable price to pay for having the right names at the Isar level.</p>
<p>But there is in fact a possible confusion at the ML level, which is much worse than the inelegant "inx": "in" is already used in the code for set membership (\&lt;in&gt;), e.g.</p>
<p>val inx = mk_in Asets sets T;</p>
<p>So maybe statu quo is best for now.</p>
