<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Proper Isar does not provide fine-grained goal adressing, which is <br>
considered part of the tactical world.  The using/apply form is as close <br>
to that as you can get -- in the end it is up to the individual proof <br>
methods to make use of the offered facts in a sensible way, i.e. a method <br>
that operates on a single subgoal (force, blast, fast etc) will only <br>
insert the facts into that goal.</p>
<p>In the "insert" above I actually overlooked that the facts get inserted <br>
into <em>all</em> subgoals.  There is relatively recent way to limit the scope of <br>
method expressions to a prefix of the given subgoals, cf. the following <br>
(old) entry in NEWS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isar: the goal restriction operator [N] (default N = 1) evaluates a<br>
method expression within a sandbox consisting of the first N<br>
sub-goals, which need to exist.  For example, ``simp_all [3]''<br>
simplifies the first three sub-goals, while (rule foo, simp_all)[]<br>
simplifies all new goals that emerge from applying rule foo to the<br>
originally first one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, as the method expressions get more and more complicated the <br>
idea of nicely structured Isar proof texts is getting more and more <br>
diluted.  In fact, using just a comma in 'by' method statements is already <br>
leaving the pure world of proof texts. (This is why I would prefer the <br>
double using/apply form over the composition of four methods in the <br>
insert/force form).</p>

Quoting <a href="mailto:rpollack@inf.ed.ac.uk">rpollack@inf.ed.ac.uk</a>:</p>
<p>I was happy too soon.  This proof sends both facts to "force" on the <br>
second goal, thus is slow.  The other proof you suggested</p>
<p>using h[where S="{}"] apply force<br>
    using h[where S ="UNIV::state set"] apply force<br>
    done</p>
<p>is fast, and does the intended search, but isn't pure Isar.  Does Isar <br>
have a vernacular form that sends the first fact to the first goal, and <br>
only the second fact to the second goal, without restating the second <br>
goal?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
