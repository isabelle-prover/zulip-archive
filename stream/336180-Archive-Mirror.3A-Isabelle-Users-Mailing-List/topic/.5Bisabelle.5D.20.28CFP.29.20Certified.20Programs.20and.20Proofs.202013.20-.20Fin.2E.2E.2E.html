<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br>
===============</p>
<p>3rd International Conference on Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP2013)</p>
<hr>
<p>December 2013, Australia (co-located with APLAS 2013)</p>
<p>CPP is an international forum on theoretical and practical topics in all<br>
areas, including computer science, mathematics, and education, that<br>
consider certification as an essential paradigm for their work.<br>
Certification here means formal, mechanized verification of some sort,<br>
preferably with production of independently checkable certificates. We<br>
invite submissions on topics that fit under this rubric.</p>
<p>The first two CPP conferences were held in Kenting, Taiwan, and Kyoto,<br>
Japan, in December 2011 and 2012, respectively. As with the first<br>
meetings, the proceedings will be published in Springer-Verlag’s Lecture<br>
Notes in Computer Science series.</p>
<p>Suggested, but not exclusive, specific topics of interest for<br>
submissions include: certified or certifying programming, compilation,<br>
linking, OS kernels, runtime systems, and security monitors; program<br>
logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code; certified<br>
decision procedures, mathematical libraries, and mathematical theorems;<br>
proof assistants and proof theory; new languages and tools for certified<br>
programming; program analysis, program verification, and proof-carrying<br>
code; certified secure protocols and transactions; certificates for<br>
decision procedures, including linear algebra, polynomial systems, SAT,<br>
SMT, and unification in algebras of interest; certificates for<br>
semi-decision procedures, including equality, first-order logic, and<br>
higher-order unification; certificates for program termination; logics<br>
for certifying concurrent and distributed programs; higher-order logics,<br>
logical systems, separation logics, and logics for security; teaching<br>
mathematics and computer science with proof assistants; and “Proof<br>
Pearls” (elegant, concise, and instructive examples).</p>
<p>Important Dates:<br>
++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>Authors are required to submit a paper title and a short abstract before<br>
submitting the full paper. The submission should include when necessary<br>
a URL where to find the formal development assessing the essential<br>
aspects of the work.  All submissions will be electronic. All deadlines<br>
are at midnight (GMT).</p>
<p>============================    ==========================<br>
<strong>Abstract Deadline:</strong>          Monday, June 10, 2013<br>
<strong>Submission Deadline:</strong>        Friday, June 14, 2013<br>
<strong>Author Notification:</strong>        Monday, August 26, 2013<br>
<strong>Camera-ready Papers Due:</strong>    Monday, September 16, 2013<br>
============================    ==========================</p>
<p>Submission Instructions:<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>Papers should be submitted electronically online via the conference<br>
submission web page at URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2013">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2013</a></p>
<p>Acceptable formats are PostScript or PDF, viewable by Ghostview or<br>
Acrobat Reader. Submissions should not exceed 16 pages in LNCS format,<br>
including bibliography and figures.  Submitted papers will be judged on<br>
the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and<br>
clarity. They should clearly identify what has been accomplished and why<br>
it is significant. The proceedings of the symposium will be published as<br>
a volume in Springer-Verlag’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.<br>
Submission instructions including LaTeX style files are available from<br>
the CPP 2013 website.</p>
<p>Each submission must be written in English and provide sufficient detail<br>
to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper.  It<br>
should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the<br>
main results, and a brief explanation of their significance and<br>
relevance to the conference, all phrased for the non-specialist.<br>
Technical and formal developments directed to the specialist should<br>
follow.  Whenever appropriate, the submission should come along with a<br>
formal development, using whatever prover, e.g., Agda, Coq, Elf, HOL,<br>
HOL-Light, Isabelle, Matita, Mizar, NQTHM, PVS, Vampire, etc. References<br>
and comparisons with related work should be included.  *Papers not<br>
conforming to the above requirements concerning format and length may be<br>
rejected without further consideration.*</p>
<p>The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>
elsewhere, including the proceedings of other published conferences or<br>
workshops.  The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work<br>
submitted to a conference or journal in advance of submission. Original<br>
formal proofs of known results in mathematics or computer science are<br>
among the targets.  One author of each accepted paper is expected to<br>
present it at the conference.</p>
