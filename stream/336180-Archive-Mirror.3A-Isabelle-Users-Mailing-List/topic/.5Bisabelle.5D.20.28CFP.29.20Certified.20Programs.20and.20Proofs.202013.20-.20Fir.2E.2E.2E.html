PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS<br>
===========================</p>
<p>Third International Conference on Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP 2013)</p>
<hr>
<p>December 2013, Australia (co-located with APLAS 2013)</p>
<p>CPP is an international forum on theoretical and practical topics in all areas,<br>
including computer science, mathematics, and education, that consider<br>
certification as an essential paradigm for their work. Certification here means<br>
formal, mechanized verification of some sort, preferably with production of<br>
independently checkable certificates. We invite submissions on topics that fit<br>
under this rubric.</p>
<p>The first two CPP conferences were held in Kenting, Taiwan, and Kyoto, Japan, in<br>
December 2011 and 2012, respectively. As with the first meetings, the<br>
proceedings will be published in Springer-Verlag’s Lecture Notes in Computer<br>
Science series.</p>
<p>Suggested, but not exclusive, specific topics of interest for submissions<br>
include: certified or certifying programming, compilation, linking, OS kernels,<br>
runtime systems, and security monitors; program logics, type systems, and<br>
semantics for certified code; certified decision procedures, mathematical<br>
libraries, and mathematical theorems; proof assistants and proof theory; new<br>
languages and tools for certified programming; program analysis, program<br>
verification, and proof-carrying code; certified secure protocols and<br>
transactions; certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra,<br>
polynomial systems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of interest;<br>
certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality, first-order<br>
logic, and higher-order unification; certificates for program termination;<br>
logics for certifying concurrent and distributed programs; higher-order logics,<br>
logical systems, separation logics, and logics for security; teaching<br>
mathematics and computer science with proof assistants; and “Proof Pearls”<br>
(elegant, concise, and instructive examples).</p>
<p>Important Dates:<br>
++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>Authors are required to submit a paper title and a short abstract before<br>
submitting the full paper. The submission should include when necessary a URL<br>
where to find the formal development assessing the essential aspects of the<br>
work.  All submissions will be electronic. All deadlines are at midnight (GMT).</p>
<p>============================    ==========================<br>
<strong>Abstract Deadline:</strong>          Friday, May 30, 2013<br>
<strong>Submission Deadline:</strong>        Friday, June 7, 2013<br>
<strong>Author Notification:</strong>        Monday, August 19, 2013<br>
<strong>Camera-ready Papers Due:</strong>    Monday, September 16, 2013<br>
============================    ==========================</p>
<p>Submission Instructions:<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>Papers should be submitted electronically online via the conference submission<br>
web page at URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2013">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2013</a></p>
<p>Acceptable formats are PostScript or PDF, viewable by Ghostview or Acrobat<br>
Reader. Submissions should not exceed 16 pages in LNCS format, including<br>
bibliography and figures.  Submitted papers will be judged on the basis of<br>
significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. They should<br>
clearly identify what has been accomplished and why it is significant. The<br>
proceedings of the symposium will be published as a volume in Springer-Verlag’s<br>
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Submission instructions including<br>
LaTeX style files are available from the CPP 2013 website.</p>
<p>Each submission must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to<br>
allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper.  It should begin<br>
with a succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the main results, and a<br>
brief explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference, all<br>
phrased for the non-specialist.  Technical and formal developments directed to<br>
the specialist should follow.  Whenever appropriate, the submission should come<br>
along with a formal development, using whatever prover, e.g., Agda, Coq, Elf,<br>
HOL, HOL-Light, Isabelle, Matita, Mizar, NQTHM, PVS, Vampire, etc. References<br>
and comparisons with related work should be included.  *Papers not conforming to<br>
the above requirements concerning format and length may be rejected without<br>
further consideration.*</p>
<p>The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere,<br>
including the proceedings of other published conferences or workshops.  The PC<br>
chairs should be informed of closely related work submitted to a conference or<br>
journal in advance of submission. Original formal proofs of known results in<br>
mathematics or computer science are among the targets.  One author of each<br>
accepted paper is expected to present it at the conference.</p>
