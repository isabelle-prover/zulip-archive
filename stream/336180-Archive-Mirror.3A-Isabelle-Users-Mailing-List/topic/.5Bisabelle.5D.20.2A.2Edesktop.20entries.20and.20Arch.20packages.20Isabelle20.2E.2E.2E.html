I'd like to disagree here. While Gentoo supports slotting (i.e. multiple<br>
versions installed at once), only a few packages are slotted, and also<br>
the slots might be too wide for certain uses (e.g. jdks are slotted by<br>
5,6,7,... and not by minor version). Furthermore, depending on the<br>
package, consumers might not work with multiple versions of a dependency<br>
installed (cf slotting boost).</p>
<p>The same holds for configurations: A too restricted dependency (most<br>
notable: needing to have a feature disabled) will quickly result in trouble.</p>
<p>So while Gentoo supports all those thing in theory, it would probably<br>
not work out in practice.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
These observations are consistent with my earlier guesses about the <br>
culture and mindset of Gentoo packaging, or similar packaging communities.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the "open-source bazaar" becomes centralized by the one big <br>
arrangement of packages of a particular community (although there might be <br>
ways to have alternative repositories, but this is again more complication <br>
than necessary).</p>
<p>I see a fundamental conceptual problem here of operating system <br>
distributions versus (against) application programs.</p>
<p>Moreover, I must confess that I am not very attached to a particular Linux <br>
distribution nor its current brand, and tend to change the system <br>
partiation quite often, while certain add-on applications remain happily <br>
on /home.  (This is out of necessity since no Linux version is really <br>
stable these days.)</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Coq guys are presently discussing similar packaging <br>
questions on the Coq-club thread "Package managing", e.g. see <br>
<a href="https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/coq-club/2013-10/msg00096.html">https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/coq-club/2013-10/msg00096.html</a> -- the <br>
idea seems to be to delegate to OCaml package management (and thus become <br>
subject to a particular INRIA-centric programming language world).</p>
<p>For Isabelle2013 and Isabelle2013-1-RC1 this privatized package management <br>
is done in the weakest-possible sense: Isabelle "components" are bundled <br>
with the one big application that you get from the Isabelle website. <br>
There are no variants nor dependencies just one piece to be shipped, which <br>
happens to be composed from a selection of parts according to the <br>
specification in etc/components.</p>
<p>This tends to require a bit more disk space than necessary, but even just <br>
one HOL image is already quite substantial compared to basic things like <br>
Poly/ML or ATPs for Sledgehammer.  Of course, JDK dwarfs everything else<br>
and is as usual a problem on its own.</p>
<p>Using Isabelle professionally over some time, several GBs of disk space <br>
can be easily filled with further heap images for the Isabelle <br>
distribution, AFP, or other projects.  This outperforms even JDK, despite <br>
recent attempts of Oracle to inflate it again.</p>

<p>Neither.  I'm using Gentoo Linux, but Arch Linux has an excellent online<br>

<p>What do you mean?  I thought that Isabelle, given its very specific Java<br>
and jEdit dependencies, does not integrate well with package managers<br>
anyway (i.e. maintainers can't easily provide an Isabelle package, which<br>
would depend on some version of the distribution's Java and jEdit<br>
packages), and that therefore the recommended way is to unzip the<br>
all-in-one download, which brings its own dependencies.  Which is what I<br>
do (even though, in principle, I'd like the "package" approach better) –<br>
and I haven't had any problems on Gentoo so far.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
OK, so I make a mental "tick" for Gentoo.</p>
<p>Note that the Isabelle "dependencies" are not very specific, we are just <br>
trying to get things as stable as possible for end-users.</p>
<p>There is a fundamental flaw in the model of classic package management: it <br>
makes equivalence classes of components of the same base name: "java", <br>
"jedit", "polyml" etc. and does not support precise dependencies on <br>
particular versions, or depencies on particular configurations of certain <br>
software components, or multiple such configurations at the same time <br>
without interfering.</p>
<p>At the start of the Isabelle/PIDE and Isabelle/jEdit project I was much <br>
more naive about that, and was still supporting the idea that the user <br>
provides <em>some</em> JDK via his base system, but no JDK is equaivalent to any <br>
other one, not even of the very same version number.  The same for other <br>
contributing components, although to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>Historically, Proof General never got rock solid for everyone, because it <br>
was impossible to bundle a particular version of Emacs -- both for <br>
technical and social reasons.  Isabelle/jEdit makes the critical cut at a <br>
different boundary, and by bundling exactly one JDK the dimensions of the <br>
problem space are much reduced.</p>

<p>Since someone claimed something else recently on some Heise forum, I've <br>

<p>Being _recent_ is a problem.  In the Gentoo practice it depends a lot on<br>
the individual packages and their maintainers.  Most packages in the<br>

<p>There are several problems coming together here, and the "open" model is <br>
no solution either.  Why does the open Linux Mint mess with its window <br>
manager in a way that even its own version of OpenJDK does not work <br>
properly?  Searching the web for such incidents reveals tracker items that <br>
are several years old and still open.  (At least the openess of the <br>
tracker helps to guess which workarounds can be applied on our side.)</p>
<p>Anyway, we should work out the Gentoo problem with C-B for explicit <br>
completion in Isabelle/jEdit.</p>
<p>I have already learned something about Fedora 18/19 by getting to the <br>
bottom of a completely different keyboard problem.  For Gentoo it will be <br>
more difficult, since I can't make my own installation of it in finite <br>
time.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'll be happy to test anything on Gentoo for you, maybe even<br>
other users' problems, given precise instructions.</p>

OK, so we close the issue once more on the mailing list.</p>
<p>Note that Isabelle/jEdit tries to find a middle ground in providing <br>
sensible defaults for theory editing and preserving original jEdit <br>
behaviour.</p>
<p>For the completion I have added the "isabelle.complete" action and made it <br>
the default for the C-B keyboard shortcut that was formerly <br>
"complete-word".  The corresponding menu item actually refers to the old <br>
action.  If you were actually using "complete-word" for its own merits, <br>
you can invent new keyboard mappings to avoid the conflict.</p>
<p>The explicit mode of "isabelle.complete" does have some virtues that were <br>
not there in Isabelle2013.  It requires some practice to figure out its <br>
dynamics (and options).  It is essentially a computer game, but so far <br>
with little documentation.</p>
