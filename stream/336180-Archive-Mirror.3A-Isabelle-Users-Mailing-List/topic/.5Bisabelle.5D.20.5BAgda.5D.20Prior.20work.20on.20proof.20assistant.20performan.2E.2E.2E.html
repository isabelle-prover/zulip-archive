Thanks!  This is very interesting.  (And thanks all for sources.)</p>
<p>I'm still digesting this, but have one question already:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, we should use NbE/environment machines for evaluation, and<br>
implement conversion checking in the semantic domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this mean that we can't be agnostic about whether or not we're<br>
supporting HoTT, because we either have to pick set theory/irrelevant<br>
equality proofs or cubical (or some other model of HoTT) when normalizing<br>
proofs of equality?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd be very interested in your findings about proof assistant performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd be happy to share once I have my thesis in a sufficiently ready state!<br>
Broadly, the message of my thesis is that performance of<br>
(dependently-typed) proof assistants / interactive theorem provers is an<br>
interesting area of research sorely in need of systematic study.  (My<br>
thesis will also include some of the research work I've done, which can be<br>
rendered as "how to work around some of the asymptotics in Coq without<br>
needing to change the system", but I think that's a bit less broadly<br>
interesting.)</p>

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>You may be interested in my github repos: smalltt<br>
&lt;<a href="https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/smalltt">https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/smalltt</a>&gt;, normalization-bench<br>
&lt;<a href="https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/normalization-bench">https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/normalization-bench</a>&gt;. I haven't yet<br>
updated the smalltt repo, but there's a simplified implementation<br>
&lt;<a href="https://gist.github.com/AndrasKovacs/a0e0938113b193d6b9c1c0620d853784">https://gist.github.com/AndrasKovacs/a0e0938113b193d6b9c1c0620d853784</a>&gt;<br>
of its evaluator, which seems to have roughly the same performance but<br>
which is much simpler to implement.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that in elaboration there are two primary computational<br>
tasks, one is conversion checking and the other is generating solutions for<br>
metavariables. Clearly, we should use NbE/environment machines for<br>
evaluation, and implement conversion checking in the semantic domain.<br>
However, when we want to generate meta solutions, we need to compute<br>
syntactic terms, and vanilla NbE domain only supports quote/readback to<br>
normal forms. Normal forms are way too big and terrible for this purpose.<br>
Hence, we extend vanilla NbE domain with lazy non-deterministic choice<br>
between two or more evaluation strategies. In the simplest case, the point<br>
of divergence is whether we unfold some class of definitions or not. Then,<br>
the conversion checking algorithm can choose to take the full-unfolding<br>
branch, and the quoting operation can choose to take the non-unfolding<br>
branch. At the same time, we have a great deal of shared computation<br>
between the two branches; we avoid recomputing many things if we choose to<br>
look at both branches.</p>
<p>I believe that a feature like this is absolutely necessary for robust<br>
performance. Otherwise, we choke on bad asymptotics, which is surprisingly<br>
common in dependent settings. In Agda and Coq, even something as trivial as<br>
elaborating a length-indexed vector expression has quadratic complexity in<br>
the length of the vector.</p>
<p>It is also extremely important to stick to the spirit of Coquand's<br>
semantic checking algorithm as much as possible. In summary: core syntax<br>
should support <em>no</em> expensive computation: no substitution, shifting,<br>
renaming, or other ad-hoc term massaging. Core syntax should be viewed as<br>
immutable machine code, which supports evaluation into various semantic<br>
domains, from which sometimes we can read syntax back; this also leaves it<br>
open to swap out the representation of core syntax to efficient<br>
alternatives such as bytecode or machine code.</p>
<p>Only after we get  the above two basic points right, can we start to think<br>
about more specific and esoteric optimizations. I am skeptical of proposed<br>
solutions which do not include these. Hash consing has been brought up many<br>
times, but it is very unsatisfying compared to non-deterministic NbE,<br>
because of its large constant costs, implementation complexity, and the<br>
failure to handle sharing loss from beta-redexes in any meaningful way<br>
(which is the most important source of sharing loss!). I am also skeptical<br>
of exotic evaluators such as interaction nets and optimal beta reducers;<br>
there is a good reason that all modern functional languages run on<br>
environment machines instead of interaction nets.</p>
<p>If we want to support type classes, then tabled instance resolution<br>
&lt;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04301.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04301.pdf</a>&gt; is also a must, otherwise we are<br>
again smothered by bad asymptotics even in modestly complex class<br>
hierarchies. This can be viewed as a specific instance of hash-consing (or<br>
rather  "memoization"), so while I think ubiquitous hash-consing is bad,<br>
some focused usage can do good.</p>
<p>Injectivity analysis is another thing which I believe has large potential<br>
impact. By this I mean checking whether functions are injective up to<br>
definitional equality, which is decidable, and can be used to more<br>
precisely optimize unfolding in conversion checking.</p>
<p>I'd be very interested in your findings about proof assistant performance.<br>
This has been a topic that I've been working on on-and-off for several<br>
years. I've recently started to implement a system which I intend to be<br>
eventually "production strength" and also as fast as possible, and<br>
naturally I want to incorporate existing performance know-how.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm in the process of writing my thesis on proof assistant performance<br>
bottlenecks (with a focus on Coq).  I'm having some trouble finding prior<br>
work on performance engineering and/or benchmarking of proof assistants<br>
(other than the paper on the Lean tactic language (<br>
<a href="https://leanprover.github.io/papers/tactic.pdf">https://leanprover.github.io/papers/tactic.pdf</a>)), and figured I'd reach<br>
out to these lists.</p>
<p>Does anyone have references for prior work on performance analysis or<br>
engineering of proof assistants or dependently typed languages?  (Failing<br>
that, I'd also be interested in papers about compile-time performance of<br>
compilers.)</p>
