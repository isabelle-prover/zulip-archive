<p>22nd European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information </p>
<p>ESSLLI 2010, 9-20 August, 2010, University of Copenhagen, Denmark </p>
<p>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</p>
<p>CALL FOR COURSE and WORKSHOP PROPOSALS </p>
<p>The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI) is organized every year by the Association for Logic, <br>
Language and Information (FoLLI, <a href="http://www.folli.org">http://www.folli.org</a>) in different sites around Europe. The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface <br>
between linguistics, logic and computation. ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and advanced courses, as well as workshops, <br>
covering a wide variety of topics within the three areas of interest: Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic and <br>
Computation. Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to 500 students from Europe and elsewhere. The <br>
school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested in the <br>
interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information. <br>
For more information, visit the FoLLI website, as well as ESSLLI2009 website: <a href="http://esslli2009.labri.fr/">http://esslli2009.labri.fr/</a>. </p>
<p>The ESSLLI 2010 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational, introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the <br>
22nd annual Summer School on important topics of active research in the broad interdisciplinary area connecting logic, linguistics, <br>
computer science, and the cognitive sciences, structured within the 3 traditional ESSLLI streams:</p>
<p>-Language and Computation <br>
-Language and Logic <br>
-Logic and Computation <br>
We also welcome proposals that do not exactly fit one of these categories. </p>
<p>PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: All proposals should be submitted, using a prescribed form that will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010 <br>
website <a href="http://www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010">www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010</a>, through EasyChair on <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2010">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2010</a>, not later than</p>
<p><strong>*</strong><strong> Monday, September 7, 2009 </strong><strong>*</strong> </p>
<p>Proposers must hold PhD or equivalent degrees and should follow the guidelines below while preparing their submissions; proposals that <br>
do not conform with these guidelines may not be considered. </p>
<p>GUIDELINES FOR COURSE AND WORKSHOP PROPOSALS: </p>
<p>ALL COURSES: Courses are given over one week (Monday-Friday) and consist of five 90 minutes sessions, one per day. Course <br>
proposals should give a brief overview of the topic and a tentative content and structure of the course, as well as state the courses <br>
objectives and clearly specify prerequisites, if any. Lecturers who want to offer a long, two-week course, should submit two independent <br>
one-week courses (for example an introductory course in the first week of ESSLLI, and a more advanced course during the second). The <br>
ESSLLI program committee has the right to select only one of the two proposed courses. </p>
<p>TIMETABLE FOR COURSE PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:</p>
<p>Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline</p>
<p>Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline</p>
<p>Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course material by the ESSLLI2010 local organizers </p>
<p>FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: These are strictly elementary courses not assuming any background knowledge. They are intended for <br>
people who wish to get acquainted with the problems and techniques of areas new to them. Ideally, they should allow researchers from <br>
other fields to acquire the key competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary <br>
research community. Foundational courses should require no special prerequisites, but may presuppose some experience with scientific <br>
methods and general appreciation of the field of the course. </p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to the activities of the Summer School. They are intended to provide an <br>
introduction to the (interdisciplinary) field for students, young researchers, and other non-specialists, and to equip them with a good <br>
understanding of the course field's basic methods and techniques. Such courses should enable experienced researchers from other fields <br>
to acquire the key competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary research <br>
community. Introductory courses in, for instance, Language and Computation, can build on some knowledge of the component fields; e.g., <br>
an introductory course in computational linguistics should address an audience which is familiar with the basics of linguistics and <br>
computation. Proposals for introductory courses should indicate the level of the course as compared to standard texts in the area (if any). </p>
<p>ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of advanced Masters or PhD students. Proposals for <br>
advanced courses should specify the prerequisites in detail. </p>
<p>WORKSHOPS: Workshops run over one week and consist of five 90-minutes sessions, one per day. The aim of the workshops is to <br>
provide a forum for advanced Ph.D. students and other researchers to present and discuss their work. Workshops should have a well <br>
defined theme, and workshop organizers should be specialists in the theme of the workshop. The proposals for workshops should justify <br>
the choice of topic, give an estimate of the number of attendants and expected submissions, and provide a list of at least 15 potential <br>
submitters working in the field of the workshop. The organizers are required to give a general introduction to the theme during the first <br>
session of the workshop. They are also responsible for the organization and program of the workshop including inviting the submission of <br>
papers, reviewing, expenses of invited speakers, etc. In particular, each workshop organizer will be responsible for sending out a Call for <br>
Papers for the workshop and to organize the selection of the submissions by the deadlines specified below. The call for workshop <br>
submissions must make it clear that the workshop is open to all members of the ESSLLI community and should indicate that all workshop <br>
contributors must register for the Summer School. </p>
<p>TIMETABLE FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS:</p>
<p>Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline</p>
<p>Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline</p>
<p>Nov 02, 2009: Deadline for submission of the Calls for Papers to ESSLLI2010 PC chair</p>
<p>Nov 09, 2009: Workshop organizers send out First Call for Papers</p>
<p>Jan 25, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Second Call for Papers</p>
<p>Mar 08, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Third Call for Papers </p>
<p>Apr 12, 2010: Suggested deadline for submissions to the workshops </p>
<p>May 24, 2010: Suggested deadline for notification of workshop contributors</p>
<p>Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for submission of camera-ready copy of workshop proceedings to the ESSLLI2010 Local Organizers. </p>
<p>Notice that workshop speakers will be required to register for the Summer School; however, they will be able to register at a reduced rate <br>
to be determined by the Local Organizers. </p>
<p>FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS: A form for submitting course and workshop proposals will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010 website <br>
<a href="http://www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010">www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010</a>. </p>
<p>The proposers are required to submit the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name(s) of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s), at most two per course or workshop </li>
<li>Contact addresses, homepages, phones, and fax numbers (if available), of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s); </li>
<li>Title of proposed course/workshop; </li>
<li>Type (workshop, foundational, introductory, or advanced course) </li>
<li>Stream (one of: Language &amp; Computation, Language &amp; Logic, Logic &amp; Computation) </li>
<li>
<p>Description (in at most 300 words, provide justification, relevance to ESSLLI, proposed contents and structure of the courses, resp. <br>
  expected participation in the workshops) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>External funding (whether the proposers will be able to obtain external funding for travel and accommodation expenses) </p>
</li>
<li>Further particulars (any further information that is required by the above guidelines should be included here; in particular, course <br>
  objectives and prerequisites, as well as the lecturers teaching experience relevant to the proposed course, and generally in the <br>
  interdisciplinary field scope of ESSLLI.) </li>
</ul>
<p>FINANCIAL ASPECTS: Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers should be aware that all teaching and organizing at the summer <br>
schools is done on a voluntary basis in order to keep the participants fees as low as possible. Lecturers and organizers are not paid for <br>
their contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation (up to fixed maximum amounts, that will be communicated to the <br>
lecturers upon notification). It should be stressed that while proposals from all over the world are welcomed, the School cannot guarantee <br>
full reimbursement of travel costs, especially from destinations outside Europe. Please note that in case a course or workshop is to be <br>
taught/organized by two lecturers, a lump sum will be reimbursed to cover travel and accommodation expenses for one lecturer; the <br>
splitting of that sum is up to the lecturers. </p>
<p>The local organizers would highly appreciate it if, whenever possible, lecturers and workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover <br>
travel and accommodation expenses, as that would help us keep the cost of attending ESSLLI2010 lower. </p>
