<p>From: Abhishek Anand &lt;<a href="mailto:abhishek.anand.iitg@gmail.com">abhishek.anand.iitg@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
I'd like to understand why such a tool/setup doesn't exist.<br>
Because of technical difficulties?<br>
Because such projects won't be cool enough to publish in "top conferences"<br>
and please the career gods?<br>
I very vaguely remember hearing about attempts to make such tools, about<br>
3-5 years ago. I'd love to hear their experience.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

CompCert and seL4 would certainly be an attractive combination, because translation validation as we do now in seL4 is a proof every time, whereas CompCert has a once-and-for-all theorem (or at least once that is usable as such).</p>
<p>Assuming HOL4 is also in the mix, which at least for Isabelle it is getting closer and closer to, running CakeML programs on top of that combination would get us a lot closer to end-to-end verified systems. Interoperability with the Verified Software Tool Chain on top of ComCert programs even more.</p>
<p>One is allowed to dream, right? ;-)</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

Just for clarity, I said "tools" which was a bit ambiguous, but I meant<br>
more along the lines of what Gerwin wrote. Appreciate the useful thoughts<br>
from all regardless :)</p>

Isabelle seems to really shine in proof automation, but obviously it<br>
doesn't hold much of a candle to automated theorem provers like Vampire,<br>
Z3, Minisat, ACL2 (to a certain extent) etc.</p>
<p>Coq has the remarkable advantage that a lot of it's extra structure, type<br>
classes, proof witnesses, computational reflection, come for free within<br>
the kernel (with the notable exception of modules). Of course this kernel<br>
is quite complex, almost the opposite of HOL-light's, which is remarkably<br>
trustworthy.</p>
<p>Almost every widely used tool has unique libraries and tactics which are<br>
found in no others, of course.</p>
<p>It's hard to tell which of these differences are intrinsic tensions of the<br>
tool designs and which are incidental. Contrary to similar debates about<br>
programing languages, however, it seems that every one of these can be<br>
embedded in some, reasonably trustworthy, super-logic, roughly on par of<br>
ZFC + largish cardinal axiom. At the cost of some severe foundational<br>
debates though, I guess.</p>
<p>Logics which are really useful and popular right now are linear, modal and<br>
seperation logics, which have to be embedded into such a system along with<br>
a proof of soundness if you want the same level of trust. This is usually<br>
extremely tedious, at least given my limited experience, both WRT notations<br>
and proof conveniences. I've seen several examples of systems originally<br>
designed as a deep embedding which were then turned into standalone tools<br>
because of this tension (CertiCrypt springs to mind).</p>
<p>I'm not sure this tension can be resolved, since there is no common ground<br>
in this case (to my knowledge). Twelf might make such a claim as a unifier,<br>
but it is a very thin veneer over the astronomical amount of work required<br>
to make the logic even remotely usable. There's a reason why in 99% of<br>
cases the word "Isabelle" is followed by "/HOL". Logical frameworks have so<br>
far not lived up to their promise.</p>
<p>As is usually the case in the PL world, usable languages are often usable<br>
because of the quality of the libraries, and their ease of installation.<br>
This is largely a language specific effort, unfortunately. This makes me<br>
something of a pessimist, as in most domains, but I guess someone's got to<br>
occupy that quadrant.</p>
<p>Thanks for the opportunity to rant,</p>
<p>Cody</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most notably on the existing work that can span proof assistants, I<br>
think of the SAIL project for hardware architectures which has an Isabelle<br>
(or HOL?) backend and a Coq backend (though it is a bit behind the other<br>
one).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an aside: From the same stable as Sail there is also Lem (<br>
<a href="https://github.com/rems-project/lem">https://github.com/rems-project/lem</a>) which follows the same idea of<br>
exporting to multiple backends including multiple theorem provers<br>
(Isabelle/HOL, HOL4 and Coq). Whilst targeted at "lightweight executable<br>
mathematics, for writing, managing, and publishing large-scale portable<br>
semantic" this is after all what a lot of us use theorem provers for.</p>
