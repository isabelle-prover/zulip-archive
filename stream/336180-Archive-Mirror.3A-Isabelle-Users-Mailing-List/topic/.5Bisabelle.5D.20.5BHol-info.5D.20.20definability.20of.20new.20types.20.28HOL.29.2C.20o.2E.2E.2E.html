I don’t want to put words in Rob’s mouth, as he’s far more knowledgable in this area than I am.</p>
<p>As far as I know, there is no mechanised conservativity proof for HOL’s recent generalised constant specification mechanism. (Here I’m in agreement that “conservativity” without any other modification should refer to the proof theoretic notion, and that’s what I mean here.) Rob certainly has a pencil-and-paper proof. Ramana, Rob, Magnus, and I (although mostly Ramana) proved the soundness of a HOL Light-style logical system, including the generalised constant specification mechanism that Rob refers to (and also designed) and type definition mechanism, with respect to a standard model of higher-order logic. I worked on a mechanised conservativity proof for the definition mechanism for a bit two years ago but got distracted and haven’t returned to it. I think it would be a suitable student project, but I’m not convinced that it’s really that interesting — I wouldn’t be bothered by a sound and consistent definition principle that allowed one to prove more things.</p>

<p>Andy Pitts gives a proof of the model-theoretic conservativity of new_specification<br>
with respect to standard models. You are quite right that in the absence of completeness<br>

I suspect Andy just didn’t want to introduce a lot of extra technical detail.</p>
<p>I proved proof-theoretic conservativity for the new mechanism gen_new_specification.<br>
As new_specification is derivable using gen_new_specification, this gives you<br>
proof-theoretic conservativity for both. (Thanks to Scott for correcting my statement<br>

<p>Ondra's statement was the correct one.</p>
<p>Let's spell this out, to make sure we are speaking of the same thing. Say you have a signature Sigma' extending a signature Sigma (by adding some constant and type constructor symbols). Then every Sigma'-model M' produces a Sigma-Model, Forget(M'), by forgetting the interpretation of the symbols in Sigma' minus Sigma. Moreover,</p>
<p>(*) For every closed Sigma-formula  phi, we have that M |= phi holds iff Forget(M) |= phi holds.</p>
<p>Let T be a Sigma-theory (i.e., a set of closed Sigma-formulas), and let T' be a Sigma'-theory that includes T.<br>
T' is called:</p>
<p>(A) a model-theoretic conservative extension of T if, for all Sigma-models M of T, there exists a Sigma'-model M' of T' such that Forget(M') = M.</p>
<p>(B) a proof-theoretic conservative extension of T if, for all closed Sigma-formulas phi, T' |- phi implies T |- phi.</p>
<p>Assuming soundness <em>and completeness</em>, we have (A) implies (B). Proof: We can reason about semantic deduction |= instead of syntactic deduction. Assume T'|= phi .To prove T|= phi, let M |= T; by (A), we find M' |= T' such that Forget(M') = M. With T'|= phi, we obtain Forget(M')|= phi. From this and (*), we obtain M' |= phi, as desired.</p>
<p>In general, (B) does not imply (A), and I don't know of interesting sufficient conditions for when it does.</p>

<p>Thanks. Also, thanks for bringing up new_specification and gen_new_specification. After having a closer look at them, I see that the definitional dependency analysis we introduce in the paper can be easily extended to cope with these mechanisms -- which means that they don't raise additional difficulties in the delicate balance between constant overloading and typedef, and therefore are in principle suitable for Isabelle/HOL. We'll add a discussion of this in the journal version (and point you to it when it's available).</p>

<p>As discussed off-list with you and Ondrej, the case covered by<br>

The interesting sufficient conditions that apply are; (1) T' is a finitely axiomatizable<br>
expansion of T introducing finitely many new constants and no new types<br>
and (2) the logical language admits an existential quantifier<br>
with the usual proof rules and semantics. For then if T' satisfies (B), let<br>
phi(x_1, ... x_n) denote the result of taking the conjunction of the formulas<br>
that axiomatize T' and replacing the new constants c_1, ..., c_n<br>
by variables x_1, ..., x_n. Then T' proves psi ::= exists x_1, ... , x_n. phi(x_1, ..., x_n).<br>
By (B), T proves psi, but then, by soundness, psi holds in every model of T, which implies (A).</p>
<p>Of course, none of the above works for an extension that introduces new types.<br>
Your paper is a very nice contribution to the problem of defining new types.</p>
