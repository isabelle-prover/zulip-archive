<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to understand the intended use of the new -A option to isabelle<br>
jedit.</p>
<p>As far as I understand, the use case for -R XXX is to open jEdit with a<br>
heap that contains already all theories that will be needed while editing<br>
theories in XXX. (Specifically, that means that theories in XXX itself are<br>
not prebuilt.)</p>
<p>Additionally there is the -A option. My first thought was that this is to<br>
be used in the following situation: I have a more complex project<br>
involving, say, two sessions <em>XXX=HOL+...</em> and <em>YYY=XXX+...</em> Without -R,-A,<br>
I would have to run *jedit -l HOL *to be able edit theories in both<br>
sessions. With <em>jedit -R XXX</em>, the theories from other sessions in YYY<br>
would not be prebuilt. With <em>jedit -R YYY</em>, the theories from XXX would be<br>
prebuilt and therefore cannot be edited. So I thought that is what *jedit<br>
-R YYY -A XXX* would be for. I had expected/hoped that this would not build<br>
the theories in sessions XXX and YYY, only the theories from other<br>
sessions. Unfortunately, this is not what <em>-A</em> does, the sessions from XXX<br>
are still prebuilt (it just changes where in the session graph they are<br>
included).</p>
<p>What is the intended use case of <em>-A</em>? And is there a combination of<br>
options that achieves what I had thought it was for (i.e., not prebuild any<br>
theories from XXX and YYY, but all included theories from other sessions)?</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

<p>It merely defines the starting point for building the auxiliary image<br>
for options -R and -S. This sometimes helps to make it work more<br>
smoothly, e.g. as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Using a rather small ancestor like HOL, instead of the endpoint of<br>
a bigger stack like HOL, HOL-Library, HOL-Computational_Algebra,<br>
HOL-Algebra, HOL-Number_Theory.</p>
<p>(2) Using a rather big ancestor to have more background material than<br>
required, e.g. HOL-Analysis, HOL-Probability.</p>
<p>You can see option -A also as fine-tuning of occasionally convoluted<br>
stacks seen in AFP: it contains more hardwired complexity than<br>
necessary. Somehow people like to publish their private development<br>
artifacts.</p>
<p>In the medium term, I would like to see a session image become merely<br>
like a "cache" for ongoing work. E.g. there could be one image for the<br>
Prover IDE, which contains whatever you have visited interactively. On<br>
application shutdown it will be stored, on restart it will be reloaded.</p>
<p>The idea of session images as "build artifact" is a bit of a conceptual<br>
mismatch: I am myself responsible for this confusion, because I've made<br>
images de-facto read-only some decades ago. Reintroducing writable<br>
images is technically difficult, but possible and definitely desirable.</p>

<p>I am unsure what the situation really is. Just some generic points:</p>
<p>* Do you really need so many intermediate sessions?</p>
<p>* Is it feasible to compose adhoc session definitions in<br>
$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/ROOT for the purpose of certain development situations?</p>

<p>Yes, those changes would be really nice I think. :)</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I don't see a way around it. It is in the context of a tool that uses<br>
Isabelle in the backend (<a href="https://github.com/dominique-unruh/qrhl-tool/">https://github.com/dominique-unruh/qrhl-tool/</a>) via<br>
libisabelle, and the binary distribution would only contain one of the<br>
sessions, but the sources contains other session with, e.g., tests.</p>
<p>* Is it feasible to compose adhoc session definitions in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/ROOT for the purpose of certain development situations?<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. That is what I have been doing (and what still works with<br>
Isabelle2018).<br>
So there is no big problem, I just had hoped that the new -R,-A switches<br>
would allow me to avoid this.<br>
The disadvantage is that this ROOT needs to be added on every system that I<br>
use, but that's not a big problem.<br>
So if the current switches don't solve that, it's no problem.<br>
I just wanted to check because they seemed to address a similar use case.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>
