<p>======== TFP 2015 ===========</p>
<p>16th Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming<br>
                                June 3-5, 2015<br>
                        Inria Sophia Antipolis, France<br>
<a href="http://tfp2015.inria.fr/">http://tfp2015.inria.fr/</a></p>
<p>The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an<br>
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of<br>
functional programming, taking a broad view of current and future<br>
trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for<br>
presenting the latest research results, and other contributions (see<br>
below). Authors of draft papers will be invited to submit revised<br>
papers based on the feedback receive at the symposium.  A<br>
post-symposium refereeing process will then select a subset of these<br>
articles for formal publication.</p>
<p>The selected revised papers will be published as a Springer Lecture<br>
Notes in Computer Science (<a href="http://www.springer.com/lncs">www.springer.com/lncs</a>) volume.</p>
<p>TFP 2015 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming<br>
events. TFP 2015 will be accompanied by the International Workshop on<br>
Trends in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE), which will take<br>
place on June 2nd.</p>
<p>The TFP symposium is the heir of the successful series of Scottish<br>
Functional Programming Workshops. Previous TFP symposia were held in</p>
<p>* Edinburgh (Scotland) in 2003;<br>
   * Munich (Germany) in 2004;<br>
   * Tallinn (Estonia) in 2005;<br>
   * Nottingham (UK) in 2006;<br>
   * New York (USA) in 2007;<br>
   * Nijmegen (The Netherlands) in 2008;<br>
   * Komarno (Slovakia) in 2009;<br>
   * Oklahoma (USA) in 2010;<br>
   * Madrid (Spain) in 2011;<br>
   * St. Andrews (UK) in 2012;<br>
   * Provo (Utah, USA) in 2013;<br>
   * and in Soesterberg (The Netherlands) in 2014.<br>

<p>== INVITED SPEAKERS ==</p>
<p>TFP is pleased to announce talks by the following two invited speakers:</p>
<p>* Laurence Rideau is a researcher at INRIA and is interested in the<br>
     semantics of programming languages , the formal methods, and the<br>
     verification tools for programs and mathematical proofs.  She<br>
     participated in the beginnings of the Compcert project (certified<br>
     compiler), and is part of the Component Mathematical team in the<br>
     MSR-INRIA joint laboratory, who performed the formalization of the<br>
     Feit-Thompson theorem successfully.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, computers barged in mathematics with the famous<br>
     proof of the Four Color Theorem.  Initially limited to simple<br>
     calculation, their role is now expanding to the reasoning whose<br>
     complexity is beyond the capabilities of most humans, as the proof of<br>
     the classification of finite simple groups.  We present our large<br>
     collaborative adventure around the formalization of the Feit-Thompson<br>
     theorem (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feit%E2%80%93Thompson_theorem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feit%E2%80%93Thompson_theorem</a>)<br>
     that is a first step to the classification of finite groups<br>
     and that uses a palette of methods and techniques that range from<br>
     formal logic to software (and mathematics) engineering.</p>
<p>* Anil Madhavapeddy</p>
<p>== SCOPE ==</p>
<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various<br>
routes.  As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore<br>
identify the following five article categories. High-quality articles<br>
are solicited in any of these categories:</p>
<p>Research Articles: leading-edge, previously unpublished research work<br>
     Position Articles: on what new trends should or should not be<br>
     Project Articles: descriptions of recently started new projects<br>
     Evaluation Articles: what lessons can be drawn from a finished project<br>
     Overview Articles: summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</p>
<p>Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for<br>
publication to any other forum. They may consider any aspect of<br>
functional programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or<br>
experience-oriented.  Applications of functional programming<br>
techniques to other languages are also within the scope of the<br>
symposium.</p>
<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include:</p>
<p>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing<br>
     Functional programming in the cloud<br>
     High performance functional computing<br>
     Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs<br>
     Dependently typed functional programming<br>
     Validation and verification of functional programs<br>
     Debugging and profiling for functional languages<br>
     Functional programming in different application areas:<br>
       security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded <br>
systems,<br>
       global computing, grids, etc.<br>
     Interoperability with imperative programming languages<br>
     Novel memory management techniques<br>
     Program analysis and transformation techniques<br>
     Empirical performance studies<br>
     Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages<br>
     (Embedded) domain specific languages<br>
     New implementation strategies<br>
     Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</p>
<p>If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of<br>
TFP, please contact the TFP 2015 program chair, Manuel Serrano.</p>
<p>== BEST PAPER AWARDS ==</p>
<p>To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper<br>
accepted for the formal proceedings.</p>
<p>TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students,<br>
acknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new<br>
subject trends. A student paper is one for which the authors state<br>
that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are listed<br>
as first authors, and a student would present the paper. A prize for<br>
the best student paper is awarded each year.</p>
<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize.  In case the<br>
best paper happens to be a student paper, that paper will then receive<br>
both prizes.</p>
<p>== SPONSORS ==</p>
<p>TFP is financially supported by Erlang Solutions.</p>
<p>== PAPER SUBMISSIONS ==</p>
<p>Acceptance of articles for presentation at the symposium is based on a<br>
lightweight peer review process of extended abstracts (4 to 10 pages<br>
in length) or full papers (20 pages). The submission must clearly<br>
indicate which category it belongs to: research, position, project,<br>
evaluation, or overview paper. It should also indicate which authors<br>
are research students, and whether the main author(s) are students.  A<br>
draft paper for which ALL authors are students will receive additional<br>
feedback by one of the PC members shortly after the symposium has<br>
taken place.</p>
<p>We use EasyChair for the refereeing process. Papers must be submitted at:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2015">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2015</a></p>
<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS<br>
style. For more information about formatting please consult the<br>
