<p>====== TFPIE 2019 ======</p>
<p>8th International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in <br>
Education<br>
                                  11 June, 2019<br>
                                Vancouver, BC, CA<br>
<a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hage0101/tfpie2019/index.html">http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hage0101/tfpie2019/index.html</a></p>
<p>The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an <br>
international forum for<br>
researchers with interests in all aspects of functional programming, <br>
taking a broad<br>
view of current and future trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively <br>
environment<br>
for presenting the latest research results, and other contributions (see <br>
below at scope).</p>
<p>Please be aware that TFP uses two distinct rounds of submissions (see <br>
below at submission<br>
details).</p>
<p>TFP 2019 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming <br>
events. TFP 2019<br>
will be accompanied by the International Workshop on Trends in <br>
Functional Programming<br>
in Education (TFPIE), which will take place on June 11.</p>
<p>== Invited Speakers ==</p>
<p>TFP 2019 is pleased to announce keynote talks by the following two <br>
invited speakers:</p>
<p>Nikhil Swamy, Microsoft Research: Structuring the Verification of <br>
Imperative Programs with<br>
                                   Functional Programming</p>
<p>Frank Wood, University of British Columbia: Probabilistic Programming</p>
<p>TFPIE 2019 is pleased to have the following invited speaker:</p>
<p>Gregor Kiczales: Functional Programming at the Core of a High Throughput <br>
Software<br>
                  Engineering Curriculum</p>
<p>== Scope ==</p>
<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various <br>
routes. As part of<br>
the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the following five <br>
article<br>
categories. High-quality articles are solicited in any of these categories:</p>
<p>Research Articles:<br>
         Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work<br>
     Position Articles:<br>
         On what new trends should or should not be<br>
     Project Articles:<br>
         Descriptions of recently started new projects<br>
     Evaluation Articles:<br>
         What lessons can be drawn from a finished project<br>
     Overview Articles:<br>
         Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</p>
<p>Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for <br>
publication to any<br>
other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming: <br>
theoretical,<br>
implementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. Applications of <br>
functional programming<br>
techniques to other languages are also within the scope of the symposium.</p>
<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing<br>
     Functional programming in the cloud<br>
     High performance functional computing<br>
     Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs<br>
     Dependently typed functional programming<br>
     Validation and verification of functional programs<br>
     Debugging and profiling for functional languages<br>
     Functional programming in different application areas:<br>
     security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded<br>
     systems, global computing, grids, etc.<br>
     Interoperability with imperative programming languages<br>
     Novel memory management techniques<br>
     Program analysis and transformation techniques<br>
     Empirical performance studies<br>
     Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages<br>
     (Embedded) domain specific languages<br>
     New implementation strategies<br>
     Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</p>
<p>If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of TFP, <br>
please contact<br>
the TFP 2019 program chairs, William J. Bowman and Ron Garcia.</p>
<p>== Best Paper Awards ==</p>
<p>To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper <br>
accepted for<br>
the formal proceedings.</p>
<p>TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students, <br>
acknowledging that<br>
students are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student <br>
paper is one<br>
for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of <br>
students, the students<br>
are listed as first authors, and a student would present the paper. A <br>
prize for the<br>
best student paper is awarded each year.</p>
<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the <br>
best paper happens<br>
to be a student paper, that paper will then receive both prizes.</p>
<p>== Instructions to Author ==</p>
<p>Papers must be submitted at:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2019">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2019</a></p>
<p>Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally <br>
reviewed either<br>
before or after the Symposium.</p>
<p>== Pre-symposium formal review ==</p>
<p>Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted <br>
before an early<br>
deadline and receive their reviews and notification of acceptance for <br>
both presentation<br>
and publication before the symposium. A paper that has been rejected in <br>
this process may<br>
still be accepted for presentation at the symposium, but will not be <br>
considered for the<br>
post-symposium formal review.</p>
<p>== Post-symposium formal review ==</p>
<p>Papers submitted for post-symposium review (draft papers) will receive <br>
minimal reviews and<br>
notification of acceptance for presentation at the symposium. Authors of <br>
draft papers will<br>
be invited to submit revised papers based on the feedback received at <br>
the symposium. A<br>
post-symposium refereeing process will then select a subset of these <br>
articles for formal<br>
publication.</p>
<p>== Paper categories ==</p>
<p>There are two types of submission, each of which can be submitted either <br>
for pre-symposium<br>
or post-symposium review:</p>
<p>Extended abstracts. Extended abstracts are 4 to 10 pages in length.<br>
     Full papers.        Full papers are up to 20 pages in length.</p>
<p>Each submission also belongs to a category:<br>
     research<br>
     position<br>
     project<br>
     evaluation<br>
     overview paper</p>
<p>Each submission should clearly indicate to which category it belongs.</p>
<p>Additionally, a draft paper submission—of either type (extended abstract <br>
or full paper) and<br>
any category—can be considered a student paper. A student paper is one <br>
for which primary<br>
authors are research students and the majority of the work described was <br>
carried out by the<br>
students. The submission should indicate that it is a student paper.</p>
<p>Student papers will receive additional feedback from the PC shortly <br>
after the symposium has<br>
taken place and before the post-symposium submission deadline. Feedback <br>
is only provided for<br>
accepted student papers, i.e., papers submitted for presentation and <br>
post-symposium formal<br>
review that are accepted for presentation. If a student paper is <br>
rejected for presentation,<br>
then it receives no further feedback and cannot be submitted for <br>
post-symposium review.</p>
<p>== Format ==</p>
<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For <br>
more information<br>
about formatting please consult the Springer LNCS web site <br>
(<a href="http://www.springer.com/lncs">http://www.springer.com/lncs</a>).</p>
