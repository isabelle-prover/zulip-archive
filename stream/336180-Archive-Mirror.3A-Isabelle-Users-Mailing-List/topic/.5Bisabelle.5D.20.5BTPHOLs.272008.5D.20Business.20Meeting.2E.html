TPHOLs'2008 Business Meeting</p>
<p>August 21, 2008 (3-4pm)</p>
<p>The meeting  started with  Sofiene Tahar presenting  a summary  of the<br>
initial proposal for  TPHOLS2008, a summary of how  things went in the<br>
conference  this year. This  was followed  by a  brief talk  by Tobias<br>
Nipkow about TPHOLs 2009. Matt Kaufman talked then about his ideas for<br>
TPHOLs 2010. After that several issues were discussed including TPHOLs<br>
name change, and  venue for 2011. The meeting  ended with Matt Kaufman<br>
thanking  Sofiene  Tahar, Otmane  Ait  Mohammed  and  Cesar Munoz  for<br>
arranging TPHOLs 2008.</p>
<p>Sofiene started  by showing a  presentation from his  initial proposal<br>
for TPHOLs  2008 given at the  business meeting of  TPHOLs 2007.  Main<br>
features  in   the  proposal  were,  in  commemoration   of  20  years<br>
anniversary:   embedded  tutorials,   invited  talks,   and  satellite<br>
workshops together with regular  contributions. He then summarized the<br>
time  line  from  call  for   papers  for  TPHOLs  2008,  to  abstract<br>
submissions, to  submission of papers,  notice of acceptance  and then<br>
finally some  conference statistics. 45 papers were  submitted from 13<br>
countries.  Sixteen were  accepted as  regular papers,  6  as emerging<br>
trend papers,  and 1 as proof  pearl. The regular  session papers were<br>
archived  in  LNCS  format  where  emerging  trends  proceedings  were<br>
provided to  the participants (hardcopies  and CD ROM). CD  as default<br>
and hardcopy by request (he  reported that 20 copies were enough!). It<br>
was also  promised that the source  code, and slides  of all tutorials<br>
and invited  talks shall be provided  on the conference web  site in a<br>
few days.</p>
<p>While talking about finances Sofiene mentioned that there were several<br>
generous  sponsors  which  made  this event  possible,  they  included<br>
Concordia University, the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science,<br>
INTEL, RESMIQ,  and NIA. All the  expenses are expected to  be met and<br>
there  may be some  money left  over! Special  rates were  provided to<br>
students  attending  the  conference.  There  was a  plan  to  provide<br>
bursaries  to   some  students  attending  the   conference  but  that<br>
unfortunately  could not  be accomplished.   Overall, this  year there<br>
were 39 regular attendees, 23 students  + 6 from Concordia, a total of<br>
68.</p>
<p>Tobias then talked  about TPHOLS 2009. The TPHOLs  conference web site<br>
is "<a href="http://tphols.in.tum.de">http://tphols.in.tum.de</a>".  In his presentation,  he showed several<br>
pictures of the university  campus and the computer science department<br>
building, and  the "slide"  from the third  floor of the  building. He<br>
suggested two possible  dates for the conference, either  third or the<br>
last  week   of  August  of   2009  with  first  preference   for  the<br>
latter. Tobias also mentioned that he has checked web sites of several<br>
other conference such as CADE, FMCAD,  CAV, etc. to make sure there is<br>
no date conflicts. The conference  format will be the same as previous<br>
year, spread over four days  and consisting of invited papers, regular<br>
contributions, emerging trends, and a  workshop on the last day of the<br>
conference,  The  organizers of  TPHOLs  are  Tobias Nipkow,  Makarius<br>
Wenzel, Stefan Berghofer, and Christian Urban.</p>
<p>The 22nd  TPHOLs will take place  in the computer  science building of<br>
the  Technische   Universitat  Munchen.  The  venue  is   out  of  the<br>
city.  There are no  hotels on  campus. Nearest  hotel is  about 20-25<br>
minutes walk away. One can take the subway to Munich which takes about<br>
25 minutes. There one can find a range of prices for hotels. There are<br>
direct flights from several metropolitan cities to Munich, e.g. Paris,<br>
London, Nice, Montreal,  Chicago. The excursion will be  probably be a<br>
visit to museum followed by a  city tour. Archival format will be LNCS<br>
and support for the invited  speakers will be provided. The organizers<br>
will be looking for sources of  support but the cost in Munich may not<br>
be  as low  Montreal which  was  truly exceptional,  as elaborated  by<br>
Tobias.</p>
<p>Matt  talked  about  TPHOLs/ITP  in  2010.  ITP  (Interactive  theorem<br>
Proving)  2010 will  be held  in Edinburgh  as part  of FLoC  2010. He<br>
briefly described the history  of TPHOLs name change. Initially TPHOLs<br>
wanted to be part of FLoC, but  FLoC said no. Then an idea was floated<br>
that  if TPHOLs  and ACL2  can join  together, then  they can  reach a<br>
critical mass needed to be part of FLOC (Approximately 30 participants<br>
from ACL2, and about 60 participants from TPHOLs community)</p>
<p>For 2010, the idea is to have one day tutorial, two parallel sessions,<br>
one for ACL2 community and one  for the HOL community. Through show of<br>
hands about  20 to  25 showed  interest in attending  a full  day ACL2<br>
tutorial.  There were  about 65 people present in  the conference room<br>
at the time of the show of hand vote.</p>
<p>This  was followed  by open  discussion of  several issues.  The first<br>
issue  discussed was  the change  of name  of TPHOLs  to  ITP starting<br>
2010. Matt lead  the discussion. He asked  if this is a  good idea? He<br>
also mentioned that the steering committee seemed to like it. This was<br>
followed by  a short discussion, mostly  in favor of  the name change,<br>
with some against the change of  name arguing the loss of the "TPHOLs"<br>
icon.  Burkhart  Wolf, John Mathews, Peter Homier,  Matt Kaufman, Yves<br>
Bertot, David  Lester, Cameron  Freer and several  others participated<br>
int  the discussion.  Some of  the  comments included  "it's a  better<br>
name", "we  deal with problems which  are much harder  to handle", "we<br>
bring human insight into the automated reasoning", "Its just evolution<br>
of the name", "it will help draw more representation from industry and<br>
the  mathematics community",  "the number  21st  gives us  an aura  of<br>
respectability so we should not  reset the number of the conference to<br>
one", "FLOC is a good venue to start a new name".</p>
<p>Sofiene suggested that since not all in the HOL community are present,<br>
we should ask for feedback  regarding the name change through email. A<br>
question  was asked  who should  lead this  effort, and  Tobias kindly<br>
accepted to do it.</p>
<p>A question  was asked about what's  the plan after  FLoC 2010. Sofiene<br>
mentioned that  Elsa Gunter showed interest in  holding the conference<br>
at University of Urbana Champaign in 2011.</p>
<p>It was mentioned  that it has been a tradition  to hold the conference<br>
in Europe one year and in  a country outside Europe the following year<br>
(or in broader  sense change continent every year).  Issues about visa<br>
to USA were  discussed. There was a mention  of avoiding countries who<br>
have  unreasonable   policies  regarding  immigration   and  therefore<br>
difficulty for  travel. Some  countries will not  give visas  and some<br>
have a lot of paperwork that needs to be done to get a visa.</p>
<p>Finally,  Matt thanked Sofiene  Tahar, Otmane  Ait Mohammed  and Cesar<br>
Munoz for arranging the conference this year.  One of the participants<br>
mentioned that he  registered late and was not able  to find the exact<br>
location from  the conference web site. Sofiene  replied that detailed<br>
information about  the conference  was to sent  to all  the registered<br>
participants a few days before the conference via email.</p>
