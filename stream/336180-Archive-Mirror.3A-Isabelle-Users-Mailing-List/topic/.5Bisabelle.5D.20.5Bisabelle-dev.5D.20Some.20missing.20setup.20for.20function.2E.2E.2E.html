@lukas: thanks for the hint.<br>
@rene: sorry, I confused two things (map and mapM) so, Rene's suggestion<br>
is orthogonal to what I said and indeed a useful lemma missing from<br>
Option.thy in HOL.</p>

Dear all,</p>
<p>related to Lukas comment (that also small contributions are appropriate <br>
for the AFP) I have some thoughts:</p>
<p>(At least for me) the AFP has a somewhat formal flavor (like a <br>
publication). Furthermore, every entry is associated to fixed authors <br>
(is it possible to extend the author list later on?).</p>
<p>As for Option_Monad: this is a completely unfinished adhoc collection of <br>
functions and lemmas related to the option type, so I'm reluctant to <br>
send it to the AFP. What I do however want, is that other users that <br>
could make use of an option monad have access to the parts that have <br>
already been done and can contribute their own ideas.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a common platform, where arbitrarily mature <br>
developments could be posted, discussed, and improved by the community <br>
(without any formal reviewing; what is useful to the community will <br>
evolve, what is not will decay). Something like hackage for Haskell. <br>
Maybe the AFP is exactly this platform and I was just not aware of it?</p>

<p>To confirm previous discussions: Small entries in the AFP are perfectly fine. Libraries are wanted as well.</p>
<p>I think we do want to stay with a publication-like model.</p>
<p>That model seems to be working well for finished pieces of work, not so well for libraries. Of course, libraries are harder to create in the first place, so it's not surprising that there are fewer.</p>
<p>I don't see that a good reason for the AFP becoming a development platform with rapid development inside its repository. Similarly to hackage, cpan, ctan, and others, it should stay a release and collection place. Active development should happen elsewhere (own sourceforge project, bitbucket, etc). Regular releases from there could then go into the AFP.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think a separate branch makes sense, but we could tag certain entries as libraries if that helps the psychology aspect. If they are actively developed, they can get a link to their home page/project page. That would also solve the problem of who to contact if you have something to contribute/request/etc. Technically we already support evolving versions of entries, and if things like author lists change, that can be marked in the change history. </p>

<p>What means "installing"?  Once we have a proper session specification in <br>
the source trees (not ROOT.ML nor IsaMakefile) you merely point to such <br>
points in the file space without "installation".  Or did you mean <br>
installation of so-called Isabelle components?</p>
<p>Dependencies are already managed pretty well by the Isabelle/Scala layer. <br>
I hope people will dispose their private perl/python approximations at <br>
some point. It is only one more step to unify this with the batch mode, <br>
and discontinue the old usedir stuff (which is from the mid 1990-ies). <br>
It will mean that there is only one way to process sources, without <br>
surprises about different flags for skipping proofs etc. -- but sometimes <br>
this behaviour is actually exploited, hindering such reforms again.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is the adhesion of many power users to extremely old <br>
versions of Proof General / Emacs.  De-facto I am still the main <br>
maintainer of Proof General 3.x and 4.x, with lots of Emacsen on Linux, <br>
Mac OS X, Windows.  At the same time I am trying to get rid of the <br>

<p>It would help if the adherents to Proof General would somehow organize <br>
themselves to take over the responsibility to maintain it with all <br>

I would interpret "installing" to mean downloading theory files and<br>
putting them into an appropriate place in the user's filesystem. After<br>
"installing" an entry or theory library, users should be able to<br>
easily import that library into their own theory files, by writing<br>
something reasonable on the "imports" line (i.e., no absolute or<br>
user-specific path names, but rather something portable that would<br>
work also for anyone else who has installed the same library).</p>

Yes, that would be precisely the idea.</p>
<p>It may be enough to just put a download of the entire AFP wherever the users wants and add the appropriate line to the user components file. Florian has basically already done the rest. The AFP is still of a size where we don't really need to disentangle separate entries.</p>
<p>Dependency management is then reduced to downloading the version of the AFP that fits to the Isabelle version the user has installed.</p>

<p>What means "installing"? Once we have a proper session specification in<br>
the source trees (not ROOT.ML nor IsaMakefile) you merely point to such<br>
points in the file space without "installation". Or did you mean<br>
installation of so-called Isabelle components?</p>
<p>Dependencies are already managed pretty well by the Isabelle/Scala<br>
layer. I hope people will dispose their private perl/python<br>
approximations at some point. It is only one more step to unify this<br>
with the batch mode, and discontinue the old usedir stuff (which is from<br>
the mid 1990-ies). It will mean that there is only one way to process<br>
sources, without surprises about different flags for skipping proofs<br>
etc. -- but sometimes this behaviour is actually exploited, hindering<br>
such reforms again.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is the adhesion of many power users to extremely old<br>
versions of Proof General / Emacs. De-facto I am still the main<br>
maintainer of Proof General 3.x and 4.x, with lots of Emacsen on Linux,<br>
Mac OS X, Windows. At the same time I am trying to get rid of the<br>
TTY/Emacs regime for 4 years already.</p>
<p>It would help if the adherents to Proof General would somehow organize<br>
themselves to take over the responsibility to maintain it with all<br>
consequences.</p>

<p>I would interpret "installing" to mean downloading theory files and<br>
putting them into an appropriate place in the user's filesystem. After<br>
"installing" an entry or theory library, users should be able to<br>
easily import that library into their own theory files, by writing<br>
something reasonable on the "imports" line (i.e., no absolute or<br>
user-specific path names, but rather something portable that would<br>
work also for anyone else who has installed the same library).</p>

<p>Yes, that would be precisely the idea.<br>
Yes that was what I meant.</p>
<p>It may be enough to just put a download of the entire AFP wherever the users wants and add the appropriate line to the user components file. Florian has basically already done the rest. The AFP is still of a size where we don't really need to disentangle separate entries.</p>
<p>Dependency management is then reduced to downloading the version of the AFP that fits to the Isabelle version the user has installed.<br>
I guess it would suffice, but I was more thinking of the following <br>
(again, like cabal for Haskell): you type on your machine the entry that <br>
you want to install, e.g.,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>$ afp install Refine_Monadic</p>
<p>and then the above (i.e., downloading theory files and putting them into <br>
an appropriate place in the filesystem) happens for all files from the <br>
afp on which Refine_Monadic does depend on. Afterwards (as Brian pointed <br>
out) it should be possible without further ado, to import the <br>
"installed" entry in your own theories in a way that does not depend on <br>
any local setup.</p>

<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:c-sterna@jaist.ac.jp">c-sterna@jaist.ac.jp</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>Agreeing to the below</p>
<p>I started a sourceforge project to develop a "library" for the option monad:</p>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/optionmonad/">http://sourceforge.net/p/optionmonad/</a></p>
<p>Of course in Isabelle/HOL it is difficult to have the "right" lemmas <br>
without actual applications. Some applications of the current version of <br>
Option_Monad.thy can be found in the theories Substitution, <br>
Ground_Context_Impl, Equational_Reasoning, and Check_Equational_Proof of</p>
<p><a href="http://cl2-informatik.uibk.ac.at/rewriting/mercurial.cgi/IsaFoR">http://cl2-informatik.uibk.ac.at/rewriting/mercurial.cgi/IsaFoR</a></p>
<p>That's where the current lemmas originate.</p>
<p>It would make sense to have example applications (for regression <br>
testing) as part of the project. Please join the project, contribute <br>
(monadic functions, properties, or example applications), and comment.</p>
<p>I would like to view this as a playground (to find out how such a kind <br>
of project works for Isabelle/HOL), so don't worry to much before <br>
changing something.</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>chris</p>
