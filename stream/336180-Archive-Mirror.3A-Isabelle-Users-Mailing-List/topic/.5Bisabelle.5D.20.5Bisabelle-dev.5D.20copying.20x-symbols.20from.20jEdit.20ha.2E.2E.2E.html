<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
(This got stuck on isabelle-dev for quite some time, where it is basically <br>
off-topic.  See also the brief descriptions of the mailing lists on the <br>
main Isabelle website.)</p>
<p>Concerning "x-symbols", there is quite a bit of confusion, including this <br>
terminology, which stems from an obsolete Emacs package of that name from <br>
a long time ago.  Even in current Proof General 4.x there are no x-symbols <br>
anymore, but Unicode characters for rendering the special Isabelle symbols <br>
like \&lt;alpha&gt;, \&lt;forall&gt; etc.</p>
<p>In contrast to Proof General 4.x, Isabelle/jEdit (and the underlying <br>
Isabelle/Scala) platform do the rendering of symbols in physical unicode <br>
on the JVM by actual translation back and forth, now just by appearance. <br>
This then allows to copy-paste in the front-end space, including other <br>
front-end renderings like the Isabelle HTML output.  It also allows the <br>
editor to search over files using the unicode that you see on the surface, <br>
although the prover sources are still in this encoding-free ASCII format <br>
of Isabelle symbols.  (The latter goes back to Isabelle98, and has <br>
remained mostly stable since then, while there were several different <br>
Unicode standards coming and going in the meantime.)</p>
<p>So far so good.  Problems arise when you mix up front-end views (with <br>
physical unicode rendering) and back-end sources that are given to the <br>
prover by a side entry, without a Isabelle/Scala compliant frontend in <br>
between.  If you produce such a unicode .thy file accidentally, you can <br>
convert it by opening in Isabelle/jEdit and saving it again with the <br>
UTF8-Isabelle encoding that should be enabled by default.  (jEdit also <br>
allows to switch encodings explicitly, and tries to remember that choice <br>
for later.)</p>
<p>Technically that encoding is managed by jEdit, independently of the raw <br>
Java VM encoding concept for text.  At some point, I might move the <br>
UTF8-Isabelle conversion down to the JVM itself.  I've also heard that the <br>
JVM clipboard can be somehow made sensitive to encodings, with potential <br>
alternatives.  The latter might make things work yet more smoothly in the <br>
future, but it needs further investigation of Unicode on the JVM (which is <br>
an endless topic).</p>
