In ProofGeneral, numerals of type 'a are explicitly flagged with their type in<br>
the output. It is an incredibly useful little feature, not just but in<br>
particular for novices. Which is why we introduced it. Any reason not to have it<br>
with jedit as well?</p>

<p>I introduced that feature many years ago, and even the idea to make a <br>

<p>You mean Isabelle/jEdit, or rather the Isabelle/Scala document model <br>
behind it; jEdit is just a plain text editor.</p>
<p>The reason why the constraint is not immediately visible in the output is <br>
the much richer term markup introduced in Isabelle2013:</p>
<p>* Configuration option show_markup controls direct inlining of markup<br>
   into the printed representation of formal entities --- notably type<br>
   and sort constraints.  This enables Prover IDE users to retrieve that<br>
   information via tooltips in the output window, for example.</p>
<p>The old TTY / ProofGeneral behaviour can be recovered by something like <br>
this:</p>
<p>declare [[show_markup = false]]</p>
<p>but this also looses the benefit of constraints that can be retrieved as <br>
tooltips on demand.</p>
<p>To make further progress, without looking back on old features, there are <br>
two things in the pipeline for quite some time (and with some priority):</p>
<p>* Highlighting of places in terms where extra polymorphism is<br>
     introduced.  (Users are more often confused about basic type-inference<br>
     than just the special case of 0, 1, etc.)</p>
<p>* Routine printing of terms with just the right amount of type/sort<br>
     constraints, such that the result is uniquely determined.</p>

<p>The subtle differences of Isabelle/ML versus Standard ML,<br>

<p>For example, questions on Stackoverflow are occasionally tagged as <br>
"isabelle" and "jedit".  In the context of that forum, the natural <br>
language wording of the text needs to be right, or people out there will <br>
not understand what it is about.  (Postings are occasionally removed for <br>
such reasons.)</p>
<p>Even just in the context of the isabelle-users mailing list, we should <br>
soon see users of Isabelle/Eclipse and CLIDE (web front-end from Bremen), <br>
which both use the underlying Isabelle/Scala document model.  In that <br>
sense Isabelle/jEdit is just an example application.</p>
<p>Not every user is required to understand all the details of the overall <br>
