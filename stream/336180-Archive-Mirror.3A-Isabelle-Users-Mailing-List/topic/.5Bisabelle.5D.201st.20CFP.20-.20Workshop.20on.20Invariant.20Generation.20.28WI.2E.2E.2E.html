<p>General</p>
<hr>
<p>The ability to extract and synthesize auxiliary properties<br>
of programs has had a profound effect on program analysis,<br>
testing and verification over the last several decades.<br>
The field of invariant generation draws on a multitude of<br>
techniques ranging from computer algebra, theorem proving,<br>
constraint solving, abstract interpretation techniques<br>
and model-checking.<br>
Likewise, the application areas are diversified from<br>
bootstrapping static program analysis tools,<br>
to test-case generation and into aiding the quest<br>
for verified software. So invariants are a key ingredient<br>
in program analysis and understanding.<br>
Yet, invariant generation poses as many challenges as promises:<br>
A key impediment for program verification<br>
is the overhead associated with providing, debugging,<br>
and verifying auxiliary invariant annotations.</p>
<p>As the design and implementation of reliable software remains<br>
an important issue, any progress in this area will be of utmost<br>
importance for future developments in verified software. In the<br>
context of static analysis and test-case generation, suitable<br>
invariants have the potential of enabling sophisticated<br>
automatic program analysis and high-coverage test-case<br>
generation.</p>
<p>Several modern techniques for program termination and<br>
expected program execution time also rely heavily on<br>
suitable invariants (as relations) for the termination analysis.</p>
<p>Automated discovery of inductive assertions is therefore<br>
one of the ultimate challenges for verification of safety and<br>
security properties of programs.</p>
<p>The increasing power of automated theorem proving and<br>
computer algebra has opened new perspectives for computer<br>
aided program verification; in particular for the automatic<br>
generation of inductive assertions in order to reason about<br>
loops and recursion. Especially promising breakthroughs are<br>
invariant generation techniques by Groebner bases,<br>
quantifier elimination, and algorithmic combinatorics,<br>
which can be used in conjunction with model checking,<br>
theorem proving, static analysis and abstract interpretation.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers from<br>
several fields of abstract interpretation, computational<br>
logic and computer algebra to support reasoning about loops,<br>
in particular, by using algorithmic combinatorics,<br>
 narrowing/widening techniques, static analysis,<br>
polynomial algebra, quantifier elimination and model checking.</p>
<p>We encourage submissions presenting work in progress,<br>
tools under development, as well as research of PhD students,<br>
such that the workshop can become a forum for active dialog<br>
between the groups involved in this new research area.</p>
<p>Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Program analysis and verification</li>
<li>Inductive Assertion Generation</li>
<li>Inductive Proofs for Reasoning about Loops</li>
<li>Applications to Assertion Generation using the following tools:<ul>
<li>Abstract Interpretation,</li>
<li>Static Analysis,</li>
<li>Model Checking,</li>
<li>Theorem Proving,</li>
<li>Algebraic Techniques</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tools for inductive assertion generation and verification</li>
<li>Alternative techniques for reasoning about loops</li>
</ul>
