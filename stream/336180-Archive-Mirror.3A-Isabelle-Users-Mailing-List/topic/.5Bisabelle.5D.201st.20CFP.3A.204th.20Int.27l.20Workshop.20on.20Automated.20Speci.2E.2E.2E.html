Workshop                 July 4, 2008</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The  increased  complexity  of Web sites and the explosive growth of<br>
Web-based applications has turned their design and construction into<br>
a  challenging problem. Nowadays, many companies have diverted their<br>
Web   sites   into   interactive,   completely-automated,  Web-based<br>
applications (such  as  Amazon, on-line banking, or travel agencies)<br>
with  a  high complexity that requires appropriate specification and<br>
verification  techniques and tools. Systematic, formal approaches to<br>
the  analysis  and  verification  can  address  the problems of this<br>
particular  domain  with  automated  and  reliable  tools  that also<br>
incorporate semantic aspects.</p>
<p>We solicit original papers on formal methods and techniques applied<br>
to Web sites, Web services or Web-based applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>rule-based approaches to Web site analysis, certification,<br>
     specification, verification, and optimization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formal models for describing and reasoning about Web sites</p>
</li>
<li>model-checking, synthesis and debugging of Web sites</li>
<li>
<p>abstract interpretation and program transformation applied<br>
     to the semantic Web</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>intelligent tutoring and advisory systems for Web specifications<br>
     authoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web quality and Web metrics</p>
</li>
<li>Web usability and accessibility</li>
<li>Testing and evaluation of Web systems and applications</li>
</ul>
<p>The WWV series provides a forum for researchers from the communities<br>
of Rule-based programming, Automated Software Engineering, and<br>
Web-oriented research to facilitate the cross-fertilization and the<br>
advancement of hybrid methods that combine the three areas.</p>
<p>The previous WWV editions were: WWV'07 (Venice, Italy), WWV'06 <br>
(Paphos, Cyprus), and WWV'05 (Valencia, Spain).</p>
<p>LOCATION</p>
<p>WWV'08 will be held in July in the convention centre of the<br>
University of Siena, Italy: <a href="http://www.unisi.it/santachiara/">http://www.unisi.it/santachiara/</a></p>
<p>The workshop will be co-located with WFLP'08:<br>

<p>WORKSHOP VENUE</p>
<p>Siena is one of the nicest city in Italy. The historical centre is<br>
situated  on   top of a   hill and   is made of beautiful medieval <br>
buildings   and   churches,   all surrounded by ancient walls. The <br>
countryside of Siena is worldwide famous for its beauty. The Palio <br>
of Siena is probably the most famous historical fair in Italy. The <br>
most   important event of it is a horse race  of medieval origins, <br>
which is held  in the afternoon of July 2nd  in 'Piazza del Campo' <br>
in the centre of Siena. For more information, please visit<br>
