<p>ACM Symposium on Applied Computing<br>
==================================</p>
<p>The ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) has gathered scientists from<br>
different areas of computing over the last thirty years. The forum represents an<br>
opportunity to interact with different communities sharing an interest in<br>
applied computing.</p>
<p>SAC 2019 is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing<br>
(SIGAPP), and will be hosted by the University of Cyprus, Limassol, Cyprus.</p>
<p>Software Verification and Testing Track<br>
=======================================</p>
<p>The Software Verification and Testing track aims at contributing to the<br>
challenge of improving the usability of formal methods in software<br>
engineering. The track covers areas such as formal methods for verification and<br>
testing, based on theorem proving, model checking, static analysis, and run-time<br>
verification. We invite authors to submit new results in formal verification and<br>
testing, as well as development of technologies to improve the usability of<br>
formal methods in software engineering. Also are welcome detailed descriptions<br>
of applications of mechanical verification to large scale software. Possible<br>
topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>model checking</li>
<li>theorem proving</li>
<li>correct by construction development</li>
<li>model-based testing</li>
<li>software testing</li>
<li>symbolic execution</li>
<li>static and dynamic analysis</li>
<li>abstract interpretation</li>
<li>analysis methods for dependable systems</li>
<li>software certification and proof carrying code</li>
<li>fault diagnosis and debugging</li>
<li>verification and validation of large scale software systems</li>
<li>
<p>real world applications and case studies applying software testing<br>
and verification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>benchmarks and data sets for software testing and verification</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission Guidelines<br>
=====================</p>
<p>Paper submissions must be original, unpublished work. Author(s) name(s) and<br>
address(es) must not appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference should<br>
be avoided and made in the third person. Submitted paper will undergo a blind<br>
review process. Authors of accepted papers should submit an editorial revision<br>
of their papers that fits within eight two-column pages (an extra two pages, to<br>
a total of ten pages, may be available at a charge). Please comply to this page<br>
limitation already at submission time. Accepted papers will be published in the<br>
ACM SAC 2019 proceedings.</p>
<p>Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of papers, posters, or<br>
SRC abstracts in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy attending SAC<br>
MUST present the work. This is a requirement for the presented work to be<br>
included in the ACM/IEEE digital library. No-show of registered papers, posters,<br>
and SRC abstracts will result in excluding them from the ACM/IEEE digital<br>
library.</p>
<p>After the Symposium we will organize a special issue of the Software Quality<br>
Journal (SQJ) on the topics of SVT.</p>
<p>Student Travel Award<br>
====================</p>
<p>The SIGAPP Student Travel Award Program (STAP) was established to provide<br>
financial support for SIGAPP student members to attend SIGAPP primary conference<br>
(SAC) to present their accepted work. Student primary authors and co-authors are<br>
eligible to apply for these awards. For details please see:<br>

<p>Student Research Competition<br>
============================</p>
<p>As previous editions, SAC 2019 organises a Student Research Competition (SRC)<br>
Program to provide graduate students the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas<br>
with researchers and practitioners in their areas of interest. Guidelines and<br>
information about the SRC program can be found at<br>
<a href="http://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/">http://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/</a>.</p>
<p>Program Committee Chairs<br>
========================</p>
<p>Leonardo Mariani, University of Milano Bicocca<br>
Matthias Guedemann, Diffblue Ltd.</p>
<p>Program Committee<br>
=================</p>
<p>will be announced in time on the webpage</p>
