<p>======== TFP 2017 ===========</p>
<p>18th Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming<br>
                            19-21 June, 2017<br>
                      University of Kent, Canterbury<br>
<a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/events/tfp17/index.html">https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/events/tfp17/index.html</a></p>
<p>The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an<br>
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of<br>
functional programming, taking a broad view of current and future<br>
trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for<br>
presenting the latest research results, and other contributions (see<br>
below). Authors of draft papers will be invited to submit revised<br>
papers based on the feedback receive at the symposium.  A<br>
post-symposium refereeing process will then select a subset of these<br>
articles for formal publication.</p>
<p>TFP 2017 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming<br>
events. TFP 2017 will be accompanied by the International Workshop on<br>
Trends in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE), which will take<br>
place on 22 June.</p>
<p>The TFP symposium is the heir of the successful series of Scottish<br>
Functional Programming Workshops. Previous TFP symposia were held in</p>
<p>* Edinburgh (Scotland) in 2003;<br>
    * Munich (Germany) in 2004;<br>
    * Tallinn (Estonia) in 2005;<br>
    * Nottingham (UK) in 2006;<br>
    * New York (USA) in 2007;<br>
    * Nijmegen (The Netherlands) in 2008;<br>
    * Komarno (Slovakia) in 2009;<br>
    * Oklahoma (USA) in 2010;<br>
    * Madrid (Spain) in 2011;<br>
    * St. Andrews (UK) in 2012;<br>
    * Provo (Utah, USA) in 2013;<br>
    * Soesterberg (The Netherlands) in 2014;<br>
    * Inria Sophia-Antipolis (France) in 2015;<br>
    * and Maryland (USA) in 2016.</p>
<p>For further general information about TFP please see the TFP homepage.<br>
(<a href="http://www.tifp.org/">http://www.tifp.org/</a>).</p>
<p>== SCOPE ==</p>
<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various<br>
routes.  As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore<br>
identify the following five article categories. High-quality articles<br>
are solicited in any of these categories:</p>
<p>Research Articles: leading-edge, previously unpublished research work<br>
Position Articles: on what new trends should or should not be<br>
Project Articles: descriptions of recently started new projects<br>
Evaluation Articles: what lessons can be drawn from a finished project<br>
Overview Articles: summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</p>
<p>Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for<br>
publication to any other forum. They may consider any aspect of<br>
functional programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or<br>
experience-oriented.  Applications of functional programming<br>
techniques to other languages are also within the scope of the<br>
symposium.</p>
<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing<br>
      Functional programming in the cloud<br>
      High performance functional computing<br>
      Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs<br>
      Dependently typed functional programming<br>
      Validation and verification of functional programs<br>
      Debugging and profiling for functional languages<br>
      Functional programming in different application areas:<br>
        security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded<br>
        systems, global computing, grids, etc.<br>
      Interoperability with imperative programming languages<br>
      Novel memory management techniques<br>
      Program analysis and transformation techniques<br>
      Empirical performance studies<br>
      Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages<br>
      (Embedded) domain specific languages<br>
      New implementation strategies<br>
      Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</p>
<p>If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of<br>
TFP, please contact the TFP 2017 program chairs, Scott Owens and Meng Wang.</p>
<p>== BEST PAPER AWARDS ==</p>
<p>To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper<br>
accepted for the formal proceedings.</p>
<p>TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students,<br>
acknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new<br>
subject trends. A student paper is one for which the authors state<br>
that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are listed<br>
as first authors, and a student would present the paper. A prize for<br>
the best student paper is awarded each year.</p>
<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the<br>
best paper happens to be a student paper, that paper will then receive<br>
both prizes.</p>
<p>== SPONSORS ==</p>
<p>TBD</p>
<p>== PAPER SUBMISSIONS ==</p>
<p>Acceptance of articles for presentation at the symposium is based on a<br>
lightweight peer review process of extended abstracts (4 to 10 pages<br>
in length) or full papers (20 pages). The submission must clearly<br>
indicate which category it belongs to: research, position, project,<br>
evaluation, or overview paper. It should also indicate which authors<br>
are research students, and whether the main author(s) are students.  A<br>
draft paper for which ALL authors are students will receive additional<br>
feedback by one of the PC members shortly after the symposium has<br>
taken place.</p>
<p>We use EasyChair for the refereeing process. Papers must be submitted at:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp17">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp17</a></p>
<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS<br>
style. For more information about formatting please consult the<br>

<p>The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an<br>
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of<br>
functional programming, taking a broad view of current and future<br>
trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for<br>
presenting the latest research results, and other contributions (see<br>
below at scope).</p>
<p>Please be aware that TFP uses two distinct rounds of submissions (see<br>
below at submission details).</p>
<p>TFP 2018 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming<br>
events. TFP 2018 will be accompanied by the International Workshop on<br>
Trends in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE), which will take<br>
place on June 14.</p>
<p>== SCOPE ==</p>

<p>== Best Paper Awards ==</p>
<p>To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper<br>
accepted for the formal proceedings.</p>
<p>TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students, acknowledging<br>
that students are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student<br>
paper is one for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of<br>
students, the students are listed as first authors, and a student would present<br>
the paper. A prize for the best student paper is awarded each year.</p>
<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the best<br>
paper happens to be a student paper, that paper will then receive both prizes.</p>
<p>== Paper Submissions ==</p>
<p>We use EasyChair for the refereeing process. The link to the submission page is:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2018</a></p>
<p>Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally reviewed<br>
either before or after the Symposium.</p>
<p>== Pre-symposium formal review ==</p>
<p>Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted before<br>
an early deadline and receive their reviews and notification of acceptance for<br>
both presentation and publication before the symposium. A paper that has been<br>
rejected in this process may still be accepted for presentation at the symposium,<br>
but will not be considered for the post-symposium formal review.</p>
<p>== Post-symposium formal review ==</p>
<p>Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance for<br>
presentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers will be invited to submit<br>
revised papers based on the feedback receive at the symposium. A post-symposium<br>
refereeing process will then select a subset of these articles for formal publication.</p>
<p>== Paper categories ==</p>
<p>Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as extended<br>
abstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (20 pages). The submission must<br>
clearly indicate which category it belongs to: research, position, project,<br>
evaluation, or overview paper. It should also indicate which authors are research<br>
students, and whether the main author(s) are students. A draft paper for which all<br>
authors are students will receive additional feedback by one of the PC members<br>
shortly after the symposium has taken place.</p>
<p>== Format ==</p>
<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For more<br>
information about formatting please consult the Springer LNCS web site.</p>
