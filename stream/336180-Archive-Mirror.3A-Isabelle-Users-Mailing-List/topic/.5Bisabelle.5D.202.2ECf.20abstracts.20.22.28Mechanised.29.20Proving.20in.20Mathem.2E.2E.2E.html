<p>Proving in Mathematics Education<br>
                         at University and at School<br>
                     ====================================<br>
                               Minisymposion at<br>
                  Austrian-Hungarian Mathematical Conference<br>
                      Győr,  Hungaria, 25-27 August 2015<br>

<hr>
<p>The minisymposion intends to discuss usability of technology applications<br>
in education in relation to proving and primarily focuses on a specific<br>
technology, Computer Theorem Proving (TP), for education in academia and<br>
beyond. The proposal is backed by increasing interest in technology<br>
integration in education to support proofs as well as the applications of<br>
TP. The completion of the TP-based proof of the Kepler Conjecture was<br>
announced on August 10th, 2014.</p>
<p>TP is reliably grounded on formal calculus — whereas proof is not taught<br>
as a formal calculus in general academic education. Rather, students adopt<br>
the habits of their academic environment and copy the way of proving from<br>
their academic teachers. Evidently this results in a lack of confidence<br>
for most students and in a lack of control of what they are doing. High-<br>
school seems affected by these academic traditions such, that proof is<br>
considered too comprehensive for most students in spite of curricula<br>
explicitly mentioning mathematical proof.</p>
<p>The Minisymposion presents experiences from courses supported by technology<br>
applications in relation to proving and TP technology at academia and at<br>
high-school throughout Europe. A major point of discussion will be the<br>
issue to narrow the gap between high-school math and academic mathematics<br>
in Science, Technology and Engineering (STEM) education. In particular,<br>
the (planned/envisioned) use of existing TP software systems in an<br>
educational setting or concrete plans for (future/desired) educational<br>
TP software systems should be demonstrated with the aim to get a common<br>
view on the requirements for such systems that would make them widely<br>
accepted teaching tools.</p>
<p>This minisymposion is motivated by the hope that bottom-up approaches in<br>
local cooperation might be more successful than pretentious top-down<br>
approaches to the sensible, but important topic. For preparing discussions<br>
we invite submission of abstracts (at most 3 pages) on topics including,<br>
but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Demonstration of tools supporting proofs and using TP technology,<br>
   i.e. tools which generate assumptions, which interactively or<br>
   automatically perform proofs, which systematically generate proof<br>
   obligations, which use TP for checking user input, etc.<br>
   (... called "TP-based" software in the sequel)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiences from academic courses of various kinds using TP-based<br>
   software --- probably including feature requests for future<br>
   development of such software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of mathematics and mathematical activities which might<br>
   specifically take advantage from support by TP-based software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematical concepts and (TP-based) technology specifically<br>
   relevant for software support in teaching and learning to prove</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiences from initiatives and activities filling the gap between<br>
   school and university --- and their relation to TP-based technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
