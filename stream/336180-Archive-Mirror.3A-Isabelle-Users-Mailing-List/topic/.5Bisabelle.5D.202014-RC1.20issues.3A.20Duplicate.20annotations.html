Hi,</p>
<p>in some cases, duplicate annotations occur in terms in proof_methods.<br>
Consider the theory:</p>
<p>lemma P<br>
  apply (simp add: exI[of _ 1])</p>
<p>and hover over the 1, which now has a duplicate set of annotations.</p>
<p>Duplicate annotations also occur in locale expressions:</p>
<p>locale A = fixes x<br>
locale B = A z for z + assumes False</p>
<p>Here, the "z" has a duplicate set of annotations from Syntax.check_term<br>
(but only a single one from Syntax.read_term).</p>
<p>I tried to dig into what triggers this behaviour:</p>
<p>For proof methods, this is related to the introduction of a method<br>
closure (which executes every proof method twice). The use of e.g. the<br>
Args.term parser is fine; but if one uses Args.name_inner_syntax and<br>
Syntax.read_term later, annotations are duplicated:</p>
<p>method_setup foo1 = ‹<br>
  Args.term &gt;&gt; (fn _ =&gt; fn _ =&gt; SIMPLE_METHOD' (K all_tac))<br>
›</p>
<p>vs.</p>
<p>method_setup foo2 = ‹<br>
  Scan.peek (fn ctxt =&gt; Args.name_inner_syntax &gt;&gt; Syntax.read_term<br>
(Context.proof_of ctxt)) &gt;&gt;<br>
  (fn _ =&gt; fn _ =&gt; SIMPLE_METHOD' (K all_tac))<br>
›</p>
<p>except if the method errors out unconditionally (and hence is called<br>
only once):</p>
<p>method_setup foo3 = ‹<br>
  Args.term -- Scan.peek (fn ctxt =&gt; Args.name_inner_syntax &gt;&gt;<br>
Syntax.read_term (Context.proof_of ctxt)) &gt;&gt;<br>
  (fn _ =&gt; raise Match)<br>
›</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This is a careful analysis of this particular situation in <br>
Isabelle2014-RC1, which was the result of spending several weeks this year <br>
to make refinements over Isabelle2013-2.</p>
<p>Here is another example:</p>
<p>lemma "x = x" "x = x" "x = x" by (rule refl [of x])+</p>
<p>If you C-hover over the fact "refl" and the variable "x" in either <br>
Isabelle version, you see how often the system traverses that spot to make <br>
a PIDE markup report.</p>
<p>It is the very concept of PIDE that markup is produced as a trace from <br>
internal aspects of the prover.  It is then left as an exercise to rework <br>
the prover that this information makes sense to the user.  Attendants of <br>
the UITP2014 workshop in Vienna may remember the brief discussion we've <br>
had about that for Coq PIDE in particular.</p>
<p>In the example above, the rule method is already in a pretty good state: <br>
its main argument outline is processed exactly once in its "static phase", <br>
before actually applying it to the goal state.  The attribute "of" <br>
notoriously suffers from dynamic evaluation, though, and causes redundant <br>
multiplication of markup.</p>
<p>The static closure of proof methods has made progress in Isabelle2014-RC1, <br>
but it is not fully finished yet.  Even in that partial stage, I can <br>
foresee complaints by proof tool authors about that sanitation.  See also <br>
the NEWS:</p>
<p>* More static checking of proof methods, which allows the system to<br>
   form a closure over the concrete syntax.  Method arguments should be<br>
   processed in the original proof context as far as possible, before<br>
   operating on the goal state.  In any case, the standard discipline for<br>
   subgoal-addressing needs to be observed: no subgoals or a subgoal<br>
   number that is out of range produces an empty result sequence, not an<br>
   exception.  Potential INCOMPATIBILITY for non-conformant tactical<br>
   proof tools.</p>
<p>The requirements for tactics or Isar proof methods are described in the <br>
"implementation" manual, as usual.</p>
<p>The relative silence in that respect of "potential incompatibility" is <br>
probably a proof that only few people have tested their own tools with<br>
Isabelle2014-RC1 so far.</p>

After looking carefully at args.ML I know now how e.g. Args.term<br>
prevents a term from being parsed twice.</p>

<p>I am in a more complicated situation: I have a parser which read_term-s<br>
the terms in a different order than they appear in the source and<br>
modifies the context (by fixing some of the term variables), so I need<br>
to use Parse.term instead of Args.term. It is static in the sense that<br>
the interpretation of the terms does not depend on the goal state.</p>
<p>Some questions arise from that and my new understanding of<br>
static/dynamic phase separation:</p>
<p>* Does it make sense at this point to mimic the Token.assign machinery<br>
    used in Args? Or is it likely that the need to do this manually will<br>
    go away with say 2014+1?</p>
<p>If yes:</p>
<p>* Is it ok for a context_parser to modify the context? (probably not,<br>
    since most of the parser will be short-circuited after the static phase)</p>
<blockquote>

I had to convert a few methods already; mostly by wrapping them into<br>
SUBGOAL.</p>
