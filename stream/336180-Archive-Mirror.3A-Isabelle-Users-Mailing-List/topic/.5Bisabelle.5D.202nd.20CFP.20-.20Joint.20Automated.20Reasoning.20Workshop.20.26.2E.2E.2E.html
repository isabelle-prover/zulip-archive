2nd CALL FOR ABSTRACTS<br>
        Joint Automated Reasoning Workshop and Deduktionstreffen<br>
                       23-24 July 2014, Vienna, Austria<br>
<a href="http://vsl2014.at/pages/ARWDT-index.html">http://vsl2014.at/pages/ARWDT-index.html</a></p>
<p>AIMS AND SCOPE</p>
<p>For many years the British and the German automated reasoning communities<br>
have successfully run independent series of workshops for anybody working<br>
in the area of automated reasoning. Although open to the general public<br>
they addressed in the past primarily the British and the German<br>
communities, respectively. At the occasion of the Vienna Summer of Logic<br>
the two series will have a joint event in Vienna as an IJCAR workshop. In<br>
the spirit of the two series there will be no formal proceedings and we try<br>
to maintain the informal open atmosphere of the two series. We welcome in<br>
particular research students to present their work. We solicit for all work<br>
related to automated reasoning and its applications. We are particularly<br>
interested in work-in-progress and the presentation of half-baked ideas.</p>
<p>As in the previous years, we aim to bring together researchers from all<br>
areas of automated reasoning in order to foster links among researchers<br>
from various disciplines; among theoreticians, implementers and users<br>
alike, and among international communities, this year not just the British<br>
and German communities.</p>
<p>TOPICS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:</p>
<p>- Theorem proving in classical and non-classical logics<br>
   - Interactive theorem proving, logical frameworks, proof assistants,<br>
     proof-planning</p>
<p>- Reasoning methods<br>
      o Saturation-based, instantiation-based, tableau, SAT<br>
      o Equational reasoning, unification<br>
      o Constraint satisfaction<br>
      o Decision procedures, SMT<br>
      o Combining reasoning systems<br>
      o Non-monotonic reasoning, commonsense reasoning,<br>
      o Abduction, induction<br>
      o Model checking, model generation, explanation</p>
<p>- Formal methods to specifying, deriving, transforming<br>
     and verifying computer systems, requirements and software</p>
<p>- Logic-based knowledge representation and reasoning:<br>
      o Ontology engineering and reasoning<br>
      o Domain specific reasoning (spatial, temporal, epistemic,agents, etc)</p>
<p>- Logic and functional programming, deductive databases<br>
   - Implementation issues and empirical results, demos<br>
   - Practical experiences and applications of automated reasoning</p>
<p>For each accepted abstract we expect that one of the authors gives a short<br>
plenary presentation as well as a poster presentation at the<br>
workshop. Authors of accepted presentations will have a chance to revise<br>
their submissions.</p>
<p>Suggestions for a panel session should include a list of potential<br>
panellists in addition to the topic and to a statement of relevance. These<br>
suggestions should also be submitted via the same EasyChair route.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>Submission of Abstracts/panel proposals    1 May 2014<br>
Notification of Acceptance                15 May 2014<br>
Final Version                             20 May 2014<br>

<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>We invite the submission of two-page abstracts for poster presentations as<br>
well as for suggestions for panel sessions. The two-page abstracts in pdf<br>
format should be submitted via EasyChair at<br>
