<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br>
      5th International Conference on Tests and Proofs (TAP 2011)<br>
<a href="http://www.tap2011.informatik.uni-bremen.de/">http://www.tap2011.informatik.uni-bremen.de/</a><br>
          June 30 - July 1, 2011, Zuerich, Switzerland<br>
          Part of the TOOLS Federated Conferences 2011</p>
<p>The TAP conference is devoted to the convergence of proofs and tests, to<br>
the application of techniques from both sides and their combination for<br>
the advancement of software quality. Test and Proof seem to be<br>
contradictory techniques: if you have proved your program, it's<br>
fruitless to comb it for bugs; and if you are testing it, that is surely<br>
a sign that you have given up on any hope to prove its correctness.<br>
Accordingly, proofs and tests have, since the onset of software<br>
engineering research, been pursued by distinct communities.</p>
<p>However, the development of both approaches lead to the discovery of<br>
common issues and to the realization that each may need the other. The<br>
emergence of model checking has been one of the first signs that<br>
contradiction may yield to complementarity. Further evidence give<br>
test data generation techniques from models or programs boil down to<br>
constraint resolution techniques for relatively large formula; the<br>
advent of powerful SMT solvers have therefore powered new testing<br>
techniques.  Finally, since formal, proof-based verification is costly,<br>
testing invariants and background theories can be helpful to detect<br>
errors early and to improve cost effectivity.  Summing up, in the past<br>
few years an increasing number of research efforts have encountered the<br>
need for combining proofs and tests, dropping earlier dogmatic views of<br>
incompatibility and taking instead the best of what each of these<br>
software engineering domains has to offer.</p>
<p>The TAP conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners<br>
working in the converging fields of testing and proving, and will offer<br>
a generous allocation of panels and informal discussions.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include (other topics related to TAP are welcome):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transfer of concepts from testing to proving (e.g., coverage criteria)<br>
  and from proving to testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Program proving with the aid of testing techniques</p>
</li>
<li>Verification and testing techniques combining proofs and tests</li>
<li>
<p>Generation of test data, oracles, or preambles by deductive<br>
  techniques such as: theorem proving, model checking, symbolic<br>
  execution, constraint logic programming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model-based testing and verification</p>
</li>
<li>Generation of specifications by deduction</li>
<li>Automatic bug finding</li>
<li>Formal frameworks</li>

<li>Case studies combining tests and proofs</li>
</ul>
