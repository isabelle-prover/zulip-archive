<p>2nd Call for Papers</p>
<p>Special Issue On Operating Systems Verification</p>
<p>Journal of Automated Reasoning</p>
<p>Industrial-strength software analysis and verification has advanced in recent<br>
years through the introduction of model checking, automated and interactive<br>
theorem proving, static analysis techniques, as well as correctness by<br>
design. However, many techniques are working under restrictive assumptions<br>
which are invalidated by complex (embedded) system software such as operating<br>
system kernels, low-level device drivers or microcontroller code.</p>
<p>This special issue will be devoted to the formal verification of operating<br>
systems and similar low-level systems code. The emphasis is on techniques and<br>
methods that provide real solutions to real software problems. A real<br>
solution is one that is applicable to the problem in industry and not one<br>
that only applies to an abstract, academic toy version of it. Submissions are<br>
encouraged, but not limited to, the following topics and their application to<br>
operating systems or low-level systems code:</p>
<p>* model checking<br>
     * automated and interactive theorem proving<br>
     * embedded systems development<br>
     * programming languages<br>
     * verifying compilers<br>
     * software certification</p>
<p>Manuscripts should be unpublished works and not submitted elsewhere. Revised<br>
and enhanced versions of papers published in conference proceedings that have<br>
not appeared in archival journals are eligible for submission. All<br>
submissions will be reviewed according to the usual standards of scholarship<br>
and originality.</p>
<p>Papers should be in pdf format, following the JAR guidelines for authors, and<br>
be submitted via EasyChair at:<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jarosv08">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jarosv08</a></p>
<p>Please do not use the Springer online submission system for the special issue<br>
at this stage, but EasyChair instead. To encourage a speedy review cycle, it<br>
will be expected that authors of submissions also serve as referees.</p>
