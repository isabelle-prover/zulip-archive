2nd Call For Papers</p>
<p>3rd International Workshop on</p>
<p>Systems Software Verification (SSV 08)<br>
            Real Software, Real Problems, Real Solutions</p>
<p>Feb 25/26 2008, Sydney, Australia</p>
<p><a href="http://nicta.com.au/ssv08/">http://nicta.com.au/ssv08/</a></p>
<p>Industrial-strength software analysis and verification has advanced in<br>
recent years through the introduction of model checking, automated and<br>
interactive theorem proving, and static analysis techniques as well as<br>
correctness by design, correctness by contract, and model-driven<br>
development. However, many techniques are working under restrictive<br>
assumptions which are invalidated by complex (embedded) system<br>
software such as operating system kernels, low-level device drivers or<br>
microcontroller code.</p>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and<br>
developers from both academia and industry, who are facing real<br>
software and real problems to find real, applicable solutions. By<br>
"real" we mean problems such as time-to-market or reliability that the<br>
industry is facing and is trying to fix in software that is deployed<br>
in the market place. A real solution is one that is applicable to the<br>
problem in industry and not one that only applies to an abstract,<br>
academic toy version of it. This forum will discuss software<br>
analysis/development techniques and tools; it will also serve as a<br>
platform to discuss open problems and future challenges in dealing<br>
with existing and upcoming system code.</p>
<p>Topics include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>* model checking<br>
     * automated and interactive theorem proving<br>
     * static analysis<br>
     * automated testing<br>
     * model-driven development<br>
     * embedded systems development<br>
     * programming languages<br>
     * verifying compilers<br>
     * software certification<br>
     * software tools<br>
     * experience reports</p>
<p>Interested speakers should submit their paper (max 15 pages, ENTCS<br>
style) to <a href="http://www.easychair.org/SSV08/">http://www.easychair.org/SSV08/</a> by Oct 19 2007, 23:59h<br>
Samoan time. All papers will be subject to peer review under normal<br>
conference standards. Experience reports and papers on work in<br>
progress are welcome as long as there is a clear contribution.<br>
Accepted submissions are planned to be published at ENTCS. Submissions<br>
must be in pdf format and follow the ENTCS style instructions at<br>
