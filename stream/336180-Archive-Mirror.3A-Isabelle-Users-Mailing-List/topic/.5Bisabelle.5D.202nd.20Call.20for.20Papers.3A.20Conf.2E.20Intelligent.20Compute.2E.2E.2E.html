<p>As   computers   and   communications  technology   advance,   greater<br>
opportunities  arise for  intelligent mathematical  computation. While<br>
computer  algebra, automated  deduction,  mathematical publishing  and<br>
novel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,<br>
we  are now seeing  increasing opportunities  for synergy  among these<br>
areas.  The  Conferences on  Intelligent  Computer Mathematics  (CICM)<br>
offer a venue for discussing these areas and their synergy.</p>
<p>CICM has been held annually  as a joint meeting since 2008, colocating<br>
related conferences  and workshops to advance work  in these subjects.<br>
Previous meetings have been held in Birmingham (U.K. 2008), Grand Bend<br>
(Canada  2009), Paris  (France 2010),  Bertinoro (Italy  2011), Bremen<br>
(Germany 2012) and Bath (U.K. 2013).</p>
<p>This is  a call for papers  for CICM 2014,  which will be held  at the<br>
University   of  Coimbra,   7-11   July  2014,   following  the   10th<br>
International Workshop on Automated Deduction in Geometry.</p>
<p>The principal tracks of the conference will be:</p>
<p>Calculemus (Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning)<br>

<p>The local  arrangements will be coordinated by  the Local Arrangements<br>
Chair,   Pedro  Quaresma  (U.  Coimbra,  Portugal),  and  the  overall<br>
programme will be organised by the General Program Chair, Stephen Watt<br>
(U. Western Ontario, Canada).</p>
<p>The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer Verlag<br>
as a volume in Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI).</p>
<p>As in  previous years, it is  anticipated that there will  be a number<br>
co-located workshops, including one to mentor doctoral students giving<br>

Track Calculemus: Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning<br>
================================================================</p>
<p>Calculemus   2014  invites   the  submission   of   original  research<br>
contributions to be considered for publication and presentation at the<br>
conference.  Calculemus  is a series  of conferences dedicated  to the<br>
integration  of  computer  algebra   systems  (CAS)  and  systems  for<br>
mechanised  reasoning  like   interactive  proof  assistants  (PA)  or<br>
automated theorem  provers (ATP).  Currently,  symbolic computation is<br>
divided into several (more  or less) independent branches: traditional<br>
ones  (e.g., computer  algebra and  mechanised reasoning)  as  well as<br>
newly emerging ones (on  user interfaces, knowledge management, theory<br>
exploration, etc.) The main concern  of the Calculemus community is to<br>
bring these  developments together in order to  facilitate the theory,<br>
design,  and  implementation   of  integrated  mathematical  assistant<br>
systems  that  will  be  used routinely  by  mathematicians,  computer<br>
scientists and  all others who need  computer-supported mathematics in<br>
their every day business.</p>
<p>All  topics  in  the  intersection  of computer  algebra  systems  and<br>
automated  reasoning systems  are  of interest  for Calculemus.  These<br>
include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated theorem proving in computer algebra systems.</li>
<li>Computer algebra in theorem proving systems.</li>
<li>Adding reasoning capabilities to computer algebra systems.</li>
<li>Adding computational capabilities to theorem proving systems.</li>
<li>
<p>Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for<br>
  computer mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case studies and applications that involve a mix of computation and<br>
  reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case studies in formalization of mathematical theories.</p>
</li>
<li>Representation of mathematics in computer algebra systems.</li>
<li>Theory exploration techniques.</li>
<li>Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction.</li>
<li>
<p>Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint languages,<br>
  and modeling languages for mathematical assistant systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homotopy type theory.</p>
</li>
<li>Infrastructure for mathematical services.</li>

Track DML: Digital Mathematical Libraries<br>
================================================================</p>
<p>Mathematicians  dream of  a digital  archive containing  all validated<br>
mathematical literature ever published, reviewed, properly linked, and<br>
verified.   It is  estimated that  the entire  corpus  of mathematical<br>
knowledge  published over  the centuries  does not  exceed 100,000,000<br>
pages,   an   amount   easily   manageable  by   current   information<br>
technologies.</p>
<p>The  track objective  is to  provide a  forum for  the  development of<br>
math-aware  technologies, standards,  algorithms and  formats  for the<br>
fulfillment  of the  dream of  a global  digital  mathematical library<br>
(DML).  Computer scientists (D) and  librarians of the digital age (L)<br>
are  especially welcome to  join mathematicians  (M) and  discuss many<br>
aspects of DML preparation.</p>
<p>Track topics  are all topics of mathematical  knowledge management and<br>
digital libraries applicable in the context of DML building, including<br>
the  processing  of  mathematical  knowledge expressed  in  scientific<br>
papers in natural languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Math-aware text mining (math mining) and MSC classification</li>
<li>Math-aware representations of mathematical knowledge</li>
<li>Math-aware computational linguistics and corpora</li>
<li>Math-aware tools for [meta]data and fulltext processing</li>
<li>Math-aware OCR and document analysis</li>
<li>Math-aware information retrieval</li>
<li>Math-aware indexing and search</li>
<li>Authoring languages and tools</li>
<li>
<p>MathML, OpenMath, TeX and other mathematical content markup<br>
  languages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web interfaces for DML content</p>
</li>
<li>Mathematics on the web, math crawling and indexing</li>
<li>Math-aware document processing workflows</li>
<li>Archives of written mathematics</li>
<li>DML management, business models</li>
<li>DML rights handling, funding, sustainability</li>
<li>DML content acquisition, validation and curation</li>
<li>Reports and experience from running existing DMLs</li>

mathematics;   publishers  who   offer   mathematical  textbooks   and<br>
disseminate   new    mathematical   results;   and    librarians   and<br>
mathematicians who catalog and organize mathematical knowledge.</p>

management. A non-exclusive list of important topics includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Representations of mathematical knowledge</li>
<li>Authoring languages and tools</li>
<li>Repositories of formalized mathematics</li>
<li>Deduction systems</li>
