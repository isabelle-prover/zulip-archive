<p>=====================================================================<br>
You are invited to submit your contribution to the International<br>
Workshop on MILS.</p>
<p>MILS* is a high-assurance security architecture based on the concepts of separation and controlled information flow. The MILS architectural approach is all about decomposition of a system design into well-understood components and their interactions with the goal to achieve composable architecture and composable assurance for the designed system. The composability of architecture and assurance  for secure systems is a grand challenge, which we undertake to meet using the MILS architectural approach.</p>
<p>Architecture composition defines a secure system from trustworthy components and system architecture. The MILS framework for composable architecture is based on a separation kernel (which has overlapping functionality with a hypervisor) that creates partitions to separate different security domains. Such a separation kernel often needs to support real-time because there are many use-cases in embedded systems. Assurance composition targets creating an assurance argument for the overall system from arguments of its components and the system's security architecture. The workshop also welcomes contributions on the industrial application of the MILS architecture, assurance and certification frameworks, attack methods and templates for MILS systems, as well as presenting the MILS  community.</p>
<p>Workshop topics:<br>
The workshop topics are but not limited to:
*   MILS architectural approach for security and safety
*   MILS components and eco-system
*   MLS systems and their relation to MILS systems
*   MILS use-cases, e.g. from avionics, automotive, communications, industrial automation, medical, railway, consumer and similar domains.
*   Real-time separation kernels
*   MILS evaluation and certification 
*   MILS testing and vulnerability analysis of MILS systems
*   Application of novel and existing information flow models/policies
*   Cross-European/world-wide high-assurance security
*   Formal methods for MILS systems as a basis for high assurance</p>
<p>Paper/Presentation submission:<br>
Submissions do not need to be full papers: this is a workshop and we are looking for interesting experience, work, and ideas (possibly preliminary and exploratory) that will stimulate discussion and thought around MILS concepts and challenges. <br>
Submissions should be in PDF format between 3-12 pages. <br>
We recommend the guidelines for ACM SIG Proceedings.</p>
<p>Electronic submissions:<br>
The submissions page at Easychair is open: <br>
