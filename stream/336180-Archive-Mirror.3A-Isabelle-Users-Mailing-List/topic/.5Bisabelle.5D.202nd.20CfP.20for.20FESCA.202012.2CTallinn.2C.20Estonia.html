<p>9th International Workshop on<br>
Formal Engineering approaches to Software Components and Architectures</p>
<p>Satellite event of ETAPS<br>
March 31st 2012, Tallinn, Estonia</p>

<p>WORKSHOP AIM</p>
<p>Component-based software design has received considerable attention in <br>
industry and academia in the past decade. In recent years, the growing <br>
need for trustworthy software systems and the increased relevance of <br>
systems quality properties (e.g. reliability, performance, and <br>
scalability) have stimulated the emergence of formal techniques and <br>
architecture modelling approaches for the specification and <br>
implementation of component-based software architectures. Both have to <br>
deal with an increasing complexity in software systems challenging <br>
analytical methods as well as modelling techniques.</p>
<p>FESCA aims to address the open question of how formal methods can be <br>
applied effectively to these new contexts and challenges. FESCA is <br>
interested in both the development and application of formal methods in <br>
component-based development and tries to cross-fertilize their research <br>
and application.</p>
<hr>
<p>NEW: We are pleased to announce invited speaker:</p>
<p>SAMUEL KOUNEV, chair of SPEC Research Group (RG) and  Descartes RG at <br>
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany), has agreed to deliver the <br>
FESCA 2012 keynote speech on the topic:<br>
"Modeling of Event-based Communication in Component-based <br>
Architectures:State-of-the-Art and Future Directions"</p>
<hr>
<p>TOPICS</p>
<p>One strength of FESCA is the link established between the formal methods <br>
community and the software engineering community by exploring how formal <br>
approaches can be exploited for the analysis of large software <br>
architectures.</p>
<p>We encourage submissions on formal techniques and their application that <br>
aid reasoning, analysis and certification of component-based <br>
applications. In this context, the following topics are of particular <br>
concern:</p>
<p>*   Architecture as a language: Building Domain-Specific Languages<br>
      (DSLs)<br>
          o Modelling formalisms for the analysis of concurrent, embeded<br>
            or model-driven systems assembled of components;<br>
          o Modelling formalisms in prediction, analysis and measurement<br>
            of software quality attributes such as reliability,<br>
            performance, or security;</p>
<p>* Properties of component-based models<br>
          o Temporal properties (including liveness and safety) and<br>
            their formal verification;<br>
          o Interface compliance (interface-to-interface and<br>
            interface-to implementation) and contractual use of components;</p>
<p>* Formal methods in Component-Based Software Development<br>
          o Techniques for prediction and formal verification of system<br>
            properties, including static and dynamic analysis;<br>
          o Instrumentation and monitoring approaches, runtime<br>
            management of applications;<br>
          o (Semi-) automatic inference of analytical models for<br>
            existing software systems;</p>
<p>* Formal methods in Model-Driven Software Development<br>
          o Abstraction level in modelling formalisms;<br>
          o Safer MDA through integration with formal methods;<br>
          o Correctness of model transformations;</p>
<p>* Industrial case studies and experience reports.</p>
<p>Submissions concentrating on specification techniques should involve an <br>
evaluation of the practical merit of their research and clearly state <br>
the analysis and reasoning techniques they enable. We also appreciate <br>
work of a formal nature with immediate value to the industrial context. <br>
We encourage not only mature research results, submissions presenting <br>
innovative ideas and early results are also of interest.</p>
<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>Three kinds of submissions are considered:</p>
<p>* Regular papers (up to 15 pages in ENTCS format), presenting<br>
      original and unpublished work related to the workshop topics.</p>
<p>* Position papers (up to 10 pages in ENTCS format) presenting ideas<br>
      and directions of interesting ongoing and yet unpublished research<br>
      related to the workshop topics.</p>
<p>* Tool demonstration papers (up to 5 pages in ENTCS format),<br>
      presenting and highlighting the distinguishing features of a<br>
      topic-related tool (co-developed by the authors).</p>
<p>PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>*   Regular and position papers will be published in a special issue<br>
      of the Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS)<br>
      after the workshop.</p>
<p>* All regular, position and tool demonstration papers will appear in<br>
      electronic pre-proceedings distributed at the workshop.</p>
