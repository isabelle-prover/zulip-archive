<p>SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>8th International Verification Workshop (VERIFY’14)<br>
              in connection with IJCAR 2014 at FLoC 2014<br>
                  July 23–24, 2014, Vienna, Austria</p>
<p><a href="http://vsl2014.at/verify">http://vsl2014.at/verify</a></p>
<p>The formal  verification of  critical information  systems has  a long<br>
tradition  as one  of  the  main areas  of  application for  automated<br>
theorem proving. Nevertheless, the area is of still growing importance<br>
as the number of computers  affecting everyday life and the complexity<br>
of  these systems  are  both  increasing. The  purpose  of the  VERIFY<br>
workshop  series is  to  discuss problems  arising  during the  formal<br>
modeling and  verification of  information systems and  to investigate<br>
suitable solutions.  Possible perspectives include those  of automated<br>
theorem proving, tool support, system engineering, and applications.</p>
<p>The VERIFY  workshop series aims  at bringing together people  who are<br>
interested in the development of safety and security critical systems,<br>
in formal  methods, in  the development  of automated  theorem proving<br>
techniques,  and  in  the   development  of  tool  support.  Practical<br>
experiences gained in  realistic verifications are of  interest to the<br>
automated theorem proving community and new theorem proving techniques<br>
should  be transferred  into practice.  The overall  objective of  the<br>
VERIFY workshops is to identify  open problems and to discuss possible<br>
solutions under the theme</p>
<p>What are the verification problems? What are the deduction techniques?</p>
<p>The 2014 edition of VERIFY aims for extending the verification methods<br>
for processes implemented in hard-  and software to processes that may<br>
well include computer-assistance, but have  a large part or a frequent<br>
interaction  with non-computer-based  process  steps.  Hence the  2014<br>
edition will run under the focus theme</p>
<p>Verification Beyond IT Systems</p>
<p>A  non-exclusive list of application areas  with these characteristics<br>
are</p>
<p>* Ambient assisted living<br>
       * Intelligent home systems and processes<br>
       * Business systems and processes<br>
       * Production logistics systems and processes<br>
       * Transportation logistics<br>
       * Clinical processes<br>
       * Social systems and processes (e.g., voting systems)</p>
<p>The scope of VERIFY includes topics such as</p>
<p>* ATP techniques in verification<br>
       * Case studies (specification &amp; verification)<br>
       * Combination of verification systems<br>
       * Integration of ATPs and CASE-tools<br>
       * Compositional &amp; modular reasoning<br>
       * Experience reports on using formal methods<br>
       * Gaps between problems &amp; techniques<br>
       * Formal methods for fault tolerance<br>
       * Information flow control security<br>
       * Refinement &amp; decomposition<br>
       * Reliability of mobile computing<br>
       * Reuse of specifications &amp; proofs<br>
       * Management of change<br>
       * Safety-critical systems<br>
       * Security models<br>
       * Tool support for formal methods</p>
<p>Submissions are encouraged in one of the following two categories:</p>
<p>A. Regular  paper:  Submissions  in  this  category  should   describe<br>
   previously unpublished  work (completed or in  progress), including<br>
   descriptions of research, tools,  and applications.  Papers must be<br>
   5-14  pages  long (in  EasyChair  style)  or  6-15 pages  long  (in<br>
   Springer LNCS style).</p>
<p>B. Discussion  papers: Submissions  in this  category are  intended to<br>
   initiate discussions and hence should address controversial issues,<br>
   and may include  provocative statements. Papers must  be 3-14 pages<br>
   long  (in EasyChair  style) or  3-15 pages  long (in  Springer LNCS<br>
   style).</p>
<p>Important dates<br>
   Abstract Submission Deadline:    April 17th, 2014<br>
   Paper Submission Deadline:       April 25th, 2014<br>
   Notification of acceptance:      May 20, 2014<br>
   Final version due:               May 27, 2014<br>
   Workshop date:                   July 23–24, 2014</p>
