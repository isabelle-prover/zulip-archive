<p>1. SAC 2008</p>
<p>For the past twenty-two years, the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing<br>
has been a primary gathering forum for applied computer scientists,<br>
computer engineers, software engineers, and application developers<br>
from around the world.  SAC 2008 is sponsored by the ACM Special<br>
Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP) and is hosted by the<br>
University of Fortaleza and the Federal University of Ceara', in Brazil.</p>
<p>2. Technical Track on Software Verification</p>
<p>In the next decade the software industry will have to face the<br>
responsibilities imposed by a computer-dependent society.  Since software<br>
is increasingly deployed in safety critical applications, correctness<br>
and reliability are becoming issues of utmost importance.<br>
Consequently, software verification will be a grand challenge for both<br>
academic world and computer industry.</p>
<p>Software verification techniques fall into three main categories: (1)<br>
software testing, (2) formal verification<br>
methods such as model checking and theorem proving, and (3) methods<br>
based on static program analysis.  The goal of this track is to study<br>
the individual contribution of each of these methodologies in<br>
verifying software artifacts, as well as promote discussion on novel<br>
combinations of these methodologies.</p>
<p>This track will focus on theoretical foundations, practical methods as<br>
well as case studies for verification of conventional and embedded<br>
software.  We welcome papers that describe work on combinations of<br>
formal verification and program analysis techniques.  Tool papers and<br>
case studies which report on advances in verifying large software<br>
systems are particularly sought.  The list of topics includes but is<br>
not limited to</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools and case studies for large scale software verification</li>
<li>
<p>Data flow analysis, control flow analysis, type effect systems,<br>
  constraint systems and abstract interpretation techniques for<br>
  verification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model checking and deductive techniques for software verification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Role of declarative programming languages for infinite state software<br>
  verification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Techniques to validate system software (such as compilers) as well as<br>
  assembly code/Java bytecode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof techniques for verifying specific classes of software<br>
  (such as object-oriented programs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration of testing and run-time monitoring with formal techniques</p>
</li>
<li>Validation of UML diagrams and/or requirement specifications</li>
<li>Software certification and proof carrying code</li>
<li>Integration of formal verification into software development projects.<p>3. Guidelines for paper submission</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission should be uploaded through the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://sac.cs.iupui.edu/SAC2008/SubmitAbstract.aspx">http://sac.cs.iupui.edu/SAC2008/SubmitAbstract.aspx</a></p>
<p>Each submitted paper will be fully referenced and undergo a blind<br>
review process.  Author(s) must not be identified in the submissions,<br>
either explicitly or by implication.  Before submitting paper,<br>
author(s) should submit a separate cover page that includes title,<br>
abstract, list of keywords, and list of authors with full names and<br>
postal addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, and e-mail<br>
addresses.  One of the authors must be designated as the primary<br>
contact person.  Please contact the track chair for any problems with<br>
submission.  Authors of accepted papers must submit an editorial<br>
revision of their papers that must fit within five two-column pages<br>
following the ACM proceedings format (an extra three pages may<br>
be available at additional cost to the authors).  Please comply as<br>
much as possible to this page limitation already at submission<br>
time.  At least one of the authors of an accepted paper must register<br>
for the conference and present the paper.  Accepted papers will be<br>
published in the ACM SAC 2008 proceedings.</p>
