<p>Aims and scope:</p>
<hr>
<p>The minisymposion intends to discuss usability of technology <br>
applications in education in relation to proving and primarily focuses <br>
on a specific technology, Computer Theorem Proving (TP), for education <br>
in academia and beyond. The proposal is backed by increasing interest in <br>
technology integration in education to support proofs as well as the <br>
applications of TP. The completion of the TP-based proof of the Kepler <br>
Conjecture was announced on August 10th, 2014.</p>
<p>TP is reliably grounded on formal calculus — whereas proof is not taught<br>
as a formal calculus in general academic education. Rather, students <br>
adopt the habits of their academic environment and copy the way of <br>
proving from their academic teachers. Evidently this results in a lack <br>
of confidence for most students and in a lack of control of what they <br>
are doing. High-school seems affected by these academic traditions such, <br>
that proof is considered too comprehensive for most students in spite of <br>
curricula explicitly mentioning mathematical proof.</p>
<p>The Minisymposion presents experiences from courses supported by <br>
technology applications in relation to proving and TP technology at <br>
academia and at high-school throughout Europe. A major point of <br>
discussion will be the issue to narrow the gap between high-school math <br>
and academic mathematics in Science, Technology and Engineering (STEM) <br>
education. In particular, the (planned/envisioned) use of existing TP <br>
software systems in an educational setting or concrete plans for <br>
(future/desired) educational TP software systems should be demonstrated <br>
with the aim to get a common view on the requirements for such systems <br>
that would make them widely accepted teaching tools.</p>
<p>This minisymposion is motivated by the hope that bottom-up approaches in<br>
local cooperation might be more successful than pretentious top-down<br>
approaches to the sensible, but important topic. For preparing <br>
discussions we invite submission of abstracts (at most 3 pages) on <br>
topics including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Demonstration of tools supporting proofs and using TP technology,<br>
   i.e. tools which generate assumptions, which interactively or<br>
   automatically perform proofs, which systematically generate proof<br>
   obligations, which use TP for checking user input, etc.<br>
   (... called "TP-based" software in the sequel)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiences from academic courses of various kinds using TP-based<br>
   software --- probably including feature requests for future<br>
   development of such software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of mathematics and mathematical activities which might<br>
   specifically take advantage from support by TP-based software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematical concepts and (TP-based) technology specifically<br>
   relevant for software support in teaching and learning to prove</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiences from initiatives and activities filling the gap between<br>
   school and university --- and their relation to TP-based technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>

contributors of abstracts will get an invitation in July.</p>
