As far as I understand it, the 32 bit reduces heap requirements in the<br>
first place. Also, it gives better performance. For example, AODV with<br>
threads=8 takes 1h39m on 64 bit, but just 1h20m on 32 bit.*</p>
<p>As an interesting side note: I've found that under low memory pressure,<br>
that session may reserve north of 50 GB memory (using 64 bit), but it is<br>
also fine to run with less than 4 GB (using 32 bit). My initial<br>
suspicion that 64 bit might be faster for huge sessions by reducing GC<br>
time turned out to be false.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>

Typically 64-bit mode takes around twice as much memory as 32-bit.  Most <br>
of the data is things like cons-cells that are twice as big.</p>
<p>I suspect that your application has a great deal of shareable data in <br>
it.  When memory is tight the Poly/ML GC runs a sharing pass that looks <br>
for common data and uses that to reduce the size of the live data.  It's <br>
expensive to run and the results are only known when the run is complete <br>
so it is only used when absolutely necessary.  In 32-bit mode the heap <br>
size is limited by the system to somewhere around 3.5G so it's much more <br>
likely to run the sharing pass there than with a larger available heap <br>
in 64-bit mode.  It may well be that in your particular case the heap <br>
can be reduced quite substantially.  I seem to recall that NinjaThreads <br>
the first time the sharing pass was run it achieved somewhere around an <br>
80% reduction.</p>
<p>It could be worth trying your example in 64-bit mode but limiting the <br>
heap with --maxheap to say 8G.  Maybe there ought to be a way to tell <br>
the heap sizer that this application may benefit from running the <br>
sharing pass sooner rather than later.</p>
