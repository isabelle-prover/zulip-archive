<p>Announcement of up to three PhD Scholarships</p>
<p>to pursue PhD studies in the <br>
              CLIP group (<a href="http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es">http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es</a>),<br>
              Technical University of Madrid (Spain)<br>
              in the context of the MOBIUS EU project<br>
                     (<a href="http://mobius.inria.fr">http://mobius.inria.fr</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>The CLIP  group at  the Technical University  of Madrid  (UPM) invites<br>
applications for  up to three, fully funded,  4-year, PhD Scholarships<br>
for qualified graduate students.</p>
<p>Candidates  should  have   graduated  in  Computer  Science,  Computer<br>
Engineering, or  related fields prior to  the start of  their study at<br>
UPM. The working language of  the group is English, and candidates can<br>
be of any nationality.</p>
<p>The Ph.D. work will center around the research areas of the CLIP group<br>
within the European research  project "MOBIUS", under the direction of<br>
German Puebla and Manuel Hermenegildo.</p>
<p>The general  aim of  "MOBIUS: Mobility, Ubiquity  and Security"  is to<br>
develop  a  framework for  establishing  trust  and  security of  Java<br>
programs,  using the Proof  Carrying Code  paradigm. The  project will<br>
start September 1, 2005 and will run for four years.</p>
<p>Within the MOBIUS  project, the research of the  CLIP group focuses on<br>
Abstraction Carrying  Code, an Abstract  Interpretation based approach<br>
to mobile code  safety. This involves the development  of new advanced<br>
program analysis  techniques for security  and verification, including<br>
resource consumption, both in terms of time and memory.</p>
<p>The   offered  scholarships   provide   excellent  opportunities   for<br>
international collaboration since MOBIUS is a European project with 16<br>
partners  from  10 countries.  Also,  the  CLIP  group is  active  and<br>
international,  with  around 15  full-time  members  from 6  different<br>
countries.</p>
<p>The  grants  include  academic  fees,  medical  care, plus a  tax-free<br>
monthly  payment which  ranges from 1,100 to 1,600 euros, depending on<br>
experience.</p>
<p>The  following  qualifications are  not  mandatory,  but increase  the<br>
chances of success:</p>
<p>* Experience with Java, Java bytecode, and JML<br>
  * Knowledge of (Constraint) Logic Programming<br>
  * Interest in software verification and security</p>
<p>Applications and information:</p>
<hr>
<p>The  deadline for  applications is  September 26,  2005.  Applications<br>
received  after this deadline  may be  considered if  the scholarships<br>
have  not been filled  at the  time.  Applications  should be  sent to<br>
<a href="mailto:mobius-phd-grants@clip.dia.fi.upm.es">mobius-phd-grants@clip.dia.fi.upm.es</a> and include a curriculum vitae, a<br>
listing  of  grades from  previous  studies,  a  brief description  of<br>
research interests with regards to  the CLIP group and MOBIUS, and, if<br>
at all  possible, letters of recommendation from  teachers or managers<br>
that  the student  has worked  with.   The latest  information on  the<br>
scholarships   and   the  application   process   can   be  found   at<br>
