Note that concerning the prover backend, both \&lt;II&gt; \&lt;RR&gt; <em>are</em> allowed <br>
within identifiers; the prover gets these ASCII sequences only.  You don't <br>
see the corresponding unicode glyph in Isabelle/jEdit, though. (The <br>
traditional dropout is \&lt;lambda&gt;, which is still not possible in <br>
identifiers as \&lt;lambda&gt;' etc.)</p>
<p>The problem of \&lt;II&gt; and \&lt;RR&gt; is an overlap with the Unicode rendering of <br>
\&lt;Re&gt; and \&lt;Im&gt;.  Unlike TeX, the second copy of fraktur I and R is <br>
missing from the Unicode 6.1 standard, cf. <br>
<a href="http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D400.pdf">http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D400.pdf</a></p>
<p>"Fraktur symbols</p>
<p>This style is sometimes known as black-letter. Black-letter symbols<br>
   already encoded in the Letterlike Symbols block are omitted here to<br>
   avoid duplicate encoding."</p>
<p>Donald Knuth and the AMS knew better, and provided separate copies, with <br>
slightly different shape.</p>
<p>Our IsabelleText font happens to have I and R glyphs in the Fraktur slot <br>
unofficially, but I did not use them in the default mapping of <br>
Isabelle2012/etc/symbols.  Instead of stretching unicode too far, I am <br>
considering to remove the default rendering for \&lt;Re&gt; and \&lt;Im&gt; instead, <br>
to make the fraktur alphabet more uniform.</p>
<p>(And yes, Unicode is notorious to require long explanations and <br>
considerations for seemingly trivial things.)</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
There is indeed a big difference of sledgehammer in Isabelle2011-1 vs. <br>
Isabelle2012.  The current release might still have some drop-outs, <br>
though.  If you spot anything specific, keep telling us (either the <br>
mailing list, or Jasmin Blanchette, or me).</p>
<p>In particular, I suspect that E prover 1.4/1.5 still has too much shell <br>
scripting built-in to work smoothly on Cygwin.  It might also help to <br>
point out such observations to Stephan Schulz from <a href="http://eprover.org">eprover.org</a>, to <br>
motivate him to improve it further.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>I don't like making this mailing list my personal playground, and after <br>
this email, I'll make a belated New Year's resolution to make a <br>
concerted effort to use this list for what it's best used for, showing <br>
experts a piece a code with a problem, which the experts are good at <br>
analyzing fast and can reply to fast.</p>
<p>If I had a blog, which I do, I could turn this email into a preliminary <br>
product review for Isabelle, which I won't at this time. If there's any <br>
value in this, it could be that a potential user out there has some of <br>
the same questions I had.</p>
<p>You can also consider me an early representative of the new wave of <br>
users who will come here and either complain about the product and <br>
disrespect the product, because they don't know what they're looking at, <br>
or tell you how awesome it is, because they've figured out what they're <br>
looking at.</p>
<p>[I interrupt this email for an important message. I don't know if I <br>
would have been excited enough to write this email if I wouldn't have <br>
gotten a structured proof out of sledgehammer on my first try. My <br>
current run of sledgehammer failed on the structured proof. I'll try to <br>
set the timeout longer. However, I did get a couple of lines that say <br>
something like "Found proof (284 ms)", but I don't know which ATP proved <br>
it. Anyway, I got a screenshot of the first results. Getting any proof <br>
could be considered exciting, but the structured proof gives more visual <br>
excitement.]</p>
<p>Not trying anymore to make this into a polished review, I throw out some <br>
ideas.</p>
<p>I dropped Isabelle for about 6 months, up until about May 2012, but in a <br>
period of about 4 to 5 months, I satisfied at least 5 "proof of concept" <br>
questions I had, where there was and always will be the ongoing question <br>
of how powerful Isabelle's logic engine is.</p>
<p>(1) Can proofs in Isabelle be made to look and flow like traditional <br>
mathematical proofs?</p>
<p>I answered that fairly quickly after working through <br>
<a href="http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/isabelle/Isabelle_Primer.pdf">http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/isabelle/Isabelle_Primer.pdf</a>. Many <br>
people don't take the time and make the choices to make their proofs <br>
look great, but formatting a document to look good takes time.</p>
<p>(2) Can I become an advanced user of Isabelle with minimal help?</p>
<p>It took me a while to get confidence about that, because I knew I would <br>
have a need to understand some of the distribution source, and the style <br>
of proofs in the distribution source is all over the place; the theories <br>
have been, after all, produced over many years. After reading Makarius's <br>
twenty ways to prove (A /\ B) --&gt; (B /\ A) in his PhD thesis, along with <br>
all the documentation that I've collected, I got the confidence that I'm <br>
not going to hit a brick learning wall I can't get over.</p>
<p>(3) Can the syntax of Isabelle be made to look very, very mathematical?</p>
<p>I already knew about the available math symbols, and the structured <br>
proofs, which was part of the initial attraction. I showed in a recent <br>
email that Isar identifiers can be made to look mathematical. Let no man <br>
or woman say that single, subscripted Latin, Greek, mathcal, or mathfrak <br>
alphabet characters do not meet the requirements of looking mathematical.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, an Isar identifier can use 0-9, ', and _, <br>
though it can't start with those characters. In addition, it can use <br>
a-z, A-Z, \&lt;a&gt; - \&lt;z&gt;, \&lt;A&gt; - \&lt;Z&gt;, \&lt;aa&gt; - \&lt;zz&gt;, \&lt;AA&gt; - \&lt;ZZ&gt; (but <br>
not II and RR) , and the lower and upper case Greek alphabet, such as <br>
\&lt;alpha&gt;. You can use \&lt;^isub&gt; and \&lt;^isup&gt; followed by the <br>
aforementioned characters anywhere you want, and as many times as you <br>
want. That's some major naming options, compared to most programming <br>
languages.</p>
<p>(4) Can I get axiomatic ZF sets in HOL?</p>
<p>This whole thing of axiomatic sets in Isabelle is a big subject. I make <br>
sure here that I don't go off telling you all my thoughts and opinions <br>
on this subject. I only say that there are many practical reasons why I <br>
choose Isabelle/HOL over Isabelle/ZF, and I have a sufficient interest <br>
in sets to want to try my hand at reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>Also, what has evolved is my understanding of the concept of <br>
meta-languages and object languages. I leave it at that. Sort of. I'll <br>
actually be working through Jech and Hrbacek's "Introduction to Set <br>
Theory, 3rd", which is one of the standard texts on axiomatic sets. My <br>
intent is to try to imitate their development of sets. Got to have goals <br>
in life, even if the goals don't always work out.</p>
<p>(5) Does Isabelle allow me to choose between proving a proof step <br>
automatically and explicitly specifying how to prove the step?</p>
<p>Yes. For this, I'm already starting to forget that this was a "big <br>
question issue". I assure you, if Isabelle only had the ability to <br>
provide "mysterious proof results" by auto, I wouldn't be trying to <br>
learn it. On the other hand, if I knew I was never ever going to have <br>
the option to not prove every little detail, then I would be buckling <br>
down for some major brainwave pain in the future.</p>
<p>A TALE TO TELL</p>
<p>The above questions were some of my questions. It's not that they've set <br>
things in stone, but up to this point, the answers to my big questions <br>
have been positive.</p>
<p>Last year, I started looking at HOL.thy very early in the game to try <br>
and figure out if "I can learn this". From November to May, I did <br>
nothing and was simply waiting on the next release. Recently, when I got <br>
to "type_synonym" on page 12, the light bulb came on for a way to try <br>
and set up sets. I put down a little bit of code just to try my hand at <br>
using some of the keywords.</p>
<p>I layed down some type commands, a few axioms, defined the first theorem <br>
to be proved (that the empty set is unique), and tried my hand at using <br>
"apply(auto)", which requires, of course, knowing how to type on the <br>
keyboard.</p>
<p>It was a no go, which was okay because I wasn't trying to be in "serious <br>
prover mode". A few days passed, and it occurred to me, "How about that <br>
axiom of extension, bro? Defining set equality would be a good thing, <br>
don't you think?"</p>
<p>So I put in the axiom of extension and tried auto again. No go. But, <br>
hey, doing the easy stuff can count for a lot, because last year I put <br>
quite a bit of effort into looking at sledgehammer's options. The idea <br>
is, if sledgehammer gives you the option to try something, then make it <br>
try it. It turns out that I end up using fairly simple options for <br>
sledgehammer.</p>
<p>Last year, I had viper installed, but I only have the default setup now, <br>
so I give it these options:</p>
<p>sledgehammer_params [provers = "e cvc3 spass z3 z3_tptp metis", <br>
verbose=true, isar_proof=true]</p>
<p>What you should know is that with Isabelle2011-1, sledgehammer running <br>
under Cygwin was useless. It wouldn't ever come back, or it would <br>
timeout. I knew sledgehammer worked because I tried it out under Linux.</p>
<p>I tried sledgehammer, not expecting any results. I got results. In <br>
particular, the structured proof stood out because it's not a one-line <br>
statement telling you, "Found proof".</p>
<p>Having a healthy amount of paranoia, and preferring to think like a <br>
lawyer, I wouldn't consider an auto proof meaningful without trying to <br>
figure out any details it gives me, checking my code setup, and, in <br>
general, trying to decide whether I gave sledgehammer meaningful <br>
information.</p>
<p>However, I took out the axiom of extension, and sledgehammer found no <br>
solution. I put it back in, and sledghammer finds a solution. <br>
Conclusive? No. But not bad news either. The easy part is done, I <br>
assume. Using the axiom of separation and the power set? I don't know <br>
about that. Oh yea, and replacing the auto proof with a non-auto proof.</p>
<p>Okay. I completed this to partly get this type of thing out of my <br>
system. I could have waited months, or a year, and said, "Hey, this <br>
Jech's set theory thing worked out." It may not work out. It's no big <br>
deal if it doesn't, since there would probably be a good reason why it <br>
didn't work out.</p>
<p>It's also to say, "Hey, I like that magic". And to say, "Dude, how do <br>
you do that? But please, don't even try to tell me."</p>
<p>Two screen shots are attached. One shows the structured proof that it <br>
found that it doesn't find anymore. I assume it's because CPU resources <br>
got sucked up by Windows for something else. I'll try setting the <br>
options later.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB<br>
