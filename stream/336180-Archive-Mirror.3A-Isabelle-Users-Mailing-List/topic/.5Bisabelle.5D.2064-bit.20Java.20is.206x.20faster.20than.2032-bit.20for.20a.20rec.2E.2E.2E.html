<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I saw 64-bit Cygwin talked about, so I send this in to show that 64-bit <br>
Java for Cygwin would be beneficial for some things.</p>
<p>Basically, I've been testing a lot of different languages for a <br>
recursive fibonacci function of this form, for a input value of 42:</p>
<p>fun fib (n:int) = (if (n &lt; 2) then n else (fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)));</p>
<p>What I can say is that Scala is fast, and most everything else is slow <br>
in comparison to it, though several things have to be taken into <br>
consideration, such as whether a language needs to be compile, and <br>
whether the integers are machine integers or big integers.</p>
<p>The crux of this email is that for Clojure, for 32-bit Java under Cygwin <br>
or Windows, takes about 48 seconds for fib(42), where for 64-bit Java, <br>
it's about 8 seconds, which is actually not that bad compared to other <br>
languages.</p>
<p>For Isabelle/ML, fib(42) is about 4.3 seconds, though it's using big <br>
integers.</p>
<p>For Scala, it's about 2.7 seconds, and the version of Java doesn't make <br>
much difference.</p>
<p>For compiled Haskell, it's about 37 seconds.</p>
<p>For compiled Erlang, it's about 16 seconds for a pattern matched form of <br>
fib, and 36 seconds for the if/then form.</p>
<p>For Julia, which is supposed to be fast, it was about 5 seconds.</p>
<p>For Mirah, which has syntax like Ruby, but is just a frontend on Java, <br>
it was a little slower than Scala.</p>
<p>I saw Lisp SBCL, but I don't know how to compile a lisp program with it, <br>
but <a href="http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org</a> shows that it should be <br>
about as fast as Scala.</p>
<p>Many of these numbers look somewhat like what the benchmarks site shows, <br>
other than Haskell.</p>
<p>I've seen a pattern emerging for me: define a datatype, then define a <br>
fun using recursion and pattern matching for the datatype, and then do a <br>
few calculations with the fun before proving anything.</p>
<p>Up front, I want to know if it works, and also I'd like to know if it's <br>
a major loser as far as speed. A language doesn't have to be the fastest <br>
to test that out, but if it's dramatically slower than Scala, then <br>
that's a bad road to start down.</p>
<p>I've gotten the reject twice by the mail server, first because the <br>
attachment was too big, and the second, with a smaller attachment, <br>
probably because of the first reject. I guess Gmx is used a lot for <br>
spam. I'll see how this one goes, but it's worth a try to put some <br>
exposure on the possibility of 64-bit Cygwin being used. I might be <br>
auto-banned by the auto-spam-filter-bot, which wouldn't be a bad thing.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>It bugs me that when calculating fib(42), the Java process only works <br>
25% of my CPU.</p>
<p>Anyway, this idea makes it a higher precedence to use a language that <br>
facilitates concurrency, like Scala, Clojure, and Erlang, though <br>
compiled Erlang is twice as slow as Clojure.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Complex things aren't that straightforward, and require talking to <br>
oneself more than one would like.</p>
<p>With Scala, using BigInt, it takes 77s, and with Clojure using bigint, <br>
it takes 21s. That assumes that things are doing what I think I've told <br>
them to do, which means one should do one's own tests. I thought I had <br>
read that Erlang's default integer is a machine integer, but maybe I'm <br>
reading now that it's of arbitrary size, which means, at 16s, it would <br>
be faster than Clojure, and arbitrary size integers is what I'd be <br>
using. Clojure actually doesn't make you pick; it chooses what works <br>
best. With Clojure, it's a 3megabyte jar to get the language. With <br>
Erlang, it's a 90megabyte install.</p>

<p>Here is a version for Isabelle/ML that uses approx. 0% of CPU:</p>
<p>ML {*<br>

<p>I use this to summarize, because things got long, and the long <br>
explanation is below.</p>
<p>The fibonacci test is actually 100% relevant to trying to set myself up, <br>
in the future, for evaluating how practical it is to use recursive <br>
functions.</p>
<p>This would be a very relevant test for numeric computation, and that's <br>
what I plan on doing in the future.</p>
<p>A starting point is to try to and find as many languages that perform <br>
good with recursive functions that use pattern matching. If a recursive <br>
fibonacci function isn't relevant, then why is Isabelle/HOL filled with <br>
impractical recursive functions?</p>
<p>It is important, at least to me, to know how practical any particular <br>
recursive function is. The fibonacci function would be one of the worst, <br>
but how can I know how bad it is if I don't find the best possible <br>
language to run it under? "Best possible" is related to how I'm <br>
implementing mathematics in HOL.</p>
<p>Recursive functions will be at the very core of what I'm doing in HOL. I <br>
want to set myself up to be able to determine what they can and can't do.</p>
<p>Here, you would be playing the part of the person in Mathematics <br>
Whatever 101, saying, "Why are we doing this? Where will we ever use <br>
this?" The application isn't always direct.</p>
<p>That would be one side of the coin. You're looking at the other side, <br>
and you don't know exactly what I'm up to, so it's forgivable.</p>

<p>So a basic tool of rhetoric is to anticipate arguments. That would be <br>
part of the logos, pathos, and ethos of Greek rhetoric, but 6 point <br>
arguments on mailing lists tend to not get read, or read any where.</p>
<p>There's more that you could teach me than not teach me, but here it did <br>
occur to me, before I forgot about it, to make a comment about the <br>
narrowness of what I'm doing.</p>
<p>The context is the prolific use, by many, of using recursive functions <br>
that use pattern matching in Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>I know that recursive functions are bad performers, and recursive <br>
functions with pattern matching are even worse. I've become a follower <br>
of the HOL crowd. I use recursion and pattern matching, and my <br>
inclination is to use it as a first choice over if/then/else.</p>
<p>Consequently, my picking the fibonacci function is totally relevant to <br>
testing languages to see how they perform under worst case conditions. <br>
It is a micro benchmark, but it's the one single test to test languages <br>
for what's on my mind, the use of recursive functions in HOL, and how <br>
they will play out when trying to run them with a programming language.</p>
<p>There's always more context than can be explained. What I'm doing is <br>
"the big pursuit of all fast, probably functional, programming languages <br>
that sync up good with how I implement logic in HOL." That language is <br>
actually ML, but for some reason, I think I need another one in addition <br>
to it.</p>
<p>It's very time consuming. I find a language. I look at the docs on the <br>
web to try to determine if it has the basic requirements, which is the <br>
ability to curry or do partial application, pattern matching, and the <br>
ability to define datatypes. I download it. I figure out how to write <br>
the fibonocci function. I try to find out what kind of integers it's <br>
using by default. I time it multiple times. More.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I did mention that it can be hard to know if a test is meaningful. If <br>
I'm trying to test 20 languages, it's not that I know that I proved <br>
something is slow, but fast generally always means something, especially <br>
after I've started to see some patterns emerging, like that out of 20 <br>
languages, none of them run faster than about 6 seconds for fib(42), and <br>
that ML is performing the best, at about 4.5 seconds.</p>
<p>I give two examples where I got mislead. I judged Scala as fast, and was <br>
using it as a benchmark, but when I switched to big integers, it got <br>
really slow.</p>
<p>I judged JRuby really slow, but when I switch to running it under 64-bit <br>
Java, fib(42) went from 51s to 23s, whee 23s isn't that bad relative to <br>
what I've seen</p>
<p>I just got through installing Rust. It fit that pattern of being a <br>
compiled language that's better than most, but not better than ML. It <br>
ran fib(42) at about 6 seconds, which is good.</p>
<p>The big question is always whether a language is using machine integers <br>
or big integers. If I know that a language is using machine integers, <br>
and it runs at fib(42) at 6 seconds, that's alright, but not that <br>
impressive, since ML uses arbitrary size ints, though it could be <br>
optimizing, by using machine ints until it needs big ints.</p>
<p>I have to make the best possible conclusions given a limited amount of <br>
time. Isabelle/ML was #2 as the benchmark until I saw that Scala when <br>
from 2.7s to about 70s, so now ML is the benchmark, and it helps me <br>
something to compare other languages to.</p>

<p>The anticipation of arguments would have saved us some time. I already <br>
had 3 other fast fibonacci functions.</p>
<p>If Ruby is fast at three out of 4 fibonacci functions, does that make <br>
Ruby fast? No, it's slow, though like I say, it wasn't as slow as I thought.</p>

<p>That is actually in the center of isabelle-users in a technical sense: we <br>

programming language environments (e.g. Poly/ML, Scala/JVM, certain <br>
C-implemented tools on Cygwin).</p>
<p>So what is the best adjustment of the 32 vs. 64bit switch?  The answer <br>
depends on many side-conditions.</p>
<p>For the Prover IDE a 64bit JVM could actually be beneficial, but it is not <br>
used on Windows due to some other side-conditions.  64-bit Cygwin is <br>
unrelated to that, because it is Windows-Java not Cygwin-Java.</p>

<p>There is nothing impractical about recursion.  The slowness of the naive <br>

which causes an exponential blowup.  But the slightly tuned linear <br>

don't have to care about complexity.  You just do symbolic reasoning, and <br>
you can e.g. make some equivalence proof of a term that represents the <br>
naive implementation to the tuned one.  Then you give the latter to the <br>
code generator to run it on the machine.</p>

<p>In Poly/ML you can be relaxed about this, and allocate hundreds of MB or <br>

Richard,</p>
<p>Thanks for the info from James McDonald. I was confused about SBCL. I <br>
had installed it, but I thought the instructions on how to build it was <br>
part of what to do to compile a script. When sorting through 20 <br>
languages, unfamiliarity and some resistance can cause me to abandon <br>
testing a language out.</p>
<p>This worked out better, because I hadn't downloaded the newest version <br>
for Windows.</p>
<p>With SBCL on Windows, with the default options, I get 5.6 seconds for <br>
fixnum, and 9.8 seconds for integer. I'm running a 2.8GHz old quad core, <br>
where it only utilizes 25% of the cpu when it's running the program.</p>
<p>Where SBCL really separates itself is with big integers, because fib(42) <br>
is only 4807526976. That wasn't forcing these other languages to use <br>
non-machine integers, the ones that don't make you choose. I say more <br>
about that in my reply to Makarius.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>More generally, if you are really trying to benchmark various languages and implementations,<br>
you might want to consider a broader suite of tests.   E.g., within the lisp world, you could<br>
look at Dick Gabriel’s “Performance and Evaluation of Lisp Systems”  from around 1985.<br>
(<a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/NewFiles/Timrep.pdf">http://www.dreamsongs.com/NewFiles/Timrep.pdf</a>)</p>
<p>In particular, if your focus is on function call overhead, the TAK and PUZZLE tests might<br>
be of interest, including the variants that move things around to account for cache lines.</p>

<p>James (and Makarius below),</p>
<p>Thanks for the specific optimizations. Right now, I'm doing rough <br>
comparisons between languages, but all that could come in handy if I go <br>
the Lisp route, and I'm not seeing anything other than the Lisps that <br>
don't tend to get slaughtered by big integers, though Lisp may get <br>
slaughtered in other ways. I wouldn't know.</p>
<p>And thanks for the PDF link also. I used the TAK test out of it, since <br>
it was short and easy.</p>
<p>I show times for Isabelle/ML, Haskell, SBCL, Clojure, Scala, and JRuby, <br>
three of them with both a 32-bit and 64-bit version. At least for the <br>
three tests, SBCL comes out ahead overall. Enough to warrant more <br>
looking in to.</p>

<p>I believe you, but "implementation" is the key word, where <br>
"implementation" is on my mind only because some Stackoverflow answerer <br>
was making sure everyone knows that languages aren't slow, but <br>
implementations are slow. Coming from that guy it was very irritating. <br>
Coming from me, it's profound.</p>
<p>I've been doing two things on multiple languages. Running the if/then <br>
form of the fibonacci function, and then hunting down how to do it with <br>
pattern matching. Most of the time, pattern matching has been slower.</p>
<p>It was even slower for Haskell. I'm looking right now at where I put the <br>
time in filenames, that it was 36s for if/then/else, and 51s for pattern <br>
matching. But the Windows 32-bit version of HaskellPlatform is slow. <br>
It's messed up, so that may not mean anything. I check these things <br>
multiple times, and want to check them again, because it's easy to get <br>
confused in all the details.</p>
<p>With Erlang, on the other hand, it was significantly faster with pattern <br>
matching. I don't think they even have a normal if/then/else statement.</p>
<p>I want as much speed as possible, because I think I'll need it.</p>
<p>I have two datatypes I want to test out, at least at some point, that <br>
point not being way off in the future. My first guess is that one of <br>
them will be slow, but I need to find out, to make some decisions.</p>
<p>I added two more tests, so now I'm doing three times more testing than <br>
what I was doing, which is infinitely more than what I was doing before, <br>
which, though not zero, was still only a small number infinitely close <br>
to zero, call it epsilon.</p>
<p>I thought about things a little more because you brought these things <br>
up, but there's no room for that here.</p>
