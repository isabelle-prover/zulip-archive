Though it is true that we all dream of creating the best possible <br>
software this goal doesn't always meet real world demands. I suggest you <br>
read:<br>

<p>Also testing is a real alternative to proving and one many software <br>
companies are using today.</p>
<p>For proving to be as unproblematic as testing you need for it to be <br>
easier. Observe the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modern languages like Haskell are declarative. So writing a proof is <br>
pointless. Your program IS the specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So it becomes more like testing. You write assumptions about your <br>
specification and prove that they hold.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Modern proof systems are limited by their knowledge of their domain. A <br>
language that can prove assumptions effortlessly needs to know topology, <br>
algebra and category theory. Only by creating a mathematically sound <br>
type system in this matter can you make a statement and let the computer <br>
access it's validity without requiring you to add a large amount of <br>
extra information.</p>
<p>In Isabelle it is usual to see 5 lemmas to each proof. Each lemma just <br>
states something that is obvious to anyone to knows maths.</p>
<p>I am working on a language I have chosen to call Formula which tries to <br>
encompass these goals. Whether I succeed or not remains to be seen. In a <br>
world increasingly into parallel computation and distributed processing <br>
traditional testing is becoming increasingly difficult. Proof rather <br>
than testing avoids many of the problems of scaling a algorithm over <br>
multiple processors..</p>
<p>Just some thoughts.</p>
