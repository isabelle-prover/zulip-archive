<p>From: "Yannick Duchêne (Hibou57 )" &lt;<a href="mailto:yannick_duchene@yahoo.fr">yannick_duchene@yahoo.fr</a>&gt;<br>
Planning to rework an SML application I did three years ago, I wanted to  <br>
have a start trying something in a sample theory, attached to this message  <br>
and pasted below in case the attachment disappears.</p>
<p>On the last line of the simple lemma proof, at “from 4 show "t1 ≅ t2" by  <br>
(simp add: 3)”, if I move the mouse cursor over “≅” while Ctrl is pressed,  <br>
I get a tool‑tip which tells me it's a fixed variable as well as a free  <br>
variable. Surprising, as to me it's a fixed variable, but I don't mind  <br>
more. More disturbing, is what I see in the Output pan when I move the  <br>
caret to the end of the same line ; it displays “t1 ≅ t2” and if I move  <br>
the mouse cursor over it while Ctrl is pressed, it says it's a free  <br>
variable, and just a free variable, and it draws the “≅” in blue instead  <br>
of black. Why does it become a free variable in the Output pan ?</p>
<p>As a question aside, is there a more explicit way to substitute the second  <br>
“t1” in 4 using the equivalence from 3 ? I feel I already came a similar  <br>
question one year ago, but I'm not able to remember what I did (I'm  <br>
seasoned with Isabelle).</p>

<p>The use of Pure equality and HOL.eq_reflection looks a bit strange: you <br>

<p>More explicit reasoning can be done by calculations in Isar, but its <br>
substitution steps will always replace all occurrences of the subterm in <br>

<p>Maybe some experts on hand-crafted substitution can point out frequently <br>

<p>OK, so may be it says it's a free variable when it does not already know  <br>
it's fixed.</p>

<p>I've just checked, and “HOL.thy” indeed says “(<em>admissible axiom</em>)”. Will  <br>
try to learn to do without it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the pointers you gave on both topics.</p>

In some sense this belongs to the "implementation" of Isabelle/HOL on top <br>
of the Isabelle/Pure framework.</p>
<p>These days you should hardly ever need == in Isabelle/HOL applications.</p>
<p>This is different to !! and ==&gt;, which have a specific purpose to outline <br>
Natural Deduction rule schemes in a declarative manner, independently of <br>
the object-logic.</p>

Does that mean substitution/simplification is not expressed with “==” but  <br>
“=” instead ? I always though “==” was the standard for that purpose with  <br>
logic.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The basic substitution rules of Isabelle/HOL directly refer to =, not ==. <br>
This is also relevant to calculational reasoning, e.g. see <br>
print_trans_rules.  (That gives only very limited support for some basic <br>
Pure reasoning with ==).</p>
<p>Some other tools go to the bottom of Pure and use == internally, such as <br>
the Simplifier itself (which is somewhat independent of the object-logic). <br>
This is also one of several points in the system where both = and == are <br>
allowed in user input, but this duplication of interfaces is not <br>
universal.</p>
<p>That was important in the past, because the primite 'defs' command was <br>
used routinely in user theories, and thus there was considerable mix-up of <br>
connectives.  For many years already, the 'definition' command allows to <br>
use = of Isabelle/HOL, just like other specification elements that are <br>
proper to HOL.</p>
