In preparation for the coming relase, I've gone through the sledgehammer <br>
and nitpick connectivety again a few days ago, and refined it a little <br>
bit.  There were some minor instabilities and potential race conditions <br>
wrt. editor buffer content, but no fundamental problems as far as I could <br>
see.</p>
<p>Public announcements for Isabelle2012 release candidates will come next <br>
week on this mailing list, so you can try again and report pending <br>
problems.</p>

I have looked a bit through the course material.  What is always <br>
interesting is to see what users get as "survival kit" -- it provides some <br>
hints what are the fine points that can be improved in the system itself, <br>
for people getting exposed to it the first time.</p>
<p>The introduction of sledgehammer to "Solve theorems in the Cloud" is also <br>
nice.  Someone told me he always explains the algebraic law of <br>
associativity in terms of the Google Map-Reduce framework :-)</p>
<p>You mention OCaml occasionally in passing, as if it could be assumed as <br>
background of French students.  Is this the case?  I am giving a 2-day <br>
Isabelle/HOL tutorial in 2 weeks at Paris Sud, so it would be good to know <br>
if OCaml can be taken for granted.</p>
<p>What I have already learned is that Coq can <em>not</em> be taken for granted <br>
here in France, even though international conferences on theorem proving <br>
sometimes give a different impression.</p>

<p>I'd like to chime in on that by noting that we do a course on "Specification and Verification with Higher-Order Logic" in Isabelle/HOL as a Master's course.<br>
Last year we set up a wiki (<a href="https://svhol.pbmichel.de">https://svhol.pbmichel.de</a>) for the students, so we could dump in some knowledge about Isabelle/HOL, the proof general, HOL theory and general emacs.</p>
<p>It was also mainly designed for the students to contribute; the wiki is world-editable. Feel free to contribute :-)</p>
<p>Maybe the site is of some interested to one or the other. Regarding the above quote I'd say our FAQ - Ask Questions section might be of interest :)</p>

<p>Yes, it is true. The overall knowledge of Coq highly depends on the <br>
university where you come from. You are very much likely to be exposed <br>
in "Research" Masters (you probably know this distinction we have in <br>
France now that you are at LRI :-) ... The course that I gave was <br>
designed for "Professional" Masters... which explains that it does not <br>
put the stress on proofs tactics and so on.</p>

<p>From: Thomas Genet &lt;<a href="mailto:thomas.genet@irisa.fr">thomas.genet@irisa.fr</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all Isabelle users,</p>
<p>as promised to Tobias and Jasmin here is some feedback and teaching <br>
material for a course that I gave this year on Formal Analysis and <br>
Design to students in a first year of Master in computer science.</p>
<p>This course was designed for our "professional" master students i.e. <br>
that will end up developpers and not for "research" master students that <br>
will end up in PhD. Thus, I focused on functional programming <br>
(Isabelle/HOL and Scala), first order logic (for defining program <br>
properties) and on counterexample finding (rather than on proof). The <br>
final objective is to run Java+Scala programs with verified blocks, i.e. <br>
whose formally defined properties have been checked on the Isabelle <br>
theory using counterexample finders.</p>
<p>The page of this course is here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irisa.fr/celtique/genet/ACF/">http://www.irisa.fr/celtique/genet/ACF/</a></p>
<p>With regards to the experience the students had with Isabelle/HOL here <br>
are some comments. I already sent them to Tobias and Jasmin but Jasmin <br>
advised me to send them on the mailing list.</p>
<p>Good points:</p>
<p>++ Though 80% of the students were initially allergic to functional<br>
    programming, in the end they are almost all convinced that it is<br>
    a convenient formalism to define and prove programs.<br>
+++ Students allergic to logic ended up in writing relevant lemmas<br>
     (this point deserves three +, because it was my main objective)<br>
++ Most of the students allergic to logic ended up in being convinced<br>
    that writing a lemma may replace writing a test<br>
++ Some of the students ended up in being convinced that writing a<br>
    lemma may replace writing a thousand tests :-)<br>
+++ Counterexample generation makes it possible for the students to<br>
     quickly figure out which of their definition (the lemma or the <br>
function) was<br>
     false.<br>
++ The code export to Scala was very much appreciated ... it makes the<br>
    formal verification of functional program sounding useful to <br>
developpers!<br>
++ Counterexamples found by nitpick and quickcheck permitted to debug<br>
    rather complex functions (see practicals in the following). They<br>
    were intensively used by students.</p>
<p>Bad points and suggested improvements:</p>
<p>--- Function parser and error messages are sometimes very poor... which<br>
     makes the debugging very difficult... especially for functions of more<br>
     than 10 lines the error message just mention that there is an error<br>
     somewhere... well, thanks :-)  At least, a line number for the error<br>
     would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>-- It is a bad idea to use a variable name like id in a function<br>
   equation, e.g.:</p>
<p>fun f:: "nat =&gt; nat"<br>
where<br>
"f(id)=id"</p>
<p>OK, the error message says:<br>
*** Type error in application: incompatible operand type</p>
<hr>
<p>*** Operator:  f :: nat =&gt; nat<br>
*** Operand:   id :: ??'a =&gt; ??'a</p>
<p>and a (careful) student may understand that 'id' is already defined as a<br>
   function etc... however this is far more difficult to find when the<br>
   function has 10 complex equations. What surprises me is that the<br>
   left-hand side of the equation f(id) does not respect the restrictions<br>
   for "fun" declarations and that it should be rejected anyway (with a<br>
   more explicit error message). Am I right?</p>
<ul>
<li>Indentation of function equations (inside the "...") is simply <br>
horrible (in emacs) as soon as you have several if and case <br>
constructions, or I did not understand it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Thomas</p>

This is one of these scoping errors that then lead to a conflict with the <br>
type constraints imposed by already defined entities, and are thus <br>
discovered indirectly.  The type checking phase could be a bit more <br>
ambitious to maintain precise position information and report that (which <br>
is technically not so easy and might require one or two more release <br>
cycles to materialize).</p>
<p>But the actual scoping is already represented quite nicely in current <br>
Isabelle2011-1 right now, if you use Isabelle/jEdit and rely in its <br>
"Haribo effect".  This means the sources are painted in funny colors <br>
according to the role of identifiers.  The Prover IDE also has the magic <br>
CONTROL (or COMMAND) key, which asks the system to explain the formal <br>
status of some piece of source.</p>
<p>So the above "id" would have come out black (constant) instead of the <br>
expected blue (free variable), and its tooltip would have said "constant <br>
<a href="http://Fun.id">Fun.id</a>", with a hyperlink to jump to its definition in main HOL.  So <br>
students would have to spend less energy divinating the meaning of the <br>
text themselves.</p>

Hello Thomas,</p>
<p>I am impressed that simply writing and validating specifications with <br>
Nitpick and Quickcheck could improve the correctness of the <br>
implementations by 45%.<br>
As you write, only 5% of the students got the right solution without <br>
Isabelle in the beginning of the course, and 50% students ended up with <br>
the correct program within 2 hours using Isabelle at midterm.</p>
<p>Can you say more why 45% succeeded at midterm? Was it simply the <br>
application of our counterexample generators and forcing students to <br>
think about their specification?<br>
Why did the remaining 50% fail? Did they never get the specifications <br>
right? Or did Quickcheck and Nitpick fail to find counterexamples?</p>
<p>Further Isabelle tools adressing the problems of the remaining 50% might <br>
be interesting to consider in the future.</p>

<p>aouch... it sounds that it is unlikely to be present in Isabelle/HOL for <br>
next january, the next time I will give the lecture :-)</p>

<p>Ok I'll try this... In fact, I was nearly ready to use jEdit for the <br>
labs but I found that jEdit was often getting stuck when using nitpick <br>
and quickcheck, and since my labs strongly rely on those two tools it <br>
was a problem.</p>
<p>However, I am convinced that students would love switching to jEdit <br>
because they are really not comfortable with emacs :-)</p>

write in Isabelle/HOL (I realize that the subject of the lab is in <br>
french... sorry, I can translate it in french if you want to try)... I <br>
mean it is not straightforward but it only consists of 2 recursive <br>
functions... However, I think that coming up with the good solution at <br>
the first try is difficult.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you say more why 45% succeeded at midterm? Was it simply the<br>
application of our counterexample generators and forcing students to<br>
think about their specification?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did the remaining 50% fail? Did they never get the specifications<br>
right? Or did Quickcheck and Nitpick fail to find counterexamples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No they had a hard time finding the good algorithmic idea and they are <br>
also beginners in functional programming... it is thus hard for them in <br>
2 hours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Further Isabelle tools adressing the problems of the remaining 50% might<br>
be interesting to consider in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>except a tool automatically writing the functions from the specification <br>
... I do not see how to help them :-)<br>
They were only lacking practice of functional programming. At the end of <br>
the course, they were more comfortable with this.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

Dear Makarius,</p>
<p>I just played a bit with both the "Haribo effect" and the "magic" <br>
COMMAND key that are both very nice functionnalities! I will consider <br>
switching to jEdit. Can you tell me if the behavior of jEdit with <br>
nitpick has been improved?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Thomas</p>

Thank you for the good resource.</p>
<p>Indeed, I am using the material to teach myself Isabelle. The material is<br>
awesome.<br>
However, I found that myself cannot solve an exercise:<br>
Prove a property of the %-calculus: % x. f x = % y. f y<br>
which looks trivial, but whatever I try to make a lemma, they make syntax<br>
errors.</p>
<p>Can anybody guide me?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Charlie Kim</p>

Probably you just need parentheses:  (% x. f x) = (% y. f y)</p>
<p>The scope of a variable-binding operator is unlimited in both directions (left and right). This is a peculiarity of Isabelle's parser.</p>
