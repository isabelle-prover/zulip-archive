<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I got this link off of the developers list: <br>
<a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/test/Isabelle_11-Jan-2013/">http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/test/Isabelle_11-Jan-2013/</a></p>
<p>I wasn't going to switch over, but Isabelle 2012 started freezing up <br>
regularly several months ago, and it was freezing up very frequently <br>
today, so I made the switch using the above link.</p>
<p>Now, I have a few questions and comments.</p>
<p>\&lt;^SUB&gt; IS STILL THERE. IS IT STAYING THERE?</p>
<p>In Isabelle 2013, nothing has changed in regards to \&lt;^isub&gt;, \&lt;^isup&gt;, <br>
\&lt;^sub&gt;, and \&lt;^sup&gt;. Are \&lt;^sub&gt; and \&lt;^sup&gt; (or something equivalent) <br>
going to stay in Isar forever, or are they going away? If they're not <br>
going away, I'll use them exclusively for the markup I talked about <br>
previously. If they're going away, I won't use them at all.</p>
<p>Comment: The symbols tab is a nice addition. I had a THY that listed all <br>
the symbols, but the symbols tab is even better. Things are gettin' down <br>
right graphical, which they already were.</p>
<p>HOW DO I GET MY SHORTCUTS IN THE NEW JEDIT?</p>
<p>I copied over my ".isabelle\Isabelle2012\jedit\properties" to the folder <br>
".isabelle\Isabelle_11-Jan-2013\jedit", and it configured most <br>
everything, but my shortcuts don't get activated. I look in the <br>
"properties" file, and I see my shortcuts in there, but they aren't used <br>
in "Global Options / Shortcuts".</p>
<p>If I manually add a shortcut for an entry that's in the "properties" <br>
file, such as for</p>
<p>+jm..markup/mu__ncx__newthm_counter_example.shortcut=A+j m n c x</p>
<p>jEdit writes the same exact entry to the "properties" files.</p>
<p>Anyone know how to get jEdit to use all my shortcuts in the "properties" <br>
file?</p>
<p>NORTON QUARANTINES POLY.EXE</p>
<p>Norton quarantines "contrib\polyml-5.5.0\x86-cygwin\poly.exe", but it <br>
started doing that with Isabelle 2012. With Isabelle 2013, it gives me a <br>
error message that it didn't give me before about not being able to find <br>
the file. Users in the future should be aware of that. I just <br>
unquarantine poly.exe, and know that it's going to happen when it gets <br>
run for the first time on a computer on which I run Norton.</p>
<p>SMT PROOFS DON'T RUN THAT RAN BEFORE, AND SLEDGEHAMMER WAS FIRST HAVING <br>
PROBLEMS</p>
<p>I saw on the developers list that SMT causes problems, so that answered <br>
my question about whether I should use SMT proofs. The reason I had a <br>
couple is because they were about 4 times faster than the metis proofs <br>
that were found.</p>
<p>Sledgehammer wasn't working correctly at first. It wasn't updating the <br>
output window. It was possibly related to me trying to run it on the <br>
theorems that had the SMT proofs that didn't work anymore. At some <br>
point, after trying different options on different theorems, <br>
Sledgehammer started working.</p>
<p>COMMENTS CONTENT IS PICKIER</p>
<p>I got several errors I didn't get before for stuff that was in comments. <br>
I found what it was that made the comments happy.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
There's a new file for jEdit 5, which is:</p>
<p>jedit\keymaps\jEdit_keys.props</p>
<p>I deleted all my previous shortcuts in the file <br>
"Isabelle2012\jedit\properties", and I put them in the file <br>
"Isabelle_11-Jan-2013\jedit\keymaps\jEdit_keys.props".</p>
<p>The shortcuts showed up alongside my macros in the Macros menu, and <br>
jEdit didn't write them back into the "jEdit\properties" files. So I <br>
guess the new file is where the shortcuts are stored. I looked just a <br>
little on the web for information on how to import configuration from <br>
one version of jEdit to another, but I didn't find any info.</p>

Can you be more specific?  Problems can be solved only when they are made <br>
known, and described according to minimal standards of empirical science. <br>
Otherwise it is just guesswork.</p>
<p>Guessing nonetheless, the ML system could crash in certain situations of <br>
running out of resources.  See e.g. <br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2012-September/msg00152.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2012-September/msg00152.html</a> <br>
how to use polyml-5.5.0 with Isabelle2012.  It gives you much more <br>
headroom in typical "low" memory situations of 1-2 GB.  On Windows it is <br>
always running in 32bit mode, so this is expecially relevant.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The problem is not \&lt;^sub&gt; and \&lt;^sup&gt;, but the second copy \&lt;^isub&gt; and <br>
\&lt;^isup&gt; for identifier syntax.  This is an old issue stemming from 2003, <br>
when that feature was introduced.  Back then there were reasons to do it <br>
like that, and <em>after</em> the coming release one might considere re-opening <br>
the can to sort it out.</p>
<p>At the moment there are far more pressing things, notably getting <br>
Isabelle2013 in a stable state, not putting more changes and features in <br>
at this point.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The jEdit guys have changed that slightly for jedit-5.0.0.  There is now a <br>
separate ISABELLE_HOME_USER/jedit/keymaps/ directory.  So far I only made <br>
sure that the standard Isabelle/jEdit keyboard shortcuts end up in the <br>
generated imported_keys.props, without investigating what happens when <br>
users start shuffling different keymaps.</p>
<p>You might have to look around at the jedit website and/or its mailing <br>
lists.</p>

Isabelle2013 seems to have fixed that problem. It hasn't froze up once <br>
in 3 days. Guessing, I would say that Isabelle2012 was freezing up at <br>
least once an hour on me, and frequently it would freeze up twice within <br>
about 10 minutes or less.</p>
<p>The last day I used it, I was getting about 10 characters before it <br>
would freeze up. But I was using a vertical split window, which I had <br>
only started doing that day. I quit using a vertical split window, and <br>
it quit freezing up so bad.</p>
<p>It wasn't a memory problem. I have an icon in my task bar that shows my <br>
memory usage, and it rarely shows greater than 50% of the memory being used.</p>
<p>Thanks for the test release. It's working out good so far, other than <br>
maybe Sledgehammer and jEdit not working together so well, but I have to <br>
do some experimenting first before I comment again on that.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I sent an email to Norton telling them they're flagging a legitimate <br>
product that's being produced by Cambridge and TUM. What you need is to <br>
get in their database of legitimate programs. They use a huge database <br>
of known good and bad programs to speed up their scans.</p>
<p>Norton has two types of scans, a scan to check for whether it's known to <br>
be infected, and a scan to check for whether it looks suspicious, and if <br>
it does look suspicious, they make decisions based on it's reputation <br>
among the user community.</p>
<p>Poly.exe is getting flagged based on reputation. It has none, and it's <br>
not a native Windows application, so it kind of makes sense.</p>
<p>If I didn't have lots of experience knowing the difference between <br>
Norton's typical behavior with normal Windows installs that I download <br>
from legitimate looking web sites, and programs that come from "other" <br>
places, I might get rid of Norton, because I've used Avast and  AVG and <br>
know they're more lenient.</p>
<p>However, I keep Norton because no one has so far broken into my bank <br>
account. The "reputation" scan is short term pain, but long term gain. <br>
They're doing more than just looking at known virus signatures.</p>
<p>I think it's their attempt to deal with things like zero-day attacks:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_attack">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_attack</a></p>
<p>Here are the results of 3 sites that I had check poly.exe. (I don't know <br>
if the results will show up for you using these links.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virustotal.com/file/6c296b99e0a6d5ac50009bd52d325e683f3ae2515ebae41f8ab46aceb1473eaa/analysis/1358256081/">https://www.virustotal.com/file/6c296b99e0a6d5ac50009bd52d325e683f3ae2515ebae41f8ab46aceb1473eaa/analysis/1358256081/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://virusscan.jotti.org/en/scanresult/96b63157b869b555c344913bbd059127d2f59b1d">http://virusscan.jotti.org/en/scanresult/96b63157b869b555c344913bbd059127d2f59b1d</a></p>

<p>The good news is that poly.exe is flagged only by Symantec out of about <br>
47 anti-virus programs, and only based on their reputation scan. The <br>
other good news is that I use Norton, so you at least know it could <br>
happen to a user.</p>

weeks, or so.  I hope to be able to start official Isabelle2013-RC1 <br>
testing at the end of this week.  Right now we should count the above as <br>
totally unofficial RC0.  As you continue testing any of these versions, it <br>
is important to update to consecutive release candidates whenever they <br>
appear, to avoid getting stuck with these not fully finished snapshots. <br>
Last time in the preparation of Isabelle2012, I introduced some small <br>
problems in later release candidates as reaction to observation to earlier <br>
ones.  We need to avoided such accidents this time.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Configuration option show_markup controls direct inlining of markup<blockquote>
<p>into the printed representation of formal entities --- notably type<br>
and sort constraints. This enables Prover IDE users to retrieve that<br>
information via tooltips in the output window, for example.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that, at least for constant functions, one is not able to see <br>
the type of the constant in the tooltip window (only the theory where it <br>
is defined) as opposed to the the corresponding one in the normal edit <br>
window (after Ctrl+hover)..</p>
<p>I attach two images, where the situation described above can be clearly <br>
exemplified.</p>
<p>Is this still a restriction or maybe a lack of proper configuration from <br>
my part?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parse vs. print phases of logical terms are not fully symmetric.  It <br>
is just an accident that parse manages to report on result types produced <br>
by type-inference, but print omits that information.</p>
<p>So it is just one of these things that still don't work for the coming <br>
release.</p>

Here are simplified examples of what was in my comments.</p>
<p>These 5 examples give me an error that I don't get in Isabelle2012:</p>
<p>(* \&lt;...&gt;  *)<br>
    Error: Malformed command syntax</p>
<p>--"\&lt;rbrace&gt;", --"\&lt;lbrace&gt;", --{* \&lt;lbrace&gt; <em>}, and --{</em> \&lt;rbrace&gt; *}<br>
    Error: Unbalanced antiquotation block parentheses</p>
<p>The first example fits your description. I haven't used anitquotations, <br>
so I don't know why the other four examples give errors. Using any of <br>
the other left or right delimiters by themselves don't cause a problem, <br>
like using --"\&lt;langle&gt;" doesn't give an error.</p>
<p>I had actually mismatched \&lt;lbrace and "}" in a comment for something <br>
like this:</p>
<p>--{* \&lt;lbrace&gt;an_equation} *}</p>
<p>The left brace is used by itself sometimes in math. I'm not using it <br>
like that, so I don't care, at least not today.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

I'm not really asking for any changes or new features, I'm asking, in a <br>
roundabout way, that you leave those four commands the way they are, <br>
forever.</p>
<p>I could be asking for even less, merely to know what the future holds. <br>
If you said, "The four will eventually be reduced down to two commands", <br>
I would say to myself, "Ah, it was a nice thought that things would stay <br>
the same, but at least I know the future."</p>
<p>I can see the need to reduce those four, as they're named, down to only <br>
two commands, but that the executive decision might need some more time <br>
to be thought out or to implement.</p>
<p>But, commands like \&lt;^isub&gt;\&lt;lfloor&gt; and \&lt;^isub&gt;\&lt;rfloor&gt; would make <br>
good markup commands. I can't use those particular two because I might <br>
use the floor function in the index of a sigma sum, not that I've <br>
completely thought that out.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other characters to choose from, but in these <br>
formative stages, when things haven't been set in stone, it doesn't hurt <br>
to ask.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>All Isabelle source text needs to conform to the official Isabelle symbol <br>
syntax.  Isabelle2013 is more thorough in checking that, even inside <br>
comments.</p>

<p>There was an omission of not observing these formal-comments.  This is <br>
done in Isabelle2013, so for example</p>
<p>-- {* look here @{term "λx. x"} *}</p>
<p>will have the proper formal markup for the embedded term inside the <br>
antiquotation.  \&lt;rbrace&gt; and \&lt;lbrace&gt; are part of the official <br>
antiquotation syntax, although they are rarely used.  You can evade by <br>
inventing referring to funny symbols that are not used elsewhere yet.</p>
