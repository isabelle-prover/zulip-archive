<p>From: Tambet &lt;<a href="mailto:qtvali@gmail.com">qtvali@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Type-safety of variables in Java is related to type constraints, but one can<br>
always emulate variables (say, as strings), which aren't type-safe.</p>
<p>Variables in Java are also mutexes. Say that mutexes are safe by<br>
composition, then one can emulate mutexes, which are not - also, one could<br>
create livelocks.</p>
<p>I am not sure if livelocks can be avoided by strong types, but deadlocks can</p>
<ul>
<li>and deadlocks are the main problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Java, taking lock is achieved by synchronized method:<br>
synchronized (a) {<br>
  ...<br>
}</p>
<p>One can also take class lock by having it in function signature.</p>
<p>First problem - it's impossible to atomically take two locks like this:<br>
synchronized (a, b) {<br>
  ...<br>
}</p>
<p>These run to deadlock if they are in different threads:<br>
synchronized (a) { synchronized (b) { ... }}<br>
synchronized (b) { synchronized (a) { ... }}</p>
<p>This is easy to see, why - order differs.</p>
<p>Say that we have "then synchronized" keyword.<br>
synchronized (a) {<br>
  then synchronized (b) {<br>
    ...<br>
  }<br>
  ...<br>
}</p>
<p>This should take two locks atomically, then release one of them.</p>
<p>Taking many locks at once, then releasing them in arbitrary order - this<br>
wont run to deadlocks.</p>
<p>Then, imagine this:<br>
synchronized (a) { synchronized (b) { ... }}<br>
synchronized (a) { ... } then synchronized (b) { ... }</p>
<p>First one takes lock b after a, second one will take b atomically when<br>
releasing a. As long as locks are taken in same order, it's impossible to<br>
force system to deadlock. There is a difference between forcing it to<br>
deadlock and allowing deadlock - it has different constraints to<br>
thread-safety of types.</p>
<p>Say that some type is ordered in regard to locks:<br>
class A {<br>
  seq Integer[] b;<br>
}<br>
class B {}<br>
seq { A, B }</p>
<p>In other file, there might be:<br>
seq { A, C }<br>
merging to previous sequence as { A, B, C }</p>
<p>Sequencing locks is one rather powerful way to avoid deadlocks. Also,<br>
integers inside A should be a sub-sequence of A.</p>
<p>For lock of A, we have a few considerable possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's last lock of it's inner sequence, then it's possible to lock it after<br>
any lock there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's first lock of it's inner sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>It's a covering lock of whole it's sequence, locking all Integers in b.</li>
</ul>
<p>We could have this goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lock whole A, get some data</li>
<li>Work on it</li>
<li>Lock A again, write it</li>
</ul>
<p>We can mark this data as being worked on or we can try to write and retry if<br>
it's changed meanwhile. We could also have queues, which is my favorite, but<br>
this is not interesting here.</p>
<p>So having A at end of sequence, it is no problem to take lock of A and b[n]<br>
at once, then release A, then work on b[n] and take A again:<br>
synchronized (b[n]) {<br>
  then synchronized (A) {<br>
    // Read data.<br>
  }<br>
  // Work on data.<br>
} then synchronized (A) {<br>
  // Write data.<br>
}</p>
<p>This relies on fact that locking all at once we can not run to deadlock -<br>
then, we release A and one lock left, go sequentially.</p>
<p>Method, then, should look something like that:<br>
int m(n) locks [(A, b[n]), A] {<br>
  synchronized (b[n]) {<br>
    then synchronized (A) {<br>
      // Read data.<br>
    }<br>
    // Work on data.<br>
  } then synchronized (A) {<br>
    // Write data.<br>
  }<br>
}</p>
<p>Eclipse could generate the lock signature. It contains locking path - and<br>
challence is to make it short.</p>
<p>For having more complex use cases - where we want to read several items,<br>
when changing one - it's needed to have independent handler for items in b -<br>
this handler will take internal locks. From such handler, no calls can be<br>
made to parent (this is, by the way, most hard-to-debug deadlock case) from<br>
locked functions. In such case, the functions are kind of "atomic" - you<br>
call them, they have inherently good lock structure, they exit and this<br>
makes no difference what locks you use from your own scope.</p>
<p>This locking, to be usable, must be tightly integrated to the rest of type<br>
system - otherwise it's unimaginable that you create all those connections<br>
between variables (as variable structure itself is dynamic, you can always<br>
add element to an array or reference something from some other class).</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Sequence structure, defined in several files, is directed and can fork/join.</p>
<p>Each locking sequence can start by taking many locks at once, then release<br>
all locks except connected slice of lock sequence, then progress.</p>
<p>Independent sequences of subsystems work ok as long as one can make calls to<br>
another, which locks things with allowed structure and then releases it's<br>
own internal locks and returns. That other can not make back-calls to<br>
methods, which use caller-scope locks in relation to it.</p>
<p>I am sure that this structure can be worked on to allow more cases, but this<br>
is a simple and proven methodology, which allows a lot. I suggest also<br>
looking at lock structure in Google Go-lang, which basically has only<br>
channels and no locks (and is fast compiled language - someday with a<br>
garbage collector). The Go-lang suggestion is precisely because proving at<br>
least one structure, which allows sending messages in two directions, to be<br>
deadlock-safe, would cover all common needs. This is - everyone tries to<br>
send something, reader can at any moment read the array or next message in<br>
and process it. Sending messages back from many to one could be simple<br>
method call, then. This would allow to emulate something similar to Go's<br>
message-sending structure, which allows all important use cases (as they<br>
say).</p>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu">andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Tambet,</p>
<p>in Isabelle, I have formalized a notion of type safety for the Java <br>
multithreading model with deadlocks in the JinjaThreads article in the <br>
Archive of Formal Proofs <br>
(<a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/JinjaThreads.shtml">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/JinjaThreads.shtml</a>).</p>
<p>There, I do allow deadlocks in showing type safety in the style of <br>
progress and preservation: The progress is restricted to non-deadlocked <br>
cases. Note that not only deadlocks via locking violate the progress <br>
property. Java's wait-notify-mechanism and joining of threads can <br>
similarly cause problems with progress. Suppose a thread is in a wait <br>
set - waiting to be notified or interrupted - but there is only one <br>
other thread which joins on the thread in the wait set. I would also <br>
call this a deadlock.</p>
<p>Andreas</p>
