<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:Thomas.Sewell@nicta.com.au">Thomas.Sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
I was sitting down to write an email about a unification bug, and it<br>
occurred to me that Isabelle users might also be interested in the<br>
status of our project.</p>
<p>I've been working on the L4.verified project at NICTA (see<br>
<a href="http://ertos.nicta.com.au/research/l4.verified/">http://ertos.nicta.com.au/research/l4.verified/</a>). Our objective was to<br>
use Isabelle as an analysis tool in proving that an operating system<br>
kernel satisfied certain conditions. I'm pleased to report that Isabelle<br>
has served us well and our project was completed successfully. You can<br>
read the story in various places, including slashdot (see<br>
<a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/09/08/13/0827231/Worlds-First-Formally">http://tech.slashdot.org/story/09/08/13/0827231/Worlds-First-Formally</a>).</p>
<p>With our project done, one of my follow-up jobs was to push our patch to <br>
the record package back upstream. The repository record package was<br>
effectively unusable for records with more than 150 fields, a limit we <br>
increase to around 1000. I'm hoping the change will make it into the <br>
next Isabelle release.</p>
<p>While cleaning up the mechanism by which certain facts about record <br>
updators were proven, I came across a charming unification bug.</p>
<p>Suppose one were to define a predicate and some rules about it like so:</p>
<p>constdefs<br>
   somepredicate :: "(('b =&gt; 'b) =&gt; ('a =&gt; 'a))<br>
                               =&gt; 'a =&gt; 'b =&gt; bool"<br>
  "somepredicate upd v x == True"</p>
<p>lemma somepredicate_idI:<br>
   "somepredicate id (f v) v"<br>
   by (simp add: somepredicate_def)</p>
<p>lemma somepredicate_triv:<br>
   "somepredicate upd v x ==&gt; somepredicate upd v x"<br>
   by assumption</p>
<p>We can resolve the two rules against each other:</p>
<p>lemmas somepredicate_triv [OF somepredicate_idI]</p>
<p>However, if we first instantiate 'a with a function type, we get a TERM<br>
exception out of the bowels of the unifier:</p>
<p>lemmas somepredicate_triv[where v="f :: nat =&gt; bool", OF somepredicate_idI]</p>
<p>*** exception TERM raised: fastype: expected function type<br>
*** At command "lemmas".</p>
<p>I've confirmed this issue exists in multiple versions of Isabelle<br>
including a recent snapshot. Severity is medium, it being easy to work<br>
around the issue once isolated but difficult to track down when it first<br>
appeared (the first time I attempted to define a record with a<br>
functional field type). Likelihood of anyone else tripping on this in <br>
the near future is low.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
     Thomas.</p>
