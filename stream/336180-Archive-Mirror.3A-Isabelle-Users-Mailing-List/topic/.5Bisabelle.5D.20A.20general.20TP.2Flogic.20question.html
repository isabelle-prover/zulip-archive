Hi,</p>
<p>I have a general theorem proving/logic question: does it make sense to<br>
have a proof obligation that checks for unprovability? For example,<br>
the proof obligation may require that a particular sentence, like "f =<br>
g" to be unprovable from a theory T, i.e. "T |+ f = g". Checking for<br>
unprovability is undecidable, right? If such a constraint is<br>
impractical, then is there a more practical formulation for checking<br>
the same/similar property?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot<br>
John</p>

You could try to exhibit a model of T in which 'f = g' holds and then<br>
exhibit another model of T in which 'f = g' does not hold.  That's how<br>
the 'parallel postulate' of Euclidian geometry was shown to be<br>
unprovable from the other axioms.</p>

Yes it makes sense.. In stead of me going into detail I suggest you read<br>
the short document the link points to.</p>

I'm currently doing this in Isabelle.  The way I've chosen to do <br>
it is using locales.  I have a locale for (Tarski's axioms of) the <br>
absolute plane.  I've proven that the real Cartesian plane is an <br>
instance of this locale and that it also satisfies Tarski's <br>
version of "Euclid's axiom".</p>
<p>I've now defined a model of the hyperbolic plane, and I'm in the <br>
process of proving that it's also an instance of my absolute plane <br>
locale.  Then I'll need to prove that it doesn't satisfy Euclid's <br>
axiom.</p>
<p>Only my work on the hyperbolic plane is necessary to establish <br>
that Euclid's axiom is unprovable in Tarski's theory of the <br>
absolute plane, but my work on the Cartesian plane establishes <br>
that the negation of Euclid's axiom is also unprovable from that <br>
theory.</p>
<p>In all of this, I have to rely on the assumption that Isabelle/HOL <br>
is consistent, but I guess all work in Isabelle/HOL makes that <br>
assumption.</p>

I see. Do you know where I can find the proof that shows that it's unprovable?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>

I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for.  Are you after the <br>
proof that Euclid's axiom is unprovable from Tarski's other axioms <br>
of the plane?  This is surprisingly difficult to find.</p>
<p>The version of Tarski's axioms I'm using is from Metamathematische <br>
Methoden in der Geometrie by Schwabhäuser, Szmielew, and Tarski <br>
(which is made slightly more difficult by the fact that I don't <br>
speak German --- not yet, anyway).  I'm told that the first <br>
published version of Tarski's axioms was in The Axiomatic Method <br>
(1959); from memory it was the second paper.</p>
<p>The following paper in The Axiomatic Method was Some <br>
Metamathematical Problems Concerning Elementary Hyperbolic <br>
Geometry, by Szmielew.  She used a modified version of Tarski's <br>
axioms, where Euclid's axiom was replaced with a hyperbolic axiom, <br>
stronger than the negation of Euclid's axiom.  Her theorem 2.15 <br>
states that a system is a model of these axioms of hyperbolic <br>
space if and only if it's isomorphic with the Klein space of <br>
appropriate dimension.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, her proof begins by asserting that it's <br>
"well known" that the Klein space satisfies the hyperbolic version <br>
of Tarski's axioms.  It's a little difficult to see how it could <br>
already be well known as soon as the axioms were first published.  <br>
(The proof goes on to show in more detail that every model of the <br>
hyperbolic version of Tarski's axioms must be isomorphic to the <br>
Klein space, which isn't the direction I need.)</p>
<p>Other publications (including Metamathematische Methoden in der <br>
Geometrie) that state the result I want, or something closely <br>
related, generally refer the reader to Szmielew's paper for the <br>
"proof", which is frustrating.</p>
<p>Szmielew did partly make up for it, though.  The book I'm finding <br>
most useful in formalizing this independence result is Foundations <br>
of Geometry by Borsuk &amp; Szmielew (which I am grateful was <br>
translated into English from the original Polish).  It uses a <br>
different set of axioms from Tarski's, but they're similar enough <br>
to be helpful. The book describes the Klein-Beltrami model of the <br>
hyperbolic plane, starting on page 245, and then checks that it <br>
satisfies their axioms, starting on page 250.</p>
<p>In the process of formalizing the independence result in Isabelle, <br>
I've found a few errors in Borsuk &amp; Szmielew, but I guess this is <br>
likely in any similar publication.</p>
<p>The Klein-Beltrami model of the hyperbolic plane is by no means <br>
the only one.  It's useful to me because it preserves betweenness, <br>
which is one of the primitive relations in Tarksi's axioms.  If <br>
you're using a different set of axioms, another model might be <br>
more useful.</p>
