Hi all,</p>
<p>recently I had a closer look at the session HOL-Word; what started as a<br>
mere analysis out of curiousity turned into a substantial overhaul of<br>
existing material resulting in a plan for the time after the next release.</p>
<p>What is relevant for the next release:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The traditional entry point HOL-Word.Word is supposed to be<br>
meta-stable: there might be issues due to things like additional simp<br>
rules and oscillating full theorem names etc. as not uncommon for new<br>
releases, but there are no intentional changes in scope there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HOL-Word.More_Word is an additional »sumo« enty point into HOL-Word.</p>
</li>
<li>Other theories in HOL-Word have undergone a massive internal<br>
re-structuring and re-grouping of material, absorbing material from AFP<br>
sessions, particulary Native_Word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some time after the release I would attempt a de-baroquification<br>
(purification?) of HOL-Word: there is evidence that the essentially<br>
needed things can be expressed quite compactly using state-of-the-art<br>
tools in Isabelle/HOL; preliminary case studies can be found in<br>
src/HOL/ex/Bit_Lists.thy and src/HOL/ex/Word_Type.thy (which are just a<br>
start, there is much more in the pipeline).  Hence I hope that in the<br>
long run bit and word types and operations can take place in two<br>
theories in HOL-Library, which HOL-Word that just builds upon; we will<br>
see which applications then still need full HOL-Word.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
    Florian<br>

Hi Florian,</p>
<p>I think that is a good endeavour, there is indeed much that can be expressed more nicely these days. Keeping larger changes to after Isabelle2019 would be good.</p>
<p>For testing, I guess we are one of the biggest users of Word proofs, so it might make sense to have a look at <a href="https://github.com/seL4/l4v/">https://github.com/seL4/l4v/</a> and run that for at least the ARM architecture settings. Of course this is on Isabelle2018. There is another round of material accumulated there that I was planning to contribute to the AFP Word entry before the Isabelle2019 release, but I will probably run out of time (project deadlines, haven’t even managed yet to test RC1) and have to move it to the next one.</p>
<p>Are your current HOL-Word changes already in RC1 or planned for RC2? Was there much impact on AFP.Word_Lib?</p>
<p>I’m also happy to help with testing later changes and be involved in the content evolution of HOL-Word.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Gerwin</p>

</blockquote>
<p>the changes are already there in RC1.  The impact on AFP entries is<br>
minimal.  In fact the primary purpose of the reorganization was to<br>
understand what the fundamental concepts are and group the material<br>
accordingly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m also happy to help with testing later changes and be involved in the content evolution of HOL-Word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My aim is to leave HOL-Word.Word more or less »as it is«, but basing it<br>
on newly emerging theories; this would allow to gradually find out which<br>
parts of HOL-Word.Word are obsolete for particular applications without<br>
endangering those that still need it.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
