<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>I would like to understand if it would be feasible for me to propose my own<br>
contributions to HOL. I have read the section "Publish contributions as an<br>
external" on the Isabelle community wiki (<br>
<a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community/Publish_contributions_as_an_external">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community/Publish_contributions_as_an_external</a>).<br>
I am also aware of the mailing list <a href="mailto:isabelle-dev@in.tum.de">isabelle-dev@in.tum.de</a>. However, this<br>
is a general question about the possibility of a contribution being<br>
considered, given certain specific circumstances. Thus, I believe that it<br>
may be more useful to this mailing list, rather than <a href="mailto:isabelle-dev@in.tum.de">isabelle-dev@in.tum.de</a>.<br>
Otherwise, of course, please suggest to forward it to <a href="mailto:isabelle-dev@in.tum.de">isabelle-dev@in.tum.de</a><br>
.</p>
<p>My primary concern is that I am not affiliated with an academic group or a<br>
company that works with Isabelle/HOL on a regular basis. I have an<br>
impression that all of the existing contributions to HOL were made by<br>
people who are, somehow, officially affiliated with the Isabelle community.<br>
Thus, I would like to assess whether or not my contributions would be<br>
considered on this basis. Of course, I am also aware of the existence of<br>
the AFP. However, I believe, some of the theorems that I would like to<br>
propose naturally extend some of the theories that are already available in<br>
HOL and, most likely, are not suitable to be published as an independent<br>
AFP library.</p>
<p>To be more specific, I would like to provide several examples of the<br>
contributions that I would like to propose.  At the moment, HOL-Algebra<br>
contains the theory IntRing.thy that contains the lemmas "ZFact_zero:<br>
"carrier (ZFact 0) = (⋃a. {{a}})"" and "ZFact_one: "carrier (ZFact 1) =<br>
{UNIV}"". However, it does not seem to contain a lemma that could describe<br>
the carrier of a more general quotient ring "ZFact (m::int)" (e.g. "0 &lt; m<br>
⟹ carrier (ZFact m) = {X. ∃n ∈ {0..&lt;m}. X = {x. m dvd (x - n)}}"). Also, I<br>
was not able to find a relatively standard textbook theorem that<br>
characterises a cyclic group in terms of the quotient group "add_monoid<br>
(ZFact m)" (e.g. "finite (carrier G) ⟹ order G = m ⟹ ∃a ∈ carrier G.<br>
carrier G = {a[^]i | i::int. i ∈ UNIV} ⟹ add_monoid (ZFact m) ≅ G"). Some<br>
of the potential contributions are not independent theorems, but minor<br>
extensions of the existing lemmas in "HOL", e.g. lemma "ord_dvd_pow_eq_1"<br>
in "Algebra-Multiplicative_Group" shows that  "finite (carrier G)", "a ∈<br>
carrier G" and "a [^] k = 𝟭" together imply "ord a dvd k", where "k" is of<br>
the type "nat". However, this lemma holds even if "k" is any number of the<br>
type "int" (the existing proof would need to be amended to take into<br>
account the negative values of k).</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>(I would prefer not to disclose my contact details publicly for the reasons<br>
of privacy and as a measure against spam)</p>

<p>If some of your results are related to number theory, you could include<br>
your contributions in my project of a library "number theory miscellany".<br>
Here is my repository :<br>
<a href="https://github.com/josephcmac/Folklore-and-miscellaneous-results-in-number-theory">https://github.com/josephcmac/Folklore-and-miscellaneous-results-in-number-theory</a></p>
<p>But, you should include in the file either your name or a pseudonym, in<br>
order to distinguish your contributions from my contributions. Maybe you<br>
prefer your own miscellany, e.g., "general miscellany", "topology<br>
miscellany", etc. In my case, my main motivation to contribute, beside the<br>
pleasure of proving some truth, is to increase my CV, because some<br>
reviewers of important journals, e.g., American Mathematical Monthly, said<br>
to me that my proofs are too long to be checked and that they are annoying<br>
for the readers (someone is confusing mathematics with comic strips). I am<br>
successfully proving the theorems from my Master Memoir in Isabelle one by<br>
one (work-in-progress). My first version is rather non-algorithmic, but I<br>
have the project to include an algorithmic version in order to do explicit<br>
computations.</p>

<p>Me neither, nevertheless, the Isabelle community, at least in my case, was<br>
the most open research community that I have ever met. Other research<br>
communities, like the communities of pure mathematics, are rather closed<br>
and mathematicians in general do not read the works of outsiders (they have<br>
not time for that), e.g., the old Gauss did not read the work of the young<br>
Abel, because he assumed that it was wrong, the old Cauchy did not read the<br>
work of the young Galois, etc. Proof assistants are the key for an outsider<br>
to become an insider, because the computer guarantee  that the result is<br>
fine, even if the proof is very complex. Nevertheless, I advice you to<br>
become part of something and to change when you will be ready: the academic<br>
growth is step by step.</p>

<p>From: Paulo Emílio de Vilhena &lt;<a href="mailto:pevilhena2@gmail.com">pevilhena2@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>I’m not answering your question, but since you are working on HOL-Algebra I<br>
would like to point out a github repository where we propose not only to<br>
extend this library with new theories but also to revise old ones. For<br>
instance, we already have one of the mentioned theorems you were looking<br>
for: it is the lemma mod_ring from the theory Int_Ring (note the underline)<br>
stated as</p>
<p>lemma (in int_ring) mod_ring:</p>
<p>assumes "a ∈ carrier R - { 𝟬 }"</p>
<p>shows "carrier (R Quot (PIdl a)) = (λi. PIdl a +&gt; ⟦ i ⟧) ` {0..&lt; ¦<br>
int_repr a ¦}"</p>
<p>It’s overly complicated for now, because it’s stated for all rings<br>
isomorphic to the ring of integers, but you can easily instantiate it for<br>
Z. We also have a theory called Multiplicative_Group_Revised where I<br>
started an analogous development of Multiplicative_Group but more concise<br>
since it reuses previous developments from cycles and permutations.</p>
<p>Other than that, there are theories on algebraic numbers, field extensions<br>
and division of polynomials. Our most impressive result is the existence of<br>
the algebraic closure of a field. Here is the link for the repository in<br>
case you want to check it out: <a href="https://github.com/DeVilhena-Paulo/GaloisCVC4">https://github.com/DeVilhena-Paulo/GaloisCVC4</a></p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Paulo.</p>

You do not have to be affiliated with anybody to contribute to Isabelle/HOL <br>
theories but there is no well-established process for contributing. For small <br>
amendments you can either send them to this mailing list or contact individuals, <br>
like the web page says that you found.</p>
<p>Larger contributions require more interaction with people who feel responsible <br>
for some area. In the case of Algebra, Paulo has already indicated that there <br>
are parellel developments that you may be able to liaise with.</p>

<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>In what follows, I address everyone who replied to my email (not in any<br>
particular order).</p>
<p>To Tobias Nipkow,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I am glad that it is potentially possible for me<br>
to make contributions to HOL. However, of course, given that potentially<br>
anyone can make a contribution, it would be nice if there was a<br>
well-established process for making contributions.</p>
<p>To Paulo Emílio de Vilhena,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response and for providing the link to the repository<br>
GaloisCVC4. I have several questions about the repository:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I would like to confirm that, while the main purpose of the project<br>
GaloisCVC4 is the development of Galois Theory in the context of<br>
HOL-Algebra, you are also making changes to HOL-Algebra that are not<br>
directly related to the main line of the development of the project<br>
GaloisCVC4, i.e. you may consider adding to the repository any established<br>
results from algebra or making minor amendments/extensions of the existing<br>
theorems that do not contribute to the main line of the development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to understand if your intention is to<br>
integrate GaloisCVC4 with HOL-Algebra or publish it in the context of the<br>
AFP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, I would like to understand if you intend to discontinue the work<br>
on the project after a certain deadline or after you achieve certain<br>
milestones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If my understanding of the dual purpose (see clause 1) of the project<br>
GaloisCVC4 is correct, would you, potentially, accept pull requests from<br>
external contributors?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, thank you for pointing out the existence of the (Isabelle)<br>
generalisation of the proof of the characterisation of the carrier of Z/mZ.<br>
I only wish I knew about the existence of GaloisCVC4 earlier.</p>
<p>To José Manuel Rodriguez Caballero,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply and for providing the link to your repository. It<br>
is good to know about the existence of this repository because it seems<br>
that there is no mention of it in the AFP at the moment (although I cannot<br>
be entirely certain). The lemmas that I have mentioned in my question may<br>
fit within the context of the repository. However, they are also very<br>
closely related to the existing Isabelle theories within HOL-Algebra, as<br>
confirmed by Paulo Emílio de Vilhena, who has already proven a<br>
generalisation of one of the theorems that I mentioned in my question in<br>
the context of an ongoing development of HOL-Algebra (unfortunately, I was<br>
not aware of this development before asking the question). Regardless, if<br>
possible, I would appreciate if you could reconfirm that potentially you<br>
could accept pull requests from external contributors. Nevertheless, I have<br>
to admit, that it is unlikely that I will produce any further proofs of<br>
results that are related to number theory in the near future.</p>
<p>With regard to non-technical part of your answer, previously, I used a<br>
pseudonym xanonec on this mailing list. I also use it on Stack Overflow.<br>
However, it seems that mailing-list-anonymous is slightly more<br>
'professional' in some sense. Also, I am only trying to hide my real<br>
contact details/identity from third parties (especially spam lists/online<br>
scam/etc). There is a good reason why there is a variety of privacy<br>
settings available on the websites like LinkedIn and Facebook and it is<br>
possible to control who can see your posts/profile/personal information.<br>
However, unfortunately, mailing lists do not provide such options and,<br>
furthermore, all posts can be found via Google. In general, I prefer the<br>
website Stack Overflow to mailing lists. However, it seems that Isabelle<br>
community is not very active on Stack Overflow, because some of the<br>
questions that I tried to ask there were left without a reply/comments for<br>
days. Nevertheless, I was able to obtain a reply to the same questions<br>
using this mailing list within hours.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Sure, everybody is welcome to contribute to the miscellany in number theory<br>
(I am myself external). Also, if another person want to create another<br>
project about miscellany, e.g., miscellany in topology, I will be glad to<br>
contribute. I think that the best way to contribute is to make some link in<br>
github. I have not experience about using github (maybe you have more<br>
experience than myself in this topic). My official formation was in pure<br>
mathematics, the computer sciences that I am doing is self-taught.</p>

<p>Ok, you could write in your Isabelle file "xanonec" or just your name if<br>
you want to be recognized. If your write "mailing-list anonymous" in your<br>
Isabelle file, people evidently will think that there was a mistake of<br>
copy-paste. Also, the problem of calling yourself "anonymous" is that<br>
another person can call himself/herself "anonymous" too: it is like the guy<br>
called "Anonymous" to whom many quotations are attributed. The name is just<br>
a mask, so being anonymous is to put your mask out.</p>

<p>From: Paulo Emílio de Vilhena &lt;<a href="mailto:pevilhena2@gmail.com">pevilhena2@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>You are right about this. While my goal was the development of Galois<br>
   Theory, the project was actually born as an attempt from me and Martin<br>
   Baillon to reduce the amount of changes to HOL-Algebra we were both making<br>
   independently.<br>
   2.</p>
<p>The idea is to integrate the material which could be considerate as<br>
   fundamental to any development in algebra and publish in the context of the<br>
   AFP more specific material. We already have a big part of our material in<br>
   the library and recent releases of Isabelle will come with some of my<br>
   revised theories and sophisticated tricks such as Weak_Morphisms.thy.<br>
   3.</p>
<p>The project was the subject of an internship in the ALEXANDRIA team,<br>
   supervised by Larry Paulson. The internship is already over and it is not<br>
   being trivial to find time to work on the project, but I do intend to<br>
   continue. The Galois correspondence theorem is certainly a milestone, but<br>
   there is a lot of work to be done on the library itself. I think it’s<br>
   preferable to progress horizontally in a proper way than to quickly prove<br>
   profound statements in a formalism that nobody will be able to use.<br>
   4.</p>
<p>Contributions are welcome :) I’m quite jealous with my theories and<br>
   proofs, I must say, but if you have well-founded contributions to make, I<br>
   will probably accept. By well-founded I mean that it should have at least a<br>
   minimal explanation on why such a modification would make sense. For the<br>
   moment, there are two theories in need of revision/development that may<br>
   interest you: Int_Ring.thy and Multiplicative_Group_Revised.thy. Int_Ring,<br>
   because I think that talking about rings isomorphic to Z only complicate<br>
   things and I did that to overcome a problem which does not exist anymore,<br>
   so merging Int_Ring and IntRing is something desirable.<br>
   Multiplicative_Group_Revised should just be continued.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would like to thank you for your interest on the project, I hope<br>
you will be able to find and use what you need in GaloisCVC4. If you have<br>
any suggestions or if you find that something in our formalism was not well<br>
thought, I’m always keen to discuss.</p>
<p>Paulo.</p>

<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who replied to my original query. I believe<br>
that my question was answered in full and I would like to propose (without<br>
being insistent) to close this topic. I would also like to make several<br>
concluding remarks in response to the replies in Digest Vol 160, Issue 15.<br>
However, please note that I may leave further comments on this topic<br>
without a reply.</p>
<p>To Makarius,</p>
<p>Thank you for your comment. Of course, it was not my intention to ask<br>
whether or not I am allowed to change or ignore any of the documented<br>
practices for making a contribution to Isabelle/HOL. My primary concern was<br>
whether or not my contributions would be considered if I was to propose<br>
them while not working under the supervision of one of the existing regular<br>
co-developers of Isabelle/HOL and while not being affiliated to a<br>
research group that regularly works with Isabelle/HOL (at the moment,<br>
Isabelle/HOL is merely one of my past-time hobbies). I believe that this<br>
issue has not been documented anywhere. However, as I mentioned in my<br>
original query, I formed an impression that all of the contributions to HOL<br>
were made by established academics in the areas of logic/formal<br>
verification/mathematics or students working under their supervision. Thus,<br>
I wanted to ensure that if I was going to make a proposal, it would not be<br>
ignored/rejected because of the aforementioned circumstances.</p>
<p>As a side note, based on the replies given by Paulo Emílio de Vilhena (see<br>
below), if I decide to submit my contributions to the community, it is<br>
likely that I will try to do so indirectly through the repository<br>
GaloisCVC4 (also, see the next section in my reply).</p>
<p>To Makarius and José Manuel Rodriguez Caballero,</p>
<p>I have no intention to hide my identity from the regular users of this<br>
mailing list. However, I would prefer to remain anonymous to the general<br>
public. Of course, anyone who needs to know my name/contact details for any<br>
good reason can inquire about them in a personal email (with the<br>
understanding that they are not to be shared without my consent). Also, of<br>
course, it is in my interest to associate my name with my contributions if<br>
they are to be accepted (whether they are contributions to Isabelle/HOL or<br>
a private repository of an academic).</p>
<p>To Paulo Emílio de Vilhena,</p>
<p>Thank you for the detailed reply.</p>
<p>I would like to make several comments with regard to clause 4 in your reply:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Firstly, given that you have already introduced (or seem to be working<br>
on) a significant number of the contributions that I was going to propose,<br>
it seems now that it is slightly less likely that I will make any attempts<br>
to make contributions in the very near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a certain amount of experience in computer programming and I am<br>
familiar with the feeling that one can get when an external entity with<br>
less experience is trying to 'sabotage' your code base or your intended<br>
direction for the development. Luckily, at least, it is nearly impossible<br>
to introduce errors/bugs in Isabelle theorems. If I will ever make an<br>
attempt to make a contribution, then I will also make every attempt to<br>
ensure that it is either peripheral to the main line of the development or,<br>
at least, it is very unlikely to have any negative impact on the main line<br>
of the development. Of course, I would submit a pull request on GitHub and<br>
you are welcome to reject it if you decide that it is not suitable<br>
(obviously, if you do decide to reject it, I will appreciate any<br>
constructive feedback).<br>
If there was an active issue tracker for the project, I would also be glad<br>
to look into the problems that you would like to be solved, but you believe<br>
that they have a low priority (i.e. the problems that you would not want to<br>
spend your time on). However, most certainly, I cannot guarantee my<br>
commitment (as I mentioned somewhere in this reply, at the moment,<br>
Isabelle/HOL is merely one of my past-time hobbies). Thus, please do not<br>
start an issue tracker on my behalf :).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I think that talking about rings isomorphic to Z only complicate<br>
things...". I cannot imagine that anyone who is able to understand the<br>
content of HOL-Algebra will not be able to specialise theorems in Int_Ring<br>
to their needs. However, most certainly, it would be useful not to expect<br>
the users to specialise the results to Z in almost every individual library<br>
that uses Int_Ring (in all probability, Z would be a very common<br>
application of theorems in Int_Ring).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To José Manuel Rodriguez Caballero,</p>
<p>Thank you for providing further information and for the confirmation that<br>
you may be able to accept pull requests. Based on the latest reply by Paulo<br>
Emílio de Vilhena, it seems that it is much more likely that I will be<br>
(potentially) submitting my contributions to GaloisCVC4, because, I<br>
believe, my (potential) contributions are more suitable for a library that<br>
is closely associated with HOL-Algebra than a library in the area of number<br>
theory. However, if any of my contributions will be rejected (for any<br>
reason other than the quality of my proofs or originality) or if I will<br>
ever formalise anything that may be more suitable for your repository, I<br>
will let you know.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
