<p>WORKSHOP SCOPE</p>
<p>ACL2 2013 is the major technical forum for users of the ACL2 theorem<br>
proving system to present research related to the ACL2 theorem prover<br>
and its applications. ACL2 2013 is the eleventh in the series of ACL2<br>
workshops, which occur approximately every 18 months. ACL2 is an<br>
industrial-strength automated reasoning system, the latest in the<br>
Boyer-Moore family of theorem provers. The 2005 ACM Software System<br>
Award was awarded to Boyer, Kaufmann, and Moore for their work in ACL2<br>
and the other theorem provers in the Boyer-Moore family.</p>
<p>ACL2 2013 is a two-day workshop to be held in Laramie, WY, USA on May<br>
30-31, 2013. The workshop will feature technical papers, invited<br>
talks, and rump sessions discussing ongoing research. We invite<br>
submissions of papers on any topic related to ACL2 and its<br>
applications, and we strongly encourage submissions related to other<br>
theorem provers or formal methods that are of interest to the ACL2<br>
community. Suggested topics include but are not limited to the<br>
following:</p>
<p>* software or hardware verification with ACL2,<br>
    * formalizations of mathematics in ACL2,<br>
    * new libraries, tools, and interfaces for ACL2,<br>
    * novel uses of ACL2,<br>
    * experiences with ACL2 in the classroom,<br>
    * reports of and proposals for improvements of ACL2,<br>
    * comparisons with other theorem provers,<br>
    * comparisons with other programming or specification languages,<br>
    * challenge problems and their solutions,<br>
    * foundational issues related to ACL2, and<br>
    * implementations connecting ACL2 with other systems.</p>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format, as directed in<br>
the ACL2 2013 website. Submissions should be prepared in the EPTCS<br>
templates, available from <a href="http://style.eptcs.org">http://style.eptcs.org</a>.</p>
<p>The ACL2 Workshop accepts both long papers (up to sixteen pages) and<br>
extended abstracts (up to two pages). Both categories of papers will<br>
be fully refereed, but only long papers will be included in the final<br>
workshop proceedings. At least one author of each accepted papers must<br>
register for the workshop and give a presentation summarizing the<br>
paper's results. Authors of long papers will have more time to present<br>
their work at the workshop. One of the main advantages of the ACL2<br>
Workshop is that attendees are already knowledgeable about ACL2, its<br>
syntax, its basic commands, and the art of writing models in it. So<br>
authors may assume that readers have this familiarity. The workshop<br>
proceedings will be published as a volume of Electronic Proceedings in<br>
Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).</p>
<p>Many papers presented at the workshop will describe interactions with<br>
the theorem prover. We strongly encourage authors of such papers to<br>
provide ACL2 script files (aka "books") along with instructions for<br>
using these books in ACL2. Such supporting materials should follow the<br>
guidelines at<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/books/index.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/books/index.html</a>. For<br>
accepted papers, these books will be mirrored on the ACL2 home page<br>
and included in the ACL2 book repository.</p>
<p>The workshop will also feature ``rump sessions'', in which<br>
participants can describe ongoing research related to ACL2. Proposals<br>
for rump session presentations, including a title and short abstract,<br>
will be accepted until the workshop.</p>
