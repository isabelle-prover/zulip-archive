<p>ACL2 2015<br>
        13th International Workshop on the ACL2 Theorem Prover<br>
                         and Its Applications</p>
<p>October 1-2, 2015, Austin, Texas, USA<br>
                  (immediately following FMCAD 2015)</p>
<p>Celebrating the 25th anniversary of ACL2</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2015/index.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2015/index.html</a></p>
<p>The 2015 ACL2 Workshop will be held in Austin, Texas, USA, in<br>
conjunction with (and immediately following) FMCAD 2015.  We invite<br>
users of ACL2, users of other theorem provers, and persons interested<br>
in the applications of theorem proving technology to attend.  Keynote<br>
talks will be given by J Strother Moore and John O'Leary.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>Abstract submission:   May 26, 2015<br>
Paper submission:      June  2, 2015<br>
Author notification:   July 17, 2015<br>
Camera ready:          August 17, 2015<br>
Workshop:              October 1-2, 2015</p>
<p>AIMS AND SCOPE</p>
<p>The ACL2 Workshop series is the major technical forum for users of the<br>
ACL2 theorem proving system to present research related to the ACL2<br>
theorem prover and its applications.  ACL2 is an industrial-strength<br>
automated reasoning system, the latest in the Boyer-Moore family of<br>
theorem provers.  The 2005 ACM Software System Award was awarded to<br>
Boyer, Kaufmann, and Moore for their work in ACL2 and the other<br>
theorem provers in the Boyer-Moore family.</p>
<p>ACL2 2015 is a two-day workshop to be held in Austin, Texas, USA, on<br>
October 1-2, 2015.  It is the 13th in the series of ACL2 workshops,<br>
which occur approximately every 18 months.  The workshop will feature<br>
technical papers, invited talks, and rump sessions discussing ongoing<br>
research.  We invite submissions of papers on any topic related to<br>
ACL2 and its applications, and we strongly encourage submissions<br>
related to other theorem provers or formal methods that are of<br>
interest to the ACL2 community.  Suggested topics include but are not<br>
limited to new results in the following areas.</p>
<p>* Software or hardware verification with ACL2<br>
    * Formalizations of mathematics in ACL2<br>
    * Libraries and tools for ACL2<br>
    * User interfaces for ACL2<br>
    * Novel uses of ACL2<br>
    * Experiences with ACL2 in the classroom<br>
    * Reports of and proposals for improvements of ACL2<br>
    * Comparisons with other theorem provers<br>
    * Comparisons with other programming or specification languages<br>
    * Challenge problems and their solutions<br>
    * Foundational issues related to ACL2<br>
    * Implementations connecting ACL2 with other systems</p>
