       15th International Workshop on the ACL2 Theorem Prover<br>
                        and Its Applications</p>
<p>November 5-6, 2018, Austin, Texas, USA</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html</a></p>
<p>The 2018 ACL2 Workshop will be held in Austin, Texas, USA, and it is<br>
co-located with FMCAD (<a href="http://www.fmcad.org/FMCAD18">http://www.fmcad.org/FMCAD18</a>).  We invite<br>
users of ACL2, users of other theorem provers, and persons interested<br>
in the applications of theorem proving technology to attend.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>Abstract submission:   June 30, 2018<br>
Paper submission:      July 7, 2018<br>
Author notification:   August 25, 2018<br>
Camera ready:          September 25, 2018<br>
Workshop:              November 5-6, 2018</p>
<p>AIMS AND SCOPE:</p>
<p>The ACL2 Workshop series is the major technical forum for users of<br>
the ACL2 theorem proving system to present research related to the<br>
ACL2 theorem prover and its applications.  ACL2 is an<br>
industrial-strength automated reasoning system, the latest in the<br>
Boyer-Moore family of theorem provers.  The 2005 ACM Software System<br>
Award was awarded to Boyer, Kaufmann, and Moore for their work in<br>
ACL2 and the other theorem provers in the Boyer-Moore family.</p>
<p>ACL2-2018 is a two-day workshop to be held in Austin, Texas, USA, on<br>
November 5-6, 2018, immediately after FMCAD<br>
(<a href="http://www.fmcad.org/FMCAD18">http://www.fmcad.org/FMCAD18</a>), on the University of Texas campus.<br>
It is the 15th in the series of ACL2 workshops, which occur<br>
approximately every 18 months.  The workshop will feature technical<br>
papers as well as rump sessions that discuss ongoing research.</p>
<p>There will be three invited keynote talks, given by:</p>
<p>Sandip Ray, University of Florida at Gainesville<br>
Alastair Reid, ARM<br>
Sol Swords, Centaur Technology</p>
<p>We invite submissions of papers on any topic related to ACL2 and its<br>
applications, and we strongly encourage submissions related to other<br>
theorem provers or formal methods that are of interest to the ACL2<br>
community.  Suggested topics include but are not limited to new<br>
results in the following areas.</p>
<p>* Software or hardware verification with ACL2<br>
    * Formalizations of mathematics in ACL2<br>
    * Libraries and tools for ACL2<br>
    * User interfaces for ACL2<br>
    * Novel uses of ACL2<br>
    * Experiences with ACL2 in the classroom<br>
    * Reports of and proposals for improvements of ACL2<br>
    * Comparisons with other theorem provers<br>
    * Comparisons with other programming or specification languages<br>
    * Challenge problems and their solutions<br>
    * Foundational issues related to ACL2<br>
    * Implementations connecting ACL2 with other systems</p>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS:</p>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format.  Submissions<br>
should be prepared in the EPTCS templates, available from<br>
<a href="http://style.eptcs.org">http://style.eptcs.org</a> &lt;<a href="http://style.eptcs.org/">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>&gt;, and submitted via<br>
EasyChair.  See the ACL2 2018 website for details.</p>
<p>The ACL2 Workshop accepts both long papers (up to sixteen pages) and<br>
extended abstracts (up to two pages).  Both categories of papers will<br>
require short abstracts to be submitted by the "Abstract submission"<br>
deadline and will be refereed by at least two members of the program<br>
committee.  Accepted submissions in both categories will be included<br>
in the final workshop proceedings, although speaking slots will be<br>
shorter for extended abstracts.  At least one author of each accepted<br>
submission must register for the workshop and give a presentation<br>
summarizing the paper's results.</p>
<p>Extended abstracts should contain at least one or two references so<br>
someone can pursue the abstract topic.  Like long papers, extended<br>
abstracts must describe work that has already been done -- it is not<br>
for ideas for future work.  To discuss future work, we will have a<br>
rump session, and we will later appeal for those topics.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of the ACL2 Workshop is that attendees are<br>
already knowledgeable about ACL2, its syntax, its basic commands, and<br>
the art of writing models in it.  So authors may assume that readers<br>
have this familiarity.  The workshop proceedings will be published as<br>
a volume of Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science<br>
(EPTCS).  Long papers will be published as PDFs, and extended<br>
abstracts will be published as HTML snippets.  Please see the EPTCS<br>
copyright page (<a href="http://copyright.eptcs.org/">http://copyright.eptcs.org/</a>) for a discussion of<br>
licensing.  Please also see the EPTCS LaTeX style file and formatting<br>
instructions (<a href="http://style.eptcs.org">http://style.eptcs.org</a>).</p>
<p>Many papers presented at the workshop will describe interactions with<br>
the theorem prover.  Authors of such papers are required to provide<br>
ACL2 script files (typically, ACL2 books) along with instructions for<br>
their use with ACL2, unless they provide a small text file explaining<br>
why supporting materials are not appropriate (e.g., for a theory<br>
paper).  Such supporting materials should have proper licenses and<br>
copyrights (feel free to email the workshop chairs if you have<br>
questions about that).  The books should be certifiable either with<br>
custom instructions that are clearly provided, or by running the<br>
following shell command in the directory of your contributed books,<br>
where ACL2_DIR denotes your ACL2 sources directory and ACL2 denotes a<br>
recent ACL2 executable.</p>
<p>ACL2_DIR/books/build/cert.pl --acl2 ACL2 *.lisp</p>
<p>Send the supporting materials to Matt Kaufmann,<br>
<a href="mailto:kaufmann@cs.utexas.edu">kaufmann@cs.utexas.edu</a>.</p>
<p>For accepted papers, we will require authors to make these books<br>
available by adding them to the ACL2 Community Books.  (The chairs<br>
may assist in that process, if asked.)  The authors can expect the<br>
reviewers to take the supporting materials into account during the<br>
refereeing process.</p>
<p>The workshop will also feature ``rump sessions'', in which<br>
participants can describe ongoing research related to ACL2.<br>
Proposals for rump session presentations, including a title and short<br>
abstract, may be accepted until the workshop, but preference will<br>
be given to early submissions and subject to available time.</p>

<p>HISTORICAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>The ACL2 Workshop series has previously published with EPTCS in 2011,<br>
2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017.  In other past years: the proceedings<br>
were published with Springer LNCS 6172 in 2010, and ACM digital<br>
library in 2006 and 2009.  The first ACL2 workshop in 1999 resulted<br>
in two books:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Computer-Aided Reasoning: An Approach, Kaufmann, Manolios, Moore,<br>
  Kluwer, (May, 2000)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computer-Aided Reasoning: ACL2 Case Studies, Kaufmann, Manolios,<br>
  Moore (eds), Kluwer, (May, 2000)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ACL2 workshops have been co-located with major conferences in formal<br>
methods in the past: European Joint Conferences on Theory and<br>
Practice of Software (ETAPS) in 2002, Computer-Aided Verification<br>
(CAV) in 2003, Federated Logic Conference (FLoC) in 2006, 2010, and<br>
2014, and Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD) in 2004,<br>
2007, 2011, 2015, and 2018.</p>
