<p>ADG 2018 <br>
12th International Conference on Automated Deduction in Geometry<br>
        Nanning, China, September 11-14, 2018<br>

<p>CALL FOR PAPERS：ADG 2018</p>
<p>About ADG<br>
=========<br>
 ADG is a forum dedicated to the exchange of ideas and views, to the <br>
 presentation of research results and progress, and to the demonstration <br>
 of software tools on the intersection between geometry, computation, <br>
 and automated reasoning. ADG organizes a workshop every two years. <br>
 The previous editions were held in Strasbourg (France) 2016, Coimbra <br>
 (Portugal) 2014, Edinburgh (UK) 2012, Munich (Germany) 2010, Shanghai <br>
 (China) 2008, Pontevedra (Spain) 2006, Gainesville (USA) 2004, Linz <br>
 (Austria) 2002, Zurich (Switzerland) 2000, Beijing (China) 1998, and <br>
 Toulouse (France) 1996.</p>
<p>The twelfth conference ADG 2018 will take place in Nanning, China, from<br>
 September 11 to September 14, 2018, in memory of Wen-tsün Wu, founder <br>
 of the Chinese school of mathematics mechanization. </p>
<p>Aim and Scope <br>
============= <br>
 ADG 2018 aims at gathering researchers, engineers, and others interested<br>
 in exploring methods for automated reasoning and symbolic computation in <br>
 geometry, to discuss theoretical and practical challenges, and to present <br>
 recent research progress and results dedicated (not exhausted) in </p>
<p>- polynomial algebra, invariant and coordinate-free methods, probabilistic, <br>
    synthetic, and logic approaches, techniques for automated geometric <br>
    reasoning from discrete mathematics, combinatorics, and numerics;</p>
<p>- symbolic and numeric methods for geometric computation, geometric constraint <br>
    solving, automated generation/reasoning and manipulation with diagrams;</p>
<p>- design and implementation of geometry software, special-purpose tools, <br>
    automated theorem provers, experimental studies;</p>
<p>- applications of ADG to mechanics, geometric modeling, CAGD/CAD, computer <br>
    vision, robotics, and education.</p>
<p>Important Dates <br>
=============== </p>
<p>- Deadline for extended abstract/full paper submission    May 25, 2018 <br>
  - Notification on all papers                    July 15, 2018 <br>
  - Camera-ready submission                    July 31, 2018 <br>
  - Early registration deadline                    August 1, 2018 <br>
  - Conference taking place                    September 11-14, 2018 </p>
<p>Submission Guideline <br>
====================<br>
 Original research papers in English, including experimental work and <br>
 work in progress, are welcome. The following two types of submissions<br>
 are invited:</p>
<p>(1) Full paper: maximum 20 pages<br>
 (2) Extended abstract addressing the following aspects explicitly:</p>
<p>- Problem: what is the problem/question/objective?<br>
     - Motivation: why do we work on the problem and what is the importance?<br>
     - State of the art: what has been done already on the problem?<br>
     - Contribution: what is the main original contribution?<br>
     - Main idea: what is the main idea underlying the contribution?</p>
<p>Submissions should follow the standard Springer LNCS Proceedings format. <br>
 Electronic submission as PDF is required via EasyChair at </p>
<p><a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adg2018">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adg2018</a>. </p>
<p>If you have any problem with the submission of your paper, or questions <br>
 concerning ADG 2018 or EasyChair, please contact <a href="mailto:chenxiaoyu@buaa.edu.cn">chenxiaoyu@buaa.edu.cn</a>. <br>
 At least one author of each accepted submission must register at ADG 2018. </p>
<p>Refereeing and Publication<br>
==========================<br>
 The submitted contributions will be subject to a summary review by the Program <br>
 Committee, bearing in mind that this first review is mainly for presentation, <br>
 NOT for publication. Digital publication of the full papers/extended abstracts<br>
 accepted for presentation will be available at the conference. The authors of the <br>
 full papers/extended abstracts accepted for presentation at the conference will be <br>
 invited to submit their full and/or revised papers for publication in a formal <br>
 proceedings of ADG 2018 after the conference. The full papers (submitted after the <br>
 conference) will be formally reviewed by PC members and external referees. All <br>
 participants are encouraged to bring along posters on their work (irrespective<br>
 of whether it was presented at the conference or not) for display during ADG 2018.</p>
<p>The accepted full papers will be published as a special issue of some journal or <br>
 in the Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series or Lecture <br>
 Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. The proceedings of ADG 1996, ADG 1998, <br>
 ADG 2000, ADG 2002, ADG 2004, ADG 2006, ADG 2010, ADG 2012, and ADG 2014 appeared<br>
 as LNAI 1360, LNAI 1669, LNAI 2061, LNAI 2930, LNAI 3763, LNAI 4869, LNCS 6877,<br>
 LNAI 7993, and LNAI 9201, respectively.    </p>
