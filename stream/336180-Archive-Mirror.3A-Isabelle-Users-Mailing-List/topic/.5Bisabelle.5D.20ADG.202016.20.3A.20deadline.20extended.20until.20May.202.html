<p>EXTENDED DEADLINE May 2</p>
<p>Overview:</p>
<p>ADG is a forum to exchange ideas and views, to present research<br>
results and progress, and to demonstrate software tools at the<br>
intersection between geometry and automated deduction. The workshop is<br>
held every two years. The previous editions of ADG were held in<br>
Coimbra in 2014, Edinburgh in 2012, Munich in 2010, Shanghai in 2008,<br>
Pontevedra in 2006, Gainesville in 2004, Hagenberg in 2002, Zurich in<br>
2000, Beijing in 1998, and Toulouse in 1996. The 11th edition, ADG<br>
2016, will be held in Strasbourg, France, June 27 – 29, 2016.</p>
<p>Scope:</p>
<p>Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>polynomial algebra, invariant and coordinate-free methods,<br>
probabilistic, synthetic, and logic approaches, techniques for<br>
automated geometric reasoning from discrete mathematics,<br>
combinatorics, and numerics;<br>
symbolic and numeric methods for geometric computation, geometric<br>
constraint solving, automated generation/reasoning and manipulation<br>
with diagrams;<br>
design and implementation of geometry software, special-purpose tools,<br>
automated theorem provers, experimental studies;<br>
applications of ADG to mechanics, geometric modelling, CAGD/CAD,<br>
computer vision, robotics and education.<br>
Submission Guidelines:</p>
<p>We invite the following types of submissions:<br>
Extended abstracts<br>
Full paper (maximum 20 pages)<br>
The extended abstracts must address the following aspects explicitly.<br>
Problem: What is the problem/question/objective?<br>
Motivation: Why do we work on the problem? What is the importance?<br>
State of the Art: What has been done already on the problem?<br>
Contribution: What is the main original contribution?<br>
Main Idea: What is the main idea underlying the contribution?<br>
The submissions should follow the standard Springer LNCS Proceedings format.<br>
Electronic submission as PDF is required via EasyChair (at<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adg2016">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adg2016</a>).<br>
If you have any problems with the submission of your paper, or<br>
questions concerning ADG 2016 or EasyChair, please contact<br>
<a href="mailto:adg2016@easychair.org">adg2016@easychair.org</a>.<br>
Refereeing and Publication:</p>
<p>The submitted contributions will be subject to a summary review by the<br>
Program Committee, bearing in mind that this first review is mainly<br>
for presentation, NOT for publication.<br>
Digital publication of the full papers accepted for presentation will<br>
be available at the workshop.<br>
The authors of the full papers accepted for presentation at the<br>
workshop will be to submit their full and/or revised papers for<br>
publication in a formal proceedings of ADG 2016 after the workshop.<br>
The full papers (submitted after the meeting) will be formally<br>
reviewed by PC members and external referees.<br>
All participants are encouraged to bring along posters on their<br>
geometric work (irrespective of whether it was presented at the<br>
workshop or not) for display during ADG 2016.<br>
The accepted full papers will be published in the Springer Lecture<br>
Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series or Lecture Notes in<br>
Computer Science (LNCS) series.<br>
The proceedings of ADG 1996, ADG 1998, ADG 2000, ADG 2002, and ADG<br>
2004, ADG 2006,  ADG 2010, ADG 2012 and ADG 2014 appeared as LNAI<br>
1360, LNAI 1669, LNAI 2061, LNAI 2930, LNAI 3763, LNAI 4869, LNCS<br>
6877, LNAI 7993 and LNAI 9201 respectively.<br>

<p>Title: Geometrisation of Geometry</p>
<p>Abstract: Coherent logic (CL) or geometry logic is a (semi-decidable)<br>
fragment of FOL that can be considered to be an extension of<br>
resolution logic. CL is suitable for formalization and automation of<br>
various mathematical theories, including geometry. This talk will give<br>
an overview of developments in geometry based on CL: automated theorem<br>
provers for CL, CL-based formalizations of geometry, CL-based proof<br>
representation for geometry, links between CL and geometry<br>
construction problems, links between CL and geometrical illustrations,<br>
etc.</p>
<p>Dominique Michelucci, University of Burgundy.</p>
<p>Title: Solving Constraints without Equations, Why and How</p>
<p>Abstract: Classically, when we solve geometric constraints, the latter<br>
are represented with mathematical equations, or inequalities. These<br>
equations or inequalities are represented explicitly, with trees or<br>
DAGs or polynomials, etc. So it is easy to symbolically compute<br>
derivatives, etc. It is possible to make proofs of geometric theorems.</p>
<p>But, recently, we meet more and more frequently problems for which<br>
equations are not available for many reasons, e.g. when the shape is<br>
the result of a procedure (subdivision surfaces; fractals). In this<br>
new framework, shapes or geometric figures are the results of the<br>
evaluation of black box procedures / algorithms / subprograms, feed<br>
with some parameters. These programs contain if-then-else constructs,<br>
loops, they compute fixed points, they call ODE and PDE solvers. Some<br>
parameters are free : how to compute their values to satisfy specified<br>
constraints ? How to solve without equations ?</p>
