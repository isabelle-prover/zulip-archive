Title: Challenges in analyzing binary programs<br>
Speaker: Hassen Saidi (SRI Computer Science Laboratory)</p>
<p>Abstract: Program analysis is an enough challenging task<br>
when source code is available. It is even more challenging when<br>
neither the source code nor debug information is present.  The<br>
analysis task is further hindered when the available<br>
binary code has been obfuscated to prevent the analysis from being<br>
carried out.  In this presentation, we review the main challenges when<br>
analyzing binary programs and explore techniques for recovery of<br>
information that allows program understanding and<br>
reverse-engineering. We illustrate these techniques on the Conficker<br>
worm that has plagued the Internet in the past few months.</p>
<p>Title: Contracts for the component-based design of embedded and distributed<br>
       systems <br>
Speaker: Susanne Graf</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed, real-time and embedded systems usually multiple<br>
layers from the high-level functional layers down to the interaction with<br>
hardware. The design of such systems leads to complex hierachical<br>
architectures with components subject to multiple constraints.  The BIP<br>
composition operators allow specifying complex multi-party interactions<br>
between components in a hierarchical fashion, and by separating component<br>
behaviour and interaction between components. It is expressive enough to<br>
describe the interaction of a set of peers so as to abstract lower layers as<br>
composition operator represented by a set of connectors and their<br>
interactions.  We define a notion of contract associated with components<br>
which strictly separates an expectation which it may have on the<br>
environment, called &lt;&lt;assumption&gt;&gt;, and a &lt;&lt;promise&gt;&gt; which is behaviour of<br>
the component under consideration that the environment may take for granted<br>
as long as it respects the component's expectation. Contrary to most notions<br>
of contracts, it does not express the assumptions directly on the<br>
component's interface but as a constraint on it's peers to which it is<br>
connected by a rich connectors as in BIP.  We do not intend contracts to be<br>
used for compositional verification but rather for compositional design and<br>
independent implementation of components. Assumptions allow simplifying<br>
component implementations by relying on properties ensured by the<br>
environment. An interesting of our kind of contracts is to allow expressing<br>
also assumptions which need not to be expressible on the component's<br>
interface. This means that the component interfaces need not to be<br>
"artificially" enriched with analysis related attributes. Moreover,<br>
knowledge about peers and about lower layers is clearly separated, and<br>
specifications of lower layers, represented by a set of connectors, may be<br>
refined independently of components.  So far, we have shown that this<br>
general contract framework is indeed a generalisation of all existing<br>
notions of interface specifications or contracts that we have studied and<br>
proposed some general methodology. Here, we propose also a set of useful<br>
concepts which can be used to actually express contracts for components<br>
which must comply to safey and progress constraints.</p>
<p>Title: Continuous Model.Driven Engineering - Formal Methods at the<br>
       Application Level <br>
Speaker: Bernhard Steffen</p>
<p>Abstract: Agility is a must, in particular for business-critical<br>
applications.  Complex systems and processes must be continuously updated in<br>
order to meet the ever changing market conditions. Continuous Model Driven<br>
Engineering addresses this need by by continuously involving the<br>
customer/application expert throughout the whole systems? life cycle<br>
including maintenance and evolution. Conceptually, it is based on the One<br>
Thing Approach (OTA), which combines the simplicity of the waterfall<br>
development paradigm with a maximum of agility. The key to OTA is to view<br>
the whole development process simply as a complex hierarchical and<br>
interactive decision process, where each stakeholder, including the<br>
application expert, is allowed to continuously place his/her decisions in<br>
term of constraints. Thus semantically, at any time, the state of the<br>
development or evolution process can simply be regarded as the current set<br>
of constraints, and each development or evolution step can be regarded<br>
simply as a transformation of this very constraint set. This approach,<br>
conceptually, allows one 1) to monitor globally and at any time the<br>
consistency of the development or evolution process simply via constraint<br>
checking, and 2) to impose a kind of decision hierarchy by mapping areas of<br>
ompetencies to roles of individuals, in order to identify required actions<br>
in case of constraint violation. The essence and power of this approach,<br>
which is technically supported by the jABC development and execution<br>
framework, will be illustrated along real life application scenarios.</p>
<p>Title: Why - an intermediate language for deductive program verification<br>
Speaker: Jean Christophe Filliatre</p>
<p>Abstract: This tutorial is an introduction to the Why tool, an intermediate<br>
language for deductive program verification. The purpose of the Why tool is<br>
two-fold: first, it computes weakest preconditions for a small alias-free<br>
programming language, which is designed to be the target of other<br>
verification tools for languages such as C or Java; second, it translates<br>
verification conditions into the native languages of several existing<br>
theorem provers, either automatic such as Simplify, Alt-Ergo, Yices, Z3,<br>
etc. or interactive such as Coq, PVS, Isabelle, etc. Why is currently used<br>
in several verification frameworks such as Caduceus, Krakatoa, or Frama-C.</p>
