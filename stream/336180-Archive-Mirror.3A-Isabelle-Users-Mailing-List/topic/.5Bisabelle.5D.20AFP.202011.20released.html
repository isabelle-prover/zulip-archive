AFP 2011 has now been released. This means all entries available from the front page [http://afp.sf.net] now work by default with Isabelle2011.</p>
<p>The AFP now has 88 entries, in total encompassing over 500,000 lines of formal proof development.</p>
<p>The release makes the following two entries available from the front page that were previously accessible as development versions only.</p>
<p>Functional Binomial Queues<br>
by René Neumann</p>
<p>[http://afp.sf.net/entries/Binomial-Queues.shtml]</p>
<p>Priority queues are an important data structure and efficient implementations of them are crucial. We implement a functional variant of binomial queues in Isabelle/HOL and show its functional correctness. A verification against an abstract reference specification of priority queues has also been attempted, but could not be achieved to the full extent.</p>
<p>Lower Semincontinous Functions<br>
by Bogdan Grechuk</p>
<p>[http://afp.sf.net/entries/Lower_Semicontinuous.shtml]</p>
<p>We define the notions of lower and upper semicontinuity for functions from a metric space to the extended real line. We prove that a function is both lower and upper semicontinuous if and only if it is continuous. We also give several equivalent characterizations of lower semicontinuity. In particular, we prove that a function is lower semicontinuous if and only if its epigraph is a closed set. Also, we introduce the notion of the lower semicontinuous hull of an arbitrary function and prove its basic properties.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
