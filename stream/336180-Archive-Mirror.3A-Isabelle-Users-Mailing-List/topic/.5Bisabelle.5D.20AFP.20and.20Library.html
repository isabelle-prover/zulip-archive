Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>You have concerted many if not all AFP sessions that use theories from Library <br>
such that they are now based on the Library image. This means that every time a <br>
Library theory changes, sonething like half the AFP needs to be rebuilt even <br>
though only a few of the AFP sessions may import the modified Library theory. <br>
This happens fairly frequently and I wonder what your rational for the change was.</p>

<p>This is indeed the traditional explanation for providing various<br>
"library" images in Isabelle and using them in the applications, e.g. in<br>
AFP. In recent years we have seen a trend of increasing that quite<br>
substantially.</p>
<p>In particular, Isabelle2017 will have the following important starting<br>
points for applications:</p>
<p>HOL<br>
  HOL-Library<br>
  HOL-Computational-Algebra<br>
  HOL-Analysis | HOL-Algebra | HOL-Number_Theory | HOL-Nonstandard-Analysis</p>
<p>After changing any of them, there will be substantial follow-up build<br>
times of other sessions depending on them. This is a natural consequence<br>
of providing good library sessions and getting lots of applications on top.</p>
<p>There is a second aspect for the HOL-Library image only: it is somehow<br>
the canonical supplement to the main HOL image.</p>
<p>Thus there are occasional tendencies in the applications to provide a<br>
session "Foo" and also "Foo-Library" that "merges" the HOL-Library<br>
aspect later on, even after building a whole stack of sessions. This<br>
complicates session specifications and causes further multiplication of<br>
build times. Since we cannot really merge session images, the main<br>
approach to avoid the problem is to put HOL-Library at the very start of<br>
the session dependencies and to remove the Foo-Library variant eventually.</p>

<p>This sounds more like the file-based build model of Coq, but without<br>
actual "object files" to store intermediate states.</p>
<p>It is a theoretical question if we can move over there, practically we<br>
can't change the fundamental approache on the spot and expect that<br>
things still work afterwards.</p>
<p>(I have occasionally discussed the inherent differences of the build<br>
model with the Coq guys, and am still convinced that our tradition of<br>
doing it scales better. Empirical proof: size and complexity of AFP today.)</p>
<p>I do agree that in the past 1-2 years there is an increasing pain to be<br>
felt in maintaining Isabelle + AFP, up to the point that less<br>
maintenance and fewer important reforms happen. In the past 3 years, the<br>
size of Isabelle + AFP material has doubled, while build and test<br>
infrastructure had stagnated since 2012. Only recently this has improved<br>
again (but I don't mean the Jenkins setup, which I simply ignore).</p>
<p>What would greatly help is to have proper time measurement for nightly<br>
builds of AFP within the regular Isabelle cronjob, with its persistent<br>
database support in the background (see also<br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/devel/build_status">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/devel/build_status</a>). The software is all there<br>
in Isabelle/Scala; lacking is only some half-decent test hardware (e.g.<br>
a cloud node with 8 cores + 64 GB should be sufficient).</p>
<p>At some point, "isabelle build" could use the persistent timing<br>
information from the database to make better scheduling of big builds,<br>
including adhoc changes to the actual session graph (e.g. changing<br>
parent sessions vs. session imports).</p>

<p>Thank you for this constructive suggestion. What would happen if there was an <br>
AFP_Library with only those Library theories that are needed at least twice in <br>
the AFP? I analyzed the sources. Only half the theories in Library are used at <br>
least twice in the AFP. Then I analyzed the last 123 builds on Jenkins: 13 of <br>
them did not involve any theory in AFP_Library and the AFP build would have <br>
completed much more quickly (often in a few minutes rater than 1 hour). There is <br>
an argument here for a dedicated AFP_Library.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Some more notes on this.</p>
<p>The present reform of session-qualified theory names in Isabelle2017<br>
still allows old-fashioned unqualified imports from existing parent<br>
session images. It eases the upgrade of existing project sources, but it<br>
means that the parent session structure still has an impact on the<br>
theory name space.</p>
<p>Right after the Isabelle2017 release we can get rid of that, and parent<br>
sessions vs. imported sessions (keyword 'sessions' in the ROOT) become<br>
interchangeable -- as far as logical theory names are concerned (not the<br>
time for loading theories).</p>
<p>This opens many possibilities to rearrange things, either statically in<br>
the ROOT files, or dynamically by a smarter version of "isabelle build".<br>
For example, all AFP sessions with &lt; 30s runtime could be built in one<br>
big ML process, for improved parallel performance and to avoid loading<br>
the base session many times.</p>
<p>There are many more possibilities, especially with full timing<br>
information of all sessions, theories, commands available to the build<br>
process.</p>
