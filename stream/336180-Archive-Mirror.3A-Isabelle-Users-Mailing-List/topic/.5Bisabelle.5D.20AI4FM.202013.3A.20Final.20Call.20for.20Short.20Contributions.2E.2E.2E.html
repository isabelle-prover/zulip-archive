<p>General</p>
<hr>
<p>This workshop will bring together researchers from formal methods and AI;<br>
it will address the<br>
issue of how AI can be used to support the formal software development<br>
process, including modelling<br>
and proof. Previous AI4FM workshops have included a mix of industrial and<br>
academic participants<br>
and we anticipate attracting a similarly diverse audience.</p>
<p>Industrial use of formal methods is certainly increasing but, in order to<br>
make it more mainstream,<br>
the cost of applying formal methods, in terms of mathematical skill level<br>
and development time,<br>
must be reduced â€” we believe that AI can help with these issues.</p>
<p>Rigorous software development using formal methods allows the construction<br>
of an accurate characterisation<br>
of a problem domain that is firmly based on mathematics; by applying<br>
standard mathematical analyses, these<br>
methods can be used to prove that systems satisfy formal specifications. A<br>
recent ACM computing survey paper<br>
describes over sixty industrial projects and discusses the effect formal<br>
methods have on time, cost and quality.<br>
It shows that with tools backed by mature theory, formal methods are<br>
becoming cost effective and their use is<br>
easier to justify, not as an academic exercise or legal requirement, but as<br>
part of a business case. Furthermore,<br>
the use of such formal methods is no longer confined to safety critical<br>
systems: the list of industrial partners<br>
in the EU-funded DEPLOY project is one indication of this broader use. Most<br>
methods tend to fit a ``posit-and-prove''<br>
paradigm where the user posits a development step (expressed in terms of<br>
specifications of yet-to-be-realised components)<br>
that has to be justified by proofs. The associated properties that must be<br>
verified are often called proof obligations (POs)<br>
or verification conditions. In most cases, such proofs require mechanical<br>
support by theorem provers.</p>
<p>One can distinguish between automatic and interactive provers, where the<br>
latter are generally more expressive but require<br>
user interaction. AI has had a large impact on the development of provers.<br>
In fact, some of the first AI applications were<br>
in theorem proving and all theorem provers now contain heuristics to reduce<br>
the search space that can be attributed to AI.<br>
Nevertheless, theorem proving research and (pure) AI research have diverged<br>
and theorem proving is barely considered<br>
to be AI-related anymore.</p>
<p>PhD Bursary</p>
<hr>
<p>Formal Methods Europe (FME) has kindly agreed to cover the registration fee<br>
for a limited number of PhD students. A proviso<br>
for receiving this bursary is that the student presents at the workshop.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>We encourage submissions presenting work in progress, tools under<br>
development, and PhD projects, in order that the<br>
workshop can become a forum for active dialogue between the groups<br>
involved in  theorem provers, formal methods and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Particular areas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of machine learning to support interactive theorem proving;</li>
<li>The use of machine learning to enhance automated theorem proving;</li>
<li>The development of search heuristics;</li>
<li>
<p>The us of AI for term synthesis, invariant generation, lemma discovery<br>
and concept invention;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of AI for counter-example generation;</p>
</li>
<li>The use of AI to support and guide the formal modelling process;</li>
<li>
<p>The role of AI planning for formal systems developments, from<br>
requirements to the end product (including software and hardware);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interplay between reasoning and modelling and the role of AI in this<br>
framework;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ontologies in the formal engineering process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission</p>
<hr>
<p>The main aim for the workshop is discussion, thus submissions<br>
do not need to be original. Extended versions of submissions<br>
may have been published previously, or submitted concurrently<br>
with or after AI4FM 2013 to another workshop, conference or a journal.</p>
<p>Submission is by email to:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:ai4fm2013@ai4fm.org">ai4fm2013@ai4fm.org</a></p>
<p>Please submit an abstract up to 3 pages in a PDF format. The extended<br>
abstracts will be handed out to all participants, and will be made into a<br>
technical report prior to the workshop.</p>
<p>Please indicate if you are student and would like to apply for the FME<br>
bursary.</p>
<p>Acceptance for presentation at the workshop will be made by the<br>
organisers based on relevance to the workshop.</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
