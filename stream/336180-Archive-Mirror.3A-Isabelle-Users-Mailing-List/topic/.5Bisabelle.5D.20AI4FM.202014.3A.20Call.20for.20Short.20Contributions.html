    the use of AI in Formal Methods</p>

<p>Singapore, 12th or 13th May, 2014<br>
     In association with FM 2014</p>
<hr>
<p>--- First Call for Contributions ---</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
<hr>
<p>Submission deadline: March 01, 2014<br>
Notification of acceptance: March 08, 2014<br>
Final version due: April 22, 2014<br>
Workshop: May 12th or 13th, 2014</p>
<p>General</p>
<hr>
<p>This workshop will bring together researchers from formal methods, <br>
automated reasoning and AI; it will address the issue of how AI can <br>
be used to support the formal software development process, including <br>
requirement analysis, modelling and proof. Previous AI4FM workshops <br>
have included a mix of industrial and academic participants and we <br>
anticipate attracting a similarly diverse audience. </p>
<p>Rigorous software development using formal methods allows the construction <br>
of an accurate characterisation of a problem domain that is firmly based <br>
on mathematics; by applying standard mathematical analyses, these methods <br>
can be used to prove that systems satisfy formal specifications. Research <br>
has shown that with tools backed by mature theory, formal methods are <br>
becoming cost effective and their use is easier to justify, not as an <br>
academic exercise, legal requirement or niche markets -- but as part of <br>
a business case. However, while industrial use of formal methods is <br>
increasing, in order to make it more mainstream, the cost of applying <br>
formal methods, in terms of mathematical skill level and development <br>
time, must still be reduced. We believe that AI can help with these <br>
issues.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>We encourage submissions presenting work in progress, tools under<br>
development, and PhD projects, in order that the workshop can become <br>
a forum for active dialogue between the groups involved in  automated <br>
reasoning, formal methods and artificial intelligence.  Particular <br>
areas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The use of AI and automated reasoning to support and guide the formal <br>
  modelling process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of AI and automated reasoning in the requirement capture process.</p>
</li>
<li>The use of AI to reuse formal models, programs and proofs.</li>
<li>The use of machine learning to support interactive theorem proving.</li>
<li>The use of machine learning to enhance automated theorem proving.</li>
<li>The development of search heuristics.</li>
<li>
<p>The use of AI for term synthesis, invariant generation, lemma discovery <br>
  and concept invention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of AI for counter-example generation.</p>
</li>
<li>The use of constraint solvers in formal methods. </li>
<li>
<p>The role of AI planning for formal systems developments, from requirements <br>
  to the end product (including software and hardware).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interplay between reasoning and modelling and the role of AI in this <br>
  framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ontologies in the formal engineering process.</p>
</li>

<p>Submission</p>
<hr>
<p>The main aim for the workshop is discussion, thus submissions do not <br>
need to be original. Extended versions of submissions may have been <br>
published previously, or submitted concurrently with or after AI4FM <br>
2014 to another workshop, conference or a journal.</p>
<p>Submission is by email to:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:ai4fm2014@ai4fm.org">ai4fm2014@ai4fm.org</a></p>
<p>Please submit an abstract up to 3 pages in a PDF format. The extended <br>
abstracts will be handed out to all participants, and will be made <br>
into a technical report prior to the workshop. </p>
<p>Acceptance for presentation at the workshop will be made by the <br>
organisers based on relevance to the workshop.</p>
