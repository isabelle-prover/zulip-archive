<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br>
================</p>
<p>ARSPA-WITS'09</p>
<p>Joint Workshop on<br>
Automated Reasoning for Security Protocol Analysis <br>
and<br>
Issues in the Theory of Security</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avantssar.eu/arspa-wits09/">http://www.avantssar.eu/arspa-wits09/</a></p>
<p>March 28-29, 2009<br>
York, UK</p>
<p>Affiliated with ETAPS 2009</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>
================</p>
<p>Papers due:   January  09 <br>
Notification: February 06<br>
Final papers: April    10 </p>
<p>SCOPE<br>
======</p>
<p>The aim of the joint workshop ARSPA-WITS'09 is to provide a forum for<br>
continued activity in different areas of computer security, bringing<br>
computer security researchers in closer contact with the ETAPS<br>
community and giving ETAPS attendees an opportunity to talk to experts<br>
in computer security, on the one hand, and contribute to bridging the<br>
gap between logical methods and computer security foundations, on the<br>
other.</p>
<p>We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security<br>
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions<br>
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in<br>
new results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques<br>
and tools for the formal specification and analysis of security<br>
protocols. We thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work<br>
and on work in progress.</p>
<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Automated reasoning techniques, Composition issues, Formal<br>
specification, Foundations of verification, Information flow analysis,<br>
Language-based security, Logic-based design, Program transformation,<br>
Security models, Static analysis, Statistical methods, Tools, Trust<br>
management</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>Access and resource usage control, Authentication, Availability and<br>
denial of service, Covert channels, Confidentiality, Integrity and<br>
privacy, Intrusion detection, Malicious code, Mobile code, Mutual<br>
distrust, Privacy, Security policies, Security protocols</p>
<p>ARSPA is a series of workshops on Automated Reasoning for Security<br>
Protocol Analysis, bringing together researchers and practitioners<br>
from both the security and the formal methods communities, from<br>
academia and industry, who are working on developing and applying<br>
automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal specification<br>
and analysis of security protocols. The first two ARSPA workshops were<br>
held as satellite events of the 2nd International Joint Conference on<br>
Automated Reasoning (IJCAR'04) and of the 32nd International<br>
Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP'05),<br>
respectively. ARSPA then joined forces with the workshop FCS<br>
(Foundations of Computer Security): FCS-ARSPA'06 was affiliated with<br>
LICS'06, in the context of FLoC'06, and FCS-ARSPA'07 was affiliated<br>
with LICS'07 and ICALP'07.</p>
<p>WITS is the official annual workshop organised by the IFIP WG 1.7 on<br>
"Theoretical Foundations of Security Analysis and Design", established<br>
to promote the investigation on the theoretical foundations of<br>
security, discovering and promoting new areas of application of<br>
theoretical techniques in computer security and supporting the<br>
systematic use of formal techniques in the development of security<br>
related applications. This is the ninth meeting in the series.  In<br>
2008, ARSPA and WITS joined with the workshop on Foundations of<br>
Computer Security FCS for a joint workshop FCS-ARSPA-WITS'08<br>
associated with LICS 2008 and CSF 21.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION<br>
===========================</p>
<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must<br>
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.</p>
<p>The post-proceedings of the workshop will be published in the Springer<br>
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.</p>
<p>To preserve ARSPA-WITS's tradition of being an open forum, authors may<br>
decide whether they would like a revised version of a paper to appear<br>
in the post-proceedings. <br>
Authors should clearly state at time of submission whether a paper is<br>
intended for presentation only or also for publication: this should be<br>
stated at the end of the abstract of the paper. <br>
Papers for presentation only may substantially overlap other (cited)<br>
work of the authors.  This choice will not affect the selection<br>
procedure in any other way.</p>
<p>Submissions should be at most 15 pages (a4paper, 11pt), including<br>
references, written in the style of LNCS (<a href="http://www.springer.com/lncs">www.springer.com/lncs</a>).<br>
Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately.<br>
Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication<br>
in the final version - for example details of proofs - may be placed<br>
in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit.</p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit their papers electronically, as portable<br>
document format (pdf) or postscript (ps); please, do not send files<br>
formatted for work processing packages (e.g., Microsoft Word or<br>
Wordperfect files).</p>
<p>The only mechanism for paper submissions is via the electronic<br>
submission web-site powered by easychair:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arspawits09">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arspawits09</a></p>
<p>Please, follow the instructions given there.</p>
