<p>Abstract due: December 5, 2009<br>
Papers due: December 13, 2009<br>
Notification: January 21, 2010</p>
<p>SCOPE<br>
=====</p>
<p>Computer security is an established field of computer science of both<br>
theoretical and practical significance. In recent years, there has<br>
been increasing interest in logic-based foundations for various<br>
methods in computer security, including the formal specification,<br>
analysis and design of security protocols and their applications, the<br>
formal definition of various aspects of security such as access<br>
control mechanisms, mobile code security and denial-of-service<br>
attacks, and the modeling of information flow and its application to<br>
confidentiality policies, system composition, and covert channel<br>
analysis.</p>
<p>We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security<br>
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions<br>
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in<br>
new results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques<br>
and tools for the formal specification and analysis of security<br>
protocols. We thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work<br>
and on work in progress.</p>
<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Automated reasoning techniques, Composition issues, Formal<br>
specification, Foundations of verification, Information flow analysis,<br>
Language-based security, Logic-based design, Program transformation,<br>
Security models, Static analysis, Statistical methods, Tools, Trust<br>
management</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>Access and resource usage control, Authentication, Availability and<br>
denial of service, Covert channels, Confidentiality, Integrity and<br>
privacy, Intrusion detection, Malicious code, Mobile code, Mutual<br>
distrust, Privacy, Security policies, Security protocols</p>
<p>ARSPA is a series of workshops on Automated Reasoning for Security<br>
Protocol Analysis, bringing together researchers and practitioners<br>
from both the security and the formal methods communities, from<br>
academia and industry, who are working on developing and applying<br>
automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal specification<br>
and analysis of security protocols. The first two ARSPA workshops were<br>
held as satellite events of the 2nd International Joint Conference on<br>
Automated Reasoning (IJCAR'04) and of the 32nd International<br>
Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP'05),<br>
respectively. ARSPA then joined forces with the workshop FCS<br>
(Foundations of Computer Security): FCS-ARSPA'06 was affiliated with<br>
LICS'06, in the context of FLoC'06, and FCS-ARSPA'07 was affiliated<br>
with LICS'07 and ICALP'07.</p>
<p>WITS is the official annual workshop organised by the IFIP WG 1.7 on<br>
"Theoretical Foundations of Security Analysis and Design", established<br>
to promote the investigation on the theoretical foundations of<br>
security, discovering and promoting new areas of application of<br>
theoretical techniques in computer security and supporting the<br>
systematic use of formal techniques in the development of security<br>
related applications. This is the tenth meeting in the series.</p>
<p>In 2008, ARSPA and WITS joined with the workshop on Foundations of<br>
Computer Security FCS for a joint workshop FCS-ARSPA-WITS'08<br>
associated with LICS 2008 and CSF 21. In 2009, ARSPA and WITS joined<br>
forces for the joint workshop ARSPA-WITS'09, which was associated with<br>
ETAPS 2009.  In 2010, ARSPA and WITS will again join forces for the<br>
joint workshop ARSPA-WITS'10, which is associated with ETAPS 2010. <br>
The aim of the joint workshop ARSPA-WITS'10 is to provide a forum for<br>
continued activity in different areas of computer security, bringing<br>
computer security researchers in closer contact with the ETAPS<br>
community and giving ETAPS attendees an opportunity to talk to experts<br>
in computer security, on the one hand, and contribute to bridging the<br>
gap between logical methods and computer security foundations, on the<br>
other.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION<br>
==========================</p>
<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must<br>
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop. To<br>
preserve ARSPA-WITS's tradition of being an open forum, authors may<br>
decide whether they would like a revised version of a paper to appear<br>
in the post-proceedings. Authors should clearly state at time of<br>
submission whether a paper is intended for presentation only or also<br>
for publication: this should be stated at the end of the abstract of<br>
the paper. Papers for presentation only may substantially overlap<br>
other (cited) work of the authors. This choice will not affect the<br>
selection procedure in any other way.</p>
<p>Submissions should be at most 16 page long excluding references and<br>
appendices with a total length not exceeding 20 pages. Manuscripts<br>
should be written in the Springer LNCS style available at the URL<br>
<a href="http://www.springer.com/lncs">http://www.springer.com/lncs</a>. If your paper does not fit into this<br>
page limit, please contact the Program Chairs before submitting your<br>
paper.</p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit their papers electronically, as portable<br>
document format (pdf) or postscript (ps); please, do not send files<br>
formatted for work processing packages (e.g., Microsoft Word or<br>
Wordperfect files). The only mechanism for paper submissions is via<br>
the electronic submission web-site powered by EasyChair:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arspawits10">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arspawits10</a></p>
<p>The post-proceedings of the workshop will be published by in the<br>
series.  A special issue of the Journal of Computer Security, with an<br>
additional reviewing process, is also planned.</p>
