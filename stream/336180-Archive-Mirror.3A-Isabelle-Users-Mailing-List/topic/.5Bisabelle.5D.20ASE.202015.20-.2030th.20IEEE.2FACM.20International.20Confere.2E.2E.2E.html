<p>Three categories of submissions are solicited:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Technical Research Papers should describe innovative research in<br>
automating software development activities or automated support to users<br>
engaged in such activities. They should describe a novel contribution to<br>
the field and should carefully support claims of novelty with citations<br>
to the relevant literature. Where a submission builds upon previous work<br>
of the author(s), the novelty of the new contribution must be clearly<br>
described with respect to the previous work. Papers should also clearly<br>
discuss how the results were validated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience Papers should describe a significant experience in applying<br>
automated software engineering technology and should carefully identify<br>
and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or<br>
practitioners can benefit from the experience. Of special interest are<br>
experience papers that report on industrial applications of automated<br>
software engineering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Ideas Papers should describe novel research directions in<br>
automating software development activities or automated support to users<br>
engaged in such activities. New ideas submissions are intended to<br>
describe well- defined research ideas that are at an early stage of<br>
investigation and may not be fully validated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Submission:</p>
<p>All submissions must come in PDF format and conform, at time of<br>
submission, to the IEEE Formatting Guidelines. For details and<br>
templates see:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a></p>
<p>Technical Research Papers and Experience Papers must not exceed 10<br>
pages (including figures and appendices) plus up to 2 pages that<br>
contain ONLY references. New Ideas Papers must not exceed 6 pages<br>
(including figures, appendices AND references). Submissions that do<br>
not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines<br>
will be desk-rejected without review. All submissions must be in<br>
English.</p>
<p>Papers submitted to ASE 2015 must not have been previously published<br>
and must not be under review for publication elsewhere. All papers<br>
that conform to submission guidelines will be peer-reviewed by members<br>
of the Program Committee and members of the Expert Review Panel.<br>
Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, soundness,<br>
relevance, importance of contribution, evaluation, quality of<br>
presentation and appropriate comparison to related work. Note that<br>
the Program Committee may re-assign a submission into a different<br>
category than the one it is submitted to if it decides that it is a<br>
better fit for that category.</p>
<p>Acceptance:</p>
<p>All accepted papers will be published by IEEE, provided that at least<br>
one author of each accepted paper registers as a full registration for<br>
the conference and presents the paper. Failure to do so may result in<br>
the paper being pulled out of the Digital Library.</p>
<p>Program Chairs:<br>
Lars Grunske, University of Stuttgart, Germany<br>
Michael Whalen, University of Minnesota, USA</p>
<p>=== TOOL DEMONSTRATIONS ==============================================</p>
<p><a href="http://ase2015.unl.edu/#tab-demos">http://ase2015.unl.edu/#tab-demos</a></p>
<p>Automated software engineering consists of automating processes related<br>
to requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance of<br>
software systems. Automating these processes in the form of tools<br>
facilitates better productivity and improve the overall quality of software.<br>
The tool demonstrations track provides an opportunity for researchers and<br>
practitioners to present and discuss their most recent advances,<br>
experiences, and challenges in the field of automated software engineering.</p>
<p>ASE 2015 solicits high-quality submissions for its tool demonstrations<br>
track. We invite submission on tools that are either (a) early research<br>
prototypes or (b) mature tools, with a significant novel Improvement,<br>
and that have not yet been commercialized. Submissions should highlight<br>
the underlying scientific contributions, engineering ingenuity,<br>
applicability to a broader software engineering audience, and/or potential<br>
for or realization of scaling the tool. In contrast to a Technical Research<br>
track paper intended to provide details of a novel automated software<br>
engineering technique, a tool demonstration paper should indicate how the<br>
technique has been implemented as a functioning tool and how that tool<br>
should be used by its intended audience. We encourage authors of papers<br>
submitted to the Technical Research track to submit an accompanying tool<br>
demonstration paper.</p>
<p>The tool demonstration program committee will review each submission to<br>
assess the relevance and quality of the proposed tool demonstration<br>
in terms of the usefulness of the tool, its ease of use by its intended<br>
users, its presentation quality, and a limited, but appropriate discussion<br>
of related tools. Accepted tool demonstrations will be allocated 5 pages<br>
in the conference proceedings: 4 pages for prose and up to one additional<br>
page for references. Authors of accepted tool demonstrations papers<br>
are required to give a presentation (read: live demo) of the tool during<br>
the conference.  There will also be an area open to attendees at scheduled<br>
times during the conference during which demonstrators will also present<br>
their work in an more informal manner.</p>
<p>Tool Demonstration Co-Chairs:</p>
<p>Andrew Begel, Microsoft Research, USA<br>
Alessandra Gorla, IMDEA Software Institute, Spain</p>
<p>=== WORKSHOPS ========================================================</p>
<p><a href="http://ase2015.unl.edu/#tab-workshops">http://ase2015.unl.edu/#tab-workshops</a></p>
<p>A workshop co-located with the ASE 2015 conference should provide an<br>
opportunity for exchanging views, advancing ideas, and discussing<br>
preliminary results on topics related to Automated Software<br>
Engineering. Workshops may also serve as platforms to nurture new<br>
scientific communities. Workshops should not be seen as an alternative<br>
forum for presenting full research papers. The workshops co-located<br>
with the conference will be organized before the main conference<br>
(Monday, Tuesday). The organizers will decide the exact day after the<br>
proposals have been reviewed and accepted. A workshop may last one or<br>
two days.</p>
<p>Workshop Co-Chairs:</p>
<p>David Lo, Singapore Management University, Singapore<br>
Anita Sarma, University of Nebraska—Lincoln, USA</p>
<p>=== TUTORIALS ========================================================</p>
<p><a href="http://ase2015.unl.edu/#tab-tutorials">http://ase2015.unl.edu/#tab-tutorials</a></p>
<p>Tutorials address a wide range of mature topics from theoretical<br>
foundations to practical techniques and tools for automated software<br>
engineering. Tutorials are intended to provide independent instruction<br>
on a relevant theme; therefore, no commercial or sales-oriented<br>
proposals will be accepted. The tutorials will be organized either on<br>
the Monday or Tuesday before the main conference. The general chair<br>
and organizers will decide the exact dates after all proposals have<br>
been reviewed and accepted.</p>
<p>Tutorial Co-Chairs:</p>
<p>Henry Muccini,University of L'Aquila, Italy<br>
Tien Nguyen, Iowa State University, USA</p>
<p>=== DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM ===============================================</p>
<p><a href="http://ase2015.unl.edu/#tab-doctoral">http://ase2015.unl.edu/#tab-doctoral</a></p>
<p>The goal of the ASE 2015 Doctoral Symposium is to provide a supportive<br>
yet questioning setting in which the PhD students have an opportunity<br>
to present and discuss their research with other researchers in the<br>
ASE community. The symposium aims a<br>
