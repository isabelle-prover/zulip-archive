<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>
  Colin O'Halloran (D-RisQ &amp; the University of Oxford)<br>
  Don Sannella (Contemplate &amp; the University of Edinburgh)</p>
<p>SPONSORS<br>
  Formal Methods Europe (FME)<br>
  The Scottish Informatics &amp; Computer Science Alliance (SICSA)</p>
<p>BACKGROUND <br>
  The aim of Automated Verification of Critical Systems (AVoCS) 2015 <br>
  is to contribute to the interaction and exchange of ideas among members <br>
  of the international research community on tools and techniques for the <br>
  verification of critical systems. </p>
<p>SCOPE<br>
  The subject is to be interpreted broadly and inclusively. It covers <br>
  all aspects of automated verification, including model checking, <br>
  theorem proving, SAT/SMT constraint solving, abstract interpretation, <br>
  and refinement pertaining to various types of critical systems which <br>
  need to meet stringent dependability requirements (safety-critical, <br>
  business-critical, performance-critical, etc.). Contributions that <br>
  describe different techniques, or industrial case studies are encouraged. </p>
<p>The technical programme will consist of invited and contributed talks <br>
  and also allow for short presentations of research ideas. The workshop <br>
  will be relatively informal, with an emphasis on discussion where special <br>
  discussion sessions will be organised around the research ideas presentations. <br>
  Topics include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>- Model Checking<br>
    - Automatic and Interactive Theorem Proving<br>
    - SAT, SMT or Constraint Solving for Verification<br>
    - Abstract Interpretation<br>
    - Specification and Refinement<br>
    - Requirements Capture and Analysis<br>
    - Verification of Software and Hardware<br>
    - Specification and Verification of Fault Tolerance and Resilience<br>
    - Probabilistic and Real-Time Systems<br>
    - Dependable Systems<br>
    - Verified System Development<br>
    - Industrial Applications</p>
<p>WORKSHOPS<br>
  AI4FM 2015: 1 September 2015 -- <a href="http://www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2015/">www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2015/</a></p>
<p>VENUE<br>
  The event will be held in the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences <br>
  (ICMS) in the centre of the historic old town of Edinburgh - an UNESCO world<br>
  heritage site. </p>
<p>STUDENT GRANTS<br>
  Thanks to sponsorships from FME and SICSA we can offer financial support for a <br>
  limited number of students registering for AVoCS in the form of a registration <br>
  fee waiver (full or partial). As this is limited, we ask the students that <br>
  would like to take the advantage of this support to submit a short application. <br>
  The details on how to apply will be available in due course from the AVoCS <br>
  webpage.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION DETAILS<br>
   Submissions of full papers to the workshop must not have been published <br>
   or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions <br>
   will be peer-reviewed and judged on the basis of originality, contribution <br>
   to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the <br>
   workshop. Submissions are handled via Easychair: </p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=avocs2015">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=avocs2015</a></p>
<p>The papers must be written in English and not exceed 15 pages and should <br>
   use the dedicated AVoCS 2015 EASST template available rom the the <br>
   following link (for LaTeX and Word):</p>
<p><a href="http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/eceasst">http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/eceasst</a></p>
<p>AVoCS also encourages the submissions of research ideas in order to stimulate <br>
   discussions at the workshop. Reports on ongoing work or surveys on work <br>
   published elsewhere are welcome. The Programme Committee will select <br>
   research ideas on the basis of submitted abstracts according to significance <br>
   and general interest. Research ideas must be written in English and not exceed <br>
   2 pages using the EASST template. The presentation of these ideas will be organised <br>
   around discussions, where the presenter should also prepare a set of question in <br>
   which the audience will discuss.</p>
<p>PROCEEDINGS<br>
  At the workshop, pre-proceedings will be available in the form of a Heriot-Watt <br>
  University Technical Report; this report will also include the research ideas.<br>
  After the workshop, the authors of accepted full papers will have about one <br>
  month in order to revise their papers for publication in the workshop post-<br>
  proceedings which will appear in the Electronic Communications of the EASST <br>
  Open Access Journal. Research ideas will not be part of the proceedings in the <br>
  Open Access Journal.</p>
<p>SPECIAL SCP JOURNAL ISSUE<br>
  Authors of a selection of the best papers presented at the workshop will be <br>
  invited to submit extended versions of their work for publication in a <br>
  special issue of Elsevier's journal Science of Computer Programming.</p>
