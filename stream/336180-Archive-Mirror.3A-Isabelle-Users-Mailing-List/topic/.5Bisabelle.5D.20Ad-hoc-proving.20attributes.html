<p>From: Lars Hupel &lt;<a href="mailto:hupel@in.tum.de">hupel@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
(My apologies for the somewhat mysterious subject line.)</p>
<p>I was wondering whether it'd make sense to unify the mechanisms behind<br>
"inductive_cases", "inductive_simps", "fun_cases" etc.; namely, commands<br>
which prove some theorems on the spot, but apart from binding them to a<br>
name, have no further side effects on the theory.</p>
<p>My main motivation for this is that, sometimes, I need "ad hoc"<br>
elimination rules, and since "inductive_cases" doesn't work in proof<br>
blocks, I end up with the rather awkward pattern of declaring them<br>
outside the proof and hiding them afterwards again. My initial thought<br>
was to make a variant of the command which works in a proof block (c.f.<br>
"lemmas" vs "note", "interpretation" vs "interpret"), but if<br>
Isabelle/HOL doesn't need more of one things, it's keywords.</p>
<p>So, here's my proposal: Instead of an "inductive_cases" command, have an<br>
"inductive_cases" attribute. It could be used like this:</p>
<p>lemmas fooE[elim] = [[inductive_cases "R (T x) (T y)"]]</p>
<p>or this:</p>
<p>then have "R a b"<br>
    using [[inductive_cases "R (T x) (T y)"]]</p>
<p>This would already work out of the box by declaring a "rule_attribute"<br>
which ignores its incoming "thm" argument.</p>
<p>Is that something people would be interested in?</p>
<p>(NB: What follows are some technical details which would probably belong<br>
to [isabelle-dev], but I don't want to split this thread.)</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>
<hr>
<p>Making my case for "inductive_cases" is easy, because I could implement<br>
it with the existing tools, because it always proves a single theorem.<br>
If we want to be fully general though, it gets more complicated, because<br>
the current "attribute" mechanism doesn't allow to return more than one<br>
theorem.</p>
<p>Looking at how attributes are implemented, I found this:</p>
<p>type attribute =<br>
    Context.generic * thm -&gt; Context.generic option * thm option</p>
<p>Modifying this to return a "thm list option" would certainly allow<br>
multiple theorems. To make it easy to use, one could create a new "smart<br>
constructor" for that type, e.g.</p>
<p>val ad_hoc_proof_attribute: (Context.generic -&gt; thm list) -&gt; attribute</p>
<p>which leaves the incoming context untouched and ignores the incoming<br>
theorem.</p>
<p>I couldn't predict what more needed to be changed, so I decided to<br>
"apply some pressure and see what starts wobbling". I changed the type<br>
in "more_thm.ML". Then, the tricky bit is "apply_attributes", which is<br>
in some way a glorified fold left over a list of attributes. There, I<br>
ran into a problem: suppose we have</p>
<p>thm _[inductive_cases "...", simp]</p>
<p>In this case, the first part of the attribute sequence might produce<br>
more than theorem, which means that the second part needs to be applied<br>
to all of them. Peter pointed out to me that we already have precendent<br>
for that:</p>
<p>thm foo.intros[simp]</p>
<p>... works in exactly the same way: "simp" is applied to all theorems in<br>
"foo.intros" (this is handled in "Isar/attrib.ML"). However, so far the<br>
full "attribute pipeline" only transformed one pair of theorem and<br>
context into another pair of theorem and context, and now it would need<br>
to deal with potentially multiple and traverse them in some manner<br>
(Depth first? Breadth first? That choice matters for non-commutative<br>
attributes, e.g. [simp, simplified]).</p>
<p>I have attached a patch which _only_ attempts to change the definition<br>
in "more_thm.ML" and fix what breaks in "global_theory.ML" and<br>
"Isar/proof_context.ML" (in both files only minor changes were needed).<br>
A bit more thought is required for "Isar/attrib.ML", where I aborted my<br>
exploration.<br>

Hi Lars,</p>
<p>I understand that your proposal is more general than the proof method ind_cases, but could <br>
you comment on how they relate to each other?</p>

Hi,</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I actually didn't know about that proof method, but it looks similar.<br>
The difference is that I would actually need to spell out the rule I<br>
want, and then continue to prove it with that method. With my proposal,<br>
you just get the theorem generated on the spot, without having to spell<br>
it out. It's very nice in proofs where you obtain variables. From my<br>
current work:</p>
<p>obtain x1 x2<br>
  where "x = x1 $ x2"<br>
    and "rs, compile rs ⊢ x1 ≈ t1"<br>
    and "rs, compile rs ⊢ x2 ≈ t2"<br>
  by (auto elim: [[summon_ind_cases "rs, compile rs ⊢ x ≈ t1 $$ t2"]])</p>
<p>I could have expressed that equally well with</p>
<p>inductive_cases need_to_make_up_a_name: "rs, compile rs ..."</p>
<p>lemma ...<br>
proof ...</p>
<p>obtain ...<br>
    by (auto elim: ...)</p>
<p>qed</p>
<p>hide_fact ...</p>
<p>The reason why I prefer an attribute over a command is that I don't need<br>
to make up a name for something which only makes sense in the context of<br>
a particular proof. Here, the "compile rs" is an artifact from the lemma<br>
I'm proving. Another reason is that I think attributes are vastly<br>
underrated – as opposed to commands, they can be used uniformly in a lot<br>
of different situations.</p>
<p>I have attached a working example of that "summon_ind_cases" attribute.<br>
(As an aside, I realize that my handling of variables is not canonical<br>
here; presumably, I need to parse "for" fixes as well. Grepping the<br>
sources for occurrences of "Parse.for_fixes" didn't reveal any canonical<br>
use cases, though.)</p>
<p>Cheers<br>

<p>From: Lars Hupel &lt;<a href="mailto:hupel@in.tum.de">hupel@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Lars just pointed out another candidate: "case_of_simps",<br>
"simps_of_case". With my proposal, one could write</p>
<p>thm foo_case = [[case_of_simps foo.simps]]<br>
  note foo_case = [[case_of_simps foo.simps]]</p>
<p>instead of using the specialized command</p>
<p>case_of_simps foo_case: foo.simps</p>
<p>This attribute could be implemented right now, but not "simps_of_case",<br>
because the latter would need to return multiple theorems.</p>

<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:lammich@in.tum.de">lammich@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
I would appreciate an attribute [[inductive_cases &lt;term&gt;]] instead of<br>
the command.</p>
