<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Ramana Kumar and List Members,</p>
<p>Thank you for your criticism and questions available at<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00149.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00149.html</a><br>
concerning my project announcement at<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html</a></p>
<p>There are two motivations for this project besides the elegance of Q0:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The implementation of Q0 should be realized as a Hilbert-style system, since <br>
axiomatic (Hilbert-style) systems and natural deduction systems show a <br>
different behavior.<br>
Theorems (and each line of a proof) in Hilbert-style systems always have a <br>
constant number (one or zero) of occurrences of the deduction symbol <br>
(turnstile), hence the theorem proved in the files available at <br>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4444/100.102">http://dx.doi.org/10.4444/100.102</a> cannot be expressed, and Goedel's First <br>
Incompleteness Theorem cannot be obtained in a Hilbert-style system (like any <br>
other theorem with two or more occurrences of the deduction symbol, unless it <br>
is a metatheorem, i.e., it makes use of syntactical variables).<br>
Since Q0 is a Hilbert-style system, the proof of Goedel's First Incompleteness <br>
Theorem fails in it (step 7101.4 has no syntactic justification), although this <br>
is not caused by unwanted restrictions of Q0. For details, please see: <br>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4444/100.101">http://dx.doi.org/10.4444/100.101</a><br>
Thus axiomatic (Hilbert-style) systems and natural deduction systems differ not <br>
only in terms of the proof style, but also in terms of the expressiveness of <br>
the language.<br>
I do not want to discard the results of natural deduction systems as a whole, <br>
but the class of theorems that can be obtained in natural deduction systems <br>
only seems problematic to me. For this reason, I prefer axiomatic <br>
(Hilbert-style) systems such as Q0.<br>
(The Isabelle implementations of higher-order logic are natural deduction <br>
systems, as of my knowledge, and Isabelle is the only proof assistant software <br>
I know of that is easy and convenient to handle according to the specification <br>
in the announcement.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the basis of an implementation of Q0, an implementation of my own <br>
(currently unpublished) system R0 within Isabelle might be possible, which <br>
allows for type variables and binding of type variables with lambda and <br>
therefore has the expressiveness of polymorphic and dependent type theory, thus <br>
removing the limitations of Q0. I already finished the R0 software <br>
implementation as an independent proof verification system on my own and <br>
carried out many of Andrews' proofs in it, but for the layer of proof <br>
automation on top of that, a machinery is desirable, the development and <br>
maintenance of which would go beyond the capabilities of a single person.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If there are any further questions, please check my website (see below) instead <br>
of the mailing list only, as I might include a project page there. Also, I <br>
might need some time to answer appropriately.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
