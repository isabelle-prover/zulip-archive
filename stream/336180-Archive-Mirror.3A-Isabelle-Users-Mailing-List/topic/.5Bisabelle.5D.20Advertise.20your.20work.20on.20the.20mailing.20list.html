Hi all,</p>
<p>This is just a reminder that we are all encouraged to let the mailing list know about your Isabelle-based work on the mailing list. This is especially important if you publish your work elsewhere than at the ITP conference or on the Archive of Formal Proof. Other people on the mailing list might be doing something similar without knowing. (This happened recently with an Isabelle-related paper presented at LPAR.)</p>
<p>Immodest example:</p>
<p>Three Years of Experience with Sledgehammer, a Practical Link between Automatic and Interactive Theorem Provers<br>
w/ Lawrence C. Paulson<br>
IWIL 2010 (Yogyakarta, Indonesia)</p>
<p>Sledgehammer is a highly successful subsystem of Isabelle/HOL that calls automatic theorem provers to assist with interactive proof construction. It requires no user configuration: it can be invoked with a single mouse gesture at any point in a proof. It automatically finds relevant lemmas from all those currently available. An unusual aspect of its architecture is its use of unsound translations, coupled with its delivery of results as Isabelle/HOL proof scripts: its output cannot be trusted, but it does not need to be trusted. Sledgehammer works well with Isar structured proofs and allows beginners to prove challenging theorems.</p>

<p>Developing Security Protocols by Refinement<br>
Christoph Sprenger and David Basin</p>
<p>Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications  <br>
Security (CCS)<br>
Chicago, IL, USA, October 4-8, 2010, pp. 361--374</p>
<p>Abstract--- We propose a development method for security protocols  <br>
based on stepwise refinement. Our refinement strategy guides the  <br>
transformation of abstract security goals into protocols that are  <br>
secure when operating over an insecure channel controlled by a Dolev- <br>
Yao-style intruder. The refinement steps successively introduce local  <br>
states, an intruder, communication channels with security properties,  <br>
and cryptographic operations realizing these channels. The  <br>
abstractions used provide insights on how the protocols work and  <br>
foster the development of families of protocols sharing a common  <br>
structure and properties. In contrast to post-hoc verification  <br>
methods, protocols are developed together with their correctness  <br>
proofs. We have implemented our method in Isabelle/HOL and used it to  <br>
develop different entity authentication and key transport protocols.</p>

<p>From: Simon Meier &lt;<a href="mailto:iridcode@gmail.com">iridcode@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>Now it's your turn!</p>
<p>at CSF 2010, we published the following results stemming from our ongoing<br>
effort to provide a simple framework for developing machine-checked protocol<br>
security proofs.</p>
<p>*Meier, Cremers, Basin, "Strong Invariants for the Efficient Construction of<br>
Machine-Checked Protocol Security Proofs", in CSF, 2010, pp. 231-245.*</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> We embed an operational semantics for security protocols in the<br>
interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL and derive two strong<br>
protocol-independent invariants. These invariants allow us to reason about<br>
the possible origin of messages and justify a local typing assumption for<br>
the otherwise untyped protocol variables. The two rules form the core of a<br>
theory that is well-suited for interactively constructing natural,<br>
human-readable, correctness proofs.  Moreover, we develop an algorithm that<br>
automatically generates proof scripts based on these invariants. Both<br>
interactive and automatic proof construction are faster than competing<br>
approaches. Moreover, we have strong correctness guarantees since all<br>
proofs, including those deriving the underlying theory from the semantics,<br>
are machine checked.</p>
<p>A pre-release of the our Isabelle theories and the proof generation tool<br>
implemented in Haskell can be found on Simon's homepage.</p>
<p><a href="http://people.inf.ethz.ch/meiersi/espl/index.html">http://people.inf.ethz.ch/meiersi/espl/index.html</a></p>
<p>Many of you know Paulson's inductive approach to security protocol<br>
verification [1]. Hence, we provide a short *comparison between the<br>
Inductive Approach and our approach.*</p>
<p>In the Inductive Approach both the formalization of the intruder<br>
capabilities as well as the protocol specification are shallowly embedded in<br>
the definition of the inductive set of traces describing the protocol<br>
execution. The advantage of such a shallow embedding is that the<br>
expressivity for the protocol specification is limited by HOL only. However,<br>
the price one pays is that one has to come up with and prove more inductive<br>
invariants.</p>
<p>In our approach, we use a deep embedding of a protocol specification<br>
language that represents protocols as a set of roles where a role is a<br>
linear sequence of send and receive steps. We formalize a protocol<br>
independent semantics as an inductive set of traces parametrized over the<br>
protocol being executed. This construction allows us to provide a set of<br>
protocol independent invariants strong enough for proving secrecy and<br>
authentication properties for "classical authentication protocols" (e.g.<br>
Kerberos or TLS or the protocols in the SPORE [2]) without resorting to<br>
induction over the traces.</p>
<p>Due to our protocol independent invariants, security proof construction<br>
becomes (quite) mechanical. For secrecy and non-injective authentication<br>
properties, proof search is even that simple that we can automatically find<br>
their proofs and output them as Isabelle proof scripts. Based on these<br>
automatically proven properties, more complex properties can then be proven<br>
interactively.</p>
<p>Note that our invariants were inspired by the theory underlying the security<br>
protocol model checker Scyther [3]. Hence, our capability for automatic<br>
proof generation comes to no surprise. The suprising fact is that a theory<br>
developed for automatic verification is also that well-suited for<br>
interactive use.</p>
<p><em>The executive summary is the following:</em> If the protocol you are verifying<br>
can be specified as a set of linear roles and your security property can be<br>
expressed as a predicate on traces, then our approach might provide an<br>
elegant way to construct your security proofs. If not, then Paulson's<br>
approach might suit your problem better. Nevertheless, we would still like<br>
to hear about your problem, as it may be that one of the extensions we are<br>
working on applies.</p>
<p>best regards,<br>

<p>Hi all,  </p>
<p>Apart from what we published on AFP and/or ITP (ProgramConflictAnalysis,<br>
Isabelle Collection Framework, Tree Automata, BinomialQueues, FingerTrees)  <br>
\+ in Preparation: <strong>Dijkstra's algorithm</strong> as an example for using ICF and<br>
PriorityQueues in a complex algorithm,  <br>
we work on program analysis for concurrent programs, and verify many of our<br>
techniques in Isabelle/HOL.  </p>
<p>The document: <strong>Formalization of pre* for DPNs</strong> (&lt;<a href="http://cs.uni-">http://cs.uni-</a><br>
<a href="http://muenster.de/sev/staff/lammich/isabelle/#dpn_prestar">muenster.de/sev/staff/lammich/isabelle/#dpn_prestar</a>&gt;) formalizes an automata-<br>
based model-checking algorithm for dynamic pushdown networks, and generates  <br>
(very inefficient) executable code.  </p>
<p>The technical report: *<em>Isabelle Formalization of Hedge-Constrained pre</em> and<br>
DPNs with Locks** (&lt;<a href="http://cs.uni-">http://cs.uni-</a><br>
<a href="http://muenster.de/sev/staff/lammich/isabelle/#pca">muenster.de/sev/staff/lammich/isabelle/#pca</a>&gt;) formalizes an analysis of<br>
Dynamic Pushdown Networks with Locks, an abstract model for parallel programs.<br>
We are currently extending the results there. On the Isabelle/HOL side, the<br>
long-term goal is to derive an executable analyser, that is specified as a<br>
datalog-like logical program, that can be efficiently solved with BDD-based<br>
techniques (cf. eg. the bddbddb - project)  </p>
<p>Moreover, we are exploring how to combine approaches from <strong>separation logic</strong><br>
with the <strong>ImperativeHOL</strong> framework. The motivation is to develop a library<br>
of efficient imperative datastructures for ImperativeHOL, that allows for<br>
nice, modular proofs (An ImperativeHOL-analogon of the Isabelle Collection<br>
Framework).  </p>

Mathematizing C++ Concurrency (POPL 2011, joint work with Mark Batty,<br>
Scott Owens, Susmit Sarkar, and Peter Sewell, Cambridge University)</p>
<p>Abstract (provisional):</p>
<p>Shared-memory concurrency in C and C++ is pervasive in systems<br>
programming, but has long been poorly defined. This motivated an ongoing<br>
shared effort by the standards committees to specify concurrent<br>
behaviour in the next versions of both languages.  They aim to provide<br>
strong guarantees for race-free programs, together with new (but subtle)<br>
relaxed-memory atomic primitives for high-performance concurrent code.<br>
However, the current draft standards, while the result of careful<br>
deliberation, are still rather far from clear and rigorous definitions.</p>
<p>In this paper we establish a mathematical (yet readable) semantics for<br>
C++ concurrency.  We aim to capture the intent of the current draft as<br>
closely as possible, but discuss a number of points where this is not<br>
straightforward.  We prove that a proposed x86 implementation of the<br>
concurrency primitives is correct with respect to the x86-TSO model, and<br>
describe our Cppmem tool for exploring the semantics of examples, using<br>
code generated from our Isabelle/HOL definitions.</p>
<p>This will aid discussion of any further changes to the draft standard,<br>
provide a correctness condition for compilers, and give a much-needed<br>
basis for analysis and verification of concurrent C and C++ programs.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Jasmin Blanchette for his extensive help in getting<br>
Nitpick to work for us!</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>Some stuff I'm involved with in Edinburgh...</p>
<p>Automated theory exploration:<br>
We have two systems based on Isabelle/IsaPlanner which carry out <br>
automated theory exploration (IsaScheme and IsaCoSy). The idea is to see <br>
how much of in inductive theory can be generated automatically. It turns <br>
out by using counter example finding and generating only irreducible <br>
terms you get some cool stuff:<br>

)<br>
and the IsaScheme stuff is described here:<br>

<p>An experiment using Isabelle by a working mathematician:<br>
This has resulted in two things. 1) a formalization of convex analysis, <br>
(I'll let Bogdan say more about this) and 2) an "Isabelle Primer for <br>
Mathematicians" which is a quick introduction to Isabelle, highlighting <br>
some of the common difficulties and how to get around them. :)<br>
The Isabelle primer can be downloaded from:<br>
<a href="http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/isabelle/Isabelle_Primer.pdf">http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/isabelle/Isabelle_Primer.pdf</a><br>
The formalisation will be released in due course.</p>
<p>Proof Planning/Inductive Theorem Proving in Isabelle:<br>
we've been developing an automated inductive theorem prover <br>
(IsaPlanner). This is based on Rippling, and is primarily a research <br>
tool for exploring extensions to the technique. We've also been <br>
experimenting with proof-plan/tactic languages a bit too, and with <br>
synthesis techniques based on Isabelle's schematic variables (and <br>
machinery to manage working with them). Some info and papers are <br>
available here:<br>
<a href="http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/isaplanner/">http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/isaplanner/</a></p>
<p>Formalisation of Intuitionistic Linear Logic in Isabelle.<br>
We've carried out various formalisations of fragments of <br>
(Intuitionistic) Linear Logic, with proof terms, in Isabelle using the <br>
nominal package, and also experimented with some other forms of handling <br>
binding (Randy Pollack can say more about this perhaps?) We really ought <br>
to tidy the linear logic stuff up and submit it to the AFP... (suddenly <br>
feeling guilty)</p>
<p>In the pipeline: we're hoping to provide some re-factoring tools for <br>
(Isar) proof scripts... still early days on that.</p>
