Dear list,</p>
<p>is there some type class of algebraically closed fields in Isabelle/HOL?<br>
Since such fields are an important and widely used concept I'd be<br>
surprised if not, but a quick search in the library+AFP did not reveal<br>
anything ...</p>
<p>Of course I could easily introduce a suitable type class myself, but I<br>
just wanted to avoid duplicate work.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Alexander</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
I don't think there is. As far as I know, the visible Isabelle universe<br>
only contains two concrete instances of algebraically closed fields,<br>
namely the complex numbers (in HOL) and the algebraic complex numbers<br>
(in the AFP entry Algebraic_Numbers). The latter are, I think, more<br>
technically interesting and not so much for abstract mathematical<br>
developments.</p>
<p>It is not necessarily bad to introduce a typeclass that has only one<br>
instance – especially when it coincides with a standard mathematical<br>
concept (as is the case here). However, it also doesn't have much<br>
immediate payoff, which is probably why no one has done it so far. Feel<br>
free to do so!</p>
<p>There is also a HOL-Algebra development by former students of<br>
Larry/Anthony (much of it still in a private repository) that could be<br>
used to make a generic "alg_closure" type constructor. Not sure how<br>
useful that is though – it might be interesting when reasoning about<br>
things like Galois fields or also for generic proofs involving fields,<br>
because it allows you to suddenly go to the algebraic closure for a<br>
proof and then back.</p>
<p>Another interesting instance would be formal Puiseux series. They've<br>
been on my long-term potential to-do list. If anyone feels like having a<br>
go at them (e.g. in analogy to the existing formal power series/Laurent<br>
series in HOL-Compuational_Algebra), please do. :)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

Dear Manuel,</p>
<p>thanks for your useful answer.</p>

<p>I will do so; should be no problem.</p>

<p>I was also thinking of something like that, although this does not have<br>
immediate priority for me. Actually, I only want to have algebraically<br>
closed fields for formalizing Hilbert's Nullstellensatz in the most<br>
general setting (i.e. not restricted to complex numbers), which I'm<br>
working on right now.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Alexander</p>

Dear Alexander,</p>
<p>having a type-class for alg.-closed fields would definitely be something nice.<br>
For instance, then one can also generalize the existence of a Jordan-Normal-Form<br>
to alg.-closed fields.</p>
<p>Moreover, I hope in the long run that there will be at least to instances:<br>
complex numbers and complex algebraic numbers.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
René</p>
