Is the Windows version ready? I tried to run it on windows, but I was <br>
not able to<br>
configure the Isabelle installation.</p>

Dear all,</p>
<p>I've installed i3p and I've been using it for a few days, so it may be that<br>
my appreciations are not that accurate, but just a few comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First I would like to emphasize the ease of use of the tool. It<br>
took me no time to install it and in a couple of minutes I was already<br>
writting code (from any point of view much easier than learning emacs<br>
or xemacs for a newbie), and I could install the Isabelle fonts just<br>
following the instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it is quite fast starting and loading theories and images.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also a few things that i did not get to work and I missed from xemacs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I do not know how to switch between the different windows from the<br>
application. For instance, when I'm writting down a theory I would<br>
like to move from the file to the "Result window" to copy the goals or<br>
some of the premises and take them back to the "thy" file. I did not<br>
manage to do it. This feature would ease faster development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X-symbols are not displayed in my files (but they are in the<br>
"Result prover" window). Whenever I write "\&lt;And&gt;" or any other symbol<br>
i3p does not automatically convert it into its X-symbol version. Can<br>
this option be turned on from any menu?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is not keyboard shortcut for the "Isabelle" menu. By means of<br>
"Alt + e" or "Alt + t" one can move to the Edit or Tools menu, but<br>
there is no such option for the "Isabelle" menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could not find any mail address inside of the application to<br>
which one could send any congratulations :-)) comments, questions or<br>
suggestions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Alltogether, I found it really nice and very convenient for starters,<br>
and with minor improvements better than the emacs or xemacs options.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Holger,</p>
<p>best wishes,</p>
<p>Jesus</p>

<p>From: Holger Gast &lt;<a href="mailto:gast@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de">gast@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle users,</p>
<p>It is my pleasure to announce the first public release<br>
of I3P, an Interactive Interface for the Isabelle Prover.<br>
It is available from</p>
<p><a href="http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/i3p">http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/i3p</a></p>
<p>The two goals of the I3P development are interactivity<br>
and extensibility: users should be able to interact with<br>
an interactive theorem prover in more ways than executing<br>
and undoing commands, and they should be able to add<br>
in well-defined ways specific user-interface functionality to<br>
support them in their specific projects.</p>
<p>Here are a few reasons why you might want to give I3P a try:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It offers the main functionality of the Emacs-based<br>
  ProofGeneral: as the main difference, the keyboard shortcuts<br>
  replace Ctrl-C by Ctrl-Shift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It builds on the Netbeans/Swing frameworks and thus offers<br>
  standard UI features: your students might appreciate the<br>
  well-known environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It handles copy &amp; paste with XSymbols correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is portable and has been used under Linux and MacOS.<br>
  (Windows/Cygwin support will be added shortly.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is fast: the design pays specific attention to handling<br>
  large numbers of trace messages and large messages efficiently:<br>
  there is no real need to wait while the UI is scanning your traces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It offers command-local tracing: several posts to this list<br>
  have asked whether it is possible to turn on tracing for<br>
  single commands. I3P offers this capability (command-local options)<br>
  on the interface side, by having the prover driver issue option<br>
  changes before and after command execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has small release cycles: due to test-driven development of<br>
  the developed infrastructure layer (with the number of test<br>
  cases approaching 400), I feel confident in releasing updates<br>
  in short periods. An AutoUpdate-Service is included to inform<br>
  you about new versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is extensible: the existing modules provide general<br>
  and documented mechanisms for plugging in new views and<br>
  commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It provides a framework for driving Isabelle-2009/-1:<br>
  several posts to this list have asked how to use Isabelle<br>
  as a background prover. The test cases of the Isabelle<br>
  driver of I3P show how to achieve this in a simple manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The installation effort is minimal anyway: just download the<br>
  binary, unzip, and start i3p/bin/i3p.</p>
<p>At most, you may want to install the IsabelleMono.ttf from<br>
Isabelle2009-1/lib/fonts on your system and choose it for the<br>
display under Tool/Options/Fonts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would also like to thank Makarius Wenzel, Burkhart Wolff,<br>
and Achim Brucker for discussions about the requirements<br>
on user interfaces for Isabelle. Furthermore, they and<br>
Alexander Krauss and Julia Trieflinger have courageously<br>
agreed to act as beta-testers for I3P and have provided<br>
invaluable feedback on shortcomings and usability issues.</p>
<p>I am very grateful for any feedback you might care to give.</p>
<p>Enjoy,</p>
<p>Holger</p>

I would like to encourage users to try it out and give some feedback, <br>
either on this mailing list or directly to Holger.</p>
