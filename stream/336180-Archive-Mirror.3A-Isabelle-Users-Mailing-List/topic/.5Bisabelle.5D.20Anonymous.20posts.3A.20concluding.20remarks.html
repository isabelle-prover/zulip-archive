<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who replied to the previous thread that I<br>
started both in private and in public (<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-December/msg00010.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-December/msg00010.html</a>).<br>
I realized that, perhaps, it was, indeed, wrong of me (purely from the<br>
perspective of the lack of social awareness) to post using an anonymous<br>
email address on this list. Most certainly, I did not mean to offend<br>
anyone. Moreover, I never intended to become an oddity for which exceptions<br>
have to be made. When I registered this email address, I was still under<br>
the impression that the Isabelle project is significantly bigger than it<br>
appeared to be. At the time I thought that just like almost any other<br>
science/mathematics forum this mailing list would be inhabited by other<br>
regular anonymous/pseudonymous posters. However, by now, I understood that<br>
there exists a culture that is based on personal acquaintance and, as such,<br>
anonymous posts are an uncommon occurrence.</p>
<p>I still do not consider it to be an option to post under my real name<br>
because I believe that such posts could have a negative and long-lasting<br>
effect on my career and personal life. Nevertheless, I will cease to post<br>
on this list from this email address. If I will ever feel a great need to<br>
ask something on the list, most likely, I will do so under a human<br>
pseudonym, as suggested by several regular users of the list, including<br>
Makarius Wenzel. It is not unlikely that this email address will be<br>
deregistered in the near future.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>The pseudonym seems to be a way everyone can live with, and I hope we can welcome you back in new form. The only objection anyone has raised (that I’m aware of) was the anonymous form, never against your person or contributions.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

Should I infer from those conclusions that: society of 2019 fears<br>
management and try to hide behind pseudonyms to not affect their personal<br>
career!<br>
It is a very interesting side effect!</p>
<p>Does this mean that in 2019, if someone publicly try to reason about a<br>
problem, even if it is a very technical problem, and his reasoning is<br>
"wrong" or "not complete" he is severely punished by the management<br>
strategies of 2019?<br>
Namely, managers do not believe anymore that "Any human has the ability to<br>
learn and move forward!" ?<br>
Does this mean, if someone uses his brain to reason publicly about<br>
something in 2019, even if it is a very technical thingy, he is punished<br>
for that?<br>
I am interested by this side effect! And I will take those conclusions<br>
seriously!</p>
<p>Note the very technical content of this mailing list, which I assumed to<br>
immune the users from the recent management strategies(which I do not agree<br>
with in most cases, since it contradicts the definition of experimental<br>
science most of the time)!</p>
<p>(Nothing against anonymous here! I had this conclusion 1 and half year ago,<br>
that recent management strategies will lead to a cataclysm in academia, and<br>
there we are!)</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Yakoub.</p>
