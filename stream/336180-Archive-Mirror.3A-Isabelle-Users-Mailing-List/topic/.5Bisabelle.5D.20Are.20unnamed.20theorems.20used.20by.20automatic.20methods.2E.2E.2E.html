Suppose I have an unnamed theorem:</p>
<p>theorem "&lt;some formula that's true&gt;" by(auto)</p>
<p>Are automatic proof methods, or is Sledgehammer going to try and use <br>
that theorem to prove anything?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>

When it is really unnamed and has not other attributes to declare it to <br>
the context, the system will not store the theorem anywhere.  So other <br>
tools like sledgehammer should not be able to find it.</p>

Makarius,</p>
<p>Thanks. I'm restating definitions and axioms as lemmas to check my <br>
typing. I also might want to prove a theorem 10 additional ways. For <br>
performance, I don't want any of that to be used by Sledgehammer, or a <br>
proof method like "by(auto)".</p>
<p>I restate a definition with <code>lemma "&lt;some formula&gt;" sorry</code>. I choose <br>
"sorry" over "oops" simply as a matter of style.</p>
<p>I try to find a code style that looks good without hiding or converting <br>
things in LaTeX.</p>
<p>If it's a 5 minute job, and you have 5 minutes to spare, can you give me <br>
some ML in a "ML{<em>...</em>}" that creates an outer-syntax-command synonym <br>
for "theorem"? It would be nice to have a two character synonym for <br>
"theorem".</p>
<p>If you're taking Isar feature requests, it would be nice to be able to, <br>
in general, define outer-syntax-command synonyms.</p>
<p>I found these lines of code:</p>
<p>FILE: more_thm.ML<br>
      signature THM =<br>
      ...<br>
      val corollaryK: string</p>
<p>FILE: isar_syn.ML<br>
      val _ = gen_theorem false Thm.corollaryK;<br>
      val _ = gen_theorem true Thm.corollaryK;</p>
<p>FILE: thm_deps.ML<br>
      member (op =) [Thm.theoremK, Thm.lemmaK, Thm.corollaryK] <br>
(Thm.legacy_get_kind th) andalso</p>
<p>I don't know enough ML to know how to use that information.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>For plain propositions you can also use the 'prop' command.</p>

<p>Proof methods lile auto, blast, fast, simp etc. only use what you declare <br>
explicitly as simp, intro, elim, dest, iff etc.  Appendix A.4 of the <br>
isar-ref manual has a small table on that.</p>
<p>Sledgehammer is a bit different in going through the whole environment of <br>
named facts, but I reckon it won't find anything that does not have a <br>
name.</p>

<p>I don't think it would be a good idea to introduce aliases for existing <br>
commands, especially very short ones.  If you want to be fast in typing it <br>
is better to figure out some jEdit plugins that do the job.  The Sidekick <br>
completion is already there; it has some plugin options to make it more <br>
aggressive.  Other plugins like superabbrevs or yet unknown ones might do <br>
even more for you.</p>
<p>Line noise that is hacked into the computer is better not stored in the <br>
text you produce, unless you never want anyone to read it, maintain it, <br>
work with it elsewise.</p>
<p>Some people have come up with proof languages based on single letter <br>
commands, or even non-letter commands in the spirit of APL.  I am fond of <br>
typing fast, but not of reading what looks like mouse droppings on the <br>
screen.</p>

<p>It was only about style. Some keywords I like or don't mind, but "oops" <br>
and "sorry" don't quite fit in. It's not a problem because I don't think <br>
I'll be postponing or abandoning proofs much in the documents I give <br>
people, and I can strip some things out.</p>
<p>I was going to make a feeble appeal for freedom of keyword syntax, <br>
similar to how we have freedom of notation with Isar, but I decided it's <br>
the standardized keywords that give the language a common feel from <br>
document to document. If you were to let people redefine keywords, there <br>
would be major fragmentation of the language, which would make the <br>
language harder to learn, and you would get blamed for it.</p>

<p>Readability is huge with me, but it takes a lot of experimenting to find <br>
the balance between using brevity for clarity, and using verboseness for <br>
clarity.</p>
