<p>From: "John F. Hughes" &lt;<a href="mailto:jfh@cs.brown.edu">jfh@cs.brown.edu</a>&gt;<br>
I'm not certain whether this is appropriate for this list, but here goes:</p>
<p>I've been trying to make progress with Isabelle, but evidently need some<br>
guidance; answers i've gotten here have been of some use, but the<br>
turnaround is a bit slow: I'd like to dedicate a couple of solid days to<br>
making progress, rather than 10 minutes, then hit a stumbling block, and<br>
wait a day or two for an answer, which is how things have gone so far.</p>
<p>I'd like to hire someone (a graduate student?) to answer my questions,<br>
perhaps via email, perhaps in a couple of skype sessions, whatever works<br>
best, allowing for time differences, etc. (I'm on the east coast of the<br>
US). If anyone knows of someone who might be willing to help out, I'd sure<br>
appreciate pointers. You could refer such a person to me directly.</p>
<p>Typical questions may range from the mundane ("Q: Why are there no colors<br>
when I type stuff, but all the examples in the book show colored text?"A:<br>
Because you named your file myTest rather than myTest.thy.") to the more<br>
sophisticated ("Q: I'd like to inductively construct an infinite set (where<br>
"sets" for me are being represented by types) and then prove things about<br>
it... how on earth do I do that?") None of my question are likely to be<br>
about the core ideas of Isabelle itself ('how is the current state of known<br>
facts represented?'), at least not initially --- they're all very much from<br>
a user's perspective.</p>
<p>My target is proving things in mathematics, not things about programming<br>
languages or programs. [I find those applications interesting too, but<br>
they're not what I'm after right now.] So someone with a bit of<br>
mathematical sophistication would probably be ideal.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.<br>
--John</p>
