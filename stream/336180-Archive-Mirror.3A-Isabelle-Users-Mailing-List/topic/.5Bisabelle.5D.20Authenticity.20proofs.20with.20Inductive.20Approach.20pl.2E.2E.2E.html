Dear Kristof, thanks for your email. I'll do my best to answer, but it's at least 15 years since I was working with this material.</p>
<p>The main reference connected with your question (e.g. authenticity of signed messages) is the original JCS paper:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Auth/jcs.pdf">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Auth/jcs.pdf</a></p>
<p>The main examples distributed with Isabelle/HOL are OtwayRees.thy (for symmetric key protocols) and NS_Public.thy (for public key protocols). The message primitives such as synth and analz are defined in Message.thy.</p>
<p>All the proofs distributed here take the original approach, where little is protocol-independent other than the basic frameworks, which assume either a symmetric key or a public key environment (Public.thy). Other authors have further developed the approach to strengthen the protocol-independent side, and apparently much reducing the effort needed to verify protocols, but I'm not familiar with this work.</p>
<p>So with a protocol-dependent approach, it works because of the way the functions synth and analz are defined: they aren't able to generate nonces or keys, so in particular the Spy cannot do that. If you look at the proofs in NS_Public.thy, which is the famous Needham-Schroeder public key protocol, you'll see that the main tools are induction, simplification and basic automation (blast) with the theorem analz_insertI, which simply asserts Y ∈ analz H ⟹ Y ∈ analz (insert X H).</p>

<p>From: Kristof Teichel &lt;<a href="mailto:k.teichel@gmail.com">k.teichel@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello Isabellers,</p>
<p>I am currently trying to finish up my dissertation project at PTB<br>
(Germany's metrology institute) with the topic of of "design and formal<br>
analysis of security measures for time synchronization protocols". For<br>
this, I would really appreciate a few pointers towards authenticity proofs<br>
with the Inductive Approach in Isabelle - and perhaps ideas on how best to<br>
implement a few extensions that I will need.</p>
<p>Since 2014, I have been (on and off) tampering with the Inductive Approach</p>
<ul>
<li>I even submitted an early inquiry on this list once before. I majored in<br>
mathematics and computer science, so all of what I am seeing is vaguely<br>
familiar territory, but the details are still mysterious to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, now for a few actual questions:</p>
<p>1) Where (if anywhere) in the source files can I find protocol-independent<br>
proofs concerning authenticity of signed messages, specifically about the<br>
impossibility of synthesis of signatures/message authentication codes<br>
without knowledge of the proper key (or the exact, already authenticated<br>
message itself)? Or is something like this simply not needed / not feasible<br>
for some reason?<br>
I ask because I have been stuck for ages whenever I attempted an<br>
authentication goal, and I have recently discovered I was able to solve all<br>
those problem with a simple lemma along the lines of "if attacker does not<br>
know [key], then he cannot synthesize messages containing signature or MAC<br>
using [key]" (with "sorry" cheat, just for proof-of-concept).</p>
<p>2) In general, what file might be a good starting point to import when<br>
defining a new protocol that I want to obtain authentication proofs for?<br>
There is lots of material, but I am somehow missing instruction on this<br>
question.</p>
<p>Sorry for wall-of-text. I would be thankful for any help.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Kristof Teichel</p>
<p>P.S.: If anyone is interested and able to help, I would also like to go<br>
more into the extensions that I need (namely, "runtime"-adjustable clocks<br>
that let participants assign quantitative time values to events and<br>
communicate those in messages). I am aware of the "Physical Properties"<br>
extension attempt (<a href="https://beschmi.net/csf09.pdf">https://beschmi.net/csf09.pdf</a>), but for a few different<br>
reasons, I do not think I will be able to use it and prefer instead to<br>
incorporate my own extensions. This is the main reason why I like the<br>
Inductive Approach so much: it is generic enough that I am pretty sure that<br>
I should be able to somehow include these extras into it in a sensible way.</p>

<p>From: Kristof Teichel &lt;<a href="mailto:k.teichel@gmail.com">k.teichel@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Thank you, Larry, for the info, as well as the quick and friendly response.</p>
<p>To give some additional context:<br>
The JCS paper I have studied and consulted a fair amount over the years. It<br>
has certainly been helpful.<br>
I would say that I have a solid working knowledge (i.e. I know the<br>
definitions and have a concept of roughly what lemmas/theorems are in<br>
there) of the theory files up to and including Public.thy.<br>
I have made modifications on Event.thy (and formerly Message.thy) and later<br>
switched to extension of Event.thy, in order to account for real-time<br>
clocks, for which I had to re-prove everything in there.<br>
Overall, these activities have certainly given me the chance of studying<br>
that material pretty carefully.<br>
Recently, I have been successful using my extensions to define a few<br>
dumbed-down protocols and proving executability and regularity goals on<br>
those.</p>
<p>However, authenticity goals have been giving me headaches forever.<br>
For some reason (probably mainly lack of skills with Isabelle syntax), I<br>
have not been successful (before cheating with protocol-independent lemmas<br>
as hinted at).<br>
I guess I will go back to the Needham-Schroeder proofs and see if my<br>
increased overall understanding since I last looked at those can give me<br>
new input.</p>
<p>Let me ask a few more actual questions:<br>
1) The protocols mostly use keyed Hash-MAC ("Hash[key] message") instead of<br>
classical signatures for authentiction - would you suppose that had<br>
something to do with my troubles (are these perhaps less friendly for<br>
provability than straight-up signatures)?<br>
2) Is there anyone still actively engaging in activities related to the<br>
Inductive Approach who would possibly be willing to have an exchange about<br>
the more intricate aspects of what I am trying to do? Or anyone who gives<br>
anything tutorial-like on it?</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Kristof</p>
<p>P.S.: Only recently did I discover that there were potentially valuable<br>
extensions in the "Guard" subdirectory.<br>
I am not yet familiar with any of the material really, but have given it a<br>
scan. I did notice there are quite a few protocol-independent formulations<br>
in there.<br>
I was hoping you or Frédéric could shine some light on what these<br>
extensions can and cannot do, specifically for authentication goals.<br>
For some reason, I have neglected Frédéric's Paper (" An Isabelle<br>
formalization of protocol-independent secrecy with an application to<br>
e-commerce") on this so far, I will rectify that ASAP.</p>

<p>The recursive authentication protocol uses the same method. It is also described in the JCS paper and formalised as Recur.thy.</p>

<p>From: Jean Martina &lt;<a href="mailto:jean.martina@cl.cam.ac.uk">jean.martina@cl.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
The issue here is that Hash-MAC are not actual signatures. They provide<br>
a weaker form of authentication. All the authentication proofs for<br>
digital signatures in the standard theories, will be too strong for<br>
that. The authentication Hash-MAC provide can only be available to the<br>
recipient of the message based on the fact that that "Hash[key] message"<br>
was not seen before by him. It is not available to anyone else. This<br>
makes some other proofs tricky.</p>
<p>If you analyse the authenticity proofs for Needham-Schroeder Shared Key<br>
Protocol and compare them with Needham-Schroeder Public Key Protocol,<br>
you will see that they yield different things, although both are called<br>
authenticity. Definitely, what you need is the weaker form that is used<br>
in NSSKP since you are using a shared key.</p>

<p>Jean<br>

Hey Jean,</p>
<p>nice to hear from you again.</p>
<p>That's a very interesting distinction you're pointing out.<br>
I've compared the two Needham-Schroder files and also taken a look at<br>
Recur.thy.</p>
<p>I will absolutely keep it mind for my formalizations and proofs.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Kristof</p>
