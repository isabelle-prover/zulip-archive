<p>CALL FOR PAPERS, TALKS, and SYSTEM DEMONSTRATIONS</p>
<p>AUTOMATHEO 2010</p>
<p>The 2010 Workshop on Automated Mathematical Theory Exploration</p>
<p><a href="http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/events/automatheo-2010/">http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/events/automatheo-2010/</a></p>
<p>14-15 July 2010, Edinburgh, UK<br>
a FLoC 2010 affiliated workshop of IJCAR and ITP.</p>
<p>About the Automatheo workshop:</p>
<p>Automated mathematical theory exploration is an exciting emerging<br>
research topic for mathematicians, developers of formalised<br>
mathematics, and those working on verified software. This topic<br>
concerns the theory and practice of developing software systems that<br>
support the automated development of mathematical theories, including<br>
the invention of definitions, theorems, conjectures, problems,<br>
examples and algorithms. The workshop aims to highlight the research<br>
area and foster collaboration amongst those working in software<br>
verification, formalised mathematics, and mathematical research, as<br>
well as help provide a shared understanding of the theory and tools<br>
for automated invention and discovery of mathematical theories.</p>
<p>In this workshop, we want to encourage dissemination of knowledge as<br>
well as interaction between researchers. To facilitate this, the<br>
programme will start with talks and be followed by demo and tutorial<br>
sessions in smaller groups. Participants will experiment with and use<br>
the various systems, pose challenge problems, and develop a clear<br>
understanding of the available technologies and concepts.</p>
<p>Invited Speakers: John Harrison and Dana S. Scott</p>
<p>Call for Participation and Submissions:</p>
<p>We invite proposals to give a talk and/or to provide a demo. Topics<br>
and demonstrations of interest include all aspects of mathematical<br>
theory exploration, especially the invention and discovery steps in<br>
the development of mathematical theories.  This includes, but is not<br>
limited to position statements, descriptions of important features,<br>
theories of theory exploration, and systems descriptions.  We also<br>
welcome contributions on the application of theory exploration to<br>
other parts of mathematics, computer science and software engineering,<br>
as well as to other sciences such as physics and biology.</p>
<p>Submissions will be accepted based on light reviewing of extended<br>
abstracts by a review panel of researchers interested in the area. The<br>
extended abstracts will not be archival publications, but will be<br>
published online. Accepted submissions will also be disseminated in an<br>
informal proceedings which will be available during the workshop.</p>
<p>Please submit extended abstracts and demo proposals by easychair:<br>
<a href="https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=automatheo2010">https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=automatheo2010</a><br>
These should not be longer than 15 pages and can be as short as 1<br>
page. We suggest, but do not require, that you use the easychair style<br>
for formatting submissions. This is available from:<br>
