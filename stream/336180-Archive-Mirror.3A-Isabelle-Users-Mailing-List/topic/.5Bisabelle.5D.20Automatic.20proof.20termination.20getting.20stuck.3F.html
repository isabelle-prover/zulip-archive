Hello,</p>
<p>I have a set of 6 mutually recursive functions and the attempt to prove<br>
termination with lexicographic order is not returning even after 30<br>
minutes. If I reduce it back to 5 functions then it does (but not<br>
immediately; it takes about 10 minutes).</p>
<p>Is there any tracing available for me to see what is happening or a timeout<br>
that I can set that will result in the matrix (possibly incomplete) being<br>
shown?</p>
<p>I could use the order it finds with the 5-function termination proof and<br>
attempt to extend it to include the sixth one but the order is a product of<br>
four measures built out of &lt;<em>mlex</em>&gt; and case_sum, and it is tricky keeping<br>
track of things and could be brittle when adding additional functions or<br>
recursive calls.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Mark</p>

Hi Mark,</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The lexcographic_order method enumerates a set of possible candidates<br>
for measure functions. Unfortunately, if you have n mutually recursive<br>
functions with k arguments each, then there are ~ k^n candidates, which<br>
will lead to ~ k^2n proof obligations being tried. This probably<br>
explains what you are seeing.</p>
<p>I don't think there is any tracing that would help you here.</p>
<p>Here are some options you might try:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Try the "size_change" method. It deals differently with mutual<br>
recursion, and IIRC it does not have the blowup problem. There may be<br>
other issues, but it is worth a try.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come up with the termination argument yourself. Often, this is not so<br>
hard even for complicated definitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplify the definition (possibly deriving the original form afterwards).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This sounds brittle indeed. Another way of making it more robust (though<br>
quite verbose) would be to define 6 (mutually recursive) measure<br>
functions, and using them for the termination argument. Then at least it<br>
is clear how to extend it later...</p>
<p>Hope this helps (a bit)</p>
