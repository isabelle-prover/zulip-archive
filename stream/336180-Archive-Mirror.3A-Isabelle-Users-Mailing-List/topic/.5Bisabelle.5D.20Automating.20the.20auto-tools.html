<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I'm in jEdit, so I first open up a second view of jEdit with "View/New <br>
View".</p>
<p>I have a theorem:</p>
<p>theorem emS_is_unique1:<br>
   "!u. (!x. ~(x IN u)) --&gt; u EQ emS"</p>
<p>I highlight it, and run my script. It creates a new file which imports <br>
my main file, like this:</p>
<p>theory sTs_Simp_X<br>
imports sTs_Simp<br>
begin</p>
<p>theorem emS_is_unique1_S:<br>
   "!u. (!x. ~(x IN u)) --&gt; u EQ emS"<br>
   apply(auto) sledgehammer<br>
   nitpick[sat_solver=MiniSat_JNI]<br>
   nitpick[sat_solver=SAT4J]<br>
   oops</p>
<p>theorem emS_is_unique1_Sn:<br>
   "~(!u. (!x. ~(x IN u)) --&gt; u EQ emS)"<br>
   apply(auto) sledgehammer<br>
   nitpick[sat_solver=MiniSat_JNI]<br>
   nitpick[sat_solver=SAT4J]<br>
   oops<br>
end</p>
<p>It's importing all my nitpick and sledgehammer settings from the main file.</p>
<p>It runs sledgehammer and nitpick on the theorem and its negation. It <br>
takes a while, that's why I have the two jEdit views. I watch sTs_Simp_X <br>
in one jEdit view and can work on sTs_Simp in the other.</p>
<p>The continuous prover works on sTs_Simp_X while I'm working on sTs_Simp. <br>
Of course, if I do a save on my main file, the auto-provers start over <br>
in sTs_Simp_X, which is why I try to leave it alone, but that's hard to <br>
do. I want to click around in sTs_Simp_X to see if anything is <br>
happening. I reduce the 20 provers down to e, spass, and z3, to speed <br>
things up; I'll probably put more back in.</p>
<p>I haven't completely figured out how the continuous prover works. In a <br>
big file, it sometimes seems to go into a dormant state if I don't go <br>
all the way to the bottom and click on the line where the "end" <br>
statement is.</p>
<p>I would attach the script, but it's done in a scripting language for <br>
WinEdt. jEdit has a scripting language, but I don't know how to use it <br>
except for very simple macros for key sequences.</p>
<p>I now return to the drudgery of tutorials and exercises.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

You'd actually want this:</p>
<p>nitpick[sat_solver=MiniSat_JNI]<br>
   nitpick[sat_solver=SAT4J]<br>
   apply(auto)<br>
   sledgehammer</p>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<p>apply(auto)<br>
   sledgehammer<br>
   nitpick[sat_solver=MiniSat_JNI]<br>
   nitpick[sat_solver=SAT4J]</p>
<p>Since nitpick would only work on the subgoal after the apply(auto).</p>

It should process more or less to the point where you are looking at in <br>
the editor. This saves a lot of computing effort, when you are editing <br>
something in the middle of a big theory -- otherwise the cpu would <br>
constantly be spinning, heating up your computer and wasting your <br>
battery power.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Okay. I guess the general rule is that if some code can be seen in a <br>
jEdit view, then the continuous prover will work on the file up to that <br>
point.</p>
<p>To belabor the point, I suppose if I had 10 jEdit views open of 10 <br>
different .thy files, the continuous prover would try to work on all of <br>
them up to the code that could be seen in each view.</p>
<p>That's how it appears. I re-generate the tester file from the theorem. I <br>
click back on the jEdit view which has my main file. jEdit asks me if I <br>
want to reload the re-generated file. I say yes, and the re-generated <br>
tester file gets reloaded in both jEdit windows, and the continuous <br>
prover starts working away on the view that shows it. All of the code <br>
for the tester file can be seen, so the continuous prover works until it <br>
gets to the end.</p>
<p>I broke the two tester theorems into four: Sledgehammer on the theorem. <br>
Nitpick on the theorem. Nitpick on the negation. Sledgehammer on the <br>
negation.</p>
<p>LEARNING BY ACCIDENT WITH AUTO-TOOLS</p>
<p>By accident, I found out that importing my complete file will allow <br>
Sledgehammer and Nitpick to find things they otherwise couldn't find, <br>
which makes sense to do for the purposes of trying to find inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Being back in my original file, rather than a simplified version for <br>
experimenting, I had the incorrect axiom uncommented out,</p>
<p>(x IN u &lt;-&gt; x IN v) --&gt; u = v,</p>
<p>instead of the commented correct version,</p>
<p>!u. !v. (!x. x IN u &lt;-&gt; x IN v) --&gt; u = v</p>
<p>In my main file, I have the theorem stated before another axiom because <br>
I don't want the axiom to be used to prove the theorem.</p>
<p>Well, in my tester file, where the negation of the theorem is being <br>
tested by Nitpick and Sledgehammer, spass and e found proofs for the <br>
negation using my additional axiom, though yices and Z3 didn't.</p>
<p>Lesson? Axioms. You don't want them, which has been addressed. If you <br>
use them, be afraid. Very afraid.</p>
<p>Additional lesson? I want to put back in some of those provers to see <br>
who can find the inconsistency and who can't.</p>
<p>The prover e tells me:</p>
<p>"The prover found a type-unsound proof ... even though a supposedly <br>
type-sound encoding was used (or, less likely, your axioms are <br>
inconsistent). Please report this to the Isabelle developers."</p>
<p>We understand that Jasmin or another develop had his peers in mind when <br>
he said, "or, less likely, your axioms are inconsistent".</p>
<p>I choose the spass metis theorem. After inserting it, in the output <br>
window, it tells me "Metis: the assumptions are inconsistent".</p>
<p>I comment out the wrong formula and un-comment the right formula. The <br>
theorem is proved, and nothing else shows up wrong at this point.</p>
<p>Sledgehammer or Nitpick completing their attempts is slowest when I try <br>
to disprove what's true, and try to prove what's not true.</p>
<p>Of course, I have the timeouts for both set to 120 seconds.</p>
<p>I need to experiment on Linux under VirtualBox to see what kind of <br>
performance I get. I dread setting it all up, and that kind of setup <br>
isn't totally trouble free either.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Yes.  It also means that a lot of editor views on different spots in some <br>
library can cost a lot of performance for continous checking.</p>
<p>You can also control the range of checking a little bit: the Prover <br>
Session panel has a "Check" button, which tells to prover to check the <br>
whole of the current buffer, until you "Cancel" or recommence normal <br>
editing.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
With a 480 second timeout, these are provers which found the <br>
inconsistency due to the trivial mistake in the axiom:</p>
<p>e<br>
metis<br>
spass<br>
spass_new<br>
z3_tptp<br>
remote_e_sine<br>
remote_iprover<br>
remote_iprover_eq<br>
remote_leo2<br>
remote_satallax<br>
remote_vampire</p>
<p>Of note is that z3_tptp found it but not z3. Note to self: Leave z3_tptp in.</p>
<p>Provers that attempted it:</p>
<p>metis smt dummy_thf e spass spass_new spass_old<br>
z3_tptp cvc3 yices z3 remote_e_sine remote_e_tofof<br>
remote_iprover remote_iprover_eq remote_leo2 remote_satallax<br>
remote_snark remote_vampire remote_waldmeister</p>
<p>Note to self: Put the remote provers in that were successful. They <br>
shouldn't add too much of a burden on my CPU.</p>
<p>With a 480 second timeout, the right axiom in, and me waiting much <br>
longer than 480 seconds, sledgehammer didn't find a proof for the <br>
negated theorem.</p>
<p>I ran with a 480 second timeout, with these provers:</p>
<p>e metis spass spass_new z3 z3_tptp remote_e_sine remote_iprover<br>
   remote_iprover_eq remote_leo2 remote_satallax remote_vampire</p>
<p>At 480 seconds, e, metis, spass, and spass_new timed out. They had all <br>
been sucking up 25% of my CPU processing. At that point z3 kicked in <br>
using 25% of my CPU until it got an error after 2 minutes. Sledgehammer <br>
was still running, so I figured it was waiting on the remote provers to <br>
signal that they had timed out after 480 seconds of processing, which, <br>
it appears, was going to be spread out over however many minutes it <br>
would take for me to get my 480 seconds of processing, the remote <br>
servers also trying to prove theorems for the rest of the world, trying <br>
in vain, at least for the negation of mine, I hope.</p>
<p>And those prover processes don't terminate very well. You have to help <br>
them out, and kill them sometimes. For Windows, it helps to have the <br>
process explorer utility:</p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx</a></p>
<p>However, killing them seems to cause problems, so I think it's best to <br>
let them terminate normally.</p>
<p>I learned something important here. Every prover's going to get its 480 <br>
seconds to try and do something.</p>
<p>But every time I do a keystroke in a file that the tester file is <br>
importing, the continuous prover starts over, so I need to change my <br>
script to accommodate for that.</p>

I'm not editing big files yet, although they've become big enough that I <br>
try not to do a save on a file in my other editor, or jEdit will reload <br>
the whole thing and prove it all from the top.</p>
<p>I'll try to remember the check button, but I forsee building up theories <br>
hierarchically so I can build the heap for what I'm doing. For anything <br>
that's in the heap, speed's not a problem, as far as I can tell. Speed <br>
problems for sessions in src/HOL went away after I built the heap for them.</p>
<p>The way you have things working is not a problem with me. I've started <br>
to use 2 views as my standard setup. The edits stay in sync, and the <br>
prover for the two views is the same prover.</p>
<p>Any keystroke in a file that my test file imports causes the prover to <br>
start over in that file, but I now create a copy of my working file for <br>
my tester file to import, so that doesn't happen.</p>
<p>The continuous prover works good for me. I don't have any longing for <br>
manually stepping through a theory like in PG, but I have decently fast <br>
computer. It's not extraordinarily fast. It's an i3 with 16GB of ram.</p>
