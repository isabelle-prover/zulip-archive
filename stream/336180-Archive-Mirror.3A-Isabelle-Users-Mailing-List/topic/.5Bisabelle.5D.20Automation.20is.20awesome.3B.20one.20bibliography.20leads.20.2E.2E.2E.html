<p>From: <a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a><br>
This comment falls under the "Dude, this is awesome" category, and no <br>
reply is needed. I try to keep my comments to a minimum, but I make this <br>
one.</p>
<p>Bibliographies leading to bibliographies led me to Blanchett's <br>
"Automatic Proofs and Refutations for Higher-Order Logic" <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/%7Eblanchet/">http://www4.in.tum.de/%7Eblanchet/</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>There are developers of other provers who listen in, so this comment <br>
could also serve as a feature request from one user, me, for their products.</p>
<p>I've said that I don't care about automatic proving. For my purposes, <br>
whatever I prove I have to understand, so automatic proving doesn't help <br>
me unless I can be shown the automatic prover's proof, and understand <br>
the details, or have a general idea of what the prover did. My intended <br>
audience, by and large, also won't be impressed by automatic proofs. <br>
There has to be educational content in the details of my proofs, where <br>
the amount of detail has to be balanced (which, of course, requires some <br>
auto proving), but where there isn't a total absence of details.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as to counterexamples, there's no requirement that I <br>
understand anything other than that the counterexample has proven me <br>
wrong, so I'll be keeping in mind the Isabelle tools that will look for <br>
counterexamples. As Blanchett says,</p>
<p>Novices and experts alike can enter invalid formulas and find <br>
themselves wasting hours<br>
     (or days) on an impossible proof; once they identify and correct <br>
the error, the proof is often easy.</p>
<p>I saw in the past a little of the results of Quickcheck, but I had <br>
forgotten about the counterexample tools.</p>
<p>But back to automatic proving, I'm sure it'll come in handy when I have <br>
"The Important Promising Conjecture", or even under less important <br>
circumstances. What I think I don't want, I sometimes do want.</p>
<p>Power is whatever you need. I had a mini-debate with someone who had no <br>
sympathy with the idea that I needed a proof assistant instead of an <br>
automatic prover. Power to him was automatic proving. Power to me was <br>
being able to specify the proof steps. I guess both are powerful, since <br>
both take a massive amount of work to implement.</p>
