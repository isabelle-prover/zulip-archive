Hi,</p>
<p>I tried to post this commercial earlier today, but probably it got  <br>
lost as spam :-)</p>
<p>Recently I thought about what kind of programming language I would  <br>
like to program in. I came up with a couple of attributes like  <br>
dynamically typed, but with a syntax that has somewhat less brackets  <br>
than Lisp, and has a feel like Standard ML or Scala. It should also  <br>
seamlessly integrate object-oriented and purely functional  <br>
programming. I didn't see such a language out there, and decided to  <br>
design one. The result is available at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/babel-17/">http://code.google.com/p/babel-17/</a> <br>
   . It is still very experimental, and the language might still  <br>
change a lot. I know that a lot of Isabelle users feel comfortable  <br>
with functional programming (maybe not so much  with "dynamically  <br>
typed"), so maybe somebody here wants to check it out. Comments are  <br>
welcome.</p>
<p>I plan to apply it to interactive theorem proving, but that's not  <br>
there yet.</p>
