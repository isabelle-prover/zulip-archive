<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I don't expect anything back on this, and I'm not trying to convince <br>
anyone of anything, but I send it in anyway. I got the important parts <br>
of my IsarToLatex markup language finished/started, and now I'm ready to <br>
start using it. The goal is, after all, to prove things, not just mess <br>
around with software.</p>
<p>My last email I thought there wouldn't be anything for anyone to say, <br>
but then I got an important proof from Christian Sternagel; though the <br>
proof is trivial,  the result is not unimportant, and the discussion is <br>
and was instructive.</p>
<p>My use of that proof would be Example 1.1.8, Theorem 1.1.9, and Proof <br>
1.1.9.1 of the attached PDF, pages 3 and 4.</p>
<p>My nifty script allows you to see from the PDF what line numbers to look <br>
for in the THY, which would be lines 168, 220, and 226.</p>
<p>The basic idea of my humble man's WYSIWYG is:</p>
<p>1) Create markup delimiters by subscripting or superscripting select <br>
ASCII or \&lt;...&gt; characters,<br>
2) in non-standard ways,<br>
3) that make the symbols smaller and more discrete,<br>
4) but yet you can still recognize them and not confuse them for similar <br>
looking characters, even when using a small font.</p>
<p>As to why I want a humble man's WYSIWYG, I won't explain that.</p>
<p>I have it to where there's a close correlation between how the THY <br>
looks, and how the PDF looks. I still have to compile to make sure I <br>
haven't made mistakes, but by not having to put in newlines for arrays, <br>
I should make a few less mistakes.</p>
<p>I have the basic LaTeX commands implemented where I currently don't have <br>
to use \, {, } and \\. The basics commands are inline math, math <br>
symbols, equations and array environments, \label, \ref, \eqref, \cite, <br>
\index, \texttt, and the very important theorem environments, which I <br>
use in conjunction with a verbatim environment.</p>
<p>There are three attachments. My working THY, sTs01.thy, which is the <br>
primary file used to produce sTs.pdf. There's a jEdit screenshot for <br>
people who can't or don't want to load the THY. I printed out sTs01.thy <br>
with a PDF printer driver, but it doesn't do justice to what you see in <br>
jEdit, and the printout was 700K, where the PDF generated from LaTeX is <br>
125K.</p>
<p>The screenshot shows some of my markup characters, and I'm using a size <br>
10 font. The spellchecker is underlining some things.</p>
<p>I got some good ideas from the standard way Isabelle does the LaTeX build.</p>
<p>The import file "i" is not needed in sTs01.thy. The margins for the PDF <br>
are chosen for the way I prefer to read a PDF on a computer.</p>
<p>As to generating other THY files from a working file like sTs01.thy, <br>
such as a THY that ASCII lovers would find acceptable and useful, that's <br>
a future possibility, but not to be done if unnecessary. These days, <br>
most people don't expect HTML pages to be converted to TXT files.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>No. It's just me hacking around with the scripting language of WinEdit, <br>
which is a LaTeX editor with it's own flavor of regular expressions: <br>
<a href="http://winedt.com/">http://winedt.com/</a></p>
<p>Consequently, the scripts aren't suitable for public distribution for a <br>
product that's tied into jEdit. I'd like to switch over to jython, so I <br>
can give Isabelle users any scripts I write, but that's not going to <br>
happen for a long time.</p>
<p>I'm also not motivated at this time to get anyone to do anything that <br>
creates forks off of what's being done using only the official <br>
distribution. And there's plenty of time to wait, because I'll be making <br>
lots of additions and changes as I use what I'm doing more and more. For <br>
example, I only had a long form for \eqref, like Equation &lt;ymdhMMa&gt;, and <br>
I've added a short form, like &lt;Eq`ymdhMMa&gt;, so that only the equation <br>
number gets printed.</p>
<p>This ties into what Christian Sternagel said in the message thread that <br>
preceded this one, that if possible, it's best to get features <br>
implemented officially.</p>
<p>You can have anything you want of what I've done. To give you the <br>
scripts, I would probably have to zip up the WinEdit executable so you <br>
could figure out how the scripting language works, along with using the <br>
help file.</p>
<p>What I don't want to publicly distribute right now is my "Greek theme <br>
layout". I'd like to use it a while before I give people the LaTeX <br>
sources, not that people couldn't easily figure out what I'm doing.</p>
<p>What I'm doing is a 3900 line LaTeX preamble, with a ton of clutter and <br>
commented lines, and a 825 line WinEdit script, which is at least half <br>
commented lines.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It wasn't obvious to me, but you made it available as an identifier <br>
character, and one thing led to another. For markup tags, the <br>
subscripted reverse tick, <code>, is an excellent character, at least with 
the default jEdit font on Windows 7. A subscripted </code> and subscripted ' <br>
are distinguishable, whereas, a subscripted ' looks the same as lots of <br>
other subscripted characters.</p>
<p>But you bring up a good point that hasn't occurred to me, that all my <br>
choices of subscripted characters, though I can distinguish them with my <br>
font, other people might not be able to.</p>
<p>With Isar identifiers, using subscripted ' is not a problem because <br>
there are only a few non-alphabet or non-numeric characters that can be <br>
used, but there are a bunch of different subscripted characters that <br>
make a small little dot, and people should be able to know what <br>
character they're looking at.</p>
<p>So maybe I'll put some thought into trying to get away from using <br>
subscripted ', `, and *.</p>

<p>I use the VoxSpell plugin: <a href="http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?VoxSpell">http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?VoxSpell</a></p>
<p>It comes with a dictionary. I tried the SpellCheck plugin, which can use <br>
Aspell and several other dictionaries, including VoxSpell, if I remember <br>
right.</p>
<p>VoxSpell is the only one that checks your spelling as you type. Yea, I <br>
like it. You can't edit its dictionary directly, so I couldn't figure <br>
out how to remove a word from its dictionary, after I had added, but if <br>
you've added an underlined word, such as "word", if you right click on <br>
"word", there's an item in the menu which says "reset 'word'".</p>

<p>As far as interface, I try not to make any requests, since you were way <br>
ahead of everyone anyway.  I'm sure the HTML feature will be useful, but <br>
it's not like I need to wait on it to get what I need now. The basics of <br>
what I need now is pretty much there, and I didn't do anything.</p>
<p>I will make a pseudo-request, but first, you mention our ability to add <br>
\&lt;foo&gt; commands to our etc/symbols, and that ties into a fundamental <br>
rule I try to follow which is, "Try to never require anything of another <br>
Isabelle user other than the default distribution".</p>
<p>So, if I put new \&lt;foo&gt;s in my etc/symbols that I use for markup tags, <br>
then other people will need to use my etc/symbols file to see what I <br>
see, and I can be pretty sure that no one will want to do that.</p>
<p>This leads into the \&lt;^isub&gt; command. What I want is not just characters <br>
for markup tags, but subscripted characters. Your point is good about <br>
the possibility of subscripted primes not being distinguishable under <br>
certain fonts, but subscripted \&lt;rhd&gt;, \&lt;lhd&gt;, \&lt;lless&gt;, and <br>
\&lt;ggreater&gt;, which I'm using for equations, would probably work under <br>
most fonts.</p>
<p>Here are three things that would make for safer markup:</p>
<p>1) You leave \&lt;^isub&gt; and \&lt;^isup&gt; in Isar.<br>
2) They and the character that follows them get ignored, other than the <br>
fact that the character gets subscripted or superscripted.<br>
3) They're highlighted different than the characters following \&lt;^sub&gt; <br>
and \&lt;^sup&gt;.</p>
<p>Without item three, it might just end up confusing people, if they're <br>
trying to figure out what the markup tags are. Is it \&lt;^isub&gt;' or <br>
\&lt;^sub&gt;'? You wouldn't be able to tell.</p>
<p>That's not a request. It's merely a pseudo-request. I wouldn't know <br>
what's best.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>The confusion of \&lt;^isub&gt; version \&lt;^sub&gt; has been there all the time, <br>
starting when \&lt;^isub&gt; was introduced. There were historical reasons to <br>
have subscripts within an identifier different from subscripts as part of <br>
notation, because there was a built-in notation using it (a variant of <br>
application).  So there might actually be a chance now to unify identifier <br>
syntax to use \&lt;^sub&gt; only, and drop the special rendering of \&lt;^isub&gt; <br>
\&lt;^isup&gt; in Isabelle/jEdit.</p>
<p>In general, the jEdit text view can render "\&lt;^foo&gt;\&lt;bar&gt;" or "\&lt;^foo&gt;a" <br>
in almost arbitrary ways that fit on a 1-dimensional line of text.  Any <br>
affine transformation on the font can be applied.  For \&lt;^sub&gt;a the glyph <br>
for \&lt;^sub&gt; is made very thin (and in the next release also with 100% <br>
transparency) and the "a" is scaled/translated to give a nice subscript <br>
(nicer than the official Java subscript style).</p>
<p>One could also change the font family on the spot, for each of the two <br>
symbols separately, but this is presently not done.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I answer those questions after a few preliminary remarks.</p>
<p>In place of \&lt;^isub&gt;, I'll call what I want \&lt;^msub&gt;, for user-markup <br>
subscript. I want to have two different subscript commands, the normal <br>
one, \&lt;^sub&gt; (which you've said will be the only one), and this new <br>
command \&lt;^msub&gt;.</p>
<p>I want to write something like this:</p>
<p>--"\&lt;^msub&gt;' Please consider the equation  \&lt;^msub&gt;'x+1\&lt;^msub&gt;'  in <br>
theorem \&lt;^msub&gt;*my\&lt;^sub&gt;'theorem\&lt;^msub&gt;*."</p>
<p>This above is an Isar comment that will become normal LaTeX text, that <br>
is, text in a text{<em>...</em>}.</p>
<p>1) The  --"\&lt;^msub&gt;'..." marks it as normal LaTeX text that's outside of <br>
any other environment.<br>
2) The \&lt;^msub&gt;'....\&lt;^msub&gt;' is a math inline equation.<br>
3) The \&lt;^msub*.....\&lt;^msub&gt;* is typewriter font.<br>
4) The "my\&lt;^sub&gt;'theorem" is a normal Isar identifier with the allowed <br>
subscripted prime, \&lt;^sub&gt;', in the name. I will have possibly copied <br>
and pasted "my\&lt;^sub&gt;'theorem" into the comment. Plus, if \&lt;^sub&gt;' is <br>
formally part of the identifier, then I definitely don't want to use <br>
another character in its place, even if its in a comment.</p>
<p>I used the word "ignored" because I got confused a little. I've only <br>
been talking about using \&lt;^isub&gt; inside a comment, --"...", where I can <br>
already do what I want with it.</p>
<p>I'll expand on describing these new commands, \&lt;^msub&gt; and \&lt;^msup&gt;.</p>
<p>1) They are reserved for user's use. A user can interpret a \&lt;^msub&gt; or <br>
\&lt;^msup&gt; subscripted or superscripted character any way they want.<br>
2) They hide nothing. They subscript or superscript the character that <br>
follows them in a reasonably normal manner.<br>
3) The character that they subscript or superscript is distinguishable <br>
from characters subscripted and superscripted with \&lt;^sub&gt; and \&lt;^sup&gt;.<br>
4) They can be used anywhere in a THY file.</p>
<p>Item 4 would be where you would sometimes need to "ignore" a \&lt;^msub&gt; or <br>
\&lt;^msup&gt;, and the character after them.</p>
<p>I haven't even been wanting to markup anything outside of a --"..." <br>
comment, but I throw out item 4 to make the use of \&lt;^msub&gt; and \&lt;^msup&gt; <br>
as general as possible.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I specifically answer your two questions to make <br>
sure I have.</p>
<p>1) "Does that mean you want to write "foo\&lt;^sub&gt;\&lt;lless&gt;" as identifier?"</p>
<p>No. The rules and available characters for identifiers are fine with me. <br>
Part of the reason I want a \&lt;^msub&gt; is because I heavily use \&lt;^isub&gt;' <br>
in identifier names, so trying to use \&lt;^isub&gt;'.....\&lt;^isub&gt;' as <br>
delimited text can't easily be done. In general I have to be careful <br>
about trying to use \&lt;^isub&gt;' to create pairs of delimiters, and ' is a <br>
great subscripted character because it's subtle and it's easy to type.</p>
<p>2) "Or \&lt;^sub&gt;\&lt;lless&gt; anywhere in the Isar outer syntax to be like a <br>
blank? ".</p>
<p>No. With this simple markup I'm talking about, I don't want anything to <br>
be completely hidden. If I decide to use markup, like</p>
<p>\&lt;^msub&gt;\&lt;lless&gt;a big equation array\&lt;^msub&gt;\&lt;ggreater&gt;,</p>
<p>though I want \&lt;lless&gt; and \&lt;ggreater&gt; to be small, I want to know that <br>
they're there, and recognize what they are.</p>
<p>If you have something fancy in mind to give us, that's fine, but my <br>
system is simply based on typing characters in a normal way. We need to <br>
see what we typed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, the jEdit text view can render "\&lt;^foo&gt;\&lt;bar&gt;" or <br>
"\&lt;^foo&gt;a" in almost arbitrary ways that fit on a 1-dimensional line <br>

to give a nice subscript (nicer than the official Java subscript style).</p>
<p>One could also change the font family on the spot, for each of the two <br>
symbols separately, but this is presently not done.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brings up a restatement of one of my rules, which would be, "The <br>
THY can only be edited in a way which conforms to the rules".</p>
<p>I can do all the preprocessing I want on a THY before I feed it to <br>
LaTeX, but if someone wants to open up one of my THYs, then I want them <br>
to see what I have been seeing, and I don't them to get any errors.</p>
<p>Basically, even if I could figure out a way to do a lot of preprocessing <br>
on the text in a THY before it got to your prover engine, I wouldn't <br>
want to do it, unless it performed some great magic, but not I'm a <br>
magician in these matters. The only "One" making changes would be you. I <br>
just work within the rules.</p>

First, I now use \&lt;^usub&gt; and \&lt;^usup&gt; as the new, hypothetical commands <br>
you will supply in Isar. The "u" is to emphasize "user reserved". It <br>
could be that you want your own \&lt;^psub&gt; and \&lt;^psup&gt; "prover reserved" <br>
markup commands.</p>
<p>(1) To clarify, "ignore" means that \&lt;^usub&gt;&lt;ASCII or Unicode character&gt; <br>
will get parsed for correct syntax, then get displayed as a subscripted <br>
character (different looking than the use of \&lt;^sub&gt;), but not get used <br>
in any way by the prover engine, and not get flagged as an error, no <br>
matter where it is in a THY file.</p>
<p>Here, I make a pseudo sales speech. For myself, I don't have to have any <br>
of this. I can modify my script to accommodate how I use Isar.</p>
<p>Suppose you gave us three control characters that behave as described <br>
by, or similar to, (1): \&lt;^usub&gt;, \&lt;^usup&gt;, and \&lt;^uchar&gt;, where <br>
\&lt;^uchar&gt; simply displays the character in a uniquely visible way.</p>
<p>You would then free up every ASCII and Unicode character to be used as a <br>
markup tag in a THY.</p>
<p>The markup we're talking about is more general than HTML or LaTeX <br>
markup. We could call it "preprocessing markup". It would give the user <br>
the ability to use single characters, single subscripted characters, and <br>
single superscripted characters as markup tags for any kind of <br>
preprocessing they would want to do.</p>
<p>Myself, I would be using a lot of single characters tags, and I don't <br>
think I would ever have to use more than two characters to create my <br>
delimiters.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

It seems like this would all turn out to be something like one character <br>
comments that get implemented like (<em>...</em>), other than having to come up <br>
with a good way to fit in how they would look.</p>
<p>But I would have eventually settled on using \&lt;^sub&gt; for this, since <br>
I've only been using \&lt;^isub&gt;. It pays to get a little information here <br>
and there. It would have been a rude awakening after it occurred to me <br>
that \&lt;^sub&gt; was the perfect solution all along, and after using the <br>
perfect solution for 4 months, the perfect solution then disappeared in <br>
the upgrade in 2013.</p>
<p>You can upgrade my psuedo-request and psuedo-sales speech to the real thing.</p>

command \&lt;^msub&gt;.</p>
<p>I want to write something like this:</p>
<p>--"\&lt;^msub&gt;' Please consider the equation  \&lt;^msub&gt;'x+1\&lt;^msub&gt;'  in theorem <br>
\&lt;^msub&gt;*my\&lt;^sub&gt;'theorem\&lt;^msub&gt;*."</p>
<p>This above is an Isar comment that will become normal LaTeX text, that is, <br>
text in a text{<em>...</em>}.</p>
<p>1) The  --"\&lt;^msub&gt;'..." marks it as normal LaTeX text that's outside of any <br>
other environment.<br>
2) The \&lt;^msub&gt;'....\&lt;^msub&gt;' is a math inline equation.<br>
3) The \&lt;^msub*.....\&lt;^msub&gt;* is typewriter font.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll expand on describing these new commands, \&lt;^msub&gt; and \&lt;^msup&gt;.</p>
<p>1) They are reserved for user's use. A user can interpret a \&lt;^msub&gt; or <br>
\&lt;^msup&gt; subscripted or superscripted character any way they want.<br>
2) They hide nothing. They subscript or superscript the character that <br>
follows them in a reasonably normal manner.<br>
3) The character that they subscript or superscript is distinguishable from <br>
characters subscripted and superscripted with \&lt;^sub&gt; and \&lt;^sup&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would call that control symbol \&lt;^mark&gt; to make its logical function <br>
more clear.  The rendering engine would merely have to assign it to some <br>
font style + color change, like it does already for \&lt;^sub&gt; in a hardwired <br>
manner.  That would have to become a bit more flexible, to allow <br>
etc/symbols changing the behaviour of control symbols.</p>
<p>(This is merely a summary of what I distilled from above, not any promise <br>
that this will come in the next release.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4) They can be used anywhere in a THY file.</p>
<p>Item 4 would be where you would sometimes need to "ignore" a \&lt;^msub&gt; or <br>
\&lt;^msup&gt;, and the character after them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I haven't even been wanting to markup anything outside of a --"..." <br>
comment, but I throw out item 4 to make the use of \&lt;^msub&gt; and \&lt;^msup&gt; <br>
as general as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it is not required there is no point to think about it too much.</p>
<p>Assigning phyisical rendering to control symbols is one thing, but <br>
specifying a certain meaning as part of the syntax is another.  The latter <br>
is usually avoided, and the etc/symbols file does not cover that at all. <br>
E.g. you can't say that something should be a "letter", "digit", "blank" <br>
that was not known as such before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This brings up a restatement of one of my rules, which would be, "The <br>
THY can only be edited in a way which conforms to the rules".</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Inventing Isabelle symbols that are not used elsewhere is perfectly within <br>
the rules of the free-form typesetting of Isabelle documents.  You can <br>
have your scripts to post-process the symbols in the "text" ranges, and <br>
people have done that before.  It merely needs an awarenes that you don't <br>
"declare" use of special symbols formally, so there is always a potential <br>
to clash with other people's scripts and tools.  But this is the same in <br>
regular LaTeX.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
So I was being overly ambitious to help other people out, not myself.</p>
<p>For myself, all I need is this:</p>
<p>(1) What is now called \&lt;^isub&gt;, you rename to \&lt;^sub&gt;.<br>
(2) What is now called \&lt;^sub&gt;, you rename to \&lt;^mark&gt;.</p>
<p>Item (1) is what you've already implemented in the development version <br>
(so I understand).</p>
<p>Item (2) is merely renaming a control symbol that has been freed up.</p>
<p>I wouldn't need anything special to distinguish between the use of <br>
\&lt;^sub&gt; and \&lt;^mark&gt;. Context would tell me which was being used.</p>
<p>If you were to tell me today that item (2) is what's going to be done, <br>
then I would just start using \&lt;^sub&gt; as my markup command. It would <br>
make the search and replace in my script fairly mindless, which is the <br>
way I like it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the hypothetical gift. I appreciate it, hypothetically.</p>
<p>If inclined, you would also rename what is now \&lt;^sup&gt; to make it a <br>
markup control symbol. The result would be that, effectively, no <br>
commands are being taken away from Isar. If \&lt;^mark&gt; was being used, and <br>
it looked like \&lt;^sub&gt;, that just means that when a THY was being marked <br>
up, it would require more experience from the user.</p>
