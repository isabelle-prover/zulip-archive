No one needs to respond to this, but I make this a global request, <br>
rather than just mention it in another email I'm working on.</p>
<p>I've been getting some mileage out of a short example using lifting that <br>
Brian Huffman provided me on Stackoverflow, and just using what I see in <br>
the sources as templates, but I don't have any real understanding of <br>
what's going on.</p>
<p>I'm seeing quotient types and lifting show up in lots of places, but I <br>
haven't noticed anything in the way of tutorials, and even searches in <br>
the collection of most documents don't return much, if anything.</p>
<p>In isar-ref.pdf, lifting is all through the document, which probably is <br>
a big part of why I've been thinking I see it mentioned a lot.</p>
<p>It'd be nice to have something along the lines of the locales, classes, <br>
codegen, nitpick, sledgehammer, and functions documents.</p>
<p>I assume no one has time. That's why I say there's no need to respond.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

To provide "some real understanding of what's going on," you may wish to<br>
check one of the original writings about quotient types and lifting,<br>
written about the HOL4 implementation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trustworthytools.com/quotients/quotient.pdf">http://www.trustworthytools.com/quotients/quotient.pdf</a></p>
<p>The actual internal computations involved in lifting a theorem is rather<br>
complicated, and would take too long to describe even in a 50 page paper,<br>
but the source code of the package is rather well commented, if you can<br>
read Standard ML. The source code can be read in the source of the HOL4<br>
system, in the directory &lt;root&gt;/src/quotient/src/.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Peter,</p>
<p>Thanks for the link.</p>
<p>Mick Jagger comes to mind. You don't always get what you want, but if <br>
you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need, yea yea, <br>
you just might find, you get what you need, yea yea, and so forth.</p>
<p>You chapter seven relating the choice operator with the definite choice <br>
operator might speed up certain learning processes for me. I've been <br>
thinking I'll have to eventually figure out the choice operator, where <br>
as a running process, I've intentionally thought many times to not think <br>
about the THE operator in HOL.thy.</p>

<p>Yea, so maybe I'm talking more about a user's manual type of doc, rather <br>
than one on the theory. Partly it's just a need to document the <br>
mechanics of using lifting and quotient types with lots of example and a <br>
few high level concepts on what the syntax means.</p>
<p>Like, there's some kind of naming scheme where things are named by <br>
adding suffixes and prefixes to other things, but I haven't found where <br>
all that's documented and explained in detail to a user for the <br>
Isabelle/HOL lifting and quotients packages.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>
