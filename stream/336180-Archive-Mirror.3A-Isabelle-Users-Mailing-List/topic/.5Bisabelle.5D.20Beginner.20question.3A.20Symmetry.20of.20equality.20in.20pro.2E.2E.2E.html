<p>From: Jason Dagit &lt;<a href="mailto:dagitj@gmail.com">dagitj@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>I'm still very new to isabelle and I've been following the standard tutorial<br>
from the isabelle website.</p>
<p>I was practicing proofs using my own definitions of rev and length.</p>
<p>Here is my theory:</p>
<p>\begin{code}<br>
theory RevLength<br>
imports Datatype</p>
<p>begin</p>
<p>datatype 'a list = Nil ("[]")<br>
                 | Cons 'a "'a list" (infixr "#" 65)</p>
<p>primrec app :: "'a list =&gt; 'a list =&gt; 'a list" (infixr "++" 65)<br>
where<br>
"[] ++ ys       = ys" |<br>
"(x # xs) ++ ys = x # (xs ++ ys)"</p>
<p>primrec rev :: "'a list =&gt; 'a list" where<br>
"rev []       = []" |<br>
"rev (x # xs) = (rev xs) ++ (x # [])"</p>
<p>primrec length :: "'a list =&gt; nat" where<br>
"length [] = 0" |<br>
"length (x # xs) = 1 + length xs"</p>
<p>lemma length_suc: "Suc (length list) = length (list ++ a # [])"<br>
apply(induct_tac list)<br>
apply(auto)<br>
done</p>
<p>lemma "length xs = length (rev xs)"<br>
apply(induct_tac xs)<br>
apply(simp, simp)<br>
apply(rule length_suc)<br>
done</p>
<p>lemma "length (rev xs) = length xs"<br>
apply(induct_tac xs)<br>
apply(simp, simp)<br>
oops<br>
(* apply(simp add: length_suc)<br>
done *)<br>
\end{code}</p>
<p>What I noticed was that between the last two lemmas, the direction of the<br>
equality makes a huge difference when proving the lemma.  The lemma "length<br>
xs = length (rev xs)" is easy to prove but lemma "length (rev xs) = length<br>
xs" is much harder to prove (for me at least).</p>
<p>I thought that maybe it was because the induction variable was inside a<br>
function call on the LHS, but one of the first examples of induction in the<br>
tutorial is theorem rev_rev[simp]: "(rev (rev xs)) = xs", which is easily<br>
proven by induction on xs followed by auto.</p>
<p>I would expect "=" to be symmetric.  Is that not the case?  Is there<br>
something else going on here?</p>
<p>On a side note, I tried to define Cons as ":" instead of "#", but I kept<br>
getting ambiguous parses.  Why is that?  ":" doesn't seem to be used in the<br>
grammar that I've seen thus far in the tutorial, but it's also a hard thing<br>
to search for.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Jason</p>

<p>You don't need to prove this for yourself. If you name the second lemma <br>
e.g. rev_length, then the third lemma is just rev_length[symmetric].</p>

<p>The simplifier applies equalities only from left to right. In your case <br>
the problem is the formulation of length_suc: The right hand side <br>
contains a variable which does not occur on the left hand side, so the <br>
simplifier does not apply this rule, as it does not know how to <br>
instantiate this variable.</p>
<p>A proof easily succeeds by</p>
<p>apply(simp add: length_suc[symmetric])</p>
<p>but I suggest you change the definition of length suc. As a rule of <br>
thumb, rules to be used by the simplifier should be "simpler" on the <br>
right hand side than on the left hand side.</p>

<p>The simplifier applies equalities only from left to right. In your case the<br>

variable which does not occur on the left hand side, so the simplifier does<br>
not apply this rule, as it does not know how to instantiate this variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another thing to remember about the simplifier: It uses the<br>
assumptions of the current subgoal as rewrite rules. And as always, it<br>
only uses equalities left-to-right.</p>
<p>So in your proof script:</p>
<p>lemma "length (rev xs) = length xs"<br>
apply(induct_tac xs)<br>
apply (simp, simp)</p>
<p>you now have the following subgoal:</p>
<p>goal (1 subgoal):</p>
<ol>
<li>⋀a list.<br>
       length (rev list) = length list ⟹<br>
       length (rev list ++ a # []) = Suc (length list)</li>
</ol>
<p>Here the simplifier would replace any occurrences of "length (rev<br>
list)" in the conclusion with "length list", except that "length (rev<br>
list)" does not appear in the conclusion, so the inductive hypothesis<br>
does not get used by the simplifier.</p>
