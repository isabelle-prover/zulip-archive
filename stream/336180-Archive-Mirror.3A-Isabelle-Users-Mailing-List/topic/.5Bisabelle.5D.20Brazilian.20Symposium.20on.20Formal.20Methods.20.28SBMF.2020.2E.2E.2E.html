<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>SBMF 2017 is the twentieth of a series of events devoted to the<br>
development, dissemination and use of formal methods for the construction<br>
of high-quality computational systems. It is now a well-established event,<br>
with an international reputation.</p>
<p>In 2017, SBMF will take place in Recife, the capital of the state<br>
Pernambuco, which is located in the northeast Brazil. It is the 9th city by<br>
population in Brazil, with over 1.5 million inhabitants, and it receives<br>
more than 5 million tourists from Brazil and abroad per year.</p>
<p>SCOPE AND TOPICS</p>
<p>The aim of SBMF is to provide a venue for the presentation and discussion<br>
of high-quality work in formal methods. The topics include, but are not<br>
limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>techniques and methodologies, such as method integration; software and<br>
hardware co-design; model-driven engineering; formal aspects of popular<br>
methodologies; formal design; development methodologies with formal<br>
foundations; software evolution based on formal methods;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>specification and modelling languages, such as well-founded specification<br>
and design languages; formal aspects of popular languages; logics and<br>
semantics for programming and specification languages; code generation;<br>
formal methods and models for objects, aspects, component-based, real-time,<br>
hybrid, critical, and service-oriented systems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>theoretical foundations, such as domain theory; type systems and category<br>
theory; computational complexity of methods and models; computational<br>
models; term rewriting; models of concurrency, security and mobility;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>verification and validation, such as abstraction, modularisation and<br>
refinement techniques; program and test synthesis; correctness by<br>
construction; model checking; theorem proving; static analysis; formal<br>
techniques for software testing; software certification; formal techniques<br>
for software inspection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>education, such as teaching of, for and with formal methods;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>applications, such as experience reports on the use of formal methods;<br>
industrial case studies; tool support.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSION</p>
<p>Papers with a strong emphasis on Formal Methods, whether practical or<br>
theoretical, are invited for submission. They should present unpublished<br>
and original work that has a clear contribution to the state of the art on<br>
the theory and practice of formal methods. They should not be<br>
simultaneously submitted elsewhere.</p>
<p>Papers will be judged by at least three reviewers on the basis of<br>
originality, relevance, technical soundness and presentation quality and<br>
should contain sound theoretical or practical results. Industry papers<br>
should emphasize practical application of formal methods or report on open<br>
challenges.</p>
<p>Contributions should be written in English and be prepared using Springer’s<br>
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format. Papers may not exceed 16<br>
pages (including figures, references and appendix). Accepted papers will be<br>
published, after the conference, in a volume of LNCS.  Also, a special<br>
issue of Science of Computer Programming (Elsevier) is going to be<br>
published for the very best papers.</p>
<p>Every accepted paper MUST have at least one author registered in the<br>
symposium by the time the camera-ready copy is submitted; the registered<br>
author is also expected to  attend the symposium and present the paper.</p>
<p>Papers can be submitted via the following link:<br>

<p>ABOUT RECIFE</p>
<p>Recife stands out as a major tourist attraction, both for its beaches and<br>
for its historic sites, dating back to both the Portuguese and the Dutch<br>
colonisation of the region. The Boa Viagem beach is one of the most famous<br>
urban beaches in Brazil. Visitors get enchanted by the sandy beaches with<br>
warm green waters, and also by the complete infrastructure of hotels,<br>
restaurants and services which surrounds it. The beach of Porto de<br>
Galinhas, 60 kilometers south of Recife, has been repeatedly awarded the<br>
title of best beach in Brazil. The historic centre of Olinda, 7 kilometers<br>
north of Recife, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982, and<br>
both cities’ Carnival are among the world's most famous.</p>
<p>Recife is also considered the first gastronomic hub of the northeastern<br>
region, the second medical centre in Brazil, besides housing the greatest<br>
technological park in the country, known as Porto Digital. In Recife, you<br>
will find culture, history, food and fun all in one place.</p>
