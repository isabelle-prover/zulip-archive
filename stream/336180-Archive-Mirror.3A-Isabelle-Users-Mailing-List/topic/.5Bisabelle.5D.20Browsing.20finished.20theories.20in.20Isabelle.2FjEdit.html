<p>From: Timothy Bourke &lt;<a href="mailto:tim@tbrk.org">tim@tbrk.org</a>&gt;<br>
I want to use Isabelle to better understand the Knaster-Tarski<br>
fixpoint theorem. So, I fire up Isabelle/jEdit and use the "Search in<br>
Directory..." feature to look for "Knaster-Tarski" (BTW, it would be<br>
great if the directory list in the dialog box automatically included<br>
$ISABELLE_HOME).</p>
<p>I quickly find that there is a well explained example<br>
($ISABELLE_HOME/src/HOL/Isar_Examples/Knaster_Tarski.thy; thanks Makarius).</p>
<p>Now, looking at the theorem, I want to know the exact definition of a<br>
complete lattice, so I COMMAND/CTRL-click on "complete_lattice". The<br>
Complete_Lattices.thy file opens at the correct position but is not<br>
processed (everything is pink) due to the error "Cannot update<br>
finished theory". This means, in particular, that I cannot continue<br>
COMMAND/CTRL-clicking to follow the definitions further.</p>
<p>Thus this naive question from someone who no longer uses Isabelle<br>
every day (sniff): is there a better way of read-only browsing the<br>
contents of an open session in Isabelle/jEdit?</p>
<p>I know that the theory files can be browsed online at <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/HOL-Isar_Examples/Knaster_Tarski.html">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/HOL-Isar_Examples/Knaster_Tarski.html</a><br>
but there I cannot click on elements to see their definitions, nor use<br>
the other great features of Isabelle and Isabelle/jEdit.</p>
<p>I also know that, on a Mac, I can launch Isabelle/jEdit with<br>
  /Applications/Isabelle2016-1.app/Isabelle/bin/isabelle jedit -l Pure</p>
<p>and then open<br>
  /Applications/Isabelle2016-1.app/Isabelle/src/HOL/Main.thy</p>
<p>to browse the theories, but a slip on the keyboard risks a rebuild,<br>
and I thought I would ask the question anyway for those who are even<br>
less experienced than me.</p>
<p>This question is also something I have wondered about when teaching<br>
Isabelle. I explain to students that they can COMMAND/CTRL-click to<br>
follow definitions to learn about the underlying libraries, but they<br>
quickly come face-to-face with the same issue.</p>

<p>For directory search, anything needs to be typed manually, and in the<br>
still official jEdit release, the one bundled with Isabelle2016-1,<br>
environment variables cannot be used here. Some months ago, we have<br>
actually sorted this out on the jedit-devel list, but the jEdit guys are<br>
far behind their release schedule, so it did not make it into our<br>
December 2016 release.</p>

<p>This is an old omission in the PIDE document model. Already loaded<br>

do it soon: using offline PIDE markup in some SQLite database that is<br>

the old log files.</p>

<p>Maybe you can occasionally show your fellow non-Isabelle users the state<br>
of sophistication of Isabelle at the end of 2016. I am still hoping for<br>
other ITP systems to catch up eventually, such that the general ideas<br>
from our communities get more users out there -- not just proof-geeks<br>
who like to have a complicated and inaccesible system for their private<br>
entertainment.</p>

<p>I did not know that. That is very nice. Something similar for the<br>
directory search would be great.</p>

<p>I am happy to hear that it is in the grand design. Thank you.</p>

<p>From time to time, I do exactly that. Without want to gush, I still<br>
find Isabelle great.</p>
