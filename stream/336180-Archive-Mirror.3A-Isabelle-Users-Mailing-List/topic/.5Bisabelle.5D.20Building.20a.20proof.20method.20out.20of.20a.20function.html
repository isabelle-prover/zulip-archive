Hallo,</p>
<p>I have an executable decision procedure, say "frobnicate", that takes<br>
some parameters and yields a result. When I run</p>
<p>value "frobnicate x"</p>
<p>I get some result "y". I would now like to turn this into a proof method<br>
that proves the statement "frobnicate x = y", ideally by deduction,<br>
without relying on oracles. (I dimly remember the "eval" method that, if<br>
I recall correctly, uses the code generator and ML as an oracle, doing<br>
basically the same thing as the "value" command)</p>
<p>What is the best way to do this? At the moment, I use the CONVERSION<br>
tactical and Code_Runtime.static_holds_conv, but I am not sure what this<br>
does internally (oracle or deduction) and it is quite slow.<br>
Additionally, I have to pass a number of constants by hand as a list of<br>
@{code_name … } and I am not sure which of these I really need in order<br>
for it to work reliably.</p>
<p>So, how does one normally do these things? Ifi the conversion with<br>
static_holds_conv is the way to go, is there some way to make it faster?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Manuel</p>

Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>Florian is the expert on Code_Runtime, but here's what I know. Can you make precise which <br>
execution model evaluates the "frobnicate x" in the value example? In principle, you can <br>
use [code] with the code generator, [nbe] for normalization by evaluation and [simp] for <br>
rewriting with the simplifier. For each of these options, there's a separate method: eval, <br>
normalization and code_simp.</p>
<p>The eval method generates ML code for the statement, runs it and checks that it returns <br>
True. It cannot deal with variables in the statement.</p>
<p>normalization converts the statement into an intermediate language and symbolically <br>
executes it in the intermediate language.</p>
<p>code_simp produces a simpset with only the code equations as rewrite rules and invokes the <br>
simplifier with this simpset on the goal after preprocessing with the code_unfold rules. <br>
This meets your criteria for "no oracle", but is the slowest of the three.</p>
<p>In the code generator tutorial, Code_Runtime.static_holds_conv is listed under the column <br>
code, so I expect that it involves code generation and the ML oracle. Isabelle has no <br>
execution engine for HOL, I only know that the simplifier can be used to normalise <br>
functions, which corresponds to executing when the rewrite system are the code equations. <br>
If this is what you want, then you should try code_simp.</p>
<p>Andreas</p>

Interestingly Coq has such a builtin execution engine, and the French have <br>
invested a lot of energy into it (conceptually and performance wise).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some Coq expert users have told me that they like the <br>
Isabelle/HOL approach better for certain applications, e.g. what <br>
Isabelle/IsaFoR does with native Haskell compared to Coq/CoLoR with the<br>
on-board execution engine.</p>
<p>Doing actual LCF proofs via computation is a different thing, though.</p>

Hallo,</p>
<p>ah, very good, I did not know about the code generator tutorial.</p>
<p>I tried to use Code_Simp now, but it does not terminate even after quite<br>
some time. I then tried "value [simp]" with some examples and found the<br>
following:</p>
<p>value [simp] "[:1:] - [:1, 2::real :]"<br>
Result: "[:1:] + - [:1, 2:]" :: "real poly"</p>
<p>That is obviously not what I wanted. Does this mean that there is some<br>
problem with the way the code equations in Polynomial.thy are set up?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>What Isabelle version are you using? And what are your imports? In Isabelle2013, I get the <br>
following results (imports Complex_Main and Polynomial):</p>
<p>value [code] =&gt; "[:0, -2:]"<br>
value [nbe]  =&gt; "[:0, -2:]"<br>
value [simp] =&gt; "[: real_of_rat (1 - 1), real_of_rat (- 2) :]"</p>
<p>With the development version f6629734dd2b, I get:</p>
<p>value [code] =&gt; "Poly [0, -2]"<br>
value [nbe]  =&gt; "Poly [0, -2]"<br>
value [simp] =&gt; "[:1:] + - [:1, 2:]"</p>
<p>Two months ago, Florian changed in 3cc46b8cca5e the code setup for polynomials from <br>
explicit constructors 0 and pCons to an abstract type with constructor Poly and destructor <br>
coeffs. This explains why the syntax [: and :] is lost.</p>
<p>Since poly is now an abstract datatype, the code generator transforms the [code abstract] <br>
equations for code generation from "Rep (f x) = ..." to "f x = Abs (...)" where Rep is the <br>
destructor and Abs is the constructor (following the usual typedef terminology). For <br>
code_simp, however, no such preprocessing happens, i.e., the simplifier is fed directly <br>
with "Rep (f x) = ...". Therefore, evaluation with [simp] will be delayed until you <br>
destruct the values. This is only a problem for value [simp], but not for proofs by <br>
code_simp, because code_simp can only be called on terms of type bool, i.e., all <br>
polynomials in the statement will be deconstructed if needed.</p>
<p>Maybe Florian can say more how one could use change value [simp] to address this issue, <br>
possibly before the next release makes all this public.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks for the explanations so far.</p>
<p>I use the development version because, if I remember correctly, it<br>
contains some theorems that I need.</p>
<p>The reason why I asked about "value [simp]" is that code_simp seems to<br>
take a very, very long time, in fact, so long that I think it either<br>
loops or builds up some enormously big term. Other expressions involving<br>
polynomials also lead to unpleasant results, such as:</p>
<p>value [simp] "gcd [:1, 2::real :] [:3:]"<br>
Result: "smult (real_of_rat (inverse 3)) [:3:]" :: "real poly"</p>
<p>If I try to use Poly instead of [: and :], I get the following error<br>
message.</p>
<p>value "Poly [0::real]"<br>
*** Abstraction violation:<br>
*** constant Poly</p>
<p>Attempting to use any of the evaluation conversions on the ML level<br>
results in the same error message, so apparently, switching from [: … :]<br>
to Poly does not solve the problem either, it seems to make things even<br>
worse.</p>
<p>I can, of course, use evaluation instead of code_simp, but I do prefer<br>
deduction within the logic over trusted prove such as the code<br>
generator, and apart from that, I really would like to understand what<br>
is going wrong here and why.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Manuel</p>

Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>Evaluation in the simplifier is a tricky beast to debug! Recently (8e8941fea278), Florian <br>
added a tracing option code_simp_trace to see what's happening. I expect that in your <br>
application, the abstract datatypes cause the trouble. When you use polynomials of reals, <br>
you have the following types stacked into one another:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numerals with constructors One, Bit0, Bit1</li>
<li>int with constructors 0, Pos, Neg</li>
<li>Rationals as abstract datatype with constructor Frct and destructor quotient_of</li>
<li>Reals with constructor Ratreal</li>
<li>Polynomials as abstract datatype with constructor Poly and destructor coeffs</li>
</ul>
<p>Evaluation with the simplifier does not obey the call-by-value strategy of ML. There are <br>
some congruence rules for some functions like op &amp; and op | that prevent execution of the <br>
second argument, but nothing more. For normal code_datatypes like Numerals, int and Reals, <br>
this is OK, because the simplifier works bottom-up, i.e., it will first simplify the <br>
arguments of a constant (from left to right) and only then try to rewrite with the <br>
constant's code equation. For abstract datatypes, this breaks down as can be seen in your <br>
examples:</p>
<p>"inverse 3 :: rat" is not evaluated because rat is an abstract type, a quotient_of <br>
destructor would be necessary to trigger evaluation. Instead, the simplifier continues the <br>
execution with the code equations for outer constants. If these do not destruct "inverse <br>
3", this term will be passed around unevaluated. As may code equation duplicate <br>
parameters, this can yield exponentially large terms. Even worse, the duplicates are not <br>
shared (in terms of execution), i.e., if "inverse 3" is destructed later, it will be <br>
destructed and evaluated each time. In summary: evaluation in the simplifier currently <br>
does not work well for abstract datatypes. Maybe Florian has some ideas to mitigate the issue.</p>
<p>Now to your next question with Poly: 'a poly is an abstract datatype with constructor Poly <br>
and destructor quotient_of. The abstract means that the constructor Poly must not occur in <br>
anything that you execute. Otherwise, you will get an abstraction violation. For normal <br>
code generation, this check is essential for soundness, because the code generator <br>
transforms all the [code abstract] equations from destructor style to constructor style.<br>
For code_simp, however, this check is bogus because it does not do the transformation and <br>
soundness is not endangered. Nevertheless, the check currently is there. Maybe you can <br>
convince Florian to drop this check for code_simp. But this will not stop the blow-up that <br>
I have described above.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

<p>If you want the execution speed of ML, you use the code generator. If you want<br>
to go through the kernel, you use some form of the simplifier.</p>

<p>All the default decision procedures go through the kernel and use ad-hoc<br>
combinations of inference rules, including the simplifier. Those in<br>
Decision_Procs use reflection and the code generator. The big advantage of<br>
reflection is speed and the ability to prove both soundness and completeness of<br>

"inverse 3" is destructed later, it will be destructed and evaluated<br>
each time. In summary: evaluation in the simplifier currently does not<br>
work well for abstract datatypes. Maybe Florian has some ideas to<br>
mitigate the issue.</p>
<p>Now to your next question with Poly: 'a poly is an abstract datatype<br>
with constructor Poly and destructor quotient_of. The abstract means<br>
that the constructor Poly must not occur in anything that you execute.<br>
Otherwise, you will get an abstraction violation. For normal code<br>
generation, this check is essential for soundness, because the code<br>
generator transforms all the [code abstract] equations from destructor<br>
style to constructor style.<br>
For code_simp, however, this check is bogus because it does not do the<br>
transformation and soundness is not endangered. Nevertheless, the<br>
check currently is there. Maybe you can convince Florian to drop this<br>
check for code_simp. But this will not stop the blow-up that I have<br>
described above.</p>

<p>Two months ago, Florian changed in 3cc46b8cca5e the code setup for<br>
polynomials from explicit constructors 0 and pCons to an abstract type<br>
with constructor Poly and destructor coeffs. This explains why the<br>
syntax [: and :] is lost.</p>
<p>Since poly is now an abstract datatype, the code generator transforms<br>
the [code abstract] equations for code generation from "Rep (f x) =<br>
..." to "f x = Abs (...)" where Rep is the destructor and Abs is the<br>
constructor (following the usual typedef terminology). For code_simp,<br>
however, no such preprocessing happens, i.e., the simplifier is fed<br>
directly with "Rep (f x) = ...". Therefore, evaluation with [simp]<br>
will be delayed until you destruct the values. This is only a problem<br>
for value [simp], but not for proofs by code_simp, because code_simp<br>
can only be called on terms of type bool, i.e., all polynomials in the<br>
statement will be deconstructed if needed.</p>
<p>Maybe Florian can say more how one could use change value [simp] to<br>
address this issue, possibly before the next release makes all this<br>
public.</p>

Why is it wrong?  It seems a perfectly good description as I understand <br>
the structure of the system.</p>
<p>Anyone who doesn't understand the reasons for what you say isn't likely <br>
to see the expression "the ML level of Isabelle" as a "wrong idea", or <br>
"Isabelle/ML" as the only correct term.</p>

Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>(first, thanks to Andreas for the thorough analysis).</p>
<p>the short answer is that code_simp indeed in its current state does not<br>
perform well with abstract datatypes.  To mitigate this, it would need<br>
to be enriched with a non-trivial machinery to do bookkeeping on<br>
invariants at runtime, to be able to reduce redexes rep (Abs x) = x when<br>
needed.  This is definitely nothing to be done in the short run.</p>
<p>To come to your particular issue.  Usually when using the simplifier you<br>
first determine an appropriate set of rewrite rules in order to solve<br>
your problem by rewriting and then just do a specific simplifier setup<br>
suited for your problem.  Cf. the following minimalistic example</p>
<p>ML {*<br>
val numeral_syms = @{thms numeral_1_eq_1 [symmetric] numeral_2_eq_2<br>
[symmetric]};</p>
<p>fun subst_numerals ctxt =<br>
  simplify (ctxt |&gt; put_simpset HOL_basic_ss |&gt; fold<br>
(Simplifier.add_simp o mk_meta_eq) numeral_syms) o Thm.transfer<br>
(Proof_Context.theory_of ctxt)<br>
*}</p>
<p>ML {* subst_numerals @{context} @{thm nat_mult_1} *}</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
    Florian<br>
