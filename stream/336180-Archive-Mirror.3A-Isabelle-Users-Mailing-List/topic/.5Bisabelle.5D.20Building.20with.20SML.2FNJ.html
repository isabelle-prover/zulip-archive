I'm trying to build Isabelle's logics from scratch using its built-in build <br>
script. I go into my Isabelle directory and run:</p>
<p>./build Pure</p>
<p>This fails, and I've attached the resulting log file. I suspect this is an <br>
SML/NJ bug, but I thought I'd check here first, to see if anyone else has <br>
encountered this problem. I built SML/NJ 110.68 by running its <br>
config/install.sh script with the default config/targets file.</p>
<p>I might just download the pre-built logics, but if there's a bug in my setup, <br>
I still want to get rid of it before it bites again.</p>

<p>I have encountered the same problem when trying 110.68 some weeks ago. <br>
110.67 still works, although it is very big and slow compared to nimble <br>
Poly/ML.</p>

<p>Note that everything we provide by default is based on Poly/ML, see also <br>
<a href="http://www.polyml.org/">http://www.polyml.org/</a> if you really want to compile from scratch.  I am <br>
including the README of our distribution, which tells how binaries have <br>
been produced.  You can also download our Poly/ML tar.gz files and then <br>
build only the logic images.</p>
<p>SML/NJ used to be an alternative many years ago, but the relative <br>
performance compared to Poly/ML has changed so much to render it <br>
impractical -- for two reasons: (1) big heap space makes NJ inherently <br>
slow due to its stackless execution model, (2) NJ is single-threaded, but <br>
starting with Poly/ML 5.1 we have native Posix threads, which Isabelle2008 <br>
already uses to some degree for parallel theory loading.</p>
<p>Recently, parallelism in Isabelle has been improved further -- in the next <br>
release all proofs are checked concurrently.  There is also a general <br>
programming ML model based on "futures".  Moreover, threads are used for <br>
advanced interaction models, e.g. an improved version of 'sledgehammer'.  <br>
In any case, heavy-duty multithreading after Isabelle2008 will require <br>
Poly/ML 5.2.1 for stability reasons, see also <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/polyml-5.2.1/">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/polyml-5.2.1/</a></p>
<p>Poly/ML 5.2.1 also works with Isabelle2008 if you pretend it is <br>
polyml-5.2, e.g. like this in etc/settings:</p>
<p>ML_PLATFORM=x86-linux<br>
  ML_HOME="/home/polyml/polyml-5.2.1/$ML_PLATFORM"<br>
  ML_SYSTEM=polyml-5.2<br>
  ML_OPTIONS="-H 500"</p>
<p>Here ML_SYSTEM is the critical bit.</p>

i would have used Poly/ML right from the start, but I did a Google search for <br>
{poly ml licence}, which turned up the strange licence at <br>
<a href="http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/software/polyml/Get.html">http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/software/polyml/Get.html</a> as the first result. Now <br>
that I've downloaded the latest source, and checked its COPYING file, I see <br>
that Poly/ML uses the LGPL now, which I'm perfectly happy with. I'll try to <br>
get going with Poly/ML in the next two or three days.</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice.</p>
