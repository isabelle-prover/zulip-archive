25th International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE) -- Call for <br>
Volunteers<br>

<p>CADE is the major forum for the presentation of research in all aspects <br>
of automated deduction. The conference programme includes invited talks, <br>

Furthermore, the Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to <br>

historical CADE papers are presented at the conference. Moreover, to <br>
celebrate its 25th edition, CADE-25 includes a Jubilee Session on the <br>
Past, Present and Future of Automated Deduction. Renowned scientists <br>
from leading universities have agreed to give invited lectures at <br>
CADE-25. For further information, visit <a href="http://cade-25.info">http://cade-25.info</a>.</p>
<p>The CADE-25 conference will be held from the 1st to 7th of August, 2015 <br>
at the Freie Universität Berlin in Berlin-Dahlem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Volunteering at CADE-25.<br>
In order to support the organisation of CADE-25, we are seeking <br>
volunteers to help between August 1st and 7th. The duties of the <br>
volunteers are to assist the CADE-25 organisation team, for example, at <br>
the registration desk, as technical support staff during the workshop <br>
and tutorial days, as a group guide during the excursion, etc. Each <br>
volunteer is supervised by one of the senior organizers who will also be <br>
the primary contact person for that volunteer during the conference.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perks of a volunteer.<br>
In return, the volunteers will receive free registration and access to <br>
all scientific events of CADE-25, including tutorials, workshops and the <br>
main conference itself. Each volunteer is guaranteed to have at least <br>
50% free time to attend lectures at will. The remaining time is devided <br>
into a share of 2-3 days of fixed duties and a small part of "stand-by" <br>
duties, which are likely to be free time.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, upon request, we might be able to provide free (shared) <br>
accommodation in a student hostel. Please tell us upon application <br>
whether this applies to you.</p>
