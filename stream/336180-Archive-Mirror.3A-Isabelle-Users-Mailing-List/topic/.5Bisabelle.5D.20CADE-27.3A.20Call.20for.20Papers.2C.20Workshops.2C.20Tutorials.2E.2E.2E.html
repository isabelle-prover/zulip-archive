The 27th International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-27)</p>
<p>Natal, Brazil</p>
<p>25-30 August 2019</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cade-27.info">http://www.cade-27.info</a></p>
<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>CADE is the major international forum for presenting research on all <br>
aspects of automated deduction. High-quality submissions on the general <br>
topic of automated deduction, including foundations, applications, <br>
implementations, theoretical results, practical experiences and user <br>
studies are solicited.</p>
<p>Key dates:<br>
   Abstract deadline:        15 February 2019<br>
   Submission deadline:      22 February 2019</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Logics of interest include propositional, first-order, equational, <br>
higher-order, classical, description, modal, temporal, many-valued, <br>
constructive, other non-classical, meta-logics, logical frameworks, type <br>
theory, set theory, as well as any combination thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paradigms of interest include theorem proving, model building, <br>
constraint solving, computer algebra, model checking, proof checking, <br>
and their integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methods of interest include resolution, superposition, completion, <br>
saturation, term rewriting, decision procedures, model elimination, <br>
connection methods, tableaux, sequent calculi, natural deduction, as <br>
well as their supporting algorithms and data structures, including <br>
matching, unification, orderings, induction, indexing techniques, proof <br>
presentation and explanation, proof planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of interest include program analysis, verification and <br>
synthesis of software and hardware, formal methods, computational logic, <br>
computer mathematics, natural language processing, computational <br>
linguistics, knowledge representation, ontology reasoning, deductive <br>
databases, declarative programming, robotics, planning, and other areas <br>
of artificial intelligence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions can be made in two categories: regular papers and system <br>
descriptions. The page limit in Springer LNCS style is 15 pages <br>
excluding references for regular papers and 10 pages excluding <br>
references for system descriptions. Submissions must be unpublished and <br>
not submitted for publication elsewhere. They will be judged on <br>
relevance, originality, significance, correctness, and readability. <br>
System descriptions must contain a link to a working system and will <br>
also be judged on usefulness and design. Proofs of theoretical results <br>
that do not fit in the page limit, executables of systems, and input <br>
data of experiments should be made available, via a reference to a <br>
website or in an appendix of the paper. For papers containing <br>
experimental evaluations, all data needed to rerun the experiments must <br>
be available. Reviewers will be encouraged to consider this additional <br>
material, but submissions must be self-contained within the respective <br>
page limit; considering the additional material should not be necessary <br>
to assess the merits of a submission. The review process will include a <br>
feedback/rebuttal period where authors will have the option to respond <br>
to reviewer comments. The PC chair may solicit further reviews after the <br>
rebuttal period.</p>
<p>The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer <br>
LNCS/LNAI series. Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files can <br>
be obtained at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a></p>
<p>At every CADE conference the Program Committee selects one of the <br>
accepted papers to receive the CADE Best Paper Award. The award <br>
recognizes a paper that the Program Committee collegially evaluates as <br>
the best in terms of originality and significance, having substantial <br>
confidence in its correctness. Overall technical quality, completeness, <br>
scholarly accuracy, and readability are also considered. Characteristics <br>
associated with a best paper include, for instance, introduction of a <br>
strong new technique or approach, solution of a long-standing open <br>
problem, introduction and solution of an interesting and important new <br>
problem, highly innovative application of known ideas or existing <br>
techniques, and presentation of a new system of outstanding power. Under <br>
exceptional circumstances, the Program Committee may give two awards (ex <br>
aequo) or give no award.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cade-27.info">http://www.cade-27.info</a></p>
<p>CALL FOR WORKSHOPS</p>
<p>Workshop proposals for CADE-27 are solicited. The workshops will take <br>
place on August 25-26 2019, before the main conference. Both <br>
well-established workshops and newer ones are encouraged. Similarly, <br>
proposals for workshops with a tight focus on a core automated reasoning <br>
specialization, as well as those with a broader, more applied focus, are <br>
very welcome.</p>
<p>Please provide the following information in your application document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop title.</li>
<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>
<li>
<p>Proposed workshop duration (from half a day to two days) and preferred <br>
day(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brief description of the goals and the scope of the workshop. Why is <br>
the workshop relevant for CADE?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the workshop new or has it met previously? In the latter case <br>
information on previous meetings should be given (e.g., links to the <br>
program, number of submissions, number of participants).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the plans for publication?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CALL FOR TUTORIALS</p>
<p>Tutorial proposals for CADE-27 are solicited. Tutorials are expected to <br>
be either half-day or full-day events, with a theoretical or applied <br>
focus, on a topic of interest for CADE-27. Proposals should provide the <br>
following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tutorial title.</li>
<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>
<li>
<p>Proposed tutorial duration (from half a day to one days) and the <br>
preferred day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brief description of the tutorial's goals and topics to be covered.</p>
</li>
<li>Whether or not a version of the tutorial has been given previously.</li>
</ul>
<p>CADE will take care of printing and distributing notes for tutorials <br>
that would like this service.</p>
<p>CALL FOR SYSTEM COMPETITIONS</p>
<p>The CADE ATP System Competition (CASC), which evaluates automated <br>
theorem proving systems for classical logics, has become an integral <br>
part of the CADE conferences.</p>
<p>Further system competition proposals are solicited. The goal is to <br>
foster the development of automated reasoning systems in all areas <br>
relevant for automated deduction in a broader sense. Proposals should <br>
include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competition title.</li>
<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>
<li>Duration and schedule of the competition.</li>
<li>Room/space requirements.</li>
<li>Description of the competition task and the evaluation procedure.</li>
<li>Is the competition new or has it been organized before?  In the latter <br>
case information on previous competition<br>
[message truncated]</li>
</ul>
