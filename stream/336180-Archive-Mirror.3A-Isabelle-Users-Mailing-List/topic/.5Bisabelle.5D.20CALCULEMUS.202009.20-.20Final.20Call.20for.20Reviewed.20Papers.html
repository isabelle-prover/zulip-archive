<p>CALCULEMUS 2009 - Final Call for Reviewed Papers</p>
<hr>
<p>16th Symposium on the Integration of<br>
Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning</p>
<p>6-7 July 2009, Joint with CICM'09, Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.calculemus.net/meetings/ontario09/">http://www.calculemus.net/meetings/ontario09/</a></p>
<p>Calculemus is a series of conferences dedicated to the integration of<br>
computer algebra systems (CAS) and systems for mechanised reasoning, the<br>
interactive theorem provers or proof assistants (PA) and the automated<br>
theorem provers (ATP).</p>
<p>Currently, symbolic computation is divided into several (more or less)<br>
independent branches: traditional ones (e.g., computer algebra and<br>
mechanised reasoning) as well as newly emerging ones (on user<br>
interfaces, knowledge management, theory exploration, etc.) The main<br>
concern of the Calculemus community is to bring these developments<br>
together in order to facilitate the theory, design, and implementation<br>
of integrated systems for computer mathematics that will routinely be<br>
used by mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers in their every<br>
day business.</p>
<p>We seek original research papers for the upcoming Calculemus meeting,<br>
which will be held jointly with MKM 2009 (confederated in the<br>
Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics, CICM 2009,<br>
<a href="http://www.orcca.on.ca/conferences/cicm09/">http://www.orcca.on.ca/conferences/cicm09/</a>) in Ontario,<br>
Canada.</p>
<p>INVITED TALKS</p>
<hr>
<p>We are pleased to have invited talks from:</p>
<p>Prof. Jacques Calmet (<a href="http://iaks-www.ira.uka.de/iaks-calmet/en_index.html">http://iaks-www.ira.uka.de/iaks-calmet/en_index.html</a>)</p>
<p>Rob Arthan (Director of Lemma 1, developer of ProofPower,<br>

<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST</p>
<hr>
<p>The scope of Calculemus covers all aspects of the interplay of<br>
mechanised reasoning and computer algebra, including cross-fertilisation<br>
between those two research areas, as well as the development of<br>
integrated systems that transcend both computer algebra and theorem<br>
proving. Potential topics of interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)</li>
<li>Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)</li>
<li>
<p>Case studies and applications that both involve computer algebra and<br>
mechanised reasoning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Representation of mathematics in computer algebra</p>
</li>
<li>Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP</li>
<li>Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving</li>
<li>Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction</li>
<li>Mathematical computation in PA and ATP</li>
<li>
<p>Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for<br>
computer mathematics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infrastructure for mathematical services</p>
</li>
<li>Theory exploration techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers on other topics closely related to the above research<br>
areas will also be welcomed for consideration.</p>

<p>SUBMISSION</p>
<hr>
<p>Theoretical and applied research papers on all topics within the scope<br>
of the symposium are invited. Submitted papers (in English) must not<br>
exceed 15 pages in length. The title page should contain the title,<br>
author(s) with affiliation(s), e-mail address(es), listing of keywords<br>
and abstract. The program committee (PC) will subject all submitted<br>
papers to a peer review. Results must be unpublished.</p>
<p>The web page for electronic submission is at:<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calculemus2009">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calculemus2009</a></p>
<p>The proceedings of the conference will be published as a volume in the<br>
series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) by<br>
Springer-Verlag. Accepted papers will have to be prepared in LaTeX and<br>
formatted according to the requirements of the Springer's LNAI series<br>
(the corresponding style files can be downloaded from<br>
<a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a> and are the same for LNCS<br>
and LNAI).<br>
Proceedings</p>
<p>Accepted papers will be published in the LNAI series of Springer.</p>
