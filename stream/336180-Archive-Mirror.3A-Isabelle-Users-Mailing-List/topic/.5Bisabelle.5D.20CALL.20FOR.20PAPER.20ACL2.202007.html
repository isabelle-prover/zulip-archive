<p><a href="http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~ruben/acl2-07">http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~ruben/acl2-07</a></p>
<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br>
                November 15-16, 2007 in Austin, Texas<br>
                         Hosted by FMCAD 2007</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>Abstract submission:        July 2, 2007<br>
    Paper submission:           July 9, 2007<br>
    Acceptance Notification:    September 3, 2007<br>
    Final Version Due:          October 15, 2007</p>
<p>CONFERENCE SCOPE</p>
<p>ACL2 2007 is the major technical forum for users of the ACL2 theorem<br>
proving system and is the seventh in a series of workshops that occur<br>
approximately every 18 months. ACL2 is an industrial-strength<br>
automated reasoning system that is part of the Boyer-Moore family of<br>
theorem provers, for which its authors received the 2005 ACM Software<br>
System Award. ACL2 2007 is hosted by FMCAD. We invite papers on any<br>
topics related to ACL2, and we encourage submission of papers related<br>
to other theorem provers or formal methods that can be contributed to<br>
the ACL2 community.  Suggested topics include but are not limited by <br>
the following:</p>
<p>* software or hardware verification with the theorem prover,<br>
    * formalizations of mathematics in ACL2,<br>
    * new libraries, tools, and interfaces for ACL2,<br>
    * experiences with ACL2 in the classroom,<br>
    * reports of and proposals for improvements of ACL2,<br>
    * comparisons with other theorem provers<br>
    * comparisons with other programming or specification languages,<br>
    * challenge problems and their solutions,<br>
    * foundational issues related to ACL2, and<br>
    * implementations connecting ACL2 with other systems.</p>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format, as directed in<br>
the ACL2 2007 website. Submissions should be prepared in the ACM SIG<br>
Proceeding Templates, available from<br>
<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html">http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html</a>. We strongly prefer<br>
submissions in the "LaTeX2e - Strict Adherence to the SIGS Style".</p>
<p>The ACL2 Workshop accepts both long papers (up to ten pages) and short<br>
papers (up to four pages). Both categories of papers will be fully<br>
refereed. At least one author of each accepted papers must register<br>
for the workshop and give a presentation summarizing the paper's<br>
results. Authors of long papers will have more time to present their<br>
work at the workshop; this is the primary distinction between long and<br>
short papers. One of the main advantages of the ACL2 Workshop is that<br>
attendees are already knowledgeable about ACL2, its syntax, its basic<br>
commands, and the art of writing models in it. So authors may assume<br>
that readers have this familiarity. We expect to provide workshop<br>
proceedings and to include these proceedings in the ACM digital<br>
library.</p>
<p>Many papers presented at the workshop will describe interactions with<br>
the theorem prover. We strongly encourage authors of such papers to<br>
provide ACL2 script files (aka "books") along with instructions for<br>
using these books in ACL2. Such supporting materials should follow the<br>
guidelines at <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/books/index.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/books/index.html</a>. <br>
For accepted papers, these books will be mirrored on the ACL2 home page<br>
and included in future ACL2 distributions.</p>
