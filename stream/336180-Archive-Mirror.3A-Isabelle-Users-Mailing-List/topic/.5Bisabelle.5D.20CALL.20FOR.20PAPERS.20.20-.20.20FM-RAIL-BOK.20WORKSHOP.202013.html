<p>A workshop in SEFM'13<br>
  September 25-27, 2013, Madrid, Spain<br>
<a href="http://antares.sip.ucm.es/sefm2013/">http://antares.sip.ucm.es/sefm2013/</a></p>
<p>MOTIVATION AND SCIENCE-PHILOSOPHICAL BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Formal methods in software science and software engineering have<br>
  existed at least as long as the term “software engineering” (NATO<br>
  Science Conference, Garmisch, 1968) itself. In many<br>
  engineering-based application areas, such as in the railway domain,<br>
  formal methods have reached a level of maturity that already enables<br>
  the compilation of a so-called body of knowledge (abbreviated as<br>
  “BOK”). Its various methods and techniques include algebraic<br>
  specification, process-algebraic modelling and verification, Petri<br>
  nets, fuzzy logics, etc. For example, the B-method has been used<br>
  successfully to verify the most relevant parts of a model of the<br>
  Metro underground railway system of the city of Paris<br>
  (France). Software tool support is already available for a number of<br>
  those formal methods; for example in the form of various model<br>
  checker or SAT solver programs.</p>
<p>In this context, our workshop shall bring together scientists,<br>
  researchers and practitioners, from academia, the industry,<br>
  professional guildes and engineering associations, national or<br>
  international standardisation committees, as well as governmental or<br>
  administrative regulators to re-collect and discuss the “state of<br>
  the art” in the application of formal methods within the railway<br>
  domain (including inner-city tram lines, urban mono-rail systems,<br>
  etc., too). Thereby we shall adopt a methodological viewpoint based<br>
  on Vincenti’s book "What Engineers know and how they know it:<br>
  Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History, John Hopkins<br>
  University Press, 1990". This book contains a science-historical and<br>
  science-philosophical analysis of what it is that constitutes<br>
  engineering knowledge (and the related practice) specifically, in<br>
  other words: an epistemology of engineering. The development of the<br>
  above-mentioned handbooks as an explicit recording of such knowledge<br>
  is part of Vincenti’s epistemology.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION</p>
<p>Our workshop calls for short position papers with strong emphasis on<br>
  methodologically sound “BOK” contents and case-based “best practice”<br>
  knowledge in the spirit of classical engineering handbooks.</p>
<p>Such papers, which will be reviewed and moderated by the workshop’s<br>
  programme committee, must not exceed 6 pages in the IEEE<br>
  double-column conference format</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a></p>
<p>and must be submitted via our EasyChair Submission Website</p>
<p><a href="http://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=fmrailbok2013">http://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=fmrailbok2013</a></p>
<p>no later than the stipulated submission deadline.  Submissions which<br>
  do not meet these requirements will be rejected without review.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>Paper submission deadline: 14 June 2013  <br>
  Author notification: 5 July 2013<br>
  Re-submission of revised accepted papers: 16 August 2013<br>
  Distribution of revised papers amongst registered participants: 2 September 2013<br>
  Workshop in Madrid: 23-24 September 2013<br>
  Thereafter: post-discussions and further work towards the planned book release</p>

<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE (confirmation status: 21 March 2013)</p>
<p>Martin Brennan, British Rail Safety Standards Board<br>
  Simon Chadwick, Invensys Rail, Great Britain<br>
  Lars-Henrik Eriksson, Uppsala University, Sweden<br>
  Alessandro Fantechi, University of Firenze, Italy<br>
  Michaela Huhn, Technical University of Clausthal, Germany<br>
  Hoang Nga Nguyen, University of Swansea, Great Britain<br>
  Jan Peleska, University of Bremen, Germany<br>
  Holger Schlingloff, Humboldt-University of Berlin, Germany<br>

  Kirsten Winter, University of Queensland, Australia</p>
<p>WORKSHOP FORMAT</p>
<p>Our workshop is planned as a workshop in the proper sense of the<br>
  word, i.e.: it will be work-oriented, not<br>
  presentation-oriented. During the workshop, smaller sub-groups will<br>
  work on various sub-topics, whereas plenum sessions will bring the<br>
  sub-groups and their sub-results together again.</p>
<p>For the sake of effective working during the event, all accepted<br>
  papers will be distributed amongst the registered participants<br>
  already before the event. Participants are expected to study these<br>
  papers before the workshop, such that the discussions and sub-groups<br>
  can commence effectively from the first hour of the meeting onwards.</p>
<p>Soon after the workshop, its work results (proceedings) shall be<br>
  published first in the form of an institutional technical<br>
  report. Thereafter the technical report shall be further “polished”<br>
  and consolidated, with the goal of publishing an authoritative BOK<br>
  book on the chosen topic, with a reputable publisher, in the<br>
  not-too-far future.</p>
<p>In case of good success, similar BOK preparation workshops are<br>
  planned for the future on other (yet similar) topics, for example:<br>
  formal methods for aviation software, or formal methods for<br>
  automobile applications, etc. In the long term, this could lead to a<br>
  multi-volume series of such BOK books on various topics.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION</p>
<p>According to our workshop’s goal and format we follow a 3-phase<br>
  publication plan with informal distribution of accepted papers<br>
  amongst registered workshop participants before the workshop,<br>
  official release of an institutional technical report soon after the<br>
  workshop, publication of a refined and consolidated BOK book in the<br>
  not-too-far future, after the technical report, with a reputable<br>
  scientific publisher.</p>
