        22nd International Conference on<br>
        Computer Aided Verification (CAV)<br>
                           CAV 2010<br>
<a href="http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~touili/cav2010/">http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~touili/cav2010/</a><br>
                      July 15 - 19, 2010<br>
                   Edinburgh, United Kingdom</p>
<p>Call for Papers<br>
........................................................................</p>
<p>Aims and Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>CAV 2010 is the 22nd in a series dedicated to the advancement of the<br>
theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for<br>
hardware and software systems. This year, CAV is part of the 5th<br>
International Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 2010), which includes<br>
CAV and seven other conferences/symposia: CSF, ICLP, IJCAR, ITP, LICS,<br>
RTA and SAT. More details about FLoC 2010 can be found at<br>
<a href="http://www.floc-conference.org/">http://www.floc-conference.org/</a></p>
<p>CAV considers it vital to continue its leadership in hardware<br>
verification, maintain its recent momentum in software verification, and<br>
consider new domains such as biological systems. The conference covers<br>
the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an<br>
emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and<br>
techniques that are needed for their implementation. The proceedings of<br>
the conference will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in<br>
Computer Science series. A selection of papers will be invited to a<br>
special issue of the International Journal on Formal Methods in System<br>
Design.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include:</p>
<p>* Model checking techniques<br>
  * Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations<br>
  * Hardware verification techniques<br>
  * Hybrid systems and embedded systems verification<br>
  * Program analysis and software verification<br>
  * Modeling and specification formalisms<br>
  * Deductive, compositional, and abstraction techniques for verification<br>
  * Testing and runtime analysis based on verification technology<br>
  * Applications and case studies<br>
  * Verification in industrial practice<br>
  * Formal methods for biological systems</p>
<p>Events</p>
<hr>
<p>There will be pre-conference workshops on July 14 and July 15, and<br>
post-conference workshops on July 20. Please see the conference website<br>
for more details.</p>
<p>There will be tutorials on July 15 (first day of the conference).</p>

<p>CAV Award</p>
<hr>
<p>An annual award, called the CAV Award, has been established<br>
       "For a specific fundamental contribution<br>
       or a series of outstanding contributions<br>
       to the field of Computer-Aided Verification."</p>
<p>The cited contribution(s) must have been made not more recently than<br>
five years ago and not over twenty years ago.  In addition, the<br>
contribution(s) should not yet have received recognition via a major<br>
award, such as the ACM Turing or Kanellakis Awards. (The nominee may<br>
have received such an award for other contributions.)</p>
<p>The award of $10,000 will be granted to an individual or a group of<br>
individuals chosen by the Award Committee from a list of nominations.<br>
The Award Committee may choose to make no award in a given year.</p>
<p>The CAV Award will be presented in an award ceremony at the<br>
Computer-Aided Verification Conference and a citation will be published<br>
in a journal of record (currently, Formal Methods in System Design).</p>
<p>Anyone, with the exception of members of the Award Committee, is<br>
eligible to receive the Award.</p>
<p>The 2010 CAV Award Committee consists of Orna Grumberg (chair), Moshe<br>
Vardi, Joseph Sifakis, and Rajeev Alur. For the CAV Award in 2010,<br>
please send nominations to the CAV Award Committee Chair:<br>
Orna Grumberg : orna (at) <a href="http://cs.technion.ac.il">cs.technion.ac.il</a></p>
<p>Nominations must be received by January 15, 2010.</p>
<p>Paper Submission</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two categories of submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A. Regular papers. Submissions, not exceeding fourteen (14) pages<br>
using Springer's LNCS format, should contain original research, and<br>
sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the<br>
contribution. For papers reporting experimental results, authors are<br>
strongly encouraged to make their data available with their submission.<br>
Submissions reporting on case studies in an industrial context are<br>
strongly invited, and should describe details, weaknesses and strength<br>
in sufficient depth. Simultaneous submission to other conferences with<br>
proceedings or submission of material that has already been published<br>
elsewhere is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B. Tool presentations. Submissions, not exceeding four (4) pages using<br>
Springer's LNCS format, should describe the implemented tool and its<br>
novel features. A demonstration is expected to accompany a tool<br>
presentation. Papers describing tools that have already been presented<br>
in this conference before will be accepted only if significant and clear<br>
enhancements to the tool are reported and implemented.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers can be submitted in PDF or PS format. Submission is done with<br>
EasyChair. The submission site  is now open. Please<br>
follow guidelines on the conference website:<br>
<a href="http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~touili/cav2010/">http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~touili/cav2010/</a></p>
<p>Papers exceeding the stated maximum length run the risk of rejection<br>
without review. The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal<br>
period where authors will have the option to respond to reviewer<br>
comments.</p>
