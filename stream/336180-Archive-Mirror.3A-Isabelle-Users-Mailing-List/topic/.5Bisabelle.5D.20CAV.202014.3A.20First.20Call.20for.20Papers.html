First Call for Papers<br>
26th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV’14)<br>
Part of Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL'14)<br>
18-22 July 2014, Vienna, Austria<br>
<a href="http://www.cavconference.org">http://www.cavconference.org</a></p>
<p>New Rules</p>
<hr>
<p>We will continue to have short and long papers, but<br>
short papers are not restricted to be tool papers anymore.</p>
<p>Further, we particularly encourage to submit high<br>
quality tool papers and empirical evaluations as long papers.</p>
<p>References do not count toward the page limit.</p>
<p>More details are explained below.</p>
<p>Aims and Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>CAV 2014 is the 26th in a series dedicated to the advancement of the<br>
theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for<br>
hardware and software systems. As part of the Federated Logic<br>
Conference (FloC) and the Vienna Summer of Logic (<a href="http://vsl2014.at">vsl2014.at</a>), CAV14<br>
will be collocated with many other conferences in logic. CAV<br>
considers it vital to continue spurring advances in hardware and<br>
software verification while expanding to new domains such as<br>
biological systems and computer security. The conference covers the<br>
spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an<br>
emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and<br>
techniques that are needed for their implementation. The proceedings<br>
of the conference will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture<br>
Notes in Computer Science series. A selection of papers will be<br>
invited to a special issue of Formal Methods in System Design and the<br>
Journal of the ACM.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<hr>
<p>Algorithms and tools<br>
   for verifying models and implementations</p>
<p>Hardware verification techniques</p>
<p>Deductive, compositional, and<br>
   abstraction techniques for verification</p>
<p>Program analysis and software verification</p>
<p>Verification methods for parallel and<br>
   concurrent hardware/software systems</p>
<p>Testing and runtime analysis based on verification technology</p>
<p>Applications and case studies in verification</p>
<p>Decision procedures and solvers for verification</p>
<p>Mathematical and logical foundations<br>
   of practical verification tools</p>
<p>Verification in industrial practice</p>
<p>Algorithms and tools for system synthesis</p>
<p>Hybrid systems and embedded systems verification</p>
<p>Verification techniques for security</p>
<p>Formal models and methods for biological systems</p>
<p>Events</p>
<hr>
<p>FLOC will host CAV-related workshops on 17-18 July and on 23-24 July<br>
and the first day of CAV will be dedicated to tutorials. Please see<br>
the conference website for further details.</p>
<p>Paper Submission</p>
<hr>
<p>Submissions should contain original research, and sufficient detail<br>
to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. We welcome<br>
papers on theory, case studies and reproductions and comparisons of<br>
existing experimental research, tool papers, as well as combinations<br>
of new theory with experimental evaluation. In contrast to previous<br>
years, we have decoupled paper length from paper topic: We welcome<br>
both long tool papers and short papers of any kind.</p>
<p>Tool papers should describe system and implementation aspects of a<br>
tool with a large (potential) user base (experiments not required,<br>
rehash of theory strongly discouraged). Papers describing tools that<br>
have already been presented (in any conference) will be accepted only<br>
if significant and clear enhancements to the tool are reported and<br>
implemented. Submissions reporting on case studies in an industrial<br>
context are strongly invited, and should describe details,<br>
weaknesses, and strengths in sufficient depth. Papers reproducing and<br>
comparing existing results experimentally do not require new<br>
theoretical insights. Examples of contributions of such papers are<br>
evaluations of existing results in a superior experimental setting<br>
and comparisons of methods that have not previously been thoroughly<br>
experimentally compared.</p>
<p>The authors of tool papers and papers with experimental evaluation<br>
should make every effort to make results reproducible by submitting<br>
through EasyChair a repository including the implementation in source<br>
and binary as well as benchmarks and logfiles. If this is not<br>
possible, the reasons should be explained in the paper.</p>
<p>Papers can be submitted in either a regular or a short format.</p>
<p>Regular Papers should not exceed 15 pages in LNCS format,<br>
not counting references.</p>
<p>Short Papers should not exceed 6 pages, not counting references.<br>
Short papers are encouraged for any subject that can be described<br>
within the page limit, and in particular for novel ideas without an<br>
extensive experimental evaluation. Short papers will be accompanied<br>
by short presentations.</p>
<p>An appendix can provide additional material such as details on proofs<br>
or experiments. The appendix is not guaranteed to be read or taken<br>
into account by the reviewers and it should not contain information<br>
necessary to the understanding and the evaluation of the presented<br>
work. Papers will be accepted or rejected in the category in which<br>
they were submitted, there will be no "demotions" from a regular to a<br>
short paper.</p>
<p>Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or<br>
submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is<br>
not allowed.</p>
<p>The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where<br>
authors will have the option to respond to reviewer comments.</p>
<p>Papers must be submitted in PDF format. Submission is done with<br>
EasyChair.  Information about the submission procedure will be<br>
available at: <a href="http://www.cavconference.org">http://www.cavconference.org</a>.</p>
<p>Deadlines</p>

<p>Call for Nominations for the CAV Award</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyone can submit a nomination. The Award Committee can originate a<br>
nomination. Anyone, with the exception of members of the Award<br>
Committee, is eligible to receive the Award. A nomination must state<br>
clearly the contribution(s), explain why the contribution is<br>
fundamental or the series of contributions is outstanding, and be<br>
accompanied by supporting letters and other evidence of worthiness.</p>
<p>Nominations should include a proposed citation (up to 25 words), a<br>
succinct (100-250 words) description of the contribution(s), and a<br>
detailed statement to justify the nomination. The cited<br>
contribution(s) must have been made not more recently than five years<br>
ago and not over twenty years ago. In addition, the contribution(s)<br>
should not yet have received recognition via a major award, such as<br>
the ACM Turing or Kanellakis Awards. The nominee may have received<br>
such an award for other contributions.</p>
