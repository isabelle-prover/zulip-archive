<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<hr>
<p>22nd International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM <br>
2020), 2-6 November 2020, Singapore.</p>
<p><a href="http://formal-analysis.com/icfem/2020/">http://formal-analysis.com/icfem/2020/</a></p>
<p>Since 1997, ICFEM provides a forum for both researchers and <br>
practitioners who are interested in developing practical formal methods <br>
for software engineering or applying existing formal techniques to <br>
improve the software development process in practice systems. Formal <br>
Methods for the development of computer systems have been extensively <br>
researched and studied. We now have good theoretical understandings of <br>
how to describe what programs do, how they do it, and why they work. A <br>
range of semantic theories, specification languages, design techniques, <br>
verification methods, and supporting tools have been developed and <br>
applied to the construction of programs of moderate size that are used <br>
in critical applications. The remaining challenge now is how to deal <br>
with problems in developing and maintaining large scale and complex <br>
computer systems.</p>
<p>The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial, academic, <br>
and government experts, from a variety of user domains and software <br>
disciplines, to help advance state of the art. Researchers, <br>
practitioners, tool developers, users, and technology transfer experts <br>
are all welcome. We are interested in work that has been incorporated <br>
into real production systems, and in theoretical work that promises to <br>
bring practical, tangible engineering benefits.</p>
<p>Scope and Topics:<br>
Submissions related to the following principal themes are encouraged, <br>
but any topics relevant to the field of formal engineering methods and <br>
their practical applications will also be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstraction, refinement, and evolution</li>
<li>Formal specification and modelling</li>
<li>Formal verification and analysis</li>
<li>Model checking</li>
<li>Formal approaches to software testing and inspection</li>
<li>Formal methods for self-adaptive systems</li>
<li>Formal methods for object-oriented systems</li>
<li>Formal methods for component-based systems</li>
<li>Formal methods for concurrent and real-time systems</li>
<li>Formal methods for cloud computing</li>
<li>Formal methods for cyber-physical systems</li>
<li>Formal methods for software safety and security</li>
<li>Formal methods for software reliability and dependability</li>
<li>Development, integration, and experiments involving verified systems</li>
<li>Formal certification of products under international standards</li>
<li>Formal model-based development and code generation</li>
</ul>
<p>Important Dates:<br>

Workshop/Tutorial Proposals: 20 March 2020<br>
Acceptance/Rejection Notification: 19 June 2020<br>
Camera-ready: 17 July 2020</p>
<p>Submission and Publication:<br>
Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be <br>
concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will <br>
be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field, <br>
technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference. The <br>
proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer <br>
Science series.</p>
<p>Papers should be written in English and should not exceed 16 pages in <br>
LNCS format (more details here). Submissions should be made through the <br>
ICFEM 2020 submission page, handled by the EasyChair conference <br>
management system.</p>
