FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>Second Workshop on<br>
             Programming Languages for Mechanized Mathematics<br>
                              (PLMMS 2008)</p>
<p><a href="http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/workshops/plmms/">http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/workshops/plmms/</a></p>
<p>As part of CICM / Calculemus 2008<br>
                     Birmingham, UK, 28-29 July 2008</p>
<p>This workshop is focused on the intersection of programming languages<br>
(PL) and mechanized mathematics systems (MMS). The latter category<br>
subsumes present-day computer algebra systems (CAS), interactive proof<br>
assistants (PA), and automated theorem provers (ATP), all heading<br>
towards fully integrated mechanized mathematical assistants that are<br>
expected to emerge eventually (cf. the objective of Calculemus).</p>
<p>The two subjects of PL and MMS meet in the following topics, which are<br>
of particular interest to this workshop:</p>
<p>* Dedicated input languages for MMS: covers all aspects of languages<br>
    intended for the user to deploy or extend the system, both<br>
    algorithmic and declarative ones. Typical examples are tactic<br>
    definition languages such as Ltac in Coq, mathematical proof<br>
    languages as in Mizar or Isar, or specialized programming<br>
    languages built into CA systems. Of particular interest are the<br>
    semantics of those languages, especially when current ones are<br>
    untyped.</p>
<p>* Mathematical modeling languages used for programming: covers the<br>
    relation of logical descriptions vs. algorithmic content. For<br>
    instance the logic of ACL2 extends a version of Lisp, that of Coq<br>
    is close to Haskell, and some portions of HOL are similar to ML<br>
    and Haskell, while Maple tries to do both simultaneously. Such<br>
    mathematical languages offer rich specification capabilities,<br>
    which are rarely available in regular programming languages. How<br>
    can programming benefit from mathematical concepts, without<br>
    limiting mathematics to the computational worldview?</p>
<p>* Programming languages with mathematical specifications: covers<br>
    advanced "mathematical" concepts in programming languages that<br>
    improve the expressive power of functional specifications, type<br>
    systems, module systems etc. Programming languages with dependent<br>
    types are of particular interest here, as is intentionality vs<br>
    extensionality.</p>
<p>* Language elements for program verification: covers specific means<br>
    built into a language to facilitate correctness proofs using MMS.<br>
    For example, logical annotations within programs may be turned<br>
    into verification conditions to be solved in a proof assistant<br>
    eventually. How need MMS and PL to be improved to make this work<br>
    conveniently and in a mathematically appealing way?</p>
<p>These issues have a very colorful history. Many PL innovations first<br>
appeared in either CA or proof systems first, before migrating into<br>
more mainstream programming languages. Some examples include type<br>
inference, dependent types, generics, term-rewriting, first-class<br>
types, first-class expressions, first-class modules, code extraction<br>
etc. However, such innovations were never aggressively pursued by<br>
builders of MMS, but often reconstructed by programming language<br>
researchers. This workshop is an opportunity to present the latest<br>
innovations in MMS design that may be relevant to future programming<br>
languages, or conversely novel PL principles that improve upon<br>
implementation and deployment of MMS.</p>
<p>We also want to critically examine what has worked, and what has not.<br>
Why are all the languages of mainstream CA systems untyped? Why are the<br>
(strongly typed) proof assistants so much harder to use than a typical<br>
CAS? What forms of polymorphism exist in mathematics? What forms of<br>
dependent types may be used in mathematical modeling? How can MMS<br>
regain the upper hand on issues of "genericity" and "modularity"? What<br>
are the biggest barriers to using a more mainstream language as a host<br>
language for a CAS or PA/ATP?</p>

<p>Submission works through EasyChair<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=plmms2008">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=plmms2008</a></p>
<p>Two kinds of papers will be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Full research papers may be up to 12 pages long. Authors of<br>
   accepted papers are expected to present their work on the workshop<br>
   in a regular talk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Position papers may be up to 4 pages long. The workshop<br>
   presentation of accepted position papers consists of two parts: a<br>
   stimulating statement of certain issues or challenges by the<br>
   author, followed by a discussion in the plenum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers should use the usual ENTCS style <a href="http://www.entcs.org/prelim.html">http://www.entcs.org/prelim.html</a><br>
(11 point version), and will be reviewed by the program<br>
committee. Informal workshop proceedings will be circulated as a<br>
technical report. We also plan post-workshop proceedings of improved<br>
research papers, or position papers that have been completed into full<br>
papers, as a special issue in a journal; papers from both PLMMS 2007<br>
and 2008 will be considered here (details to follow).</p>
