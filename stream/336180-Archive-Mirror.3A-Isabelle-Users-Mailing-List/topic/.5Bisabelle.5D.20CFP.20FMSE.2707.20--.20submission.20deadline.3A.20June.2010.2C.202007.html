<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>The 5th ACM Workshop on</p>
<p>Formal Methods in Security Engineering: From Specifications to Code</p>
<p>held in conjunction with the ACM CCS'07</p>
<p>November 2, 2007, George Mason University, USA</p>
<p>[http://www.fmis.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fmse07/]</p>
<p>Information security has become a crucial concern for the commercial<br>
deployment of almost all applications and middleware. Although this is<br>
commonly recognized, the incorporation of security requirements in the<br>
software development process is not yet well understood. The<br>
deployment of security mechanisms is often ad hoc, without a formal<br>
security specification or analysis, and practically always without a<br>
formal security validation of the final product. Progress is being<br>
made, but there remains a wide gap between high-level security models<br>
and actual code development.</p>
<p>We aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from both the<br>
security and the software engineering communities, from academia and<br>
industry, who are working on applying formal methods to the design and<br>
validation of large-scale systems.</p>
<p>We seek original research papers addressing foundational issues in<br>
formal methods in security engineering.  Topics covered include, but<br>
are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>security requirements and risk analysis</li>
<li>access control models, information flow models, and trust models</li>
<li>specification and analysis of security properties</li>
<li>stepwise development by refinement and composition</li>
<li>computationally sound abstraction</li>
<li>program logics and type systems for security</li>
<li>other techniques for verification and static analysis</li>
<li>
<p>tool support for the development and analysis of security-critical <br>
  systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>design and analysis of security protocols</p>
</li>
<li>security aspects of operating systems and middleware</li>
<li>case studies</li>
</ul>
<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed.  Authors of accepted papers<br>
must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.<br>
Final proceedings will be published by the ACM.  </p>
<p>Submissions must be received by Sunday June 10, 2007 to be considered.<br>
For submitting a paper, follow the guidelines on the FMSE'07 webpage<br>
at <a href="http://www.fmis.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fmse07/">http://www.fmis.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fmse07/</a> .</p>
<p>Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers that have been<br>
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a<br>
conference with proceedings.  The article must list all authors and<br>
their affiliations.  It should begin with a title, a short abstract,<br>
and a list of key words, and its introduction should summarize the<br>
contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist<br>
reader.  The submitted paper should be at most 12 pages excluding the<br>
bibliography and clearly marked appendices, and at most 15 pages in<br>
total, using at least 11-point font, reasonable margins, and page<br>
numbers on each page.  Committee members are not required to read<br>
appendices; the paper should be intelligible without them.  The<br>
document must be in Acrobat PDF format, and must be legible after<br>
printing on standard grayscale printers, both those that use A4 and<br>
those that use 8-1/2x11" paper.  Submissions not meeting these<br>
guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.<br>
Camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be limited to 10 pages<br>
in total using the ACM conference style.</p>
