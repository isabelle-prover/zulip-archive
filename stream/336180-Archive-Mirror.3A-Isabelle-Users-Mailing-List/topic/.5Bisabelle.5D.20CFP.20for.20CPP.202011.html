The First International Conference on<br>
           Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP 2011)<br>
                PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>Kenting, Taiwan <br>
                  December 7--9, 2011 <br>
<a href="http://formes.asia/cpp">http://formes.asia/cpp</a></p>
<p>(co-located with APLAS 2011)</p>
<p>CPP is a new international forum on theoretical and practical topics<br>
in all areas, including computer science, mathematics, and education,<br>
that consider certification as an essential paradigm for their work.<br>
Certification here means formal, mechanized verification of some sort,<br>
preferably with production of independently checkable certificates.<br>
We invite submissions on topics that fit under this rubric.</p>
<p>Suggested, but not exclusive, specific topics of interest for<br>
submissions include: certified or certifying programming, compilation,<br>
linking, OS kernels, runtime systems, and security monitors; program<br>
logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code; certified<br>
decision procedures, mathematical libraries, and mathematical<br>
theorems; proof assistants and proof theory; new languages and tools<br>
for certified programming; program analysis, program verification, and<br>
proof-carrying code; certified secure protocols and transactions;<br>
certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra,<br>
polynomial systems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of interest;<br>
certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality,<br>
first-order logic, and higher-order unification; certificates for<br>
program termination; logics for certifying concurrent and distributed<br>
programs; higher-order logics, logical systems, separation logics, and<br>
logics for security; and teaching mathematics and computer science<br>
with proof assistants.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>Authors are required to submit a paper title and a short abstract<br>
before submitting the full paper.  The submission should include when<br>
necessary a url where to find the formal development assessing the<br>
essential aspects of the work.  All submissions will be<br>
electronic. All deadlines are at midnight (GMT).</p>
<p>Abstract Deadline:           Monday, June 13, 2011<br>
  Paper Submission Deadline:   Friday, June 17, 2011 <br>
  Author Notification:         Monday, August 29, 2011<br>
  Camera Ready:                Monday, September 19, 2011<br>
  Conference:                  December 7-9, 2011</p>
<p>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: </p>
<p>Papers should be submitted electronically online via the conference<br>
submission web page at URL: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2011">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2011</a></p>
<p>Acceptable formats are PostScript or PDF, viewable by Ghostview or<br>
Acrobat Reader. Submissions should not exceed 16 pages in LNCS format,<br>
including bibliography and figures.  Submitted papers will be judged<br>
on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and<br>
clarity. They should clearly identify what has been accomplished and<br>
why it is significant. The proceedings of the symposium will<br>
be published as a volume in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in<br>
Computer Science series. Submission instructions including Latex<br>
style files are available from the CPP 2011 website.</p>
<p>Each submission must be written in English and provide sufficient<br>
detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the<br>
paper.  It should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a<br>
summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their<br>
significance and relevance to the conference, all phrased for the<br>
non-specialist.  Technical and formal developments directed to the<br>
specialist should follow.  Whenever appropriate, the submission should<br>
come along with a formal development, using whatever prover, e.g.,<br>
Agda, Coq, Elf, HOL, HOL-Light, Isabelle, Matita, Mizar, NQTHM, PVS,<br>
Vampire, etc. References and comparisons with related work should be<br>
included.  Papers not conforming to the above requirements concerning<br>
format and length may be rejected without further consideration.</p>
<p>The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>
elsewhere, including the proceedings of other published conferences or<br>
workshops.  The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work<br>
submitted to a conference or journal in advance of<br>
submission. Original formal proofs of known results in mathematics or<br>
computer science are among the targets.  One author of each accepted<br>
paper is expected to present it at the conference.</p>
<p>AWARD FOR BEST PAPER:</p>
<p>An award will be given for the best accepted paper, as judged by the<br>
program committee.  Details concerning eligibility criteria and<br>
procedure for consideration for this award will be posted at the CPP<br>
website.  The committee may decline to make the award or split it<br>
among several papers.</p>
