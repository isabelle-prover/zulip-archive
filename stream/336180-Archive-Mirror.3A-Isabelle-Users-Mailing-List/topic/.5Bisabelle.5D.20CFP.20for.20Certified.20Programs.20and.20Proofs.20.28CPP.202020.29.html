<h2>CFP for Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP 2020)</h2>
<p>Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP) is an international conference on<br>
practical and theoretical topics in all areas that consider<br>
certification as an essential paradigm for their work. Certification<br>
here means formal, mechanized verification of some sort, preferably<br>
with the production of independently checkable certificates.<br>
CPP spans areas of computer science, mathematics, logic, and education.</p>
<p>CPP 2020 will be held on 20-21 January 2020 in New Orleans, Louisiana,<br>
United States and will be co-located with POPL 2020. CPP 2020 is<br>
sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGLOG.</p>

<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>Prior to the paper submission deadline, the authors should upload their<br>
<strong>anonymized</strong> paper in PDF format through the HotCRP system at<br>
<a href="https://cpp2020.hotcrp.com">https://cpp2020.hotcrp.com</a></p>
<p>Submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient detail<br>
to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper.</p>
<p>Submitted papers must be formatted following the <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/">ACM SIGPLAN
Proceedings</a> format using the<br>
<code>acmart</code> style with the <code>sigplan</code> option, which provides a two-column<br>
style,<br>
using 10 point font for the main text, and a header for double blind review<br>
submission, i.e.,</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Isabelle"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">\</span><span class="n">documentclass</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">sigplan</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">10pt</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">review</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="ow">{</span><span class="n">acmart</span><span class="ow">}</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="n">settopmatter</span><span class="ow">{</span><span class="n">printfolios</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">true</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">printccs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">false</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">printacmref</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">false</span><span class="ow">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages, including tables and<br>
figures, but <strong>excluding bibliography and clearly marked appendices</strong>.<br>
The paper should be self contained without the appendices. Shorter<br>
papers are welcome and will be given equal consideration. Papers not<br>
conforming to the requirements concerning format and maximum length may<br>
be rejected without further consideration.</p>
<p>CPP 2020 will employ a <strong>lightweight double-blind reviewing process</strong>.<br>
To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>author names and institutions must be omitted, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>references to authors' own related work should be in the third person<br>
  (e.g., not "We build on our previous work …" but rather “We build on<br>
  the work of …").</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers<br>
come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it<br>
impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing<br>
should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or<br>
makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular,<br>
important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In<br>
addition, authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions<br>
of their paper as usual. For example, authors may post drafts of their<br>
papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. POPL has<br>
answers for frequently asked questions addressing many common concerns:<br>
<a href="https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ">https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ</a></p>
<p>We encourage authors to provide any supplementary material that is<br>
required to support the claims made in the paper, such as proof scripts<br>
or experimental data. These materials must be uploaded at submission<br>
time, as an archive, not via a URL. Two forms of supplementary material<br>
may be submitted:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anonymous supplementary material is available to the reviewers before<br>
 they submit their first-draft reviews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-anonymous supplementary material is available to the reviewers<br>
 after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and learned the<br>
 identity of the authors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the anonymous form whenever possible, so that the materials can be<br>
taken into account from the beginning of the reviewing process.</p>
<p>Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and the<br>
ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences,<br>
journals, workshops with proceedings, or similar forums of publication<br>
are not allowed. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related<br>
work submitted to a conference or journal in advance of submission.</p>
<p>One author of each accepted paper is expected to present it at the<br>
conference.</p>
<h3>Publication, copyright, and open access</h3>
<p>The CPP proceedings will be published by the ACM, and authors of accepted<br>
papers will be required to choose one of the following publication options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM<br>
<strong>a non-exclusive permission-to-publish license</strong><br>
  and, optionally, licenses the work under a Creative Commons license;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM<br>
<strong>an exclusive permission-to-publish license</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Author <strong>transfers copyright</strong> of the work to ACM.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For authors who can afford it, we recommend option 1, which will make<br>
the paper <strong>Gold Open Access</strong>, and also encourage such authors to<br>
license their work under the CC-BY license. ACM will charge you an<br>
article processing fee for this option (currently, US$700), which you<br>
have to pay directly with the ACM.</p>
<p>For everyone else, we recommend option 2, which is free and allows you<br>
to achieve <strong>Green Open Access</strong>, by uploading a pre-print of your paper<br>
to a repository that guarantees permanent archival such as arXiv or<br>
HAL. This is anyway a good idea for <strong>timely dissemination</strong> even if you<br>
chose option 1. Ensuring timely dissemination is particularly important<br>
for this edition, since, because of the very tight schedule, the<br>
official proceedings might not be available in time for CPP.</p>
<p>The official CPP 2020 proceedings will also be available via SIGPLAN<br>
OpenTOC.</p>
<p>For ACM's take on this, see their Copyright Policy and Author Rights.</p>
