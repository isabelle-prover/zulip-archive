             LfSA'10 - Logics for System Analysis<br>
     Workshop Affiliated with IJCAR and LICS at FLoC 2010<br>
               July 15th, 2010, Edinburgh, UK<br>

<p>Safety-critical systems frequently occur as real-time systems, embedded<br>
systems, hybrid systems, distributed systems, and cyber-physical<br>
systems. They are also becoming more and more important in many<br>
application domains, including aviation, automotive, railway, robotic,<br>
or medical applications. To ensure the correct functioning of<br>
safety-critical systems it is necessary to model and reason about<br>
hardware (including physical properties or movement), software,<br>
communication aspects, and qualitative and quantitative aspects of the<br>
system environment.</p>
<p>Logics for system analysis, system modeling, and specification, are<br>
primary tools to analyze system behavior.  Logic is equally important<br>
for understanding the theoretical foundations of system analysis and as<br>
the basis for practical analysis tools that establish correct<br>
functioning of systems or find bugs in their designs.  Depending on the<br>
nature of the system, modeling languages that are amenable to logical<br>
analysis and the study of correctness properties include logical<br>
representations, automata, state charts, Petri nets, dataflow models, or<br>
systems of differential equations. Several system models can be analyzed<br>
rigorously with the help of techniques such as logical calculi, decision<br>
procedures, model checking, and abstraction.</p>
<p>LfSA'10 is devoted to the systematic theoretical study, practical<br>
development, and applied use of logics for system analysis. The purpose<br>
of the LfSA workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners<br>
interested in studying practically relevant systems or in developing the<br>
logical foundations and analysis tools for their study.</p>
<p>Topics</p>
<hr>
<p>* Logics for safety-critical systems (real-time, embedded, hybrid,<br>
      distributed, stochastic, cyber-physical)</p>
<p>* Logic-based methods for development of safety-critical systems<br>
    * System representations using logics, automata, modeling<br>
      languages, state charts, Petri nets, dataflow models</p>
<p>* Theories, decision procedures, and calculi for system analysis<br>
    * Model checking, theorem proving, and systematic testing<br>
    * Case studies for logical system analysis<br>
    * Applications of system analysis to industrial problems<br>
      (including automotive, aviation, railway, robotics, process<br>
      control, mixed analog/digital circuits in chip design)</p>
<p>In particular, we invite contributions that bridge the gap between<br>
theory and practice or that combine different application domains.</p>
<p>Submission Categories</p>
<hr>
<p>* Regular papers (up to 15 pages), which should present previously<br>
      unpublished work (completed or in progress), including<br>
      descriptions of research, tools, and applications.</p>
<p>* Short papers (up to 5 pages), which describe work in progress or<br>
      aim at initiating discussions.</p>
<p>* Presentation-only papers, i.e., papers already submitted or<br>
      presented at a conference or another workshop; such papers will<br>
      not be included in the LfSA proceedings but will be presented<br>
      during the workshop.</p>
<p>In addition to informal and electronic workshop proceedings, we consider<br>
the option of a special issue in a journal after the workshop.</p>
