CPP 2017: The 6th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Certified Programs and Proofs<br>
Paris, France, January 16 - 17, 2017 (co-located with POPL'17)<br>
<a href="http://cpp2017.mpi-sws.org/">http://cpp2017.mpi-sws.org/</a></p>
<p>Call for papers</p>
<p>CPP is an international forum on theoretical and practical topics in all <br>
areas, including computer science, mathematics, and education, that <br>
consider certification as an essential paradigm for their work. <br>
Certification here means formal, mechanized verification of some sort, <br>
preferably with production of independently checkable certificates.</p>
<p>We welcome submissions in research areas related to formal certification <br>
of programs and proofs. The following is a suggested list of topics of <br>
interests to CPP. This is a non-exhaustive list and should be read as a <br>
guideline rather than a requirement.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>certified or certifying programming, compilation, linking, OS kernels, <br>
runtime systems, and security monitors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>program logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>certified decision procedures, mathematical libraries, and <br>
mathematical theorems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>proof assistants and proof theory;</p>
</li>
<li>new languages and tools for certified programming;</li>
<li>program analysis, program verification, and proof-carrying code;</li>
<li>certified secure protocols and transactions;</li>
<li>
<p>certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra, <br>
polynomial systems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality, <br>
first-order logic, and higher-order unification;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>certificates for program termination;</p>
</li>
<li>logics for certifying concurrent and distributed programs;</li>
<li>
<p>higher-order logics, logical systems, separation logics, and logics <br>
for security;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teaching mathematics and computer science with proof assistants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission guidelines</p>
<p>Papers should be submitted in PDF format through the EasyChair <br>
submission page at</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2017">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2017</a>.</p>
<p>Submitted papers must be formatted following the ACM SIGPLAN Proceedings <br>
format (seehttp://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/) using <strong>10 point</strong> <br>
font for the main text (not the default 9pt font).</p>
<p>Papers should should not exceed <strong>12 pages</strong> including all tables, <br>
figures, and bibliography. Shorter papers are very welcome and will be <br>
given equal consideration.</p>
<p>Abstracts must be submitted by October 5, 2016 (AOE). The deadline for <br>
full papers is October 12, 2016 (AOE), and authors have the option to <br>
withdraw their papers during the window between the two.</p>
<p>Submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to <br>
allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper. They <br>
should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the <br>
main results, and a brief explanation of their significance and <br>
relevance to the conference, all phrased for the non-specialist. <br>
Technical and formal developments directed to the specialist should <br>
follow. References and comparisons with related work should be included. <br>
Papers not conforming to the above requirements concerning format and <br>
length may be rejected without further consideration.</p>
<p>Whenever appropriate, the submission should come along with a formal <br>
development, using whatever prover, e.g., Agda, Coq, Dafny, Elf, HOL, <br>
HOL-Light, Isabelle, Lean, Matita, Mizar, NQTHM, PVS, Vampire, etc. Such <br>
formal developments must be submitted together with the paper as <br>
auxiliary material, and will be taken into account during the reviewing <br>
process.</p>
<p>The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication <br>
elsewhere, including the proceedings of other published conferences or <br>
workshops. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work <br>
submitted to a conference or journal in advance of submission. Original <br>
formal proofs of known results in mathematics or computer science are <br>
welcome. One author of each accepted paper is expected to present it at <br>
the conference.</p>
<p>For any questions about the formatting or submission of papers, please <br>
consult the PC chairs.</p>
