<p>2nd International Workshop on Automated<br>
          Specification and Verification<br>
               of Web Systems (WWV'06)</p>
<p>Cyprus, November 15-19, 2006<br>
               (Track of ISoLA 2006)</p>

<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The  increased  complexity  of Web sites and the explosive growth of<br>
Web-based applications has turned their design and construction into<br>
a  challenging problem. Nowadays, many companies have diverted their<br>
Web   sites   into   interactive,   completely-automated,  Web-based<br>
applications (such  as  Amazon, on-line banking, or travel agencies)<br>
with  a  high complexity that requires appropriate specification and<br>
verification  techniques and tools. Systematic, formal approaches to<br>
the  analysis  and  verification  can  address  the problems of this<br>
particular  domain  with  automated  and  reliable  tools  that also<br>
incorporate semantic aspects.</p>
<p>We solicit paper on formal methods and techniques applied to Web<br>
sites, Web services or Web-based applications, such as:</p>
<p>* rule-based approaches to Web site analysis, certification,<br>
    specification, verification, and optimization</p>
<p>* formal models for describing and reasoning about Web sites<br>
  * model-checking, synthesis and debugging of Web sites<br>
  * abstract interpretation and program transformation applied<br>
    to the semantic Web</p>
<p>* intelligent tutoring and advisory systems for Web specifications<br>
    authoring</p>
<p>The WWV series provides a forum for researchers from the communities<br>
of Rule-based programming, Automated Software Engineering, and<br>
Web-oriented research to facilitate the cross-fertilization and the<br>
advancement of hybrid methods that combine the three areas.</p>
<p>LOCATION</p>
<p>WWV'06 will be held in November in Cyprus as a Special Track of the<br>
2006 International Symposium on Leveraging Applications of Formal<br>
Methods, Verification, and Validation (ISoLA 2006).</p>
<p>SUBMISSION PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Submissions must be received by July 16, 2006. In addition, an ASCII<br>
version of the title and abstract must have been submitted by July 3,<br>
2006. Submitted papers should be at most 15 pages in the Lecture Notes<br>
in Computer Science (LNCS) style. Submitted papers should include an<br>
abstract and the author's information. See the author's instructions<br>
of LNCS style at <a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION</p>
<p>Accepted papers will be published in a preliminary proceedings volume,<br>
which will be available during the workshop. Publication of the<br>
workshop post-proceedings by IEEE Computer Society Press is envisaged.</p>
