CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>3rd International Verification Workshop (VERIFY'06)</p>
<p>What are the verification problems? What are the deduction techniques?</p>
<p>in connection with IJCAR'06 at FLoC'06</p>
<p>August 15-16, 2006, Seattle, USA</p>
<p>[http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~omega/workshops/Verify06/]</p>
<p>The formal verification of   critical information systems has  a  long<br>
tradition as   one  of the  main  areas of  application for  automated<br>
theorem  proving.    Nevertheless,  the  area  is  of  still   growing<br>
importance as the number of computers affecting  everyday life and the<br>
complexity of  these systems are both increasing.   The purpose of the<br>
VERIFY workshop  series is to  discuss   problems arising  during  the<br>
formal  modeling   and  verification  of  information systems  and  to<br>
investigate suitable solutions.   Possible  perspectives include those<br>
of automated theorem  proving,  tool support, system  engineering, and<br>
applications.</p>
<p>The   VERIFY   workshops  aim  at  bringing  together  people  who are<br>
interested in the development of safety and security critical systems,<br>
in formal  methods, in the  development  of automated theorem  proving<br>
techniques, and  in  the  development  of  tool   support.   Practical<br>
experiences  gained in realistic verifications  are of interest to the<br>
automated theorem proving community and new theorem proving techniques<br>
should be transferred into   practice.  The overall objective  of  the<br>
VERIFY workshops is to identify open problems  and to discuss possible<br>
solutions under the theme</p>
<p>What are the verification problems? What are the deduction techniques?</p>
<p>In  2006,   VERIFY will  specifically   consider issues  regarding the<br>
application of "tool support   for formal modeling,  verification  and<br>
stepwise  system  development" without excluding submissions regarding<br>
other topics in the focus of the  workshop.  Therefore, submissions in<br>
this area are especially encouraged.</p>
<p>Topics include (but are not limited to)</p>
<ul>
<li>ATP techniques in verification      + Information flow control</li>
<li>
<p>Case studies                        + Refinement &amp; decomposition<br>
  (specification &amp; verification)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combination of verification systems + Reliability of mobile computing</p>
</li>
<li>Integration of ATPs and CASE-tools  + Reuse of specifications &amp; proofs</li>
<li>Compositional &amp; modular reasoning   + Management of change</li>
<li>
<p>Experience reports on using         + Safety-critical systems<br>
  formal methods        </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaps between problems &amp; techniques  + Security models</p>
</li>
<li>Formal methods for fault tolerance  + Tool support for formal methods</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions are encouraged in one of the following two categories:</p>
<p>A.  Regular  papers: Submissions  in  this category  should  describe<br>
     previously unpublished work (completed or in progress), including<br>
     descriptions of research,  tools, and  applications.  Papers must<br>
     be formated  following the Springer  LNCS guidelines and  be 6-15<br>
     pages long.</p>
<p>B.  Discussion papers: Submissions  in this category are  intended to<br>
     initiate discussions and should address controversial issues, and<br>
     may include provocative   statements.   Papers must  be  formated<br>
     following the Springer LNCS guidelines and be 3-15 pages long.</p>
<p>Submission of papers is via EasyChair at <a href="http://www.easychair.org/VERIFY-06/">www.easychair.org/VERIFY-06/</a>.</p>
<p>Upon submission, the category (either A or B)  must be indicated.  The<br>
informal   workshop proceedings will   be distributed at the workshop.<br>
Final versions of accepted papers have to be prepared with LaTeX.</p>
<p>Following up  the workshop there  will be a  call for submissions to a<br>
special issue of  the Journal of Automated  Reasoning dedicated to the<br>
topics   of  VERIFY'06.   Authors   of  accepted   regular papers  are<br>
especially encouraged to submit to this special issue.</p>
