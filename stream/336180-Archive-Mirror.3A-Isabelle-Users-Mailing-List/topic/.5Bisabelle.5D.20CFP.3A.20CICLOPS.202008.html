<p>Topics of interest</p>
<hr>
<p>This  workshop aims  at discussing  and exchanging  experience  on the<br>
design, implementation, and  optimization of logic, constraint (logic)<br>
programming  systems, and  systems intimately  related to  logic  as a<br>
means  to   express  computations.   Experience  backed  up   by  real<br>
implementations and their evaluation will be given preference, as well<br>
as descriptions of work in progress in that direction.</p>
<p>Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>* Standard and alternative sequential implementation schemes (e.g.,<br>
    generalization / modification of the WAM, translation to<br>
    lower-level and/or general-purpose languages, etc.)</p>
<p>* Implementation of parallel and concurrent logic and constraint<br>
    programming systems.</p>
<p>* Compile-time analysis and its application to code generation.</p>
<p>* Interaction between high-level optimizations / transformations /<br>
    specialization and low-level issues.</p>
<p>* Memory management, indexing, and garbage collection issues.</p>
<p>* Balance between compile-time effort and run-time machinery.</p>
<p>* Implementation techniques for declarative programming paradigms<br>
    with basis on, or extending, logic and constraint programming,<br>
    such as non-monotonic reasoning, inductive logic programming,<br>
    co-inductive logic programming, contextual logic programming, etc. </p>
<p>* Implementation of systems closely related to, or based on, logic,<br>
    such as theorem provers and natural language processing systems.</p>
<p>* Automatic performance evaluation of logic and constraint<br>
    programming systems.</p>
<p>* User-oriented tools for performance evaluation and enhancement.</p>
<p>* Software design with / for LP/CP systems: components, code<br>
    patterns and rules, etc.</p>
<p>* Design and implementation of programming environments.</p>
<p>* Experiences from using systems in real-life applications.</p>
<p>Workshop Goals</p>
<hr>
<p>Our  intent is  to  bring  together, in  an  informal setting,  people<br>
involved  in  research   on  sequential  and  parallel  implementation<br>
technologies  for  logic  and  constraint  programming  languages  and<br>
systems, in  order to  promote the exchange  of ideas and  feedback on<br>
recent developments. We hope that  the workshop will provide a meeting<br>
point for  people working  on implementation technology  for different<br>
aspects of logic and constraint-based languages and systems.</p>
<p>Rationale and History</p>
<hr>
<p>Progress in computing technology,  including the now readily available<br>
multicore processors, increased  memory capacity and bandwidth, faster<br>
networking  technology,  and   O.S.  support  for  cluster  computing,<br>
combined  with recent  advances  in compilation  technologies and  the<br>
wider  adoption   of  alternative  constraint/logic-based  programming<br>
languages,  are making  high-level languages  to be  regarded  as good<br>
candidates for programming  complex, demanding applications. A witness<br>
of this  very interesting  trend is the  interest of Intel  with their<br>
sponsorship  of the DAMP  series of  workshops. Logic  Programming and<br>
Constraint  Programming,   in  particular,  offer  one   of  the  best<br>
alternatives, as  they couple a very  high level of  abstraction and a<br>
declarative nature with flexibility  its execution model, which can be<br>
adapted to different scenarios.</p>
<p>An orthogonal but synergistic  issue in the pursue of high-performance<br>
and  high-level  languages   comes  from  advances  in  implementation<br>
techniques for logic and constraint languages. These techniques aim at<br>
achieving  both design flexibility  and good  performance in  terms of<br>
speed and memory consumption,  thus making those languages and systems<br>
more  amenable  than ever  for  real  world applications.  Maintaining<br>
flexibility without  unnecessarily sacrificing performance,  and while<br>
retaining a  high level which  relieves the programmer  from burdening<br>
tasks,  requires   sophisticated  technology  whose   exploration  and<br>
development is one the aims of this workshop.</p>
<p>This  workshop  continues  a  tradition  of  successful  workshops  on<br>
Implementations of Logic Programming  Systems, previously held with in<br>
Budapest  (1993) and  Ithaca  (1994), the  Compulog  Net workshops  on<br>
Parallelism and  Implementation Technologies held in  Madrid (1993 and<br>
1994), Utrecht (1995) and Bonn (1996), the Workshop on Parallelism and<br>
Implementation Technology for (Constraint) Logic Programming Languages<br>
held in  Port Jefferson (1997), Manchester (1998),  Las Cruces (1999),<br>
and London (2000), and  more recently the Colloquium on Implementation<br>
of Constraint and LOgic  Programming Systems in Paphos (Cyprus, 2001),<br>
Copenhagen (2002),  Mumbai (2003),  Saint Malo (France,  2004), Sitges<br>
(Spain, 2005), Seattle (U.S.A., 2006) and Porto (Portugal, 2007).</p>
