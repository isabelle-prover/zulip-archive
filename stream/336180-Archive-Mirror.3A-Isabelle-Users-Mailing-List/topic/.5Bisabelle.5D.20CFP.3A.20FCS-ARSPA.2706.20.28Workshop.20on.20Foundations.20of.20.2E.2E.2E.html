<p>BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE<br>
=========================</p>
<p>Computer security is an established field of computer science of both<br>
theoretical and practical significance. In recent years, there has been<br>
increasing interest in logic-based foundations for various methods in<br>
computer security, including the formal specification, analysis and<br>
design of security protocols and their applications, the formal<br>
definition of various aspects of security such as access control<br>
mechanisms, mobile code security and denial-of-service attacks, and the<br>
modeling of information flow and its application to confidentiality<br>
policies, system composition, and covert channel analysis.</p>
<p>The workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is the fusion of two workshops. The workshop<br>
FCS continues a tradition, initiated with the Workshops on Formal<br>
Methods and Security Protocols (FMSP) in 1998 and 1999, then with the<br>
Workshop on Formal Methods and Computer Security (FMCS) in 2000, and<br>
finally with the LICS satellite Workshop on Foundations of Computer<br>
Security (FCS) in 2002 through 2005, of bringing together formal methods<br>
and the security community.</p>
<p>The ARSPA workshop is the third in a series of workshops on Automated<br>
Reasoning for Security Protocol Analysis, bringing together researchers<br>
and practitioners from both the security and the formal methods<br>
communities, from academia and industry, who are working on developing<br>
and applying automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal<br>
specification and analysis of security protocols. The first two ARSPA<br>
workshops were held as satellite events of IJCAR'04 and of ICALP'05,<br>
respectively.</p>
<p>The aim of the joint workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is to provide a forum for<br>
continued activity in these areas, to bring computer security<br>
researchers in closer contact with the LICS community, and to give LICS<br>
attendees an opportunity to talk to experts in computer security. We<br>
thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work and on work in<br>
progress.</p>
<p>We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security<br>
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions<br>
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in<br>
new results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques<br>
and tools for the formal specification and analysis of security<br>
protocols.</p>
<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Automated reasoning techniques       Access control and resource usage control<br>
Composition issues                   Authentication<br>
Formal specification                 Availability and denial of service<br>
Foundations of verification          Covert channels<br>
Information flow analysis            Confidentiality<br>
Language-based security              Integrity and privacy<br>
Logic-based design              for  Intrusion detection<br>
Program transformation               Malicious code<br>
Security models                      Mobile code<br>
Static analysis                      Mutual distrust<br>
Statistical methods                  Privacy<br>
Tools                                Security policies<br>
Trust management                     Security protocols</p>
<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must<br>
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION<br>
==========</p>
<p>Submissions should be at most 15 pages (a4paper, 11pt), including<br>
references, in the Springer LNCS style available at the URL<br>
<a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a><br>
The cover page should include title, names of authors, co-ordinates of<br>
the corresponding author, an abstract, and a list of keywords.<br>
It is recommended that submissions adhere to the specified format and<br>
length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected<br>
immediately.<br>
Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication in<br>
the final version - for example details of proofs - may be placed in a<br>
clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. <br>
Simultaneous submissions to a journal or another conference are accepted.</p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit their papers electronically, as portable<br>
document format (pdf) or postscript (ps); please, do not send files<br>
formatted for work processing packages (e.g., Microsoft Word or<br>
Wordperfect files).</p>
<p>The only mechanism for paper submissions is via the electronic<br>
submission web-site (which will soon be available).</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>
===============</p>
<p>Papers due:                     May  10, 2006<br>
Notification of acceptance:     June 16, 2006<br>
Final paper versions due:       July 14, 2006<br>
Workshop:                   August 15-16, 2006</p>
<p>PUBLICATION<br>
===========<br>
Informal proceedings will be made available in electronic format and<br>
they will be distributed to all participants of the workshop.<br>
The authors of the best papers might be invited to submit an extended<br>
revision for inclusion in a special issue of a journal, with an<br>
additional reviewing process.</p>
