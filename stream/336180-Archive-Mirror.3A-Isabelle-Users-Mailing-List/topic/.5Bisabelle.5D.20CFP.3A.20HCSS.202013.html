The NSA Thirteenth Annual HCSS Conference (2013)*<br>
<em>Call for Presentations</em></p>
<p><em>Introduction</em><br>
The thirteenth annual HCSS Conference will be held May 7-10, 2013 at the<br>
Historic Inns of Annapolis in Annapolis, Maryland. You are invited to<br>
submit a proposal to present a talk at this year's conference. As an added<br>
feature at the 2013 HCSS Conference, you are also invited to participate in<br>
a poster session. See details below for more information.<br>
<em>Background</em><br>
Our security, safety, privacy, and well-being are all increasingly<br>
dependent upon the correctness, reliability, resilience, and integrity of<br>
software-intensive systems of all kinds, including cyber-physical systems<br>
(CPS). Our systems must be capable of interacting correctly, safely, and<br>
securely with humans and the physical world even while they operate in<br>
changing, difficult-to-predict, and possibly malicious environments. New<br>
foundations in science, technology, and advanced practice continue to be<br>
needed. Moreover, these methods and tools have to be transitioned into<br>
mainstream use to build and assure these systems‹and to move towards more<br>
effective models for acceptance and certification.<br>
<em>Conference Scope, Goals, and Vision</em><br>
The High Confidence Software and Systems (HCSS) Conference, now in its<br>
second decade, draws together researchers, practitioners, and management<br>
leaders from government, universities, and industry. The conference<br>
provides a forum for dialogue centered upon the development of scientific<br>
foundations for the assured engineering of software-intensive complex<br>
computing systems and the transition of science into practice. The<br>
technical emphasis of the HCSS conference is on mathematically-based tools<br>
and techniques, scientific foundations supporting evidence creation,<br>
systems assurance, and security. The HCSS vision is one of engaging and<br>
growing a community‹including researchers and skilled practitioners‹that is<br>
focused around the creation of dependable systems that are capable,<br>
efficient, and responsive; that can work in dangerous or inaccessible<br>
environments; that can support large-scale, distributed coordination; that<br>
augment human capabilities; that can advance the mission of national<br>
security; and that enhance quality of life, safety, and security.<br>
<em>Conference Themes</em><br>
The 2013 HCSS Conference week will highlight daily themes including on the<br>
following topics:<br>
·       <em>Automatic theorem proving and SMT:</em> With the rapidly increasing<br>
power and applicability of automated theorem proving and SMT tools, both<br>
new and existing tools can benefit tremendously from the reduction of both<br>
decidable and undecidable programs to these off-the-shelf tools.<br>
 Furthermore, developers of automated reasoning tools are actively looking<br>
to increase the applicability and performance of their tools based on<br>
customer need.  The idea of this day is to get prover developers together<br>
with users of the tools to discuss what is possible today, and what will be<br>
possible tomorrow.<br>
·       <em>Javascript:</em>  Javascript is the modern day x86 (messy but<br>
omnipresent). In order to make off-the-shelf systems robust and secure, we<br>
must consider ways of writing and reasoning about Javascript code.  The<br>
purpose of this day¹s theme will be to gather experts in programming,<br>
networking, program verification/analysis, etc to discuss the current<br>
advances in the area of Javascript-based development.  Note that<br>
presentations on tools or techniques that address problems similar to<br>
Javascript are also welcome.<br>
·       <em>Boundary between hardware and software</em>: The dramatic increase in<br>
computational performance and power requirements combined with the<br>
leveling-off of microprocessor clock speeds forces us to remove traditional<br>
abstractions between hardware and software.  For example, weak memory<br>
concurrency gives increased performance at the cost of the traditional idea<br>
of sequential consistency. On this day we aim to bring together those<br>
working at different levels of abstraction in computer systems to discuss<br>
common techniques, goals, and to learn about techniques unique to their<br>
area that may be applicable in others.<br>
Note that presentations on other related themes are also encouraged.<br>
<em>Conference Presentations</em><br>
The conference program features invited speakers, panel discussions, poster<br>
presentations, and a technical track of contributed papers.<br>
<em>Technical Track Presentations</em><br>
The technical track features two kinds of talks:<br>
§  <em>Experience reports.</em> These talks inform participants about how emerging<br>
HCSS and CPS techniques play out in real-world applications, focusing<br>
especially on lessons learned and insights gained. While experience reports<br>
do not have to be highly technical, they should emphasize substantive<br>
reflection on all aspects of experience, building on data and direct<br>
experience. Experience reports can focus on topics such as transitioning<br>
science into practice, architecture and requirements, the use of advanced<br>
languages and tools, evaluation and assessment, team practice and tooling,<br>
supply-chain issues, and so on.<br>
§  <em>Technical talks.</em> These talks focus on informing the audience regarding<br>
specific techniques or methods, ideally from the point of view of someone<br>
with experience in practice. There is a wide range of relevant topics and<br>
themes including analysis of concurrency, use of hybrid reasioning<br>
approaches, theorem proving, separation logic, analysis, synthesis,<br>
analytics, and modeling particular techniques. Such talks should<br>
nonetheless be accessible to the broad HCSS and CPS audience.<br>
If you are interested in offering a talk on one of this year's topics or<br>
themes‹or nominating someone else to be invited to do so‹please upload an<br>
abstract of  *one page or less *for your proposed talk or a *one paragraph<br>
description* of your nominee¹s proposed talk by <em>Tuesday, March 22nd, 2013</em><br>

<p>Slide presentations and supporting documents of accepted talks should be<br>
submitted in pdf format no later than <em>Friday, April 27, 2013</em>.</p>
<p><em>Poster Presentations</em><br>
If you are interested in participating in the poster session, please upload<br>
an <em>abstract</em> of your proposed poster theme with title by *Tuesday, March<br>
22nd, 2013* at</p>
<p><em>http://cps-vo.org/group/hcss_conference/cfposters2013</em></p>
<p>Posters should provide an overview of the HCSS Conference theme or research<br>
topic and/or results, with effective use of appropriate graphics. Only a<br>
limited number of posters will be accepted due to space availability. All<br>
posters for display should be printed in a 3¹x4¹ size format. Notifications<br>
of accepted posters will be made by <em>Friday, March 29, 2013</em>. Content<br>
designs of accepted posters can be submitted electronically in either Adobe<br>
InDesign (preferred) or pdf formats also by <em>Friday, April 27, 2013</em>. The<br>
conference organizers will print posters free of charge if design content<br>
is electronically submitted by the April 27 due date. After April 27,<br>
poster session participants will be responsible for the printing and<br>
delivery of their own posters. The conference organizers will provide<br>
easels and basic setup for all poster displays. Poster session participants<br>
should contact the conference organizers in advance if additional materials<br>
or props are desired.</p>
