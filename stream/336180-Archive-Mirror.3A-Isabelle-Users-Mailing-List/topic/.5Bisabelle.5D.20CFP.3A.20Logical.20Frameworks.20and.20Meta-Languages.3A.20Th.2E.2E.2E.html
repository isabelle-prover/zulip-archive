Logical Frameworks and Meta-Languages: Theory and Practice<br>

<p>Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for<br>
representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of deductive<br>
systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their design and<br>
implementation and their use in reasoning tasks ranging from the correctness<br>
of software to the properties of formal computational systems have been the<br>
focus of considerable research over the last two decades. This workshop will<br>
bring together designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss various<br>
aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical frameworks,<br>
including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and co-inductive<br>
reasoning techniques and the expressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning<br>
process.</p>
<p>LFMTP 2016 will provide researchers a forum to present state-of-the-art<br>
techniques and discuss progress in areas such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming languages and<br>
   related formally specified systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable<br>
   binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning about,<br>
   datatypes defined from binding signatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and<br>
   associated reasoning techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New theory contributions: canonical and substructural frameworks,<br>
   contextual frameworks, proof-theoretic foundations supporting binders,<br>
   functional programming over logical frameworks, homotopy type theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of logical frameworks, e.g., in proof-carrying<br>
   architectures such as proof-carrying authorization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Techniques for programming with binders in functional programming<br>
   languages such as Haskell, OCaml, or Agda and logic programming languages<br>
   such as lambda Prolog or Alpha-Prolog.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>== Submission ==</p>
<p>In addition to regular papers, we also solicit "work in progress"<br>
reports, in a broad sense.  Those do not need to report fully polished<br>
research results, but should be interesting for the community at large.</p>
<p>Submitted papers should be in PDF, formatted using the ACM sigplanconf<br>
style files. The length is restricted to 10 pages for regular papers and<br>
7 pages for "Work in Progress" papers.</p>

published in ACM digital library in its International Proceedings series.</p>

<p>SUBMISSION INFORMATION</p>

polished research results, but should be of interest for the community<br>
at large.</p>

style. The length is restricted to 15 pages for regular papers and 8<br>
pages for "Work in Progress" papers.</p>
<p>Submission is via EasyChair:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=lfmtp2020">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=lfmtp2020</a></p>
<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed and the authors of those accepted<br>
will be invited to present their papers at the workshop.</p>
<p>POST-PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>After the workshop we will publish post-proceedings in the Electronic<br>
Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) series.</p>
<p>Accepted regular papers will be published in the post-proceedings.</p>
<p>Authors of selected work-in-progress papers will be invited to submit<br>
