<p>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION</p>
<p>Model-based design and analysis of cyber-physical systems<br>
           SPES_XT Summer School at AVoCS'14<br>
                 Twente, The Netherlands<br>
                    Sept. 17-23, 2014</p>
<p>Today's challenges in the development of embedded and cyber-physical<br>
systems are mainly caused by the ever-increasing complexity of the<br>
software. Model-based design and analysis has a high potential to<br>
overcome these challenges. SPES_XT (Software Platform Embedded<br>
Systems) is a large German endeavour to build a consistent, coherent<br>
model-based design methodology for complex embedded and cyber-physical<br>
systems. The aim of AVoCS (International Workshop on Automated<br>
Verification of Critical Systems) is to further research on tools and<br>
techniques for the verification of critical systems. The SPES_XT<br>
Summer School at AVoCS'14 will present results and experiences from<br>
the SPES_XT project, as well as research approaches established at<br>
AVoCS. It will provide a concise introduction to the state-of-the-art,<br>
as well as new approaches and research questions. Attendants will gain<br>
an intimate understanding of a consistent system development process<br>
for complex embedded and cyber-physical systems over different<br>
application domains (e.g. automation, automotive, avionic, rail).</p>
<p>The school addresses young researchers as well as young professionals<br>
from industry. It will be held immediately prior to AVoCS 2014.</p>
<p>COURSES</p>
<p>Holger Schlingloff: Cyber-Physical Systems Engineering<br>
  Manfred Broy: Logics of Discrete System Design - From Formal Models to <br>
System Assertions<br>
  Alexander Knapp: Modern modeling formalisms: UML, SysML, MARTE<br>
  Alessio Lomuscio: Model Checking of Multi-Agent Systems<br>
  Marieke Huisman: Verification of Concurrent Software<br>
  Markus Roggenbach: Foundational Concepts and Techniques for Modeling <br>
and Verification<br>
  Stephan Merz: Modeling and Verifying Systems in TLA+<br>
  Joachim Wegener: Methods and Tools for Analytical Quality Assurance<br>
  Joost Pieter Katoen: Quantitative Analysis of Safety-Critical Systems</p>
