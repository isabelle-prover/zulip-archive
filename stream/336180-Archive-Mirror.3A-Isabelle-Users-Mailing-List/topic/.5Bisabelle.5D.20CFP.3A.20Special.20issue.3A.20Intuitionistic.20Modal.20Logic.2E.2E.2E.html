Call for Papers</p>
<p>Special Issue of Information and Computation on<br>
Intuitionistic Modal Logics and Applications (IMLA)</p>
<p>Guest Editors: Valeria de Paiva, Brigitte  Pientka and Aleks Nanevski</p>
<p>Submission deadline: 31. May, 2009</p>
<p>Constructive modal logics and type theories are of increasing<br>
foundational and practical relevance in computer science. Applications<br>
are in type disciplines for programming languages, and meta-logics for<br>
reasoning about a variety of computational phenomena.<br>
Theoretical and methodological issues center around the question of<br>
how the proof-theoretic strengths of constructive logics can best be<br>
combined with the model-theoretic strengths of modal logics. Practical<br>
issues center around the question of which modal connectives with<br>
associated laws or proof rules capture computational phenomena<br>
accurately and at the right level of abstraction and how to implement<br>
these efficiently.</p>
<p>There have been a series of   LICS-affiliated workshops devoted to the<br>
theme. The first one was held as part of FLoC1999, Trento, Italy, the<br>
second was part  of FLoC2002, Copenhagen, Denmark, the third was<br>
associated with LiCS2005, Chicago, USA and the last one was associated<br>
with LICS 2008 in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Two special issues of journals<br>
on the theme have already appeared,  a Mathematical Structures in<br>
Computer Science volume edited by Matt Fairtlough, Michael Mendler and<br>
  Eugenio Moggi ( Modalities in type theory) in 2001, and a special<br>
issue of  the Journal of Logic and Computation  in 2004<br>
(Intuitionistic Modal Logics and Application, eds. Valeria de Paiva,<br>
R. Gore ad M. Mendler).</p>
<p>We are hereby soliciting papers for a further special volume<br>
  of Information and Computation, devoted to Intuitionistic Modal<br>
Logics and Applications. We hope to cover the novel applications<br>
presented in the last two workshops, especially applications to<br>
computer security, automated deduction and  computational linguistics,<br>
but also to include work not presented at the workshops. The proposed<br>
timeline  of events is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Papers (preferably under 20 pages long) should be submitted by 31st<br>
May  2009</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reviews will be provided until the end of August 2009 and the volume<br>
should be ready by the end of the Fall.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Topics  of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>applications of intuitionistic necessity and possibility</li>
<li>monads and strong monads</li>
<li>constructive belief logics and type theories</li>
<li>
<p>applications of constructive modal logic and modal type theory to<br>
formal verification, foundations of security, abstract interpretation,<br>
and program analysis and optimization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>modal types for integration of inductive and co-inductive types,<br>
higher-order abstract syntax, strong functional programming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>models of constructive modal logics such as algebraic, categorical,<br>
Kripke, topological, and realizability interpretations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>notions of proof for constructive modal logics</p>
</li>
<li>extraction of constraints or programs from modal proofs</li>
<li>proof search methods for constructive modal logics and their <br>
implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact one of the editors (Valeria de Paiva<br>
<a href="mailto:valeria@cuill.com">valeria@cuill.com</a> or  Brigitte Pientka <a href="mailto:bpientka@cs.mcgill.ca">bpientka@cs.mcgill.ca</a>) if<br>
you're not sure that your paper is within the scope of this special<br>
volume. Submissions should be 10 to 20  pages  long and sent in<br>
PostScript or PDF format to one of the editors, before the 31st<br>
May 2009.</p>
