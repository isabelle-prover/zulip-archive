CALL FOR PAPERS<br>
Workshop on Foundations of Computer Security (FCS 2015)<br>
13 July 2015, Verona, Italy</p>
<p><a href="http://software.imdea.org/~bkoepf/FCS15/">http://software.imdea.org/~bkoepf/FCS15/</a></p>
<p>Affiliated with IEEE CSF 2015</p>
<p>=========================</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKER</p>
<p>Dominique Unruh, University of Tartu</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>Submission:                     April 10, 2015<br>
Notification of acceptance:     May 29, 2015<br>
Workshop:                       July 13, 2015</p>
<p>BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE</p>
<p>Computer security is an established field of both theoretical and<br>
practical significance. In recent years, there has been sustained<br>
interest in the formal foundations of methods used in computer<br>
security. The aim of the FCS 2015 workshop is to provide a forum for<br>
continued activity in this area.</p>
<p>The scope of FCS 2015 includes, but is not limited to, the formal<br>
specification, analysis, and design of cryptographic protocols and<br>
their applications; the formal definition of various aspects of<br>
security such as access control mechanisms, mobile code security and<br>
denial-of-service attacks; the modelling of information flow and its<br>
application to confidentiality policies, system composition, and<br>
covert channel analysis.</p>
<p>We are interested both in new theoretical results in computer security<br>
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions<br>
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in<br>
new results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques<br>
and tools for the formal specification and analysis of security<br>
protocols. We thus solicit submission of papers both on mature work<br>
and on work in progress.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION</p>
<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must<br>
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.</p>
<p>FCS 2015 welcomes two kinds of submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>short abstracts (1 page, including references and appendices), and</li>
<li>full papers (at most 12 pages, excluding references and well-marked<br>
   appendices).</li>
</ul>
<p>Short abstracts will receive as rigorous a review as full<br>
papers. Short abstracts may receive shorter talk slots at the workshop<br>
than full papers, depending on the number of accepted<br>
submissions. Papers should be submitted using the two-column IEEE<br>
Proceedings style available for various document preparation systems<br>
at the IEEE Conference Publishing Services page:<br>
<a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a></p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit their papers electronically in portable<br>
document format (pdf); please do not send files formatted for word<br>
processing packages (e.g., Microsoft Word or WordPerfect files).<br>
Papers must be submitted at the following site:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fcs2015">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fcs2015</a></p>
<p>INFORMAL PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>FCS has no published proceedings. Presenting a paper at the workshop<br>
should not preclude submission to or publication in other<br>
venues. Papers presented at the workshop will be made publicly<br>
available, but this will not constitute an official proceedings.</p>
