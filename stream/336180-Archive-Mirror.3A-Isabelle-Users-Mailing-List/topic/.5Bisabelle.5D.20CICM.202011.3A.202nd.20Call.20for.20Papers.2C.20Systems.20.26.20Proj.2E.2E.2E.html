Second Call for Papers, including NEW Systems and Projects track</p>
<p>Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM)</p>
<p>Bertinoro, Forli (Italy), 18-23 July 2011</p>
<p><a href="http://cicm11.cs.unibo.it">http://cicm11.cs.unibo.it</a></p>
<p>Track A: Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)</p>
<p>Track B: Calculemus</p>
<p>Track C: Systems &amp; Projects</p>
<p>In addition to the formal tracks above, CICM has historically had <br>
associated workshops, and workshop proposals should be sent to the CICM PC <br>
Chair (<a href="mailto:J.H.Davenport@bath.ac.uk">J.H.Davenport@bath.ac.uk</a>), DEFINITELY by the end of February 2011.</p>
<p>Mathematical Knowledge Management is an innovative field at the <br>
intersection of mathematics, computer science, library science, and <br>
scientific publishing. Its development is driven, on the one hand, by new <br>
technological possibilities which computer science, the Internet, and <br>
intelligent knowledge processing offer, and, on the other hand, by the <br>
increasing demand by engineers and scientists for new techniques to help <br>
in producing, transmitting, consuming, and managing sophisticated <br>
mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p>Calculemus is a series of conferences dedicated to the integration of <br>
computer algebra systems (CAS) and systems for mechanised reasoning, the <br>
interactive theorem provers or proof assistants (PA) and the automated <br>
theorem provers (ATP). Currently, symbolic computation is divided into <br>
several (more or less) independent branches: traditional ones (e.g., <br>
computer algebra and mechanised reasoning) as well as newly emerging ones <br>
(on user interfaces, knowledge management, theory exploration, etc.) The <br>
main concern of the Calculemus community is to bring these developments <br>
together in order to facilitate the theory, design, and implementation of <br>
integrated systems for computer mathematics that will routinely be used by <br>
mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers in their every day <br>
business.</p>
<p>Common to MKM and Calculemus is a need for these theories to be developed <br>
in systems and projects, hence there will also be a "Systems and Projects" <br>
track, designed to enable people to showcase their systems and projects.</p>
<p>After successfully colocating as the Conference of Intelligent Computer <br>
Mathematics (CICM), MKM and Calculemus will formally join for CICM 2011. <br>
CICM seeks original high-quality submissions in their tracks and the <br>
"Systems and Projects" track. The topics of interest include but are not <br>
limited to:</p>
<p><strong> MKM track </strong></p>
<p>* Representations of mathematical knowledge</p>
<p>* Repositories of formalized mathematics</p>
<p>* Mathematical digital libraries</p>
<p>* Diagrammatic representations</p>
<p>* Multi-modal representations</p>
<p>* Mathematical OCR</p>
<p>* Mathematical search and retrieval</p>
<p>* Deduction systems</p>
<p>* Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems</p>
<p>* Authoring languages and tools</p>
<p>* MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards</p>
<p>* Web presentation of mathematics</p>
<p>* Data mining, discovery, theory exploration</p>
<p>* Computer algebra systems</p>
<p>* Collaboration tools for mathematics</p>
<p>* Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows</p>
<p><strong> Calculemus track </strong></p>
<p>* Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)</p>
<p>* Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)</p>
<p>* Case studies and applications that both involve computer algebra and mechanised reasoning</p>
<p>* Representation of mathematics in computer algebra</p>
<p>* Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP</p>
<p>* Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving</p>
<p>* Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction</p>
<p>* Mathematical computation in PA and ATP</p>
<p>* Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for computer mathematics</p>
<p>* Theory exploration techniques</p>
<p>* Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint languages, and modeling languages for mechanised mathematics systems (PA, CAS, and ATP).</p>
<p>* Infrastructure for mathematical services</p>
<p>Papers on other topics closely related to the above research areas will <br>
also be welcomed for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong> Submission <strong>*</strong></p>
<p>CICM seeks both formal and work-in-progress submissions.</p>
<p>Formal submissions must not exceed 15 pages and will be reviewed by blind <br>
peer review and evaluated regarding to relevance, clarity, quality, <br>
originality, and impact. Shorter papers, e.g., for system descriptions, <br>
are welcome. Authors will have an opportunity to respond to their papers' <br>
reviews before the programme committee makes a decision.</p>
<p>Selected formal submissions will be published as a volume in the series <br>
Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) by Springer-Verlag. In <br>
addition to these formal proceedings, authors are permitted and encouraged <br>
to publish the final versions of their papers on <a href="http://arXiv.org">arXiv.org</a>.</p>
<p>Work-in-progress submissions are intended to provide a forum for the <br>
presentation of original work that is not (yet) in a suitable form for <br>
submission as a full or system description paper. This includes work in <br>
progress and emerging trends. Their size is not limited, but we recommend <br>
5 - 10 pages.</p>
<p>The programme committee may offers authors of rejected formal submission <br>
to publish as an work-in-progress submission instead. Depending on the <br>
number of work-in-progress papers accepted, presentation may be as a short <br>
talk or as a poster. The work-in-progress proceedings will be published as <br>
a technical report.</p>
<p>The Systems and Projects track requires an abstract, with appropriate <br>
references and links to on-line materials/demonstrations, of at most two <br>
pages.</p>
<p>All papers should be prepared in LaTeX and formatted according to the <br>
requirements of the Springer's LNCS series (the corresponding style files <br>
can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>). By <br>
submitting a paper the authors agree that if it is accepted at least one <br>
of the authors will attend the conference to present it.</p>
