<p>Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM)</p>
<p>Bertinoro, Forli (Italy), 18-23 July 2011</p>
<p><a href="http://cicm11.cs.unibo.it">http://cicm11.cs.unibo.it</a></p>
<p>Track A: Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)</p>
<p>Track B: Calculemus</p>
<p>Track C: Systems &amp; Projects</p>
<p>In addition to the formal tracks above, CICM has historically had<br>
associated workshops, and workshop proposals should be sent to the<br>
CICM PC Chair (<a href="mailto:J.H.Davenport@bath.ac.uk">J.H.Davenport@bath.ac.uk</a>), DEFINITELY by the end of<br>
February 2011.</p>
<p>Mathematical Knowledge Management is an innovative field at the<br>
intersection of mathematics, computer science, library science, and<br>
scientific publishing. Its development is driven, on the one hand, by<br>
new technological possibilities which computer science, the Internet,<br>
and intelligent knowledge processing offer, and, on the other hand, by<br>
the increasing demand by engineers and scientists for new techniques<br>
to help in producing, transmitting, consuming, and managing<br>
sophisticated mathematical<br>
knowledge.</p>
<p>Calculemus is a series of conferences dedicated to the integration of<br>
computer algebra systems (CAS) and systems for mechanised reasoning,<br>
the interactive theorem provers or proof assistants (PA) and the<br>
automated theorem provers (ATP). Currently, symbolic computation is<br>
divided into several (more or less) independent branches: traditional<br>
ones (e.g., computer algebra and mechanised reasoning) as well as<br>
newly emerging ones (on user interfaces, knowledge management, theory<br>
exploration, etc.) The<br>
main concern of the Calculemus community is to bring these<br>
developments together in order to facilitate the theory, design, and<br>
implementation of integrated systems for computer mathematics that<br>
will routinely be used by mathematicians, computer scientists and<br>
engineers in their every day business.</p>
<p>Common to MKM and Calculemus is a need for their solutions to be<br>
implemented and applied. Hence there will also be a "Systems and<br>
Projects" track. It aims to provide a broad overview of the developed<br>
systems, projects, ideas, and interests of the CICM community. The<br>
track welcomes two-page abstracts about fresh systems and projects<br>
related to mathematical knowledge management (MKM) and Calculemus<br>
topics, and about progress on existing systems and projects.</p>
<p>After successfully colocating as the Conference of Intelligent<br>
Computer Mathematics (CICM), MKM and Calculemus will formally join for<br>
CICM 2011. CICM seeks original high-quality submissions in their<br>
tracks and the "Systems and Projects" track. The topics of interest<br>
include but are not limited to:</p>
<p><strong> MKM track </strong></p>
<p>* Representations of mathematical knowledge</p>
<p>* Repositories of formalized mathematics</p>
<p>* Mathematical digital libraries</p>
<p>* Diagrammatic representations</p>
<p>* Multi-modal representations</p>
<p>* Mathematical OCR</p>
<p>* Mathematical search and retrieval</p>
<p>* Deduction systems</p>
<p>* Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems</p>
<p>* Authoring languages and tools</p>
<p>* MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards</p>
<p>* Web presentation of mathematics</p>
<p>* Data mining, discovery, theory exploration</p>
<p>* Computer algebra systems</p>
<p>* Collaboration tools for mathematics</p>
<p>* Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows</p>
<p><strong> Calculemus track </strong></p>
<p>* Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)</p>
<p>* Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)</p>
<p>* Case studies and applications that both involve computer algebra<br>
and mechanised reasoning</p>
<p>* Representation of mathematics in computer algebra</p>
<p>* Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP</p>
<p>* Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving</p>
<p>* Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction</p>
<p>* Mathematical computation in PA and ATP</p>
<p>* Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems<br>
for computer mathematics</p>
<p>* Theory exploration techniques</p>
<p>* Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint<br>
languages, and modeling languages for mechanised mathematics systems<br>
(PA, CAS, and ATP).</p>
<p>* Infrastructure for mathematical services</p>
<p><strong> Systems and Projects track </strong></p>
<p>* Systems addressing the MKM and Calculemus topics</p>
<p>* Projects and long-term visions addressing the MKM and Calculemus topics</p>
<p>Papers on other topics closely related to the above research areas<br>
will also be welcomed for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong> Submission <strong>*</strong></p>
<p>CICM seeks both formal and work-in-progress submissions.</p>
<p>Formal submissions to tracks A or B must not exceed 15 pages and will<br>
be reviewed by blind peer review and evaluated with respect to<br>
relevance, clarity, quality, originality, and impact. Shorter papers,<br>
e.g., for system descriptions, are welcome. Authors will have an<br>
opportunity to respond to their papers' reviews before the programme<br>
committee makes a decision.</p>
<p>Submissions to the Systems &amp; Projects track must not exceed two pages.<br>
The accepted abstracts will be presented at CICM in a fast<br>
presentation session, followed by an open demo/poster session. System<br>
papers must be accompanied by a system demonstration, and project<br>
papers must be accompanied by a poster presentation. The two pages of<br>
the abstract should be new material, accompanied by links to<br>
demos/downloads/project-pages and [existing] system descriptions.<br>
Availability of such accompanying<br>
material will be a strong prerequisite for acceptance.</p>
<p>Selected formal submissions from all tracks will be published as a<br>
volume in the series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI)<br>
by Springer-Verlag. In addition to these formal proceedings, authors<br>
are permitted and encouraged to publish the final versions of their<br>
papers on <a href="http://arXiv.org">arXiv.org</a>.</p>
<p>Work-in-progress submissions are intended to provide a forum for the<br>
presentation of original work that is not (yet) in a suitable form for<br>
submission as a full or system description paper. This includes work<br>
in progress and emerging trends. Their size is not limited, but we<br>
recommend 5 - 10 pages.</p>
<p>The programme committee may offer authors of rejected formal<br>
submissions to publish their contributions as work-in-progress papers<br>
instead. Depending on the number of work-in-progress papers accepted,<br>
they will be presented at the conference either as short talks or as<br>
posters. The work-in-progress proceedings will be published as a<br>
technical report.</p>
<p>All papers should be prepared in LaTeX and formatted according to the<br>
requirements of the Springer's LNCS series (the corresponding style<br>
files can be downloaded from<br>
<a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>). By submitting a paper<br>
the authors agree that if it is accepted at least one of the authors<br>
will attend the conference to present it.</p>
