Dear Isabelle users,</p>
<p>I am not sure if the subsequent CFP made it on the list as intended. The <br>
abstract deadline has passed already yesterday, but there is about one <br>
more week left for the main submission deadline.  Moreover, the PC chairs <br>
have agreed to be flexible to accomodate late submissions.</p>

we are now seeing increasing opportunities for synergy among these<br>
areas. The Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics offers a<br>
venue for discussing these areas and their synergy.</p>
<p>The conference will be organized by Serge Autexier and Michael<br>
Kohlhase at Jacobs University in Bremen and consist of five tracks:</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation (AISC)<br>
   Co-Chairs: John A. Campbell, Jacques Carette<br>

<p>Tracks</p>

<p><strong>* AISC </strong>*</p>
<p>Symbolic computation can be roughly described as the study of<br>
algorithms which operate on expression trees. Another way to phrase<br>
this is to say that the denotational semantics of expressions trees is<br>
not fixed, but is rather context dependent. Expression simplification<br>
is probably the archetypal symbolic computation. Mathematically<br>
oriented software (such as the so-called computer algebra systems)<br>
have been doing this for decades, but not long thereafter, systems<br>
doing proof planning and theorem discovery also started doing the<br>
same; some attempts at knowledge management and 'expert systems' were<br>
also symbolic, but less successfully so. More recently, many different<br>
kinds of program analyses have gotten `symbolic', as well as some of<br>
the automated theorem proving (SMT, CAV, etc).</p>
<p>But a large number of the underlying problems solved by symbolic<br>
techniques are well known to be undecidable (never mind the many that<br>
are EXP-time complete, etc). Artificial Intelligence has been<br>
attacking many of these different sub-problems for quite some time,<br>
and has also built up a solid body of knowledge. In fact, most<br>
symbolic computation systems grew out of AI projects.</p>
<p>These two fields definitely intersect. One could say that in the<br>
intersection lies all those problems for which we have no decision<br>
procedures. In other words, decision procedures mark a definite phase<br>
shift in our understanding, but are not always possible. Yet we still<br>
want to solve certain problems, and must find 'other' means of<br>
(partial) solution. This is the fertile land which comprises the core<br>
of AISC.</p>
<p>Rather than try to exhaustively list topics of interest, it is<br>
simplest to say that AISC seeks work which advances the understanding<br>
of</p>
<p>Solving problems which fundamentally involve the manipulation of<br>
expressions, but for which decision procedures are unlikely to ever<br>
exist.</p>
<p><strong>* Calculemus </strong>*</p>
<p>Calculemus is a series of conferences dedicated to the integration of<br>
computer algebra systems (CAS) and systems for mechanised reasoning,<br>
the interactive theorem provers or proof assistants (PA) and the<br>
automated theorem provers (ATP). Currently, symbolic computation is<br>
divided into several (more or less) independent branches: traditional<br>
ones (e.g., computer algebra and mechanised reasoning) as well as<br>
newly emerging ones (on user interfaces, knowledge management, theory<br>
exploration, etc.) The main concern of the Calculemus community is to<br>
bring these developments together in order to facilitate the theory,<br>
design, and implementation of integrated systems for computer<br>
mathematics that will routinely be used by mathematicians, computer<br>
scientists and engineers in their every day business.</p>
<p>The topics of interest of Calculemus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>* Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)<br>
    * Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)<br>
    * Case studies and applications that both involve computer<br>
            algebra and mechanised reasoning<br>
    * Representation of mathematics in computer algebra<br>
    * Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP<br>
    * Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving<br>
    * Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal<br>
                  deduction<br>
    * Mathematical computation in PA and ATP<br>
    * Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary<br>
            systems for computer mathematics<br>
    * Theory exploration techniques<br>
    * Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint<br>
                languages, and modeling languages for mechanised<br>
                mathematics systems (PA, CAS, and ATP).<br>
    * Infrastructure for mathematical services</p>
<p><strong>* DML </strong>*</p>
<p>Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed<br>
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked, validated and<br>
verified.  It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical<br>
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000<br>
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information<br>
technologies. Following success of DML 2008, DML 2009 DML 2010, and<br>
DML 2011 track objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of a<br>
global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current<br>
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects as<br>
EuDML, asking such questions as:</p>
<p>* What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should<br>
        be used and what metadata should be shared?<br>
    * What business models are suitable for publishers of<br>
        mathematical literature, authors and funders of their<br>
        projects and institutions?<br>
    * Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and<br>
        extensible mathematical library that mathematicians<br>
        can use in their everyday work?<br>
    * What is the best practice for<br>
        * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to<br>
                          MathML or TeX);<br>
        * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing<br>
            electronic copy in DVI, PS or PDF to MathML or<br>
            TeX);<br>
        * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed<br>
            metadata and file formats available as a side<br>
            effect of publishing workflow [CEDRAM/Euclid<br>
            model])?</p>
<p>DML is an opportunity to share experience and best practices between<br>
projects in any area (MKM, NLP, OCR, pattern recognition, whatever)<br>
that could change the paradigm for searching, accessing, and<br>
interacting with the mathematical corpus. The track is<br>
trans/interdisciplinary and contributions from any kind of people on<br>
any aspect of the DML building are welcome.</p>
<p><strong>* MKM </strong>*</p>
<p>Mathematical Knowledge Management is an interdisciplinary field of<br>
research in the intersection of mathematics, computer science, library<br>
science, and scientific publishing. The objective of MKM is to develop<br>
new and better ways of managing sophisticated mathematical knowledge,<br>
based on innovative technology of computer science, the Internet, and<br>
intelligent knowledge processing. MKM is expected to serve<br>
mathematicians, scientists, and engineers who produce and use<br>
mathematical knowledge; educators and students who teach and learn<br>
mathematics; publishers who offer mathematical textbooks and<br>
disseminate new mathematical results; and librarians and<br>
mathematicians who catalog and organize mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p>The conference is concerned with all aspects of mathematical knowledge<br>
management. A non-exclusive list of important topics includes:</p>
<p>* Representations of mathematical knowledge<br>
    * Authoring languages and tools<br>
    * Repositories of formalized mathematics<br>
    * Deduction systems<br>
    * Mathematical digital libraries<br>
    * Diagrammatic representations<br>
    * Mathematical OCR<br>
    * Mathematical search and retrieval<br>
    * Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems<br>
    * MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards<br>
    * Web presentation of mathematics<br>
    * Data mining, discovery, theory exploration<br>
    * Computer algebra systems<br>
    * Collaboration tools for mathematics<br>
    * Challenges and<br>
