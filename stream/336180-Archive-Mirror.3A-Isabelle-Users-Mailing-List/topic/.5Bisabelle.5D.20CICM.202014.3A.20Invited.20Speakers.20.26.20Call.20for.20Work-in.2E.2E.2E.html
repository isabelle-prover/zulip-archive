<p>As   computers   and   communications  technology   advance,   greater<br>
opportunities arise  for intelligent mathematical  computation.  While<br>
computer  algebra, automated  deduction,  mathematical publishing  and<br>
novel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,<br>
we are  now seeing  increasing opportunities  for synergy  among these<br>
areas.  CICM  2014 offers  a venue  to discuss  these areas  and their<br>
synergy.</p>
<p>The conference will take place at the University of Coimbra, Portugal,<br>
and consists of four tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Calculemus, Chair: James Davenport</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML), Chair: Petr Sojka</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM), Chair: Josef Urban</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Systems and Projects, Chair: Alan Sexton</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As  in previous  years, there  will be  a Doctoral  Programme for  the<br>
mentoring of Doctoral students and several co-located workshops.</p>
<ul>
<li>MathUI 2014: Mathematical User Interfaces</li>
<li>OpenMath Workshop 2014</li>

<p>Work-in-Progress Call-for-Papers</p>
<hr>
<p>Work-in-progress submissions are  intended to provide a  forum for the<br>
presentation of original work that is not (yet) in a suitable form for<br>
submission as a  full or system description paper.  This includes work<br>
in progress  and emerging trends.   Papers may  be on any  CICM topic,<br>
including those from Calculemus, DML, MKM and Systems and Projects.</p>
<p>Accepted work-in-progress  papers will be presented  at the conference<br>
as  short   teaser  talks   and  as  posters.    The  work-in-progress<br>
proceedings  will   be  published  digitally  in   the  CEUR  Workshop<br>
Proceedings series (<a href="http://CEUR-WS.org">CEUR-WS.org</a>).</p>
<p>WiP  papers  should  be  prepared in  LaTeX  and  formatted  according<br>
Springer's  LNCS   series  (the  corresponding  style   files  can  be<br>
downloaded     from    <a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>).<br>
Papers should be between 5 and 10 pages in length.</p>
<p>By submitting  a paper  the authors  agree that if  it is  accepted at<br>
least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it.</p>

Calculemus<br>
==========</p>
<p>Calculemus   2014  invites   the  submission   of  original   research<br>
contributions to be considered for publication and presentation at the<br>
conference. Calculemus  is a  series of  conferences dedicated  to the<br>
integration  of  computer  algebra   systems  (CAS)  and  systems  for<br>
mechanised  reasoning  like  interactive   proof  assistants  (PA)  or<br>
automated theorem  provers (ATP).  Currently, symbolic  computation is<br>
divided into several (more  or less) independent branches: traditional<br>
ones  (e.g., computer  algebra and  mechanised reasoning)  as well  as<br>
newly emerging ones (on  user interfaces, knowledge management, theory<br>
exploration, etc.) The main concern  of the Calculemus community is to<br>
bring these developments  together in order to  facilitate the theory,<br>
design,  and  implementation   of  integrated  mathematical  assistant<br>
systems  that  will  be  used routinely  by  mathematicians,  computer<br>
scientists and  all others who need  computer-supported mathematics in<br>
their every day business.</p>
<p>All  topics  in  the  intersection of  computer  algebra  systems  and<br>
automated  reasoning systems  are  of interest  for Calculemus.  These<br>
include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated theorem proving in computer algebra systems.</li>
<li>Computer algebra in theorem proving systems.</li>
<li>Adding reasoning capabilities to computer algebra systems.</li>
<li>Adding computational capabilities to theorem proving systems.</li>
<li>
<p>Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for<br>
  computer mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case studies and applications that involve a mix of computation and<br>
  reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case studies in formalization of mathematical theories.</p>
</li>
<li>Representation of mathematics in computer algebra systems.</li>
<li>Theory exploration techniques.</li>
<li>Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction.</li>
<li>
<p>Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint languages,<br>
  and modeling languages for mathematical assistant systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homotopy type theory.</p>
</li>
<li>Infrastructure for mathematical services.</li>
</ul>
<p>===<br>
DML<br>
===</p>
<p>Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed<br>
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked, validated and<br>
verified.   It is  estimated that  the entire  corpus of  mathematical<br>
knowledge  published over  the centuries  does not  exceed 100,000,000<br>
pages,   an   amount   easily  manageable   by   current   information<br>
technologies.</p>
<p>Track objective  is to provide  a forum for development  of math-aware<br>
technologies, standards, algorithms and formats towards fulfillment of<br>
the  dream  of global  digital  mathematical  library (DML).  Computer<br>
scientists  (D)  and librarians  of  digital  age (L)  are  especially<br>
welcome to  join mathematicians  (M) and discuss  many aspects  of DML<br>
preparation.</p>
<p>Track topics are  all topics of mathematical  knowledge management and<br>
digital  libraries  applicable  in  the context  of  DML  building  --<br>
processing of math knowledge expressed in scientific papers in natural<br>
languages, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Math-aware text mining (math mining) and MSC classification</li>
<li>Math-aware representations of mathematical knowledge</li>
<li>Math-aware computational linguistics and corpora</li>
<li>Math-aware tools for [meta]data and fulltext processing</li>
<li>Math-aware OCR and document analysis</li>
<li>Math-aware information retrieval</li>
<li>Math-aware indexing and search</li>
<li>Authoring languages and tools</li>
<li>MathML, OpenMath, TeX and other mathematical content standards</li>
<li>Web interfaces for DML content</li>
<li>Mathematics on the web, math crawling and indexing</li>
<li>Math-aware document processing workflows </li>
<li>Archives of written mathematics</li>
<li>DML management, business models</li>
<li>DML rights handling, funding, sustainability </li>
<li>DML content acquisition, validation and curation </li>
</ul>
<p>===<br>
MKM<br>
===</p>
<p>Mathematical  Knowledge Management  is an  interdisciplinary field  of<br>
research in the intersection of mathematics, computer science, library<br>
science, and scientific publishing. The objective of MKM is to develop<br>
new and better ways  of managing sophisticated mathematical knowledge,<br>
based on innovative technology of  computer science, the Internet, and<br>
intelligent   knowledge  processing.   MKM   is   expected  to   serve<br>
mathematicians,  scientists,   and  engineers  who  produce   and  use<br>
mathematical  knowledge; educators  and students  who teach  and learn<br>
mathematics;   publishers  who   offer   mathematical  textbooks   and<br>
disseminate   new    mathematical   results;   and    librarians   and<br>
mathematicians who catalog and organize mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p>The conference is concerned with all aspects of mathematical knowledge<br>
management. A non-exclusive list of important topics includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Representations of mathematical knowledge</li>
<li>Authoring languages and tools</li>
<li>Repositories of formalized mathematics</li>
<li>Deduction systems</li>
<li>Mathematical digital libraries</li>
<li>Diagrammatic representations</li>
<li>Mathematical OCR</li>
<li>Mathematical search and retrieval</li>
<li>Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems</li>
<li>MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards</li>
<li>Web presentation of mathematics</li>
<li>Data mining, discovery, theory exploration</li>
<li>Computer algebra systems</li>
<li>Collaboration tools for mathematics</li>
<li>Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>====================<br>
Systems and Projects<br>
====================</p>
<p>The  Systems and  Projects  track of  the  Conferences on  Intelligent<br>
Computer Mathematics is  a forum for presenting  available systems and<br>
new and ongoing  projects in all areas and topics  related to the CICM<br>
conferences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deduction and Computer Algebra (Calculemus)</li>
<li>Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML)</li>
<li>Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)</li>
</ul>
<p>The track aims  to provide an overview of the  latest developm<br>
