<p>Aims and scope</p>
<hr>
<p>The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers<br>
with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its applications.<br>
Over the last two decades, coalgebra has developed into a field of<br>
its own, presenting a mathematical foundation for various kinds<br>
of dynamical systems, infinite data structures, and logics.<br>
Coalgebra has an ever growing range of applications in and interactions<br>
with other fields such as reactive and interactive system theory,<br>
object oriented and concurrent programming, formal system specification,<br>
modal logic, dynamical systems, control systems, category theory,<br>
algebra, analysis, etc.</p>
<p>An anniversary: the 10th CMCS</p>
<hr>
<p>CMCS took place for the first time when ETAPS started, in 1998.<br>
Since then, it has always been collocated with ETAPS, becoming<br>
bi-annual since the start of CALCO (Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra)<br>
in 2005.</p>
<p>In 2010, we will celebrate the 10th edition of CMCS,<br>
by inviting a number of specialists in the field to present overviews<br>
of both obtained results and future challenges.</p>
<p>Programme Committee</p>
<hr>
<p>Chairs: Bart Jacobs (RUN) and Jan Rutten (CWI, VUA, RUN).<br>
Members: to be announced shortly.</p>
<p>Organising Committee</p>
<hr>
<p>Bart Jacobs,<br>
Milad Niqui (co-chair, CWI),<br>
Jan Rutten, <br>
Alexandra Silva (co-chair, CWI).</p>
<p>Submissions</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two types of submissions possible: </p>
<p>(a) Papers to be evaluated by the PC for publication in the proceedings:<br>
They must have a length no greater than 20 pages.<br>
(Style files will be provided shortly.)</p>
<p>They must contain original contributions,<br>
be clearly written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison <br>
with related work.  <br>
Accepted papers will appear in either ENTCS or EPTCS.</p>
<p>Also a special journal issue of selected papers will be considered.</p>
<p>(b) Short contributions:<br>
These will not be published in the proceedings<br>
but will be bundled in a CWI technical report.</p>
<p>They should be no more than two pages and may describe work in progress,<br>
summarise work submitted to a conference or workshop elsewhere,<br>
or in some other way appeal to the CMCS audience.</p>
