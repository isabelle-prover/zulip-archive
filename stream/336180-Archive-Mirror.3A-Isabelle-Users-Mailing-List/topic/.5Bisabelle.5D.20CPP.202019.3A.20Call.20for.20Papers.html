<p>From: Magnus Myreen &lt;<a href="mailto:myreen@chalmers.se">myreen@chalmers.se</a>&gt;<br>
Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP) is an international forum on<br>
theoretical and practical topics in all areas, including computer<br>
science, mathematics, and education, that consider certification as an<br>
essential paradigm for their work. Certification here means formal,<br>
mechanized verification of some sort, preferably with production of<br>
independently checkable certificates.</p>
<p>In 2019, CPP will be co­located with Principles of Programming<br>
Languages (POPL) in Cascais/Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
<p>Important Dates (AoE, UTC-12h)</p>
<p>Abstract Deadline: Wednesday, 11 October 2018<br>
     Paper Submission Deadline: Wednesday, 18 October 2018<br>
     Author Notification: Wednesday, 22 November 2018<br>
     Conference dates: 14 January - 15 January 2019</p>
<p>Topics of interest</p>
<p>We welcome submissions in research areas related to formal<br>
certification of programs and proofs. The following is a suggested<br>
list of topics of interests to CPP. This is a non-exhaustive list and<br>
should be read as a guideline rather than a requirement.</p>
<p>- certified or certifying programming, compilation, linking, OS<br>
    kernels, runtime systems, and security monitors;</p>
<p>- program logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code;<br>
  - certified decision procedures, mathematical libraries, and<br>
    mathematical theorems;</p>
<p>- proof assistants and proof theory;<br>
  - new languages and tools for certified programming;<br>
  - program analysis, program verification, and proof-carrying code;<br>
  - certified secure protocols and transactions;<br>
  - certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra,<br>
    polynomial systems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of<br>
    interest;</p>
<p>- certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality,<br>
    first-order logic, and higher-order unification;</p>
<p>- certificates for program termination;<br>
  - logics for certifying concurrent and distributed programs;<br>
  - higher-order logics, logical systems, separation logics, and<br>
    logics for security;</p>
<p>- teaching mathematics and computer science with proof assistants.</p>
<p>Submission Guidelines</p>
<p>Papers should be submitted in PDF format through the EasyChair<br>
submission page at</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2019">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2019</a></p>
<p>Submitted papers must be formatted following the ACM SIGPLAN<br>
Proceedings format using the acmart format with the sigplan option,<br>
using 10 point font for the main text, and a header for single blind<br>
review submission, e.g.,</p>
<p>\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review]{acmart}\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}</p>
<p>Submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages, including tables and<br>
figures, but excluding bibliography. Shorter papers are welcome and<br>
will be given equal consideration.</p>
<p>Submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient detail<br>
to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper. They<br>
should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the<br>
main results, and a brief explanation of their significance and<br>
relevance to the conference, all phrased for the<br>
non-specialist. Technical and formal developments directed to the<br>
specialist should follow. References and comparisons with related work<br>
should be included. Submitted papers are not allowed to have an<br>
appendix. Papers not conforming to the above requirements concerning<br>
format and length may be rejected without further consideration.</p>
<p>Whenever appropriate, the submission should come along with a formal<br>
development, using whatever prover, e.g., Agda, Coq, Dafny, Elf, HOL,<br>
HOL-Light, Isabelle, Lean, Matita, Mizar, NQTHM, PVS, Vampire,<br>
etc. Such formal developments must be submitted together with the<br>
paper as auxiliary material, and will be taken into account during the<br>
reviewing process. Please do so by including a link to your files in<br>
the text of your paper, or by sending a zip or tar file to the PC<br>
chairs at <a href="mailto:cpp2019@easychair.org">cpp2019@easychair.org</a> with your paper number included in the<br>
subject of your email.</p>
<p>The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>
elsewhere, including the proceedings of other published conferences or<br>
workshops. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work<br>
submitted to a conference or journal in advance of<br>
submission. Original formal proofs of known results in mathematics or<br>
computer science are welcome. One author of each accepted paper is<br>
expected to present it at the conference.</p>
<p>For any questions about the formatting or submission of papers, please<br>
consult the PC chairs (<a href="mailto:cpp2019@easychair.org">cpp2019@easychair.org</a>).</p>
