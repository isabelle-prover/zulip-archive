<p>===================================================<br>
CSF 2016 Call for Papers<br>
29th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium</p>
<p><a href="http://csf2016.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/">http://csf2016.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/</a><br>
June 28-July 1, 2016<br>
Lisbon, Portugal</p>
<p>The Computer Security Foundations Symposium is an annual conference<br>
for researchers in computer security. CSF seeks papers on foundational<br>
aspects of computer security, such as formal security models,<br>
relationships between security properties and defenses, principled<br>
techniques and tools for design and analysis of security mechanisms,<br>
as well as their application to practice. While CSF welcomes<br>
submissions beyond the topics listed below, the main focus of CSF is<br>
foundational security: submissions that lack foundational aspects risk<br>
rejection.</p>
<p>This year, CSF will use a light form of double blind reviewing; see<br>
below.</p>
<p>Topics</p>
<hr>
<p>New results in computer security are welcome. We also encourage<br>
challenge/vision papers, which may describe open questions and raise<br>
fundamental concerns about security. Possible topics for all papers<br>
include, but are not limited to: access control, accountability,<br>
anonymity and privacy, authentication, computer-aided cryptography,<br>
data and system integrity, database security, decidability and<br>
complexity, distributed systems security, electronic voting, formal<br>
methods and verification, decision theory, hardware-based security,<br>
information flow, intrusion detection, language-based security,<br>
network security, data provenance, mobile security, security metrics,<br>
security protocols, software security, socio-technical security, trust<br>
management, usable security, web security.</p>
<p>Special Sessions</p>
<hr>
<p>This year, we strongly encourage papers in two foundational areas of<br>
research we would like to promote at CSF:</p>
<p>PRIVACY (Chair: Daniel Kifer). CSF 2016 will include a special<br>
  session on privacy foundations and invites submissions on<br>
  innovations in practice, as well as definitions, models, and<br>
  frameworks for communication and data privacy, principled analysis<br>
  of deployed or proposed privacy protection mechanisms, and<br>
  foundational aspects of practical privacy technologies. We<br>
  especially encourage submissions aiming at connecting the computer<br>
  science point of view on privacy with that of other disciplines<br>
  (law, economics, sociology, statistics...)</p>
<p>SECURITY ECONOMICS (Chair: Jens Grossklags). There is an interplay<br>
  between important system properties including privacy, security,<br>
  efficiency, flexibility, and usability. Diverse systems balance<br>
  these properties differently, and as such provide varied benefits<br>
  (for users) for different costs (for builders and attackers). In<br>
  short, securing systems is ultimately an economic question. CSF 2016<br>
  will include a special session on security economics, where we<br>
  invite submissions on foundational work in this area. Topics<br>
  include, but are not limited to, risk management and<br>
  cyber-insurance, investments in information security, security<br>
  metrics, decision and game theory for security, and<br>
  cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>These papers will be reviewed under the supervision of the special<br>
session chairs. They will be presented at the conference, and will<br>
appear in the CSF proceedings, without any distinction from the other<br>
papers.</p>
<p>Proceedings, published by the IEEE Computer Society Press (pending<br>
approval), will be available at the symposium, and selected papers<br>
will be invited for submission to the Journal of Computer Security.</p>

<p>PAPER SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have<br>
been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a<br>
conference with published proceedings.</p>
<p>Papers must be submitted using the two-column IEEE Proceedings style<br>
available for various document preparation systems at the IEEE<br>
Conference Publishing Services page. All papers should be at most 12<br>
pages long, not counting bibliography and well-marked appendices.<br>
Committee members are not required to read appendices, and so the<br>
paper must be intelligible without them.</p>
<p>Following the recent history of other top-quality conferences and<br>
symposia in security, CSF'16 will employ a light form of double-blind<br>
reviewing. To facilitate this, submitted papers must (a) omit any<br>
reference to the authors' names or the names of their institutions,<br>
and (b) reference the authors' own related work in the third person<br>
(e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on<br>
the work of ..."). Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity<br>
that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper<br>
more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be<br>
omitted or anonymized). Please see the conference site for answers to<br>
frequently asked questions (FAQ) that address many common<br>
concerns. When in doubt, contact the program chairs.</p>
<p>Papers failing to adhere to any of the instructions above will be<br>
rejected without consideration of their merits.</p>
<p>Papers intended for one of the special sessions should select the<br>
"Privacy" or "Security Economics" option, as appropriate.</p>
<p>At least one coauthor of each accepted paper is required to attend CSF<br>
to present the paper.</p>
