<p>Submission (title &amp; abstract):  March 26, 2010<br>
Notification:                   May 17, 2010<br>
Submission (full paper):        April 2, 2010<br>
Final papers:                   June 6, 2010</p>
<p>Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European<br>
Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL). The conference is intended<br>
for computer scientists whose research activities involve logic, as well as<br>
for logicians working on issues significant for computer science. The 19th<br>
EACSL Annual Conference on Computer Science Logic (CSL 2010) and the 35th<br>
International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science<br>
(MFCS 2010) are federated and organized in parallel at the same place. The<br>
federated MFCS &amp; CSL 2010 conference has common plenary sessions and social<br>
events for all participants. The technical program and proceedings of MFCS <br>
2010 and CSL 2010 are prepared independently. The MFCS &amp; CSL 2010 conference <br>
is accompanied by satellite workshops on more specialized topics.</p>
<p>Suggested topics of interest include (but are not limited to) automated<br>
deduction and interactive theorem proving, constructive mathematics and type<br>
theory, equational logic and term rewriting, automata and games, modal and <br>
temporal logic, model checking, decision procedures, logical aspects of <br>
computational complexity, finite model theory, computational proof theory, <br>
logic programming and constraints, lambda calculus and combinatory logic, <br>
categorical logic and topological semantics, domain theory, database theory, <br>
specification, extraction and transformation of programs, logical foundations <br>
of programming paradigms, verification and program analysis, linear logic, <br>
higher-order logic, nonmonotonic reasoning.</p>
<p>Proceedings will be published in the Advanced Research in Computing and <br>
Software Science (ARCoSS) subline of the LNCS series. Each paper accepted <br>
by the Programme Committee must be presented at the conference by one of <br>
the authors, and a final copy must be prepared according to Springer's <br>
guidelines. Submitted papers must be in Springer's LNCS style and of no more <br>
than 15 pages, presenting work not previously published. They must not be <br>
submitted concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. The <br>
PC chairs should be informed of closely related work submitted to a <br>
conference or journal by March 19, 2010. Papers authored or coauthored by <br>
members of the Programme Committee are not allowed.</p>
<p>Papers will be submitted through the conference website. Submitted papers <br>
must be in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the Programme <br>
Committee to assess the merits of the papers. Full proofs may appear in a <br>
technical appendix which will be read at the reviewers' discretion. Authors <br>
are strongly encouraged to include a well written introduction which is <br>
directed at all members of the program committee.</p>
<p>The Ackermann Award for 2010 will be presented to the recipients at CSL'10.</p>
