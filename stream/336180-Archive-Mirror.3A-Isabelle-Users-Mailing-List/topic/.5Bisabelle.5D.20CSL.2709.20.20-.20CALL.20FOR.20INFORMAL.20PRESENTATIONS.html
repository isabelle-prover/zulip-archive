<p>Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European<br>
Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL). The conference is<br>
intended for computer scientists whose research activities involve<br>
logic, as well as for logicians working on issues significant for<br>
computer science.</p>
<p>Registration is open:         <a href="http://www.mat.uc.pt/~csl/">http://www.mat.uc.pt/~csl/</a><br>
Early registration deadline:  31 July, 2009.<br>

<p>This year, CSL is opening a special session for Informal<br>
Presentations. There are four categories for these presentations:</p>
<p>1) PhD students. Students which are about to finish their PhD are<br>
invited to report on their results. It is expected that submissions<br>
have the support of the supervisor.</p>
<p>2) Recent PhDs. Researchers which recently finished their PhD are<br>
invited to report on their theses.</p>
<p>3) Work in progress. Researches who would like to discuss work in<br>
progress which is not yet in the stage for publications.</p>
<p>4) Other conference papers. Researchers who have a paper of interest<br>
for the CSL community that has already been presented at another<br>
conference.</p>
<p>Informal presentations must be in English. Please send an abstract of<br>
1 to 3 pages in Springer's LNCS style by 20 July 2009 to the CSL<br>
submission server: <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=csl2009">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=csl2009</a><br>
Please provide, in the Abstract field of the Easychair form, the<br>
following information:<br>
For category 1: Name and e-mail of your supervisor.<br>
For category 2: Date and University of your PhD defense.<br>
For category 4: Conference where the paper is accepted.</p>
<p>The submissions are evaluated by the programme committee chairs,<br>
taking into account the appropriateness for CSL and possible timetable<br>
restrictions.</p>
<p>Suggested topics of interest include: automated deduction and<br>
interactive theorem proving, constructive mathematics and type theory,<br>
equational logic and term rewriting, automata and games, modal and<br>
temporal logic, model checking, logical aspects of computational<br>
complexity, finite model theory, computational proof theory, logic<br>
programming and constraints, lambda calculus and combinatory logic,<br>
categorical logic and topological semantics, domain theory, database<br>
theory, specification, extraction and transformation of programs,<br>
logical foundations of programming paradigms, verification and program<br>
analysis, linear logic, higher-order logic, and nonmonotonic<br>
reasoning.</p>
<p>Young researchers are especially encouraged to send submissions for<br>
informal presentations.</p>
<p>The submission deadline for informal presentations is 20 July, 2009.</p>
