                        Special issue on Geometric Reasoning<br>
<a href="http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/events/amai-geom">http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/events/amai-geom</a></p>
<p>Geometry is one of most studied areas of mathematics and, though its role as a foundational <br>
system has evolved over time, it remains key to our understanding of many aspects of the world. <br>
It is one of the first areas to which Artificial Intelligence (AI) was applied and has remained <br>
the focus of much work in the field, giving rise to new mathematical concepts and techniques, <br>
heuristics, algorithms, and applications over the past fifty years. In view of the importance <br>
of geometry and the sustained advances in the field of computer-based geometric reasoning and <br>
its applications, the time seems ripe to take stock of the progress so far and look at some of <br>
the latest mathematical and AI-related advances in the field. Thus, we invite original contributions <br>
-- ranging from theory to implementations and applications -- and insightful surveys to a special <br>
issue of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence on Geometric Reasoning. </p>
<p>Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automated and interactive theorem proving in geometry involving algebraic, logical, <br>
 and/or probabilistic approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Symbolic and numerical methods for geometric computation and constraint solving.</p>
</li>
<li>The formal verification of geometric algorithms, for instance in relation to computational geometry.</li>
<li>Reasoning and manipulation via diagrams, including approaches based on dynamic geometry.</li>
<li>The design, implementation, and evaluation of software for geometric reasoning.</li>
<li>Knowledge management and libraries of test problems for theorem proving in geometry.</li>
<li>The applications to geometric modelling, CAGD/CAD, computer vision, robotics, and education.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission</p>
<p>Prospective authors should follow the instructions set out by the Annals of Mathematics and <br>
Artificial Intelligence on its webpage (<a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10472">http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10472</a>) and <br>
submit their articles through Springer's Editorial Manager System (at <a href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/amai">https://www.editorialmanager.com/amai</a>) <br>
by the deadline indicated below. </p>
<p>Please note that the guest editors will first carry a quick assessment of each submission and <br>
only papers that are deemed relevant to the special issue and are of high enough quality will <br>
be forwarded to at least two referees for full, independent reviews. </p>
