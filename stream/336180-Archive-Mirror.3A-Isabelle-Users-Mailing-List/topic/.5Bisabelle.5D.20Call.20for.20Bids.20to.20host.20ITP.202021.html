<p>From: "O'Leary, John W" &lt;<a href="mailto:john.w.oleary@intel.com">john.w.oleary@intel.com</a>&gt;<br>
We call for bids to host ITP 2021, the 12th edition of the<br>
International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving.</p>
<p>It has long been decided that next year's ITP will be incorporated<br>
into IJCAR 2020, the International Joint Conference on Automated<br>
Reasoning, to be held in Paris.  But planning ahead never hurts, so we<br>
are already looking forward to 2021.</p>
<p>As in previous years, the procedure consists of two phases:<br>
solicitation of bids and voting. This message concerns the first<br>
phase. A long-standing ITP/TPHOLs convention is that the conference<br>
should by preference be held on a continent different from the<br>
location of the previous meeting. For 2021, we therefore particularly<br>
solicit bids from prospective hosts located outside Europe. However,<br>
bids from within Europe are also welcome. Similar to previous years,<br>
we expect bids to propose a date in July, August or September.</p>
<p>Bids should be sent to <a href="mailto:itp19@cecs.pdx.edu">itp19@cecs.pdx.edu</a> and should include at least<br>
the following information:</p>
<p>* name and email address of a contact person<br>
  * names of other people involved<br>
  * address of website for the bid<br>
  * approximate dates of the conference<br>
  * structure (e.g., k workshop days and n days of presentations,<br>
    excursion, etc.)</p>
<p>* advantages of the proposed venue </p>
<p>Some examples of previous winning bids follow:</p>
<p>* ITP 2016 in Nancy, France  <a href="https://members.loria.fr/JCBlanchette/itp2016/bid.html">https://members.loria.fr/JCBlanchette/itp2016/bid.html</a><br>
  * ITP 2017 in Brasilia, Brazil  <a href="https://cic.unb.br/~nalon/itp2017/">https://cic.unb.br/~nalon/itp2017/</a><br>
  * ITP 2019 in Portland, USA  <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/itp2019bid/">http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/itp2019bid/</a></p>
<p>The deadline for bids is Friday, May 31. Shortly after, all admitted<br>
bids will be made public and the voting phase will take place. The<br>
people eligible to vote are those who are seriously considering<br>
attending ITP 2021. The voting system used will be single transferable<br>
vote between all received bids.</p>
<p>If you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact this year's<br>
organizers at <a href="mailto:itp19@cecs.pdx.edu">itp19@cecs.pdx.edu</a>.</p>
