Please ignore the previous email, and read the following CFP for WRiPE 2011<br>
instead.</p>

<p>1st International Workshop on Rigorous Protocol Engineering (WRiPE 2011)<br>
Co-located with the 19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols<br>
(ICNP 2011)<br>
<a href="http://wripe11.cis.upenn.edu/">http://wripe11.cis.upenn.edu/</a></p>
<p>WRiPE is an inter-disciplinary workshop that will bring together researchers<br>
from the networking, formal methods and programming languages communities.<br>
ICNP started nearly twenty years ago as a conference focused on the<br>
application of formal methods to the design and analysis of protocols<br>
primarily from the telecommunication space. This initial focus on formal<br>
methods has diminished over the years as ICNP has shifted towards research<br>
on Internet protocols. The aim of WRiPE is to reinvigorate and revitalize<br>
the application of formal methods to the design and analysis of network<br>
protocols.</p>
<p>We think the time is ripe for this type of workshop because (1) verification<br>
techniques have matured greatly in the last few decades, (2) verification<br>
tools such as model checkers, theorem provers, and SAT/SMT solvers have<br>
attracted a sizable user base, and (3) such techniques and tools have not<br>
traditionally been applied to network protocols (in particular IP, which is<br>
now the dominant networking technology).</p>
<p>By network protocols, we include traditional IP routing protocols, wireless<br>
multi-hop routing, BGP policies, transport protocols, application-layer<br>
overlay networks, and enterprise and data center networks. These may also<br>
include security extensions to these protocols, e.g. IPSec and Secure BGP,<br>
as well as protocols developed using emerging software router platforms such<br>
as OpenFlow. By verification technique, we mean any rigorous method of<br>
demonstrating<br>
that an implementations satisfies a given specification, or that reliable<br>
conclusions can be extracted from measurements.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Correct-by-Construction methods: meta-model frameworks (logics, algebras,<br>
calculi, etc.) for Internet protocols</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of model checkers, theorem provers, and SAT/SMT solvers to<br>
Internet protocol design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Domain specific languages (declarative, functional, or logic-based) that<br>
raise the level of abstraction in Internet protocol development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal-methods based techniques for run-time verification and testing of<br>
Internet protocols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combining model checking and theorem proving for verifying<br>
Internet protocols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model finding techniques for network configuration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission guidelines</p>
<p>Paper submission will not be blind. The submissions will indicate the names<br>
or affiliations of the authors in the paper. Please do not submit<br>
abbreviated versions of journal or conference papers. In particular,<br>
submissions to WRiPE must not be concurrent with a substantially similar<br>
submission to a conference or workshop, including condensed versions of work<br>
that has been submitted and is currently under review. We do encourage<br>
submissions of work-in-progress based on novel and interesting ideas.<br>
Submitted papers must be no longer than six (6) pages in double-column<br>
format with standard margins (i.e., at least one inch all around) and<br>
at least a 10 point font. This length includes everything: figures, tables,<br>
references, appendices and so forth. Longer submissions will not be<br>
reviewed. Papers should include a title; full list of authors, their<br>
organizations and email addresses; and an abstract of fewer than 200 words.</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>

<li>Submission deadline for papers      June 11, 2011.</li>
