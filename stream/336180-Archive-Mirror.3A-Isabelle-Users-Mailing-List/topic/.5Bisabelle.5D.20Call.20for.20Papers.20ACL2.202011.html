<p>Abstract submission: 13 June2011<br>

<p>Scope of the workshop</p>
<hr>
<p>ACL2 2011 is a major forum for the users of the ACL2 theorem proving<br>
system to present research related to the ACL2 theorem prover and its<br>
applications. ACL2 2011 is the tenth in the series of workshops, occurring<br>
at approximately 18-month intervals. ACL2 is a state-of-the-art automated<br>
reasoning system, the latest in the Boyer-Moore family of theorem provers,<br>
for which its authors received the 2005 ACM Software Systems Award.<br>
ACL2 2011 is planned as a two-day workshop to be held in Austin, TX, USA,<br>
on 3-4 November 2011. ACL2 2011 is affiliated with FMCAD 2011, the<br>
eleventh International Conference on Formal Methods in Computer Aided<br>
Design (<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ragerdl/fmcad11/">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ragerdl/fmcad11/</a>). In addition to paper<br>
presentations, ACL2 2011 is anticipated to include several rump sessions<br>
discussing ongoing research. We invite submission of papers on any topic<br>
related to ACL2 and its applications. We strongly encourage the participation<br>
of users of other theorem provers and researchers and practitioners interested<br>
in theorem proving technology.</p>
<p>Paper categories</p>
<hr>
<p>Papers presented at the workshop will be assigned to one of the following<br>
categories. At the time of submission, please indicate to which category you<br>
think your paper belongs. If you are not sure about the category for your<br>
paper, simply submit the paper to the "Other" category.</p>
<p><strong> Wizard spells </strong> (new)</p>
<p>Let the wizards reveal their spells!  Wizard spell papers must present<br>
detailed proof techniques. They illustrate the use of ACL2 features, general<br>
proof patterns, and advanced proof strategies. The objectives are to help<br>
new users, to share the expertise of ACL2 "power users", and hopefully to inspire<br>
and help other users.</p>
<p><strong> Applications </strong></p>
<p>Applications have played an important role in the development of ACL2.  ACL2<br>
2011 welcomes papers reporting about user experiences in hardware and software<br>
verification, formalization of mathematics, teaching, but also in emerging or<br>
novel areas.</p>
<p><strong> What's new ? </strong></p>
<p>Papers of this category will present updates about the ACL2 systems and related<br>
systems, like ACL2s, ACL2(r) or ACL2(h). Papers may present new system capabilities,<br>
features, or interfaces.</p>
<p><strong> Other </strong></p>
<p>All papers that do not fit in any of the above categories belong to this category.</p>
<p><strong> Short and long papers </strong></p>
<p>In all categories, ACL2 2011 welcomes long (10 pages) and short (4 pages) papers.</p>
<p>Paper submission</p>
<hr>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format through Easy Chair.<br>
The corresponding webpage can be found on the ACL2 2011 website.<br>
Submissions must use ACM SIG Proceedings format with letter-size paper<br>
(see <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html">http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html</a>). The<br>
proceedings are expected to be published in the ACM Digital Library (pending).<br>
Authors may assume that the audience has a working knowledge of ACL2's<br>
syntax, basic commands, and modeling techniques. Papers should contain a<br>
short abstract of about 150 words, clearly stating the contribution of the<br>
submission. Papers should be self-contained, but we strongly encourage<br>
authors to follow the tradition (where applicable) of providing ACL2 "books",<br>
or script files, with instructions for their execution. For accepted papers, these<br>
books will be mirrored from the ACL2 Home Page and included in the future<br>
ACL2 distributions. At least one author of each accepted paper will be required<br>
to register for the workshop and present the paper. Authors of accepted papers<br>
are expected to present their papers at the conference and will be required to<br>
sign copyright release forms. All submissions must be written in English.</p>
