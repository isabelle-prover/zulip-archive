<p>Abstract:                            January 15, 2020<br>
Paper:                                January 22, 2020<br>
Notification:                      March 16, 2020<br>
Camera-Ready Version:   April 17, 2020<br>
Conference:                      June 22-26, 2020</p>
<p>Aim and Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>The TAP conference promotes research in verification and formal<br>
methods that targets the interplay of proofs and testing: the<br>
advancement of techniques of each kind and their combination, with the<br>
ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.</p>
<p>Research in verification has recently seen a steady convergence of<br>
heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally<br>
distinct areas of testing (and dynamic analysis) and of proving (and<br>
static analysis). Formal techniques for counter-example generation<br>
based on, for example, symbolic execution, SAT/SMT-solving or<br>
model checking, furnish evidence for the potential of a combination of<br>
test and proof. The combination of predicate abstraction with testing-like<br>
techniques based on exhaustive enumeration opens the perspective<br>
for novel techniques of proving correctness. On the practical side,<br>
testing offers cost-effective debugging techniques of specifications<br>
or crucial parts of program proofs (such as invariants).  Last but not<br>
least, testing is indispensable when it comes to the validation of the<br>
underlying assumptions of complex system models involving<br>
hardware and/or system environments. Over the years, there is<br>
growing acceptance in research communities that testing and proving<br>
are complementary rather than mutually exclusive techniques.</p>
<p>The TAP conference aims to promote research in the intersection of<br>
testing and proving by bringing together researchers and practitioners<br>
from both areas of verification.</p>
<p>Topics of Interest</p>
<hr>
<p>TAP's scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology,<br>
including foundational work, tool development, and empirical<br>
research. Its topics of interest center around the connection between<br>
proofs (and other static techniques) and testing (and other dynamic<br>
techniques). Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the<br>
following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verification and analysis techniques combining proofs and tests</li>
<li>Program proving with the aid of testing techniques</li>
<li>
<p>Deductive techniques supporting the automated generation of test vectors<br>
   and oracles (theorem proving, model checking, symbolic execution, SAT/SMT<br>
   solving, constraint logic programming, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deductive techniques supporting novel definitions of coverage criteria,</p>
</li>
<li>Program analysis techniques combining static and dynamic analysis</li>
<li>Specification inference by deductive and dynamic methods</li>
<li>Testing and runtime analysis of formal specifications</li>
<li>Search-based technics for proving and testing</li>
<li>Verification of verification tools and environments</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of test and proof techniques in new domains,<br>
   such as security, configuration management, learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combined approaches of test and proof in the context of formal<br>
   certifications (Common Criteria, CENELEC, …)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case studies, tool and framework descriptions, and experience<br>
   reports about combining tests and proofs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission Instructions</p>
<hr>
<p>TAP 2020 accepts papers of four kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular research papers: full submissions describing original<br>
research, of up to 16 pages (excluding references).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tool demonstration papers: submissions describing the design and<br>
implementation of an analysis/verification tool or framework, of up<br>
to 8 pages (excluding references). The tool/framework described in<br>
a tool demonstration paper should be available for public use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short papers: submissions describing preliminary findings, proofs<br>
of concepts, and exploratory studies, of up to 6 pages (excluding<br>
references).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Journal-first extended abstracts, of up to 4 pages, summarizing recently<br>
published articles in high-quality journals. The aim of journal-first papers<br>
is to further enrich the program of TAP, as well as to provide an more <br>
flexible<br>
path to dissemination of results in the field. The summarized journal <br>
article<br>
should have been published (or accepted) by 1 July 2018 or later, and report<br>
new results (as opposed as simply extending prior conference work with<br>
'appendix' material, or minor enhancements). Journal-first submissions <br>
must be<br>
marked as such in the submission’s title, and must explicitly include full<br>
bibliographic details (including a DOI) of the journal publication they are<br>
based on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Accepted submissions will be published in Springer's LNCS series. Papers <br>
have to<br>
adhere to Springer's LNCS format and must be submitted in PDF format at the<br>
EasyChair submission site:</p>
