1st Workshop on Formal Techniques for Dependable Autonomous Systems<br>
                     Co-located with SafeComp-2019<br>
==========================================================</p>

<p>Theme</p>
<hr>
<p>Autonomous systems have been increasingly deployed in safety and <br>
mission-critical application. For example, future autonomous cars are <br>
ready to hit the public roads in a few years. Due to a direct impact on <br>
human lives, their functional safety, security, and dependability are <br>
important for both the general public and Original Equipment <br>
Manufacturers (OEMs). Formal Methods techniques have the potential to <br>
address some of the most important verification and dependability <br>
challenges associated with such autonomous systems. Indeed,  industrial <br>
standards, such as ISO 26262, ISO 61508, IEC 62304, EN 50128  explicitly <br>
recommend the use of formal methods in the design and development of <br>
autonomous systems. The main purpose of this workshop is to bring <br>
together people from both industry and academia and serve as a forum to <br>
discuss practical applications of formal methods. Moreover, we believe <br>
this workshop will help to discuss the readiness of formal methods in <br>
industrial applications by discussing the needs of autonomous systems <br>
industry and challenges faced by formal methods researchers.</p>
<p>The focus of the workshop will be on formal verification techniques for <br>
the modeling, analysis, and verification of safety and security critical <br>
autonomous systems. We encourage submissions on interdisciplinary <br>
approaches that bring together various formal methods and techniques <br>
such as model checking, runtime verification, and theorem proving.</p>
