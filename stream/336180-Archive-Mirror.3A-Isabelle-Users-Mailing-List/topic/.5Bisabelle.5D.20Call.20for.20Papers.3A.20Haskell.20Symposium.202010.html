Haskell 2010</p>
<p>ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2010<br>
                     Baltimore MD, United States<br>
                         30th September, 2010</p>
<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p><a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2010/">http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2010/</a></p>
<p>The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2010 will be co-located with the<br>
   2010 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), in<br>
   Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Haskell Symposium is to discuss experiences with<br>
   Haskell and future developments for the language. The scope of the<br>
   symposium includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory,<br>
   application, implementation, and teaching of Haskell.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>* Language Design, with a focus on possible extensions and<br>
       modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the<br>
       status quo;</p>
<p>* Theory, such as formal treatments of the semantics of the present<br>
       language or future extensions, type systems, and foundations<br>
       for program analysis and transformation;</p>
<p>* Implementations, including program analysis and transformation,<br>
       static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and<br>
       distributed architectures, memory management as well as foreign<br>
       function and component interfaces;</p>
<p>* Tools, in the form of profilers, tracers, debuggers,<br>
       pre-processors, and suchlike;</p>
<p>* Functional Pearls, being elegant, instructive examples of using<br>
       Haskell;</p>
<p>* Applications, Practice, and Experience, using Haskell for<br>
       scientific and symbolic computing, database, multimedia and Web<br>
       applications, and so forth, as well as general experience with<br>
       Haskell in education and industry.</p>
<p>Papers in the latter two categories need not necessarily report<br>
   original research results; they may instead, for example, report<br>
   practical experience that will be useful to others, reusable<br>
   programming idioms, or elegant new ways of approaching a<br>
   problem. (More advice appears on the symposium webpage.)  <br>
   The key criterion for such a paper is that it makes a<br>
   contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. It is not<br>
   enough simply to describe a program!</p>
<p>Before 2008, the Haskell Symposium was known as the Haskell<br>
   Workshop.  The name change reflects both the steady increase of<br>
   influence of the Haskell Workshop on the wider community, as well as<br>
   the increasing number of high quality submissions. The selection<br>
   process is highly competitive.  After eleven Haskell Workshops<br>
   between 1995 and 2007, the first Haskell Symposium was held in<br>
   Victoria in 2008, and the second in Edinburgh in 2009.</p>
<p>Submission Details</p>
<p>* Submission Deadline: Monday, 14th June 2010, 15:00 UTC<br>
     * Author Notification: Monday, 12th July 2010<br>
     * Final Papers Due   : Monday, 2nd August 2010</p>
<p>Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF),<br>
   formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines<br>
   (<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm">http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm</a>). The text<br>
   should be in a 9pt font in two columns; the length is restricted to<br>
   12 pages, except for "Applications, Practice, and Experience"<br>
   papers, which are restricted to 6 pages. Each submission must<br>
   adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy, as explained on the web.<br>
   Violation risks summary rejection of the offending submission.<br>
   Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the<br>
   ACM Digital Library.</p>
<p>In addition, we solicit proposals for system demonstrations, based<br>
   on running (perhaps prototype) software rather than necessarily on<br>
   novel research results. Proposals are limited to 2-page abstracts,<br>
   in the same ACM format as papers, and should explain why a<br>
   demonstration would be of interest to the Haskell community. They<br>
   will be assessed for relevance by the PC; accepted proposals will<br>
   be published on the Symposium website, but not formally published<br>
   in the proceedings.</p>
