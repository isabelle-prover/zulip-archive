<p>CONFERENCE BACKGROUND</p>
<p>ITP is the premier international conference for researchers from all areas of<br>
interactive theorem proving and its applications. It represents the natural<br>
evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to include research related to all<br>
other interactive theorem provers. TPHOLs meetings took place every year from<br>
1988 until 2009. In 2010, the first ITP conference was held in Edinburgh,<br>
Scotland, as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC). Subsequent ITP<br>
conferences were held in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, in 2011, Princeton, New<br>
Jersey, USA, in 2012, and Rennes, France in 2013. ITP 2014 will again be a<br>
part of FLoC, in Vienna, Austria.</p>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of<br>
interactive theorem proving and its applications. In particular, the ITP<br>
community is open to users of all interactive theorem provers. Suggested<br>
topics include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>-&gt; formal aspects of hardware and software,<br>
 -&gt; formalizations of mathematics,<br>
 -&gt; improvements in theorem prover technology,<br>
 -&gt; user interfaces for interactive theorem provers,<br>
 -&gt; formalizations of computational models,<br>
 -&gt; use of theorem provers in education,<br>
 -&gt; industrial applications of interactive theorem provers, and<br>
 -&gt; concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations ("Proof Pearls").</p>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format. Submissions should be<br>
prepared using the Springer LNCS format, available from<br>
<a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors">http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors</a>, and submitted via<br>
EasyChair. Submissions must describe original unpublished work not submitted<br>
for publication elsewhere, presented in a way that is accessible to users of<br>
other systems. The proceedings will be published as a volume in the Springer<br>
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series and will be available to participants<br>
at the conference.</p>
<p>ITP accepts both long papers (up to 16 pages) and "rough diamonds" (up to six<br>
pages, possibly in the form of an extended abstract). Both categories of<br>
papers will be fully refereed and included in the published proceedings.<br>
Papers in the "rough diamonds" category are expected to present innovative and<br>
promising ideas that have not yet had the time to mature. Regular papers are<br>
expected to present mature research projects with appropriate supporting<br>
evidence.</p>
<p>All papers should have an abstract of approximately 100 words. Note that<br>
abstracts must be submitted a week prior to the paper submission deadline.<br>
Papers should also include a list of relevant keywords, which must include the<br>
name of the theorem prover featured in the paper. We strongly encourage<br>
submissions that describe interactions with or improvements of a theorem<br>
prover. Authors of such papers should provide verifiable evidence of an<br>
implementation, such as appropriate source files. This material may be<br>
uploaded via EasyChair or may be placed online, as long as a URL is included<br>
with the submission.</p>
<p>Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers at the<br>
conference, and will be required to sign copyright release forms. All<br>
submissions must be written in English.</p>
