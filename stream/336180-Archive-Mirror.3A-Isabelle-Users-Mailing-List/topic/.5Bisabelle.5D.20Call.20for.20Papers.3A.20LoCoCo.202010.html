LoCoCo 2010 --  Workshop on Logics for Component Configuration<br>
   Workshop of SAT at FLoC 2010, Edinburgh, Scotland, July 10, 2010<br>
<a href="http://lococo2010.mancoosi.org/">http://lococo2010.mancoosi.org/</a><br>
                        First Call for Papers</p>
<p>Scope:<br>
======<br>
Modern software distributions are based on the notion of components, which<br>
denote units of independent development and deployment. Components provide<br>
the necessary flexibility when organizing a complex software distribution,<br>
but also are a challenge when it comes to selecting components from a large<br>
repository of possible choices, and configuring these components according<br>
to user needs, resource constraints, and interdependencies with other<br>
components.  Representing and solving configuration problems is a hot topic<br>
of great importance for many application domains. Some well-known examples<br>
of complex systems of components in the world of Free and Open Source<br>
software are the different distributions for GNU/Linux, BSD, or Eclipse<br>
plugins.</p>
<p>Understanding and solving these questions is an attractive research<br>
topic since the problems to be solved are complex and interesting for<br>
researchers working on solving techniques, and on the other hand have<br>
the potential of high impact on the way the software we all use<br>
everyday is developed and deployed. Not only adequate logical<br>
formalisms to represent a configuration problem are required, but also<br>
sophisticated reasoning technologies to deal with large amounts of<br>
data. Further relevant aspects include diagnosis of failed<br>
configuration settings and an intelligent behavior dealing with user<br>
preferences.</p>
<p>This workshop will focus on logic-based methods for specifying and solving<br>
complex configuration problems for software components.  The goal of the<br>
workshop is to bring together both researchers and practitioners active in<br>
the area of component configuration of software systems, using different<br>
modeling and solving techniques, such as constraint and logic programming,<br>
description logics, satisfiability and its extensions. The workshop will be<br>
an opportunity to discuss common and complementary solutions for solving<br>
component configuration.</p>
<p>Topics:<br>
=======<br>
Main areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:<br>
o Configuration problems and models: knowledge representation and<br>
  acquisition, incomplete knowledge, inconsistent knowledge, etc.<br>
o Reasoning methods for solving configuration problems: constraint<br>
  satisfaction and optimization, SAT solving and extensions, integer <br>
  programming, local search, symmetry breaking, etc.<br>
o Interactivity: user preferences, machine learning, distributed<br>
  environments, etc.<br>
o Applications and tools: case studies, current challenges,<br>
  application reports, etc.</p>
<p>Invited Talk<br>
============<br>
An invited talk will be given by Carsten Sinz (University of Karlsruhe).</p>
<p>MISC 2010<br>
=========<br>
The first Mancoosi International Solver Competition will be held in<br>
conjunction with the LoCoCo workshop.</p>
<p>Important Dates<br>
===============<br>
Friday, March 26   Submission deadline<br>
Friday, April 23   Notification about acceptance<br>
Friday, May 21     Final paper due<br>
Saturday, July 10  Workshop</p>
<p>Submission and Publication<br>
==========================<br>
We welcome submissions of various types of presentations related to<br>
the topics of the workshop, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>full research papers</li>
<li>abstracts of ongoing work</li>
<li>tutorial overview papers</li>
<li>summaries of research projects</li>
<li>system descriptions, if possible including system demonstration at the<br>
  workshop. These must provide the means to download and evaluate the<br>
  system, with preference to distribution under an open source licence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers presented at the workshop will have to carry an open access<br>
licence agreement. We will attempt to publish the papers at an<br>
open access archive of workshop proceedings. Details will be posted<br>
later.</p>
<p>Submitted papers must not exceed a limit of 10 pages, but authors may<br>
provide pointers to additional online resources if necessary.  Papers<br>
may be submitted in the formats Postscript or PDF. Details of the<br>
exact page style to be used will be posted later.  Submissions will be<br>
handled through easychair at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lococo2010">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lococo2010</a>.</p>
