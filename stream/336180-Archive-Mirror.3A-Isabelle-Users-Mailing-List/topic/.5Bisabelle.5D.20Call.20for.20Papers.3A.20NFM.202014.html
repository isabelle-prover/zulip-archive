<p>The Sixth NASA Formal Methods Symposium<br>
<a href="http://www.NASAFormalMethods.org/">http://www.NASAFormalMethods.org/</a><br>
             29 April - 1 May 2014<br>
 NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, USA</p>
<hr>
<p>Theme of the Symposium:</p>
<hr>
<p>The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission- and safety-critical systems require advanced techniques that address their specification, verification, validation, and certification requirements.<br>
The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is a forum for theoreticians and practitioners from academia, industry, and government, with the goals of identifying challenges and providing solutions to achieving assurance in mission- and safety-critical systems. Within NASA such systems include autonomous robots, separation assurance algorithms for aircraft, Next Generation Air Transportation (NextGen), and autonomous rendezvous and docking for spacecraft. Moreover, emerging paradigms such as property-based design, code generation, and safety cases are bringing with them new challenges and opportunities. The focus of the symposium will be on formal techniques, their theory, current capabilities, and limitations, as well as their application to aerospace, robotics, and other safety-critical systems in all design life-cycle stages. We encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches marrying formal verification techniques with advances in safety-critical system development, such as requirements generation, analysis of aerospace operational concepts, and formal methods integrated in early design stages carrying throughout system development.<br>
