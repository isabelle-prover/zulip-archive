<p>8th International Workshop on<br>
                     Systems Software Verification</p>
<p>Vienna, July 23-24, 2014<br>
                      co-located with CAV and ITP,<br>
              as part of the Vienna Summer of Logic 2014.<br>
========================================================================</p>
<p>Important Dates<br>
===============<br>
Paper Submission: April 1, 2014<br>
Notification: May 1, 2014<br>
Conference: July 23–24, 2014</p>
<p>Topics<br>
======<br>
Industrial-strength software analysis and verification has advanced in<br>
recent years through the introduction of model checking, automated and<br>
interactive theorem proving, and static analysis techniques, as well as<br>
correctness by design, correctness by contract, and model-driven<br>
development. However, many techniques are working under restrictive<br>
assumptions that are invalidated by complex embedded systems software<br>
such as operating system kernels, low-level device drivers, or<br>
microcontroller code.</p>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and developers<br>
from both academia and industry who are facing real software and real<br>
problems with the goal of finding real, applicable solutions. By “real”<br>
we mean problems such as time-to-market or reliability that the industry<br>
is facing. A real solution is one that is applicable to the problem in<br>
industry and not one that only applies to an abstract, academic, toy<br>
version of it. In this workshop we will discuss software analysis and<br>
development techniques and tools; this forum will serve as a platform to<br>
discuss open problems and future challenges in dealing with existing and<br>
upcoming systems-level code.</p>
<p>Topics include, but are not restricted to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model checking</li>
<li>Automated and interactive theorem proving</li>
<li>Static analysis</li>
<li>Automated testing</li>
<li>Model-driven development</li>
<li>Embedded systems development</li>
<li>Programming languages</li>
<li>Verifying compilers</li>
<li>Software certification</li>
<li>Software tools</li>
<li>Experience reports</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions<br>
===========<br>
Submissions must be made electronically through the EasyChair system<br>
[https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssv2014] until April 1st,<br>
2014. Papers should be up to 10 pages in pdf format and formatted in<br>
EPTCS style [http://info.eptcs.org/]. Additional details may be included<br>
in a clearly marked appendix, which will be read at the discretion of<br>
the program committee. All will be subject to peer review under normal<br>
conference standards. Experience reports and papers on work in progress<br>
are welcome as long as there is a clear contribution. Submissions which<br>
are based or discuss a non-trivial piece of software are required to<br>
make all those non-standard software parts available, which a referee<br>
may need, in order to check the claims of the submission.</p>
<p>Submitted papers must not have previously appeared in a journal or<br>
conference with published proceedings and must not be concurrently<br>
submitted to any other peer-reviewed workshop, symposium, conference or<br>
archival journal. Any partial overlap with any such published or<br>
concurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated.</p>
