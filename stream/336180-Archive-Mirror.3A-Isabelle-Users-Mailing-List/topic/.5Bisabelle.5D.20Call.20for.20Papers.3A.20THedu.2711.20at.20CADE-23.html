<p>THedu'11 Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>This workshop intends to gather the research communities for Computer<br>
Theorem proving (CTP), Automated Theorem Proving (ATP),  Interactive<br>
Theorem Proving (ITP) as well as for Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) and<br>
Dynamic Geometry Systems (DGS).<br>
The goal of this union is to combine and focus systems of these areas to<br>
enhance existing educational software as well as studying the design of<br>
the next generation of mechanised mathematics assistants (MMA). Elements<br>
for next-generation MMA's include:</p>
<p>* Declarative Languages for Problem Solution: education in applied<br>
sciences and in engineering is mainly concerned with problems, which are<br>
understood as operations on elementary objects to be transformed to an<br>
object representing a problem solution. Preconditions and postconditions<br>
of these operations can be used describe the possible steps in the<br>
problem space; thus, ATP-systems can be used to check if an operation<br>
sequence given by the user does actually present a problem solution.<br>
Such "Problem Solution Languages" encompass declarative proof languages<br>
like Isabelle/Isar or Coq's Mathematical Proof Language, but also more<br>
specialized forms such as, for example, geometric problem solution<br>
languages that express a proof argument in Euklidian Geometry or<br>
languages for graph theory.</p>
<p>* Consistent Mathematical Content Representation:  libraries of<br>
existing ITP-Systems, in particular those following the LCF-prover<br>
paradigm, usually provide logically coherent and human readable<br>
knowledge. In the leading provers, mathematical knowledge is covered to<br>
an extent beyond most courses in applied sciences. However, the<br>
potential of this mechanised knowledge for education is clearly not yet<br>
recognised adequately: renewed pedagogy calls for enquiry-based learning<br>
from concrete to abstract --- and the knowledge's logical coherence<br>
supports such learning: for instance, the formula 2.Ï? depends on the<br>
definition of reals and of multiplication; close to these definitions<br>
are the laws like commutativity etc. However, the complexity of the<br>
knowledge's tracable interrelations poses a challenge to usability design.</p>
<p>* User-Guidance in Stepwise Problem Solving: Such guidance is<br>
indispensable for independent learning, but costly to implement so far,<br>
because so many special cases need to be coded by hand. However, CTP<br>
technology makes automated generation of user-guidance reachable:<br>
declarative languages as mentioned above, novel programming languages<br>
combining computation and deduction, methods for automated construction<br>
with ruler and compass from specifications, etc --- all these methods<br>
'know how to solve a problem'; so, use the methods' knowledge to<br>
generate user-guidance mechanically, is an appealing challenge for  ATP<br>
and ITP, and probably for compiler construction!</p>
<p>In principle, mathematical software can be conceived as models of<br>
mathematics: The challenge addressed by this workshop is to provide<br>
appealing models for MMAs which are interactive and which explain<br>
themselves such that interested students can independently learn by<br>
inquiry and experimentation.</p>

<p>Submission</p>
<hr>
<p>We welcome submission of proposals to present a demo, as well as<br>
submissions of papers presenting original unpublished work which is not<br>
been submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>
<p>Selected papers will appear in CISUC Technical Report series (ISSN<br>
