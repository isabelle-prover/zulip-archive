The scope of this workshop has a large overlap with interactive<br>
theorem proving, and ITP systems are explicitly called out in the list<br>
of topics. Apologies in advance if you receive multiple copies. -- Joe</p>
<p>FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>ATE-2011<br>
                     CADE23 Workshop on<br>
               Automated Theory Engineering<br>
                      (31. July 2011)</p>
<p>Deadline: 29 April 2011<br>

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br>
 The first Workshop on Automated Theory Engineering will<br>
 be held in July 2011 in Wroclaw. It is associated  with<br>
 the 23th International Conference on Automated Deduction<br>
 (CADE23).</p>
<p>SCOPE<br>
 Theory engineering  means the development and mechanisation<br>
 of mathematical axioms, definitions, theorems and inference<br>
 procedures as needed to cover the essential concepts and<br>
 analysis tasks of an application domain. It is essential for<br>
 the  qualitative and quantitative modelling and  analysis of<br>
 computing systems. The aim of the workshop is to present users<br>
 with lightweight domain specific modelling languages, and to<br>
 devolve the technical intricacies of analysis tasks as far as<br>
 possible to tools that provide heavyweight automation.</p>
<p>The workshop brings together tool and theory developers with<br>
 industrial engineers to exchange  experiences and ideas that<br>
 stimulate further tool developments and theory designs. A main<br>
 goal is the creation of a repository of case studies that<br>
 allows developers to test and improve their theories and tools.</p>
<p>TOPICS<br>
 Theory engineering is relevant to the design of systems, programs,<br>
 APIs, protocols, algorithms, design patterns, specification<br>
 languages, programming languages and beyond.  It involves technology<br>
 such as  ITP systems, ATP systems, SAT/SMT solvers, model checkers<br>
 and decision procedures. Specific topics of the workshop include,<br>
 but are not limited to:<br>
   o  qualitative and quantitative modelling and  analysis<br>
   o  formal specification and verification<br>
   o  domain specific models, languages and solvers<br>
   o  theorem proving technology for theory engineering<br>
   o  integration of theories and tools<br>
   o  applications of mechanised reasoning to formal modelling<br>
   o  industrial case studies/experiences</p>
<p>We especially invite industrial contributions from the areas of<br>
 network protocols and concurrent systems, but any submission on<br>
 the topics outlined  is very welcome.</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKER<br>
 o  Timothy Griffin, University of Cambridge, UK<br>
 o  TBA</p>
<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>
 Submission of papers for presentation at the workshop are now<br>
 invited. Submissions are limited to 10 pages,  but shorter extended<br>
 abstracts are welcome. All papers will be reviewed by the programme<br>
 committee, and a balanced programme will be selected based on<br>
 relevance and technical soundness. Submissions must  be in PDF<br>
 using the LaTeX EasyChair-format <a href="http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip">http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip</a>.<br>
 Accepted papers will be published as CEUR Workshop Proceedings.</p>
<p>If quality and quantity of the submissions warrants this, we<br>
 plan to publish a special issue of a recognized journal on the<br>
 topic of the workshop.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:<br>
 Submission:    29 April 2011<br>
 Notification:    30 May 2011<br>
 Final version:   1 July 2011<br>
 Workshop:       31 July 2011</p>
