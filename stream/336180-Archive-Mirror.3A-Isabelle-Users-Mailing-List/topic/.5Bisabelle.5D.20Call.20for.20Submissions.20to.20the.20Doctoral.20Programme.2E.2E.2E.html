<p>NEWS: Invited Speakers at CICM 2017</p>
<p>- Alan Bundy (University of Edinburgh)<br>
  - Przemysław Chojecki (Polish Academy of Sciences)<br>
  - Grant Olney Passmore (University of Cambridge)</p>
<hr>
<p>Digital and  computational solutions are becoming  the prevalent means<br>
for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of<br>
mathematical  information.  Separate  communities  have  developed  to<br>
investigate  and build  computer based  systems for  computer algebra,<br>
automated deduction, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user<br>
interfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their<br>
integration  can   lead  to   synergies  offering   significant  added<br>
value.  The  Conference  on Intelligent  Computer  Mathematics  (CICM)<br>
offers a  venue for discussing  and developing solutions to  the great<br>
challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.</p>
<p>CICM has been held annually as a joint meeting since 2008, co-locating<br>
related   conferences  and   workshops  to   advance  work   in  these<br>
subjects. Previous  meetings have been  held in Birmingham  (UK 2008),<br>
Grand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France 2010), Bertinoro (Italy 2011),<br>
Bremen (Germany  2012), Bath (UK  2013), Coimbra (Portugal  2014),<br>
Washington DC (USA 2015) and Bialystok (Poland 2016).</p>
<p>This  is a  call for  papers  for CICM  2017,  which will  be held  in<br>
Edinburgh, Scotland, July 17-21, 2017. CICM 2017 also invites work-in-<br>
progress papers.</p>
<p>The principal tracks of the conference are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track: Calculemus (chair: Matthew England)</li>
<li>Track: Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML) (chair: Olaf Teschke)</li>
<li>Track: Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM) (chair: Florian Rabe)</li>
<li>Track: Systems &amp; Data (chair: Osman Hasan)</li>
<li>Track: Doctoral Programme (chair: Adnan Rashid)</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall programme is organized by the General Program Chair Herman<br>
Geuvers.  The  local  arrangements  are  coordinated  by  Jacques<br>
Fleuriot.  The publicity chair is Serge Autexier.</p>
<p>CICM is  also an excellent  opportunity for graduate students  to meet<br>
established researchers from the  areas of computer algebra, automated<br>
deduction, and mathematical publishing.</p>
<p>The Doctoral Programme provides a  dedicated forum for PhD students to<br>
present  and discuss  their ideas,  ongoing or  planned research,  and<br>
achieved  results   in  an  open   atmosphere.  It  will   consist  of<br>
presentations  by  the  PhD  students to  get  constructive  feedback,<br>
advice, and suggestions from the research advisory board, researchers,<br>
and  other PhD  students.  Each PhD  student will  be  assigned to  an<br>
experienced researcher from  the research advisory board  who will act<br>
as a mentor and who will provide detailed feedback and advice on their<br>
intended and ongoing research.</p>
<p>Submission to the doctoral programs are possible until 5. June, details<br>
of the submission process are given below.</p>
