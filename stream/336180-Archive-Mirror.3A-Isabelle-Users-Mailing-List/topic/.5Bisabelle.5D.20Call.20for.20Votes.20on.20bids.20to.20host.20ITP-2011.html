<p>From: Matt Kaufmann &lt;<a href="mailto:kaufmann@cs.utexas.edu">kaufmann@cs.utexas.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Bidding has now closed for ITP-2011, and the bids can be viewed at </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/itp-2011-bids.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/itp-2011-bids.html</a></p>
<p>Voting is now open to decide which bid should be adopted. If you are<br>
seriously thinking of attending ITP-2011, then you may vote. Please<br>
read the bids and judge them by the plans as a whole: are the<br>
facilities appropriate? Are the transportation links adequate? Do you<br>
have confidence in the organisers?</p>
<p>TPHOLs had a tradition of alternating between Europe and North<br>
America, but bids were opened world-wide since the first call for bids<br>
was unsuccessful. It is up to you, the electorate, to decide which<br>
location will be best for 2011.</p>
<p>Voting will be by single transferable vote: each ballot will consist<br>
of your preferences in decreasing order. Votes will be counted in a<br>
series of rounds until a candidate wins a majority. At each round, the<br>
least popular candidate will be eliminated. Your second choice vote<br>
will only be counted if your first choice candidate is eliminated, and<br>
so forth. This system is known by many other names: instant run-off<br>
voting (IRV), alternative vote (AV), etc.</p>
<p>To ensure that your ballot is counted, please adhere carefully to<br>
following formatting instructions.  List your choices from most to<br>
least preferable (any positive number of choices up to five is<br>
acceptable).  For example, the following ballot (with fictitious<br>
choices) indicates a preference first for Alice, then for Bob, and so<br>
on.</p>
<p>Alice<br>
Bob<br>
Frank<br>
Mary</p>
<p>Each choice should be one of the tags shown on the above web page:<br>
China, Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, or USA.</p>
<p>Send your vote by March 1, by email to Matt Kaufmann,<br>
<a href="mailto:kaufmann@cs.texas.edu">kaufmann@cs.texas.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Matt Kaufmann and Larry Paulson (ITP-10 co-chairs)</p>
