Call for Work-in-Progress Papers</p>
<p>Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics<br>
                                 CICM 2015</p>
<p>13-17 July 2015<br>
                            Washington DC, USA</p>
<p>Digital and computational solutions are becoming the prevalent means for the<br>
generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of mathematical<br>
information. Separate communities have developed to investigate and build<br>
computer based systems for computer algebra, automated deduction, and<br>
mathematical publishing as well as novel user interfaces. While all of these<br>
systems excel in their own right, their integration can lead to synergies<br>
offering significant added value. The Conference on Intelligent Computer<br>
Mathematics (CICM) offers a venue for discussing and developing solutions<br>
to the great challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.</p>
<p>CICM has been held annually as a joint meeting since 2008, co-locating<br>
related conferences and workshops to advance work in these<br>
subjects. Previous meetings have been held in Birmingham (UK 2008),<br>
Grand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France 2010), Bertinoro (Italy 2011),<br>
Bremen (Germany 2012), Bath (UK 2013), and Coimbra (Portugal 2014).</p>
<p>This is a (short version of the) call for Work-in-Progress papers for CICM<br>
2015, which will be held in Washington, D.C., 13-17 July 2015.<br>
We solicit for papers which describe work in progress, recent developments,<br>
and other work of interest to our communities which does not yet have<br>
the maturity for archival proceedings.</p>
<p>The full version of the CFP is available from the conference web page<br>
athttp://cicm-conference.org/2015/cicm.php</p>
