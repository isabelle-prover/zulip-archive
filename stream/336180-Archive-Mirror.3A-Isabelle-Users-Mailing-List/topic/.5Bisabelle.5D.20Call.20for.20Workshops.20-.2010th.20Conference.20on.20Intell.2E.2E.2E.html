Call for Workshop Proposals<br>
        10th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics<br>
                            - CICM 2017 - <br>
                           July 17-21, 2017<br>
                  University of Edinburgh, Scotland<br>

<p>Digital and  computational solutions are becoming  the prevalent means<br>
for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of<br>
mathematical  information.  Separate  communities  have  developed  to<br>
investigate  and build  computer based  systems for  computer algebra,<br>
automated deduction, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user<br>
interfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their<br>
integration  can   lead  to   synergies  offering   significant  added<br>
value.  The  Conference  on Intelligent  Computer  Mathematics  (CICM)<br>
offers a  venue for discussing  and developing solutions to  the great<br>
challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.</p>
<p>CICM has been held annually as a joint meeting since 2008, co-locating<br>
related   conferences  and   workshops  to   advance  work   in  these<br>
subjects. Previous  meetings have been  held in Birmingham  (UK 2008),<br>
Grand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France 2010), Bertinoro (Italy 2011),<br>
Bremen (Germany  2012), Bath (UK  2013), Coimbra (Portugal  2014), <br>
Washington DC (USA 2015) and Bialystok (Poland 2016).</p>
<p>This is the call for proposals for  workshops to be held  at CICM 2017<br>
Edinburgh, Scotland, July 17-21, 2017. </p>
<p>Some of the workshops that have been held at past CICM meetings are:<br>
  Automated Reasoning: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice<br>
  Compact Computer Algebra<br>
  Empirically Successful Automated Reasoning for Mathematics<br>
  Formal Mathematics for Mathematicians <br>
  Intelligent Proof Search<br>
  Mathematical user Interfaces<br>
  Mathematics Information Retrieval<br>
  OpenMath<br>
  Pen-Based Mathematical Computation<br>
  Programming languages for Mechanized Mathematics Systems<br>
  Proof Engineering<br>
  SCIEnce<br>
  The Notion of Proof<br>
  User Interfaces for Theorem Provers</p>
<p>Proposals for workshops  to be held at CICM  2017 are solicited.  Both<br>
well-established workshops and newer or brand new ones are encouraged.</p>
<p>Please provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop title.</li>
<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>
<li>Brief description of workshop goals and/or topics.</li>
<li>Proposed workshop duration (half a day up to two days is possible).</li>
<li>If the workshop has met previously, please include the conference <br>
   affiliation for the previous meeting. If the workshop is new, <br>
   please indicate so.</li>
</ul>
<p>CICM  will take  care  of copying  and  distributing informal  printed<br>
proceedings for  workshops that  would like this  service, as  well as<br>
permanently archived open access online proceedings with <a href="http://CEUR-WS.org">CEUR-WS.org</a>.</p>
<p>All  proposals  should  be  sent  via email to the CICM workshop chair<br>
Petros Papapanagiotou (<a href="mailto:pe.p@ed.ac.uk">pe.p@ed.ac.uk</a>).</p>
<p>Important dates:</p>
<p>Deadline for proposal submissions:                     17. April 2017<br>
 Workshop dates:                                      17-21. July 2017</p>
