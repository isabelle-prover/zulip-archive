Call for Workshop Proposals</p>
<p>9th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics<br>
                            - CICM 2016 - <br>
                           July 25-29, 2016<br>
                   University of Bialystok, Poland<br>

<p>Digital and  computational solutions are becoming  the prevalent means<br>
for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of<br>
mathematical  information.  Separate  communities  have  developed  to<br>
investigate  and build  computer based  systems for  computer algebra,<br>
automated deduction, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user<br>
interfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their<br>
integration  can   lead  to   synergies  offering   significant  added<br>
value.  The  Conference  on Intelligent  Computer  Mathematics  (CICM)<br>
offers a  venue for discussing  and developing solutions to  the great<br>
challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.</p>
<p>CICM has been held annually as  a joint meeting since 2008, colocating<br>
related conferences and  workshops to advance work  in these subjects.<br>
Previous meetings have been held in Birmingham (U.K. 2008), Grand Bend<br>
(Canada  2009), Paris  (France 2010),  Bertinoro (Italy  2011), Bremen<br>
(Germany   2012),  Bath (U.K.  2013),    Coimbra (Portugal, 2014)  and<br>
Washington D.C. (USA, 2015). </p>
<p>This is the call for proposals for  workshops to be held  at CICM 2016,<br>
which will be held at the University of Bialystok (Poland), July 25-29<br>
next year.</p>
<p>Some of the workshops that have been held at past CICM meetings are:<br>
  Automated Reasoning: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice<br>
  Compact Computer Algebra<br>
  Empirically Successful Automated Reasoning for Mathematics<br>
  Formal Mathematics for Mathematicians <br>
  Intelligent Proof Search<br>
  Mathematical user Interfaces<br>
  Mathematics Information Retrieval<br>
  OpenMath<br>
  Pen-Based Mathematical Computation<br>
  Programming languages for Mechanized Mathematics Systems<br>
  SCIEnce<br>
  The Notion of Proof<br>
  User Interfaces for Theorem Provers</p>
<p>Proposals for workshops  to be held at CICM  2016 are solicited.  Both<br>
well-established workshops and newer or brand new ones are encouraged.</p>
<p>Please provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop title.</li>
<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>
<li>Brief description of workshop goals and/or topics.</li>
<li>Proposed workshop duration (half a day up to two days is possible).</li>
<li>If the workshop has met previously, please include the conference <br>
   affiliation for the previous meeting. If the workshop is new, <br>
   please indicate so.</li>
</ul>
<p>CICM  will take  care  of copying  and  distributing informal  printed<br>
proceedings for  workshops that  would like this  service, as  well as<br>
permanently archived open access online proceedings with <a href="http://CEUR-WS.org">CEUR-WS.org</a>.</p>
<p>All proposals should be sent via email to</p>
