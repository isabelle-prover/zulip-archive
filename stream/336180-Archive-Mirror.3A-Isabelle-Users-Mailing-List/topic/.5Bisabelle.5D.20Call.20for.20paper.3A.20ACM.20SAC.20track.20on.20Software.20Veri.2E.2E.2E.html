<p>Technical Track on Software Verification</p>

<li>SAC 2007 </li>
</ol>
<p>For the past twenty-one years, the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing has<br>
been a primary gathering forum for applied computer scientists, computer<br>
engineers, software engineers, and application developers from around the<br>
world. SAC 2007 is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied<br>
Computing (SIGAPP), and is hosted by Seoul National University in Seoul and<br>
The Suwon University in Gyeonggi-do.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Technical track on software verification</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next decade the software industry will have to face its</p>
<p>responsibility imposed by a computer-dependent society. Since software</p>
<p>is increasing deployed in safety critical applications, correctness</p>
<p>and reliability are becoming issues of utmost importance. Consequently,<br>
software verification will be a grand challenge for both academic world and<br>
computer industry.  The track will focus on theoretical foundations,<br>
practical methods as well as case studies for verification of conventional<br>
and embedded software. We welcome papers that describe work on combinations<br>
of formal verification and program analysis techniques. Tool papers and case<br>
studies which report on advances in verifying large software systems are<br>
particularly sought. The list of topics includes but not limited to</p>
<p>o    Tools, and case studies for large scale software verification</p>
<p>o    Static analysis/Abstract interpretation for verification </p>
<p>o    Model checking and deductive techniques for software verification</p>
<p>o    Role of declarative programming languages (such as Prolog) for infinite<br>
state software verification. </p>
<p>o    Proof techniques for verifying specific classes of software (such as<br>
object-oriented programs) </p>
<p>o    Integration of testing and run-time monitoring with formal techniques</p>
<p>o    Validation of UML diagrams, and/or requirement specifications</p>
<p>o    Software certification and proof carrying code</p>
<p>o    Integration of formal verification into software development projects</p>

<li>Guidelines for paper submission</li>
</ol>
<p>Each paper must not exceed 4,000 words and should not be more than 15</p>
<p>pages long using 11 point font and 1 inch margins on all four sides on</p>
<p>letter size paper. Papers that fail to comply with length limitations</p>
<p>risk rejection. Each submitted paper will be fully referenced and</p>
<p>undergo a blind review process. Author(s) must not be identified in</p>
<p>the submissions, either explicitly or by implication.  Before</p>
<p>submitting paper, author(s) should submit a separate cover page that</p>
<p>includes title, abstract, list of keywords, and list of authors with</p>
<p>full names and postal addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, and</p>
<p>e-mail addresses. One of the authors must be designated as the primary</p>
<p>contact person. Please upload the cover page via conference website. A</p>
<p>confirmation email with further instructions on paper submission will</p>
<p>be sent to the contact author. Please contact track chairs for any</p>
<p>problems with submission.  Authors of accepted papers must submit an</p>
<p>editorial revision of their papers that must fit within five</p>
<p>two-column pages following the ACM proceedings format (an extra three</p>
<p>extra pages may be available at additional cost to the authors). At</p>
<p>least one of the authors of an accepted paper must register for the</p>
<p>conference and present the paper. Accepted papers will be published in</p>
<p>the ACM SAC 2006 proceedings.</p>
