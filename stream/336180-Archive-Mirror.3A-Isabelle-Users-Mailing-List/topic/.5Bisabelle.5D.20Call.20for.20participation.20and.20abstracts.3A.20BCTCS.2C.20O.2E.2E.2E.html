<p>23rd British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science</p>
<p>BCTCS 2007</p>
<p>2-5 April 2007<br>
                      St Anne's College, Oxford</p>
<p><a href="http://cms.brookes.ac.uk/bctcs2007/">http://cms.brookes.ac.uk/bctcs2007/</a></p>
<p>The purpose of BCTCS is to provide a forum in which researchers in<br>
theoretical computer science can meet, present research findings,<br>
and discuss developments in the field. It also aims to provide an<br>
environment in which PhD students can gain experience in presenting<br>
their work, and benefit from contact with established researchers.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>All aspects of theoretical computer science, including automata<br>
theory, algorithms, complexity theory, semantics, formal methods,<br>
concurrency, types, languages and logics. Computer scientists and<br>
mathematicians are welcome to attend, as are participants from<br>
outside the UK.</p>
<p>PROGRAMME</p>
<p>The programme  will consist of nearly 3 days worth of invited and<br>
contributed talks, beginning at 5.30pm on Monday 2nd April and<br>
concluding at 1pm on Thursday 5th April 2007. The abstracts of the<br>
talks will be published in the Bulletin of the European Association<br>
for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS).</p>
<p>The invited speakers are as follows:</p>
<p>Dimitris Achlioptas, University of California, Santa Cruz, U.S.A.<br>
        "Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems:<br>
         from Physics to Algorithms"</p>
<p>Steven Alpern, The London School of Economics and Political Science<br>
        "Search Games and Utilitarian Postman Paths on Networks"</p>
<p>Julian Bradfield, University of Edinburgh<br>
        (BCS-FACS Lecturer in Formal Methods)</p>
<p>Georg Gottlob, University of Oxford<br>
        "Living with Computational Complexity"<br>
        (This is Prof. Gottlob's inaugural lecture at Oxford University.)</p>
<p>Bob Harper, Carnegie Mellon University, U.S.A.</p>
<p>Richard Jozsa, University of Bristol</p>
<p>Kristina Vuskovic, University of Leeds<br>
        (LMS Lecturer in Discrete Mathematics)</p>
<p>LOCATION</p>
<p>The 2007 colloquium will be held at St Anne's College, Oxford, one<br>
of the colleges of the University of Oxford, and hosted by the<br>
computing departments of both Oxford Brookes and Oxford universities,<br>
Oxford itself is known as the "City of Dreaming Spires", and has<br>
been home to both royalty and scholars for over 800 years.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION</p>
<p>Registration for BCTCS2007 is open, via the web page.<br>
The deadline for registration and submission of abstracts for<br>
proposed talks is 16th February 2007.  The registration fee is<br>
340 UK pounds, including accommodation and meals, and the day<br>
rate is 145 UK pounds. A number of free registrations for<br>
UK-based PhD students are available.</p>
<p>SPONSORS</p>
<p>The colloquium is sponsored by EPSRC, BCS-FACS, and also the<br>
London Mathematical Society.</p>
