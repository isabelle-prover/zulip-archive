<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hallo,</p>
<p>I recently needed something like a "cancellation lemma" for setprod but<br>
was unable to find anyting like it in the libraries.</p>
<p>The lemma I needed and proved was the following:<br>
lemma setprod_cancel: fixes A::"nat set" and B::"nat set"<br>
assumes "B ⊆ A" and "finite A" and "0 ∉ B" shows "∏A / ∏B = ∏(A-B)"</p>
<p>Is there a lemma like this somewhere? If yes, what is it called? If not,<br>
it might be a good idea to add this (or a generalised version of this)<br>
and a version for setsum to the libraries, since it seems like something<br>
one needs quite often when dealing with products and sums.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Manuel</p>

Did you mean "div" instead of "/" or do you an implicit conversion to <br>
real in there?</p>

<p>For sums, there is setsum_diff. For products, there is the question what <br>
the type class of the base type of A,B should be -- probably would need <br>
to be a field, to be useful (which then excludes the naturals).</p>
<p>Maybe one could generically prove "∏A = ∏(A-B) * ∏B" and derive your <br>

I agree that this looks like the right approach. Your suggested lemma in<br>
(generalized form) is a direct consequence of setprod_Un_disjoint:</p>
<p>[| finite A; finite B; A Int B = {} |]<br>
==&gt; setprod f (A Un B) = setprod f A * setprod f B</p>
<p>because A-B and B are disjoint.</p>

(Replied directly at first instead of to the list, sorry about that)</p>
<p>No, I really meant /. I have coercions from nat to real in there. But<br>
yes, the generalisation you proposed seems like a good idea, that should<br>
work for any abelian semigroup with multiplication, I think. (as long as<br>
the underlying lemmas for setprod are that general as well)</p>
<p>I was just very surprised that something like this didn't exist already.<br>
Who is responsible for maintaining these libraries, i.e. whom do I have<br>
to contact if I have a lemma that I think should be included in the library?</p>

<p>You can try to send it to one of the people who created the theory. Which would<br>
be me in this case.</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
It can indeed be proven for comm_monoid_mult in a rather straightforward<br>
fashion:</p>
<p>lemma setprod_diff: "⟦B ⊆ A; finite A⟧ ⟹<br>
    setprod f A = setprod f (A - B) * setprod f B"<br>
by (subgoal_tac "A - B ∪ B = A", subst setprod_Un_disjoint[symmetric],<br>
    auto intro: finite_subset)</p>
<p>And the corresponding cancellation lemmas for products over nat, int and<br>
real. I was unable to prove a general version of this with arbitrary<br>
types because the correctness lemmas for the real type coercion seem to<br>
be only available for specific types such as nat and int. (note the<br>
implicit coercion to real)</p>
<p>lemma setprod_cancel_nat: fixes f::"'a ⇒ nat"<br>
    assumes "B ⊆ A" and "finite A" and "∀x∈B. f x ≠ 0"<br>
    shows "setprod f A / setprod f B = setprod f (A - B)" (is "?A / ?B =<br>
?C")<br>
proof-<br>
  from setprod_diff[OF assms(1,2)] have "?A = ?C * ?B" by auto<br>
  moreover have "?B ≠ 0" using assms by (simp add: finite_subset)<br>
  ultimately show ?thesis by simp<br>
qed</p>
<p>(and similarly for int and real)</p>
<p>To be more precise, if I tried to prove this for arbitrary types with<br>
some sort constraint, i.e. 'b::comm_monoid_mult, I always got stuck at<br>
some subgoal like "real (a * b) = real a * real b" which seemed to be<br>
unprovable. Do I really have to write three separate lemmas for nat, int<br>
and real or is there a way to do this once for arbitrary types?</p>
