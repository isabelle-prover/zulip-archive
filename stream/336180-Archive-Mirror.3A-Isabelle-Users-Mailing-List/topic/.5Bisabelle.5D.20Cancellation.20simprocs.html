<p>From: Mathias Fleury &lt;<a href="mailto:mathias.fleury12@gmail.com">mathias.fleury12@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello list,</p>
<p>there are several simprocs that are able to cancel terms, i.e. simplify<br>
"a + b + c = b + d" to "a + c = d".</p>
<p>Current problem: none of the simprocs is activated on<br>
cancel_comm_monoid_add (i.e., the earliest point where the cancellation<br>
is possible).</p>
<p>Here is the situation as far as I can tell:</p>
<p>Simproc<br>
    _L_arry _P_aulson's cancellation _s_improc on nat/int/...<br>
    Brian Huffman's _G__r_oup cancellation _s_improc<br>
    My _M_ultiset cancellation _s_improc<br>
    My _G__e_neralised _m_ultiset cancellation _s_improc<br>

~~/src/HOL/Library/Cancellation/cancel*.ML<br>
Works on:<br>
    nat / int / ...<br>
    cancel_comm_monoid_add, but activated only on groups<br>
    cancel_comm_monoid_add, but activated only on multisets<br>
cancel_comm_monoid_add, but activated only on multisets<br>
Special feature<br>
    - support the product</p>
<ul>
<li>does additional simplification on the output<p>- support repeat_mset, replicate_mset,...<br>
  - support an iterate_add operator (for multisets: repeat_mset,<br>
replicate_mset,...; for natural numbers, it would be the product)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some points to notice:</p>
<p>(1) The aim behind generalising the MS to GeMS is to support multiset<br>
variants with constructors and special operators (like signed multisets<br>
in $AFP/Nested_Multisets_Ordinals/Signed_Multiset.thy). There might be<br>
other types that have a operator that behaves like a multiplication by nat.</p>
<p>(2) We cannot activate the simprocs on cancel_comm_monoid_add.<br>
Otherwise, tactics like linarith fails: linarith relies on the<br>
additional simplification done by LPS (like replacing ‹-1 * x› by ‹- x›).</p>
<p>(3) I am not sure that GrS and GeMS do the exact same thing on the same<br>
formula.</p>
<p>To solve the problem, I have locally activated GeMS where I have<br>
hard-coded that the simproc does not apply on types where LPS applies.<br>
It worked without problem. However, I am not sure that testing the AFP<br>
and the Isabelle distribution is sufficient to declare that (3) does not<br>
cause problems.</p>
<p>Does somebody have an opinion on the matter? Or should I just proceed<br>
and activate my GeMS simproc on all cancel_comm_monoid_add types (except<br>
those where LPS applies)?</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mathias</p>

<p>I have no ready-to-proceed suggestion at hand, but a few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>LPS is the only one to operate on nat / int directly rather than an<br>
algebraic structure.  Can this be lifted, and how would the overall<br>
picture then look like?<br>
For nat: it cannot be lifted. The replacement from Suc to +1 is done<br>
while iterating over the term. So no simple way to do lifting.</li>

<p>For int: it already works on linordered_idom.</p>
<p>I have to think about the general picture if we really want to reduce<br>
duplication (with the risk of breaking proofs).</p>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>the code is non-trivial (e.g., whether Suc is replaced by +1 is<br>
handled internally).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is some normalisation done after cancellation (I don't really<br>
know why).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the simprocs on natural numbers are crucial for the linarith, meaning<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>LPS does not always do what people would expect, e.g.<br>
~~/HOL/ex/Simproc_Tests.thy:<br>
       (* FIXME "Suc (i + 3) \&lt;equiv&gt; i + 4" *)<br>
       assume "4 * Suc 0 + i = u" have "Suc (i + 3) = u"<br>
          by (tactic \&lt;open&gt;test @{context} [@{simproc<br>
nat_combine_numerals}]\&lt;close&gt;) fact</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we want to replace LPS, should we aim at full compatibility to avoid<br>
breaking proofs or try to fix the FIXMEs from Simproc_Test?</p>

Historical remark: this code was written possibly before axiomatic type classes even existed and certainly before they were used to streamline our formalisation of arithmetic theories. And it’s still possible that the natural numbers are sufficiently distinctive to need their own dedicated simproc.</p>
<p>I don’t remember for sure, quite possibly, rewriting i+4 to Suc(i+3) is intentional, with the idea that a subsequent rewrite step will involve something of the form f(Suc k) = …k….</p>
<p>Streamlining and generalising this code will be a big job for somebody.</p>

Not really. It should be possible to have a simproc that replaces the<br>
Suc by ‹+1› where needed. Then the normal cancellation simproc should be<br>
able to do the job.</p>

I think you misunderstood the comment: the simprocs simplifies ‹Suc (i +<br>
3)› in ‹4 * Suc 0 + i›. It does not do anything on ‹i+4›.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, what you said explains why ‹Suc (i  + 1)› is not simplified to<br>
‹i+2›.</p>

I agree.</p>

<p>linarith is indeed a world on its own and IMHO it would be OK if<br>
linarith would retain its current simproc, even if that is not used any<br>
where else.</p>
<p>For a generalized simproc it would be fine if some proofs have to be<br>
amended, if the number of breaking proofs does not rise to high; this<br>
happens routinely when maintaining proof automation.  The usual approach<br>
to figure out is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the intended change.</li>
<li>See whether HOL can get run with reasonable effort.</li>
<li>
<p>Build as much as possible from distro and AFP.  Iterate over breaking<br>
proofs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time you get an idea what the impact of the change is:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many breaking proofs?</li>
<li>
<p>How big is the amount of »awkward« breaking proofs compared to<br>
»streamlined« breaking proofs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there are recurring pattern how proofs can be repaired?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there yet another thing to change e.g. concerning the simplifier<br>
setup to get to a cleaner situation again?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
