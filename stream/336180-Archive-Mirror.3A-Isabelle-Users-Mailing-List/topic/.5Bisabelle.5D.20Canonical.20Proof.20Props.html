Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm currently working on extracting theorem dependencies from proof terms. I've noticed that the prop one gets from <code>Thm.full_prop_of</code>  sometimes doesn't match the prop in the topmost proof body of a <code>thm</code>. As an example, the following two props are different:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Isabelle"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">theory</span> <span class="n">Scratch</span>
<span class="kp">imports</span> <span class="n">Main</span>
<span class="k">begin</span>

<span class="k">declare</span> <span class="o">[[</span><span class="n">show_sorts</span><span class="o">]]</span>
<span class="k">ML</span> <span class=" -Symbol">\&lt;open&gt;</span>
  <span class="n">val</span> <span class="n">prop1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Thm.full_prop_of</span> <span class="err">@</span><span class="ow">{</span><span class="kt">thm</span> <span class="n">refl</span><span class="ow">}</span><span class="err">;</span>
  <span class="n">val</span> <span class="n">prop2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="err">@</span><span class="ow">{</span><span class="kt">thm</span> <span class="n">refl</span><span class="ow">}</span>
    <span class="o">|</span><span class="err">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Thm.proof_body_of</span>
    <span class="o">|</span><span class="err">&gt;</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">fn</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">PBody</span> <span class="ow">{</span><span class="n">thms</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="ow">...}</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">=</span><span class="err">&gt;</span> <span class="n">thms</span><span class="o">)</span>
    <span class="o">|</span><span class="err">&gt;</span> <span class="n">List.hd</span>
    <span class="o">|</span><span class="err">&gt;</span> <span class="n">snd</span>
    <span class="o">|</span><span class="err">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Proofterm.thm_node_prop</span><span class="err">;</span>
<span class=" -Symbol">\&lt;close&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In particular, <code>prop2</code> has the <code>type_class</code> sort constraint pulled out as a premise, whereas <code>prop1</code> leaves it as a constraint on types in the term. As far as I can tell, the transformation only occurs in proof bodies as part of a post-processing step introduced by <code>Proofterm.thm_proof</code>.</p>
<p>I ran into the above while attempting to disambiguate the names that occur in proof bodies. That is, if a proof body refers to a prop <code>p</code> with name <code>"foo_1"</code>, I need to distinguish between <code>p</code> being proven by the first theorem in a thm list (<code>foo(1)</code>) or by a thm with the actual name <code>foo_1</code>. Since <code>Thm.full_prop_of</code> and proof bodies sometimes disagree, the easiest solution at the time was to use the proof body terms as a 'normal form', which seems unsatisfying. So, for my own education:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the canonical way to get the dependencies of a thm?</li>
<li>What is the canonical way to disambiguate between the first theorem of <code>foo</code> vs. a theorem named <code>foo_1</code>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Regards,<br>

I occasionally ask myself the same questions. After so many years the<br>

theory was just a comment, and the slightly odd "disambiguation" wrt.<br>
the proposition was used to make sense of in as proof terms. Now the<br>
fact environment of the context is authentic, but proof terms still have<br>
a rather weak notion of derivation name internally.</p>
<p>There are other fine points that don't quite work, e.g. see the<br>
implementation of the commands 'thm_deps' and 'unused_thms'.</p>
<p>As usual, one needs to look very closely at the status-quo, and figure<br>
out if a particular application has the chance to go through.</p>
<p>Which leaves the canonical question: What application do you have in mind?</p>

<p>We're looking for stray unused lemmas in the seL4 verification proofs. These are (in some parts) old and (in all parts) large collections of proofs that have undergone more than a few refactorings. The technique of using proof node names to loosely infer "real" lemma names and their usage relationships, as well as proof node props to disambiguate/confirm those inferences, seems to be working so far, so I suppose I have no real issue yet.<br>
