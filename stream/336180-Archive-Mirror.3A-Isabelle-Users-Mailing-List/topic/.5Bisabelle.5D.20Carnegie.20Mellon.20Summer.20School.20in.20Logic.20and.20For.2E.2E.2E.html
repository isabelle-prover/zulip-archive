Carnegie Mellon Summer School in Logic and Formal Epistemology</p>
<p>In the summer of 2008, the Department of Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon<br>
University will hold a three-week summer school in logic and formal<br>
epistemology for promising undergraduates in philosophy, mathematics,<br>
computer science, linguistics, and other sciences.</p>
<p>The goals are to</p>
<p>o introduce students to cross-disciplinary fields of research at an<br>
     early stage in their career; and<br>
   o forge lasting links between the various disciplines.</p>
<p>The summer school will be held from Monday, June 9 to Friday, June 27,<br>
2008. There will be morning and afternoon lectures and daily problem<br>
sessions, as well as planned outings and social events.</p>
<p>The summer school is free. That is, we will provide</p>
<p>o full tuition, and<br>
   o dormitory accommodations on the Carnegie Mellon campus.</p>
<p>So students need only pay round trip travel to Pittsburgh and living<br>
expenses while there. There are no grades, and the courses do not<br>
provide formal course credit.</p>
<p>Instructions for applying can be found on the summer school web page,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.phil.cmu.edu/summerschool">http://www.phil.cmu.edu/summerschool</a></p>
<p>Materials must be received by the Philosophy Department by March 15,<br>
2008.</p>
<p>This year's topics are:</p>
<p>Causal and Statistical Inference<br>
   Monday, June 9 to Friday, June 13<br>
   Instructor: David Danks</p>
<p>Semantics and Discourse Representation<br>
   Monday, June 16 to Friday, June 20<br>
   Instructor: Mandy Simons</p>
<p>Logic and Formal Verification<br>
   Monday, June 23 to Friday, June 27<br>
   Instructor: Jeremy Avigad</p>
<p>The summer school is open to undergraduates, as well as to students<br>
who will have just received their undergraduate degrees. We regret<br>
that we cannot extend the invitation to students beyond their first<br>
year of graduate school. Applicants need not be US citizens.</p>
