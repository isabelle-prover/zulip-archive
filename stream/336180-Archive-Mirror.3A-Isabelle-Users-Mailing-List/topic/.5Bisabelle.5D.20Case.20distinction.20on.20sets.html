<p>From: "C. Diekmann" &lt;<a href="mailto:diekmann@in.tum.de">diekmann@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi everyone,</p>
<p>with lists, I can do case distinctions, which I cannot do with sets.<br>
Is there any good advice to express case distinctions on sets?</p>
<p>Here is my example. With lists, I can write the following:</p>
<p>case [x←xs. P x] of [] =&gt; None<br>
                            | [y] =&gt; Some y<br>
                            | _ =&gt; undefined</p>
<p>I would like to write this down for xs being a set. To prove<br>
equivalence, I will use "set xs". Unfortunately, I cannot use "case"<br>
with a set. The best I could come up with is the following:</p>
<p>let matching_entries = {x ∈ set xs. P x} in<br>
    if matching_entries = {} then None else<br>
    if ∃y. matching_entries = {y} then Some (the_elem matching_entries) else<br>
       undefined</p>
<p>Is there a nicer and better way to express this?</p>
<p>If xs is distinct, both versions are equivalent (though the proof was<br>
horrible). For the proof I needed some helper lemmas, for example the<br>
following:</p>
<p>lemma "distinct xs ⟹ {x. x ∈ set xs ∧ P x} = {x} ⟹<br>
       [x←xs . P x] = [x]"<br>
apply(induction xs)<br>
 apply(simp)<br>
apply(simp)<br>
apply(case_tac "x=a")<br>
 apply simp_all<br>
 apply (smt DiffD2 Diff_insert_absorb filter_False insert_compr mem_Collect_eq)<br>
by (smt Collect_cong ball_empty insert_iff mem_Collect_eq)</p>
<p>The lemma seems pretty obvious to me so I didn't want to invest much<br>
time into it. This was the best proof I could come up with. Why can't<br>
the built-in tools such as blast solve this lemma instantly? I could<br>
not replace those two smt calls with other one-line methods. What is<br>
it that makes this lemma so hard for Isabelle?</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice,<br>
  Cornelius</p>

Hi Cornelius,</p>
<p>You can simplify your definitions if you split the filtering from the section of the <br>
elements. It looks as if you are trying to lift the operation "pick the unique element in <br>
a set" into the option monad. So just lift this operaton:</p>
<p>definition the_elem_option :: "'a set =&gt; 'a option"<br>
where "the_elem_option A = (if EX1 x. x : A then Some (the_elem A) else None)"</p>
<p>Note that this specification is tighter than yours as the result is None if there are <br>
several elements in the set. If you wanted the function to be undefined in a mathematical <br>
sense, then this approach is likely to make your life hard anyway, because working with <br>
underspecified functions usually causes quite some pain.</p>
<p>Moreover, I've replaces EX x. A = {x} with EX1 x. x : A, because the latter involves more <br>
primitive operations on sets than the former. Intuitively, I'd expect better automation <br>
for the latter, but I have not tested it.</p>
<p>In general, I recommend that you work only at the level of abstraction that fits your <br>
needs. If you want sets (without order on the elements), then stick to the type set (or <br>
fset, if you need finiteness) and never talk about lists. If you need the order of the <br>
elements in the list, then work with lists and convert them to sets when needed, but do <br>
not try to lift the operations from lists to sets when they rely on the order---this <br>
normally directly leads to ugly, messy, tedious proofs.</p>
<p>Picking an element from a set is hard for the automated tools, because it involves a <br>
tricky mix of rewriting and resolution. Blast can only deal with resolution, but not <br>
rewriting, so blast usually does not work well for proofs involving equality. Conversely, <br>
the simplifier cannot deal well with underspecified functions (like the_elem).</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
Andreas</p>
