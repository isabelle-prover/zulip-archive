<p>From: Andrei Popescu &lt;<a href="mailto:andrei.h.popescu@gmail.com">andrei.h.popescu@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP) is an international conference on<br>
practical and theoretical topics in all areas that consider formal<br>
verification and certification as an essential paradigm for their work. CPP<br>
spans areas of computer science, mathematics, logic, and education.</p>
<p>CPP 2021 will be held on 18-19 January 2021 and will be co-located with<br>
POPL 2021. CPP 2021 is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM<br>
SIGLOG.</p>

<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>
<p>Prior to the paper submission deadline, the authors should upload their<br>
anonymized paper in PDF format through the HotCRP system at</p>
<p><a href="https://cpp2021.hotcrp.com">https://cpp2021.hotcrp.com</a></p>
<p>The submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to<br>
allow the program committee to assess the merits of the contribution. They<br>
must be formatted following the ACM SIGPLAN Proceedings format using the<br>
acmart style with the sigplan option, which provides a two-column style,<br>
using 10 point font for the main text, and a header for double blind review<br>
submission, i.e.,</p>
<p>\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,anonymous,review]{acmart}\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}</p>
<p>The submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages, including tables and<br>
figures, but excluding bibliography and clearly marked appendices. The<br>
papers should be self-contained without the appendices. Shorter papers are<br>
welcome and will be given equal consideration. Submissions not conforming<br>
to the requirements concerning format and maximum length may be rejected<br>
without further consideration.</p>
<p>CPP 2021 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. To<br>
facilitate this, the submissions must adhere to two rules:</p>
<p>(1) author names and institutions must be omitted, and</p>
<p>(2) references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person<br>
(e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the<br>
work of ...").</p>
<p>The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come<br>
to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it<br>
impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing<br>
should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or<br>
makes the job of reviewing it more difficult. In particular, important<br>
background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition,<br>
authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their<br>
papers as usual. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on<br>
the web or give talks on their research ideas. POPL has answers to<br>
frequently asked questions addressing many common concerns:<br>
<a href="https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ">https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ</a></p>
<p>We encourage the authors to provide any supplementary material that is<br>
required to support the claims made in the paper, such as proof scripts or<br>
experimental data. This material must be uploaded at submission time, as an<br>
archive, not via a URL. Two forms of supplementary material may be<br>
submitted:</p>
<p>(1) Anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers<br>
before they submit their first-draft reviews.</p>
<p>(2) Non-anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers<br>
after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have learned the<br>
identity of the authors.</p>
<p>Please use anonymous supplementary material whenever possible, so that it<br>
can be taken into account from the beginning of the reviewing process.</p>
<p>The submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy (<br>
<a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/</a>) and the ACM<br>
Policy on Plagiarism (<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism">https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism</a>).<br>
Concurrent submissions to other conferences, journals, workshops with<br>
proceedings, or similar forums of publication are not allowed. The PC<br>
chairs should be informed of closely related work submitted to a conference<br>
or journal in advance of submission. One author of each accepted paper is<br>
expected to present it at the (possibly virtual) conference.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION, COPYRIGHT AND OPEN ACCESS</p>
<p>The CPP proceedings will be published by the ACM, and authors of accepted<br>
papers will be required to choose one of the following publication options:</p>
<p>(1) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive<br>
permission-to-publish license and, optionally, licenses the work under a<br>
Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>(2) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive<br>
permission-to-publish license.</p>
<p>(3) Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.</p>
<p>For authors who can afford it, we recommend option (1), which will make the<br>
paper Gold Open Access, and also encourage such authors to license their<br>
work under the CC-BY license. ACM will charge you an article processing fee<br>
for this option (currently, US$700), which you have to pay directly with<br>
the ACM.</p>
<p>For everyone else, we recommend option (2), which is free and allows you to<br>
achieve Green Open Access, by uploading a preprint of your paper to a<br>
repository that guarantees permanent archival such as arXiv or HAL. This is<br>
anyway a good idea for timely dissemination even if you chose option 1.<br>
Ensuring timely dissemination is particularly important for this edition,<br>
since, because of the very tight schedule, the official proceedings might<br>
not be available in time for CPP.</p>
<p>The official CPP 2021 proceedings will also be available via SIGPLAN<br>
OpenTOC (<a href="http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp">http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp</a>).</p>
<p>For ACM’s take on this, see their Copyright Policy (<br>
<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy">http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy</a>) and Author<br>
Rights (<a href="http://authors.acm.org/main.html">http://authors.acm.org/main.html</a>).</p>
