<p>From: Jeremy Avigad &lt;<a href="mailto:avigad@cmu.edu">avigad@cmu.edu</a>&gt;<br>
The 5th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on<br>
Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP 2016)<br>
in cooperation with ACM SIGLOG</p>
<p>Saint Petersburg, Florida, USA<br>
January 18-19, 2016<br>
<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/adamc/cpp16/">http://people.csail.mit.edu/adamc/cpp16/</a><br>
Co-located with POPL 2016 (<a href="http://conf.researchr.org/home/POPL-2016">http://conf.researchr.org/home/POPL-2016</a>)</p>
<p>Call for Papers<br>
===============</p>
<p>CPP is an international forum on theoretical and practical topics in<br>
all areas, including computer science, mathematics, and education,<br>
that consider certification as an essential paradigm for their work.<br>
Certification here means formal, mechanized verification of some sort,<br>
preferably with production of independently checkable certificates.</p>
<p>CPP 2016 is the fifth in the CPP conference series and will be co-located<br>
with POPL 2016 in Saint Petersburg, Florida from 18-19 January 2016.</p>
<p>Important dates</p>
<hr>
<p>Abstract submission:    7 October 2015, anywhere on Earth (11:59 pm, UTC-12)<br>
Full paper submission: 12 October 2015, anywhere on Earth (11:59 pm, UTC-12)<br>
Notification:          18 November 2015<br>
Final versions due:     4 December 2015<br>
Conference dates:   18-19 January 2016</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission instructions</p>
<hr>
<p>Submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages in the ACM SIGPLAN<br>
Proceedings format. Shorter papers are welcome and will be given equal<br>
consideration. The proceedings of the conference will be published<br>
by the ACM. Templates for ACM SIGPLAN format can be found on the<br>
ACM SIGPLAN website:<br>
<a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author">http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author</a>.</p>
<p>Papers should be submitted in PDF format, through the EasyChair<br>
submission page:<br>
<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2016">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2016</a></p>
<p>Abstracts must be submitted by the deadline given above.<br>
The deadline for full papers falls one week later, and authors<br>
have the option to withdraw their papers during the window between the<br>
two.</p>
<p>Each submission must be written in English and provide sufficient<br>
detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the<br>
paper. It should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a<br>
summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their<br>
significance and relevance to the conference, all phrased for the<br>
non-specialist. Technical and formal developments directed to the<br>
specialist should follow. If the submission reports on a<br>
computer-checked formalization, code, or the results of a computation,<br>
a link to the relevant data should be provided. References and<br>
comparisons with related work should be included. Papers not<br>
conforming to the above requirements concerning format and length may<br>
be rejected without further consideration.</p>
<p>The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>
elsewhere, including the proceedings of other published conferences or<br>
workshops. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work<br>
submitted to a conference or journal in advance of submission.<br>
Original formal proofs of known results in mathematics or computer<br>
science are among the targets. One author of each accepted paper is<br>
expected to present it at the conference.</p>
