<p>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>Reducing the likelihood of human error in the use of interactive<br>
   systems is increasingly important: the use of such systems is<br>
   becoming widespread in applications that demand high reliability<br>
   due to safety, security, financial or similar considerations.<br>
   Consequently, the use of formal methods in verifying the<br>
   correctness of interactive systems should also include analysis<br>
   of human behaviour in interacting with the interface. </p>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers in<br>
   computer science and cognitive psychology, from both academia<br>
   and industry, who are interested in developing formal and<br>
   semi-formal methodologies and tools for the evaluation and<br>
   verification of interactive systems. The outcome is to establish<br>
   a worldwide network of researchers interested in applying formal<br>
   methods to HCI. </p>
<p>The workshop will focus on, though will not be restricted to,</p>
<p>* general design and verification methodologies<br>
       based on cognitive psychology</p>
<p>as well as application areas such as</p>
<p>* mobile devices;<br>
     * embedded systems;<br>
     * safety-critical systems;<br>
     * high-reliability systems;<br>
     * shared control systems;<br>
     * digital libraries;<br>
     * eGovernment;<br>
     * pervasive systems;<br>
     * augmented reality. </p>
<p>The one-day workshop will feature a one hour presentation by a<br>
   keynote speaker together with contributed papers that will<br>
   undergo a peer-review process. Contributed papers may be<br>
   accepted either for full presentation or short presentation.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION</p>
<p>Papers accepted as full paper presentations will be published by<br>
   Elsevier in the series Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer<br>
   Science (ENTCS). Papers accepted as short paper presentations<br>
   will be published in the participants` proceedings at the<br>
   workshop only. Detailed information on the submission procedure<br>
   is available below. </p>
<p>Publication of a selection of the papers in a journal special<br>
   issue is also under consideration.</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKER</p>
<p>* Harold Thimbleby, University of Wales Swansea, UK</p>
<p>SPONSORS AND ORGANISATION</p>
<p>IFMIS 2006 will be organised jointly between the International<br>
   Institute for Software Technology of the United Nations<br>
   University (UNU-IIST) and the EPSRC Human Error Modelling (HUM)<br>
   Project of the University of London (QMUL and UCL).<br>
   UNU-IIST and EPSRC-HUM are also sponsors of ICTAC 2006.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION</p>
<p>Submissions to the workshop must not have been published or be<br>
   concurrently considered for publication elsewhere.<br>
   All submissions will be peer-reviewed and judged on the basis<br>
   of originality, contribution to the field, technical and<br>
   presentation quality, and relevance to the workshop.<br>
   Papers should be written in English and not exceed 16 pages<br>
   in ENTCS format. </p>
<p>Authors should utilize the ENTCS macro files that have been<br>
   specially prepared for use with ENTCS. The generic ENTCS package,<br>
   which contains files common for all volumes in ENTCS and<br>
   includes several examples, as well as instructions, can be<br>
   downloaded from <br>
<a href="http://www.entcs.org/generic.tar.gz">http://www.entcs.org/generic.tar.gz</a>.<br>
   The entcsmacro.sty file in the ENTCS package should be be<br>
   replaced by the prentcsmacro.sty file, which is specific to<br>
   FMIS 2006 and can be downloaded from<br>
<a href="http://www.entcs.org/files/fmis/prentcsmacro.sty">http://www.entcs.org/files/fmis/prentcsmacro.sty</a>.<br>
   File prentcsmacro.sty has to be renamed entcsmacro.sty.<br>
   File example.tex has to be used as a template for the paper,<br>
   making sure that key words are included in the frontmatter<br>
   section where indicated. </p>
<p>Authors also should not use any formatting commands that alter<br>
   the ENTCS style definitions. This includes the format of<br>
   Definitions, Lemmas, Theorems, etc., as well as the spacing<br>
   that is defined by the ENTCS Macros. </p>
<p>Authors must submit their papers in pdf format to the website<br>
<a href="http://confman.iist.unu.edu/FMIS2006/REG-paper/">http://confman.iist.unu.edu/FMIS2006/REG-paper/</a><br>
   no later than Sunday 23 July 2006. </p>
<p>All queries should be sent to: fmis2006 AT <a href="http://iist.unu.edu">iist.unu.edu</a>.</p>
