<p><em>CALL FOR PAPERS</em></p>
<p>*HOFM 2015: 2nd Human-Oriented Formal Methods Workshop *
<a href="http://hofm2015.wordpress.com">http://hofm2015.wordpress.com</a></p>
<p><em>co-located to SEFM</em>, 13th International Conference on Software Engineering<br>
and Formal Methods, <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/sefm2015">http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/sefm2015</a> (York, UK)</p>
<p><strong>Important Dates</strong></p>
<p>Deadline for paper submission: June 3, 2015<br>
Notification: June 19, 2015<br>
Workshop will take place on Monday, September 7, 2015.</p>
<p><em>Aims:</em></p>
<p>While designing and applying formal methods, computer scientists have<br>
dominantly focused on two factors, only: firstly, the method must be<br>
precise and sound and secondly, it must be mathematically concise and<br>
aesthetic. Other important characteristics such as simplicity,<br>
learnability, readability, memorability, ease of use and communication or,<br>
even support for integrating tools into larger development tool chains are<br>
ignored too often. These nonfunctional properties, however, are key<br>
attributes of usability and user satisfaction. If usability is compromised,<br>
methods are not fit for the purpose of documenting, reproducing and<br>
communicating key design and realization decisions, or analysis results,<br>
especially when these need to communicate or mediate between expertise in<br>
different disciplines, different tool chains or across technological or<br>
organizational boundaries. For these reasons, many engineers and<br>
practitioners largely reject formal methods and formal specification<br>
languages as “too hard to understand and use in practice” while admitting<br>
that they are powerful and precise.</p>
<p>With increasing computing power and its consequent automation capabilities,<br>
the research and development community however is slowly but definitely<br>
focusing on usability in combination with automation. Moreover<br>
practitioners across numerous domains are increasingly interested in formal<br>
domain-specific modelling, simulation and validation, whether in<br>
application areas of energy, robotics, health, biology, climate and<br>
sustainable development, or, for specific technologies of importance such<br>
as data analytics and user interface specification for an exponentially<br>
growing number of hand-held or wearable devices.</p>
<p>While there are many applications of formal methods to analyze<br>
human-machine interaction and to construct user interfaces, the field of<br>
application of human factors to the analysis and to the optimization of<br>
formal methods area is almost unexplored.</p>
<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers, engineers and<br>
practitioners from academia and industry to baseline the state of the art<br>
in this increasingly important domain. It also aims to develop a future<br>
vision and roadmap of usability and automation, focusing especially on<br>
readability and ease of use.</p>
<p><em>Areas of interest include but are not limited to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Integration of formal methods in the industrial development life<br>
cycle , application of Formal Methods to real-world problems especially in<br>
domains listed below</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimization of the development tools based on formal models</p>
</li>
<li>Specification/modeling notations and tools for human readability</li>
<li>Human factors of/for formal methods</li>
<li>Formal methods and design for usability</li>
<li>Usability and scalability of formal methods tools</li>
<li>Human error and human factors in software/systems dependability</li>
<li>Interface design, formal specification and human factors</li>
<li>Cross-disciplinary automation and hybrid formal methods</li>
<li>Verification/testing automation</li>
<li>Usability evaluation in automated verification and testing</li>
<li>Visualisation of/in formal methods and tools</li>
<li>Domain-specific languages for verification and validation</li>
<li>Crowd-enabling and gamification for human-centred verification</li>
<li>Domain-specific formal methods for real-world problems</li>
<li>Teaching of Formal Methods, especially wrt. human factors</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Formatting and Submission Guidelines:</em></p>
<p>All accepted papers will be published as part of the Lecture Notes in<br>
Computer Science (LNCS) proceedings volume organized by SEFM.<br>
PDF versions of papers should be submitted trough EasyChair submission<br>
system.<br>
The maximum size is 15 pages using the LNCS Formatting Guidelines.<br>
If you submit a paper and it gets accepted, at least one of the<br>
(co)author(s) is expected to be present at the workshop to present the<br>
paper. All papers submitted to the workshop must be unpublished original<br>
work and should not be under review or submitted elsewhere while being<br>
under consideration.</p>
<p>We invite submissions in three categories:<br>
• Research papers reporting innovative and original research in the field.<br>
• Work-in-Progress/vision describing ongoing research, emerging results and<br>
future ideas&amp;trends.<br>
• Tool papers describing operational tool and its contributions.</p>
<p>Submitted papers will be reviewed by 3 members of Program/Organizing<br>
Committee (or their sub-reviewers) and selection of accepted papers will<br>
based on relevance, quality and originality of the submitted papers.</p>
