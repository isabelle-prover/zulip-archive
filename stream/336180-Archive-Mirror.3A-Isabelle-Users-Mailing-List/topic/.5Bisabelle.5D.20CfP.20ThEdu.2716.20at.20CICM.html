<p>THedu'16 Scope:</p>
<p>Educational software tools have technologies integrated from CAS, from<br>
DGS, from Spreadsheets and others, but not from TP with few exceptions:<br>
the latter have been developed to model mathematical reasoning in<br>
software -- rigorous reasoning as a companion of calculating, which<br>
guarantees the unsurpassed reliability of mathematics. Providing<br>
students with insight in and experience with this kind of reliability is<br>
considered an essential aim of mathematics education.</p>
<p>TPs intrude into science as well as into industry: They are used to<br>
tackle difficult proofs in the science of mathematics, like the Four<br>
Color Problem or the Kepler Conjecture. In industry TPs are successfully<br>
used to verify safety critical software. This workshop addresses a<br>
window of opportunity during the still open development of TP.</p>
<p>The workshop provides a meeting place for educators and developers of<br>
 educational mathematics software and experts in TP. The discussions<br>
shall clarify the requirements of education, identify advantages and<br>
promises of TP for learning and motivate development of a novel kind of<br>
educational mathematical tools probably establishing a new generation of<br>
such tools.</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
<p>* Extended Abstracts:    4. June 2016<br>
    * Author Notification:  18. June 2016<br>
    * Final Version:         2. July 2016<br>
    * Workshop Day:         25-29. July 2016</p>
<p>Points of interest include:</p>
<p>* Adaption of TP -- concepts and technologies for education: knowledge<br>
    representation, simplifiers, reasoners; undefinednes, level of<br>
    abstraction, etc.</p>
<p>* Requirements on software support for reasoning -- reasoning appears<br>
    as the most advanced method of human thought, so at which age<br>
    which kind of support TP should be provided?</p>
<p>* Automated TP in geometry -- relating intuitive evidence with logical<br>
    rigor: specific provers, adaption of axioms and theorems, visual<br>
    proofs, etc.</p>
<p>* Application of TP components in SW for engineers -- Formal Methods<br>
    increasingly advance into engineering practice, so educational<br>
    software based on TP components could anticipate that advancement.</p>
<p>* Levels of authoring -- in order to cope with generality of TP:<br>
    experts adapt to specifics of countries or levels, teachers adapt<br>
    to courses and students.</p>
<p>* Adaptive modules, students modeling and learning paths -- services<br>
    for user guidance provided by TP technology: which interfaces<br>
    enable flexible generation of adaptive user guidance?</p>
<p>* Next-step-guidance -- suggesting a next step when a student gets<br>
    stuck in problem solving: which computational methods can extend<br>
    TP for that purpose?</p>
<p>* TP as unifying foundation -- for the integration of technologies<br>
    like CAS, DGS, Spreadsheets etc: interfaces for unified support of<br>
    reasoning?</p>
<p>* Continuous tool chains -- for mathematics education from high-school<br>
    to university, from algebra and geometry to graph theory etc.</p>
<p>Submission</p>
<p>We welcome submission of extended abstracts and demonstration<br>
  proposals presenting original unpublished work which is not been<br>
  submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>
<p>All accepted extended abstracts and demonstrations will be presented<br>
  at the workshop. The extended abstracts will be made available<br>
  online.</p>
<p>Contributions should be submitted via THedu'16 easychair<br>
<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu16">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu16</a>.</p>
<p>Extended abstracts and demonstration proposals should be no more than<br>
  4 pages in length and are to be submitted in PDF format. They must<br>
  conform to the EPTCS style guidelines (<a href="http://style.eptcs.org/">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>).</p>
<p>At least one author of each accepted extended abstract/demonstration<br>
  proposal is expected to attend THedu'15 and presents his/her extended<br>
  abstract/demonstration. Joint publication in companion with other CICM<br>
  events is under consideration (e.g. <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/">http://ceur-ws.org/</a>).</p>
