                  IJCAR Workshop on Automated Theory Exploration<br>
                                (June 30-July 1)<br>

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>This Workshop on Automated Theory Exploration will be held in June/July in Manchester, UK.<br>
It is associated with the 6th International Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR) and<br>
follows on from two series of workshops: Automated Theory Engineering and Automatheo.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>Theory exploration means the development of mathematical axioms, definitions, conjectures,<br>
theorems, examples and inference procedures as needed to cover the essential concepts<br>
and analysis tasks of mathematical and other application domains. The automation and<br>
mechanisation of these capabilities are much sought after in areas such as software<br>
verification, the analysis of computer systems, formalised mathematics and indeed<br>
mathematical research.</p>
<p>The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers with interests in any aspects<br>
of this area, including domain-specific formalisations, tool and theory development,<br>
and general-purpose frameworks for the structuring of theories and their maintenance.</p>
<p>TOPICS</p>
<p>Theory exploration is relevant to the design of systems, programs, APIs, protocols,<br>
algorithms, design patterns, specification languages, programming languages and<br>
beyond. It involves technology such as ITP systems, ATP systems, SAT/SMT solvers,<br>
model checkers and decision procedures.</p>
<p>Specific topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>o mechanised reasoning for modelling and analysis<br>
o automation applied to formal specification and verification<br>
o domain specific models, languages and solvers<br>
o theorem proving technology for theory exploration<br>
o integration of theories and tools<br>
o the formalisation and automation of mathematics<br>
o case studies/experiences<br>
o automated identification of key concepts and results<br>
o supporting collaborative theory exploration</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>
<p>o Robert L. Constable, Cornell University.<br>
o TBA</p>
<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>We invite submissions in 3 forms:</p>
<p>o Research papers, up to 10 pages;<br>
o System/tool descriptions, up to 5 pages;<br>
o Extended abstracts, up to 3 pages.</p>
<p>Research and tool papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>
elsewhere. Extended abstracts are intended to discuss ideas and work in progress.<br>
All papers will be reviewed by the programme committee.</p>
<p>Submissions must be in PDF using the LaTeX EasyChair-format<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip">http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip</a> . One author of each accepted submission<br>
is expected to present the paper at the workshop. Associated systems demos are<br>
encouraged, where appropriate.</p>
<p>Accepted research and tool papers will be published as CEUR Workshop Proceedings.</p>
<p>If quality and quantity of the submissions warrants this, we plan to publish a special issue<br>
of a recognized journal on the topic of the workshop.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>Submission: 3 April 2012<br>
Notification: 8 May, 2012<br>
Final version: 5 June, 2012<br>
Workshop: 30 June &amp; 1 July, 2012</p>
