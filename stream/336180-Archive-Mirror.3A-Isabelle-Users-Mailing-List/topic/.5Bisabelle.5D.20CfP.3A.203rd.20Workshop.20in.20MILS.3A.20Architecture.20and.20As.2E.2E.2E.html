Dear Isabelle-users,</p>
<p>as you know, MILS (Multiple Indepent Levels of Security/Safety) is about<br>
decomposing systems into components, that each have manageable <br>
security policies, which, for example, can be modelled in Isabelle/HOL<br>
(see e.g. Koolen/Schmaltz, "Modeling Information Routing with Noninterference", <br>
<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/47980">https://zenodo.org/record/47980</a>).</p>
<p>Please consider to submit an abstract or forward to potentially<br>
interested colleagues.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Holger</p>

<p>=====================================================================<br>
You are invited to submit your contribution to the International<br>
Workshop on MILS.</p>
<p>MILS* is a high-assurance security architecture based on the concepts of<br>
separation and controlled information flow. The MILS architectural<br>
approach is all about decomposition of a system design into<br>
well-understood components and their interactions with the goal to<br>
achieve composable architecture and composable assurance for the<br>
designed system. The composability of architecture and assurance  for<br>
secure systems is a grand challenge, which we undertake to meet using<br>
the MILS architectural approach.</p>
<p>Architecture composition defines a secure system from trustworthy<br>
components and system architecture. The MILS framework for composable<br>
architecture is based on a separation kernel (which has overlapping<br>
functionality with a hypervisor) that creates partitions to separate<br>
different security domains. Such a separation kernel often needs to<br>
support real-time because there are many use-cases in embedded systems.<br>
Assurance composition targets creating an assurance argument for the<br>
overall system from arguments of its components and the system's<br>
security architecture. The workshop also welcomes contributions on the<br>
industrial application of the MILS architecture, assurance and<br>
certification frameworks, attack methods and templates for MILS systems,<br>
as well as presenting the MILS  community.</p>
<p>Workshop topics:<br>
The workshop topics are but not limited to:
*   MILS architectural approach for security and safety
*   MILS components and eco-system
*   MLS systems and their relation to MILS systems
*   MILS use-cases, e.g. from avionics, automotive, communications,<br>
industrial automation, medical, railway, consumer and similar domains.
*   Real-time separation kernels
*   MILS evaluation and certification
*   MILS testing and vulnerability analysis of MILS systems
*   Application of novel and existing information flow models/policies
*   Cross-European/world-wide high-assurance security
*   Formal methods for MILS systems as a basis for high assurance</p>
<p>Abstract submission:<br>
This is a workshop and we are looking for interesting experience, work,<br>
and ideas (possibly preliminary and exploratory) that will stimulate<br>
discussion and thought around MILS concepts and challenges. At this<br>
stage, submissions are in the form of abstracts. Submission should<br>
clearly shows industrial relevance.</p>
<p>Submissions should be made via Embedded World online portal at<br>
<a href="http://www.embedded-world.eu/call-for-papers.html">http://www.embedded-world.eu/call-for-papers.html</a><br>
When submitting your abstract please choose contribution topic area<br>
"8.5 MILS: Architecture and Assurance for Secure and Safe Systems".<br>
Abstracts are submitted in plain text and must be 3000 characters max.<br>
(including white-space).</p>
<p>Slides/papers:<br>
If your abstract is accepted you will be invited to submit a<br>
paper/slides. Papers/slides of accepted talks will be published at<br>
conference proceedings (ISBN) and<br>
