<p>Geometry is one of most studied areas of mathematics and, though its <br>
role as a<br>
foundational system has evolved over time, it remains key to our <br>
understanding<br>
of many aspects of the world. It is one of the first areas to which <br>
Artificial<br>
Intelligence (AI) was applied and has remained the focus of much work in the<br>
field, giving rise to new mathematical concepts and techniques, heuristics,<br>
algorithms, and applications over the past fifty years. In view of the <br>
importance<br>
of geometry and the sustained advances in the field of computer-based <br>
geometric<br>
reasoning and its applications, the time seems ripe to take stock of the <br>
progress<br>
so far and look at some of the latest mathematical and AI-related <br>
advances in<br>
the field. Thus, we invite original contributions -- ranging from theory to<br>
implementations and applications -- and insightful surveys to a special <br>
issue of<br>
the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence on Geometric <br>
Reasoning.</p>
<p>Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automated and interactive theorem proving in geometry involving algebraic,<br>
   logical, and/or probabilistic approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Symbolic and numerical methods for geometric computation and constraint<br>
   solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formal verification of geometric algorithms, for instance in <br>
relation to<br>
   computational geometry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasoning and manipulation via diagrams, including approaches based on <br>
dynamic<br>
   geometry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The design, implementation, and evaluation of software for geometric <br>
reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge management and libraries of test problems for theorem proving in<br>
   geometry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applications to geometric modelling, CAGD/CAD, computer vision, <br>
robotics,<br>
   and education.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission</p>
<p>Prospective authors should follow the instructions set out by the Annals of<br>
Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence on its webpage<br>
(<a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10472">http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10472</a>) and submit their <br>
articles<br>

<p>Please note that the guest editors will first carry a quick assessment <br>
of each<br>
submission and only papers that are deemed relevant to the special issue <br>
and are<br>
of high enough quality will be forwarded to at least two referees for full,<br>
independent reviews.</p>
