<p>CONFERENCE SCOPE AND PUBLICATION</p>
<p>FMCAD 2017 is the seventeenth in a series of conferences on the theory and<br>
applications of formal methods in hardware and system verification. FMCAD<br>
provides a leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for<br>
presenting and discussing groundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical<br>
results, and tools for reasoning formally about computing systems. FMCAD<br>
covers formal aspects of computer-aided system design including verification,<br>
specification, synthesis, and testing.</p>
<p>FMCAD employs a rigorous peer-review process. Accepted papers are distributed<br>
through both ACM and IEEE digital libraries. In addition, published articles<br>
are made available freely on the conference page; the authors retain the<br>
copyright. There are no publication fees. At least one of the authors is<br>
required to register for the conference and present the accepted paper. A<br>
small number of outstanding FMCAD submissions will be considered for<br>
inclusion in a Special Issue of the journal on Formal Methods in System<br>
Design (FMSD).</p>
<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST</p>
<p>FMCAD welcomes submission of papers reporting original research on advances<br>
in all aspects of formal methods and their applications to computer-<br>
aided design. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>-- Model checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and<br>
   reduction, compositional methods, decision procedures at the bit- and<br>
   word-level, probabilistic methods, combinations of deductive methods and<br>
   decision procedures.</p>
<p>-- Synthesis and compilation for computer system descriptions, modeling,<br>
   specification, and implementation languages, formal semantics of<br>
   languages and their subsets, model-based design, design derivation and<br>
   transformation, correct-by-construction methods.</p>
<p>-- Application of formal and semi-formal methods to functional and<br>
   non-functional specification and validation of hardware and software,<br>
   including timing and power modeling, verification of computing systems<br>
   on all levels of abstraction, system-level design and verification for<br>
   embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, automotive systems and<br>
   other safety-critical systems, hardware-software co-design and<br>
   verification, and transaction-level verification.</p>
<p>-- Experience with the application of formal and semi-formal methods to<br>
   industrial-scale designs; tools that represent formal verification<br>
   enablement, new features, or a substantial improvement in the automation<br>
   of formal methods.</p>
<p>-- Application of formal methods to verifying safety, correctness,<br>
   connectivity, and security properties of networks and distributed<br>
   systems.</p>
<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmcad17">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmcad17</a></p>
<p>Two categories of papers are invited: Regular papers, and Tool &amp; Case Study<br>
papers. Regular papers are expected to offer novel foundational ideas,<br>
theoretical results, or algorithmic improvements to existing methods,<br>
along with experimental impact validation where applicable. Tool &amp; Case<br>
Study papers are expected to report on the design, implementation or use of<br>
verification (or related) technology in a practically relevant context<br>
(which need not be industrial), and its impact on design processes.</p>
<p>Both Regular and Tool &amp; Case study papers must use the IEEE Transactions<br>
format on letter-size paper with a 10-point font size. Regular papers can be<br>
up to 8 pages in length and tool papers up to 4 pages, although there<br>
is no requirement to fill all pages in either category. Authors will be<br>
required to select the appropriate paper category at abstract submission<br>
time. Submissions may contain an optional appendix, which will not appear<br>
in the final version of the paper. The reviewers should be able to assess<br>
the quality and the relevance of the results in the paper without reading<br>
the appendix.</p>
<p>Submissions in both categories must contain original research that has not<br>
been previously published, nor is concurrently submitted for publication.<br>
Any partial overlap with published or concurrently submitted papers must be<br>
clearly indicated. If experimental results are reported, authors are<br>
strongly encouraged to provide the reviewers access to their data at<br>
submission time, so that results can be independently verified.</p>
