<p>Paper submission: January 10, 2014<br>
Notification of acceptance: April 4, 2014<br>
Publication: Second half of 2014</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<hr>
<p>Symbolic Computation is the science of computing with symbolic objects <br>
(terms, formulae, programs, representations of algebraic objects etc.). <br>
Powerful symbolic algorithms and methods have been developed during the <br>
past decades like computer algebra, theorem proving, automated <br>
reasoning, software verification, model checking, rewriting, <br>
formalization of mathematics, Groebner bases, characteristic sets, <br>
telescoping for recurrence relations, cylindric algebraic decomposition <br>
and other quantifier elimination techniques, etc.</p>
<p>The purpose of this special issue is to promote research on theoretical <br>
and practical aspects of symbolic computation in software science. The <br>
special issue is related to the topics of the International Symposiums <br>
on Symbolic Computation in Software Science - SCSS 2013 and SCSS 2012. <br>
It will be published by Elsevier within the Journal of Symbolic Computation.</p>
<p>Participants of the SCSS 2013 and SCSS 2012 symposiums, as well as other <br>
authors are invited to submit contributions.</p>

journals or refereed conferences. Submissions will be peer-reviewed <br>

Computation.</p>
<p>Authors of papers presented at the SCSS 2013 and SCSS 2012 symposiums <br>

introduction addressing the following questions in succinct and informal <br>
manner:</p>
<p>- What is the problem?<br>
  - Why is the problem important?<br>
  - What has been done so far on the problem?<br>
