First Call for Papers:</p>
<p>Workshop on<br>
            Models for Formal Analysis of Real Systems<br>
                           (MARS 2017)</p>
<p>Affiliated With ETAPS 2017</p>
<p>April 29, 2017 Uppsala, Sweden</p>

<p>AIM:<br>
Logics and techniques for automated reasoning have often been<br>
developed with formal analysis and formal verification in mind.<br>
To show applicability, toy examples or tiny case studies are<br>
typically presented in research papers. Since the theory needs<br>
to be developed first, this approach is reasonable.<br>
 However, to show that a developed approach actually scales to<br>
real systems, large case studies are essential. The development<br>
of formal models of real systems usually requires a perfect<br>
understanding of informal descriptions of the system—sometimes<br>
found in RFCs or other standard documents—which are usually just<br>
written in English. Based on the type of system, an adequate<br>
specification formalism needs to be chosen, and the informal<br>
specification translated into it. Abstraction from unimportant<br>
details then yields an accurate, formal model of the real system.<br>
 The process of developing a detailed and accurate model usually<br>
takes a large amount of time, often months or years; without even<br>
starting a formal analysis. When publishing the results on a formal<br>
analysis in a scientific paper, details of the model have to be skipped<br>
due to lack of space, and often the lessons learnt from modelling are<br>
not discussed since they are not the main focus of the paper.<br>
 The workshop aims at discussing exactly these unmentioned lessons.<br>
Examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which formalism is chosen, and why?</li>
<li>Which abstractions have to be made and why?</li>
<li>How are important characteristics of the system modelled?</li>
<li>Were there any complications while modelling the system?</li>
<li>Which measures were taken to guarantee the accuracy of the model?</li>
</ul>
<p>The workshop emphasises modelling over verification. In particular,<br>
we invite papers that present full Models of Real Systems, which may<br>
lay the basis for future formal analysis. The workshop will bring<br>
together researchers from different communities that all aim at verifying<br>
real systems and are developing formal models for such systems. Areas where<br>
large models often occur are within networks, (trustworthy) systems and<br>
software verification (from byte code up to programming- and specification<br>
languages). An aim of the workshop is to present different modelling<br>
approaches and discuss pros and cons for each of them.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION:</p>
<p>Submissions must be unpublished and not be submitted for publication elsewhere.<br>
Contributions are limited to 8 pages EPTCS style (not counting the appendices),<br>
but shorter extended abstracts are welcome. Appendices (of arbitrary length) can<br>
be used to present all details of a formalised model; the appendices will be part<br>
of the proceedings. In case a formal model is presented that is modelled in some<br>
formalism or tool, such as timed automata for Uppaal or formal proofs for Isabelle/HOL,<br>
these models have to be submitted as well. They will be published as part of the<br>
proceedings, and will be made available in our Repository of Models for Formal<br>
Analysis of Real Systems (<a href="http://mars-workshop.org/repository.html">http://mars-workshop.org/repository.html</a>).<br>
Submissions must be in English and submitted in PDF format via EasyChair<br>
(<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mars2017">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mars2017</a>).<br>
 All submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three referees based on their<br>
novelty, relevance and technical merit. The proceedings (including the electronic<br>
models) will be published as part of the open access series Electronic Proceedings<br>
in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).</p>
