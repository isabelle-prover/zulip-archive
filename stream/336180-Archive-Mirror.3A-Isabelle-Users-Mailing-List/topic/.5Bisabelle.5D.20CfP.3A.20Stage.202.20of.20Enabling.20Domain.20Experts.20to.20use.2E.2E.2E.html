<p>SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 14 January</p>
<p>This symposium is motivated by the long-term VISION of making information<br>
systems dependable.  In the past even mis-represented units of<br>
measurements caused fatal ENGINEERING disasters.  In ECONOMICS, the<br>
subtlety of issues involved in good auction design may have led to low<br>
revenues in auctions of public goods such as the 3G radio spectra.<br>
Similarly, banks' value-at-risk (VaR) models – the leading method of<br>
financial risk measurement – are too large and change too quickly to be<br>
thoroughly vetted by hand, the current state of the art; in the London<br>
Whale incident of 2012, JP Morgan claimed that its exposures were $67mn<br>
under one of its VaR models, and $129 under another one.  Verifying a<br>
model's properties requires formally specifying them; for VaR models, any<br>
work would have to start with this most basic step, as regulators' current<br>
desiderata are subjective and ambiguous.</p>
<p>We believe that these problems can be addressed by representing the<br>
knowledge underlying such models and mechanisms in a formal, explicit,<br>
machine-verifiable way.  Contemporary computer science offers a wide<br>
choice of knowledge representation languages well supported by<br>
verification tools.  Such tools have been successfully applied, e.g., for<br>
verifying software that controls commuter rail or payment systems (cf. the<br>
symposium homepage for further background).  Still, DOMAIN EXPERTS without<br>
a strong computer science background find it challenging to choose the<br>
right tools and to use them.  This symposium aims at investigating ways to<br>
support them.  Some problems can be addressed now, others will bring new<br>
challenges to computer science.</p>
<p>General TOPICS of interest include:</p>
<p>* for DOMAIN EXPERTS: what problems in application domains could benefit<br>
    from better verification and knowledge management facilities?<br>
    Possible fields include:</p>
<p>* Example 1 (economics):<br>
      auctions, VaR, trading algorithms, market design</p>
<p>* Example 2 (engineering):<br>
      system interoperability, manufacturing processes, product<br>
classification</p>
<p>* for COMPUTER SCIENTISTS: how to provide the right knowledge management<br>
    and verification tools to domain experts without a computer science<br>
    background?</p>
<p>* wikis and blogs for informal, semantic, semiformal, and formal<br>
      mathematical knowledge;</p>
<p>* general techniques and tools for online collaborative mathematics;<br>
    * tools for collaboratively producing, presenting, publishing, and<br>
      interacting with online mathematics;</p>
<p>* automation and computer-human interaction aspects of mathematical<br>
      wikis;</p>
<p>* ontologies and knowledge bases designed to support knowledge<br>
      management and verification in application domains;</p>
<p>* practical experiences, usability aspects, feasibility studies;<br>
    * evaluation of existing tools and experiments;<br>
    * requirements, user scenarios and goals.</p>
<p>We particularly invite submissions that address the problems or that apply<br>
the tools presented in the papers submitted for stage 1 (see "submission"<br>
below).</p>
<p>THE SYMPOSIUM is designed to bring domain experts and formalisers into<br>
close and fruitful contact with each other: domain experts will be able to<br>
present their fields and problems to formalisers; formalisers will be<br>
exposed to new and challenging problem areas. We will combine talks and<br>
hands-on sessions to ensure close interaction among participants from both<br>
sides.</p>
<p>World-class economists will offer dedicated HANDS-ON SESSIONS on the<br>
following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Market design and matching problems (Utku Ünver, Boston College): These<br>
  include matching students to schools, interns to hospitals, and kidney<br>
  donors to recipients.  See the documentation for the 2012 Nobel Memorial<br>
  Prize in Economic Sciences for more background information<br>
  (<a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2012/">http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2012/</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auctions (Peter Cramton, University of Maryland): Peter works on<br>
  auctions for ICANN (the ‘knock out’ domain name auctions), Ofcom UK (4G<br>
  spectrum auction), the UK Department of the Environment and Climate<br>
  Change, and others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finance (Neels Vosloo, Financial Services Authority UK): It is currently<br>
  impossible for regulators to properly inspect either risk management<br>
  models, or algorithmic trading platforms.  To what extent can techniques<br>
  from mechanised reasoning automate some of the inspection process?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>We solicit submissions on any of the TOPICS outlined initially but prefer<br>
submissions that specifically address topics identified in the earlier<br>
submission Stage 1.  In Stage 1 we had solicited</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>from DOMAIN EXPERTS descriptions of "nails": canonical models and<br>
  problems in their domain that might benefit from better verification and<br>
  knowledge management facilities.  Descriptions should focus on aspects<br>
  of these models that domain users find particularly problematic, and<br>
  suspect might be aided by formalisation tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from COMPUTER SCIENTISTS descriptions of "hammers": formalisation,<br>
  verification and knowledge management tools, with an emphasis on how<br>
  they could be applied in a concrete real-world setting, or tailored to<br>
  such application domains.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Commented versions of these submissions are now online at<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/events/aisb2013/stage1.php">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/events/aisb2013/stage1.php</a>.<br>
A tool whose description is submitted to Stage 2 could, e.g., be motivated<br>
with a Stage 1 problem, and sketch how the tool could, or will, be applied<br>
in this domain.  Each submission will be refereed by three PC members on<br>
average.  Submissions will be judged based on the PC's views of the<br>
likelihood of contributing to a better matching of hammers (formalisation<br>
and verification tools) to nails (domain problems).</p>
<p>At this stage we accept PDF submissions in any layout but count 1200 words<br>
as one page for fair comparison.  We invite research and position papers,<br>
as well as tool and system descriptions, from 3 to 10 pages.  Besides PDFs<br>
we invite the submission of formalised knowledge representations with<br>
human-readable annotations.</p>
<p>To submit a paper, please go to the Do-Form EasyChair page<br>
(<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=doform2013">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=doform2013</a>) and follow the<br>
instructions for Stage 2 there.</p>
<p>FINAL VERSIONS</p>
<p>Final versions should be prepared in LaTeX according to the AISB<br>
formatting guidelines linked from the symposium homepage.  For the final<br>
version, non-PDF submissions should be accompanied by a PDF abstract of 2<br>
to 4 pages.  Electronic proceedings (with an ISBN) will be made available<br>
to the convention delegates on a memory stick, and on the AISB website.</p>
<p>Given a sufficient number of high-quality submissions, we will invite<br>
authors to submit revised and extended versions to a SPECIAL ISSUE of a<br>
relevant JOURNAL.  (E.g., co-chair Manfred Kerber is on the editorial<br>
board of Mathematics in Computer Science.)</p>
