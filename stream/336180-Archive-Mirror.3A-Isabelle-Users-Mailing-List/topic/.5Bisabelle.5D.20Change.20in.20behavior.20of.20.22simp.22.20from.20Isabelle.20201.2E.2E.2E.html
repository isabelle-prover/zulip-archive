<p>From: "Eugene W. Stark" &lt;<a href="mailto:isabelle-users@starkeffect.com">isabelle-users@starkeffect.com</a>&gt;<br>
After downloading Isabelle2015 and loading into it the theory files<br>
I had been working on under Isabelle2014 only two proofs broke, but<br>
the reason is a behavior of Isabelle2015 that seems to make life more<br>
difficult in certain respects than Isabelle2014.</p>
<p>After getting started with Isabelle not too long ago, I settled into<br>
a mode of use in which I often state the fact I am trying to prove,<br>
enter a "using xxx yyy zzz ..." clause with as many of the lemmas that<br>
I am reasonably certain are relevant to the proof, and then invoke<br>
"try" to try to see if the fact can be proved automatically, and as<br>
a byproduct to learn about relevant lemmas from various theories in Main<br>
which I would otherwise have a hard time locating.</p>
<p>With Isabelle2015, I have so far experienced a number of times the situation<br>
in which I enter "using foobar_def", then invoke "try" and am told<br>
"Try this: by (simp add: foobar_def)".  Previously in Isabelle2014 it generally<br>
seemed to be enough to say "using foobar_def by simp", but now in Isabelle2015<br>
it is often necessary to explicitly add foobar_def as a simplification.<br>
The point is, I already know that foobar_def is going to be needed in the proof,<br>
but I don't necessarily know that it will have to be used as a simplification.<br>
Also, as far as I know, the "using" clause does not provide a way to indicate<br>
which of the facts being used are to be used as simplifications, as opposed<br>
to ordinary lemmas.</p>
<p>Was this change in behavior intentional?  Is there a workaround?<br>
If necessary, I will try to get a standalone example, but I don't have one<br>
just now.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

The intention is always to get things more right and more clear than <br>
before.  In the long run (of almost 30 years) this has usually worked out, <br>
but sometimes there are set-backs.</p>
<p>Concerning this particular detail, their might be some re-adjustments in <br>
the 'try' command that Jasmin Blanchette could explain.</p>
<p>As a general principle, 'using' does not say anything specific yet.  It <br>
merely hands over certain facts as primary agument to subsequent proof <br>
method.  The automated methods (simp, blast, auto, etc.) all work the <br>
same in this respect: the facts are inserted (using the "insert" method <br>
internally), and then they do their normal business on the augmented goal <br>
state.</p>
<p>The latter poses a logical problem, because the logic (and thus the core <br>
goal state) cannot handle schematic types as truly general types -- there <br>
is no type-quantifier in Isabelle/Pure nor Isabelle/HOL.  This means, <br>
facts inserted into a goal state are instantiated 0 or at most 1 times.</p>
<p>This makes a technical difference for the following:</p>
<p>have something<br>
     using foo_def by simp   -- "unreliable in the presence of polymorphism"</p>
<p>versus:</p>
<p>have something<br>
     by (simp add: foo_def)  -- "canonical use of arbitrary rewrite rule"</p>
<p>have something<br>
     unfolding foo_def by simp</p>
<p>Maybe that is what you experience, but you did not show any concrete <br>
examples.</p>

While this mode of proving works, you will get better results if you<br>
learn the more directed ways of passing lemmas to proof tools: e.g.,<br>
simplification, introduction, elimination and destruction rules. This<br>
also has the advantage that you can declare them to be used<br>
automatically by proof tools (using the [simp], [intro], ... attributes).</p>
<p>With Isabelle2015, I have so far experienced a number of times the situation<br>
in which I enter "using foobar_def", then invoke "try" and am told<br>
"Try this: by (simp add: foobar_def)". Previously in Isabelle2014 it generally<br>

I am pretty sure that there was no change in Isabelle 2015 which would<br>
change this behaviour in general. However, as simp rules and facts<br>
inserted by "using" are treated differently by the simplifier, it is no<br>
surprise that these sometimes lead to different results -- neither of<br>
these methods is strictly more powerful then the other.<br>
The point is, I already know that foobar_def is going to be needed in the proof,<br>
but I don't necessarily know that it will have to be used as a simplification.<br>
For a definition, anything else would be surprising (in most cases) ;)<br>
Also, as far as I know, the "using" clause does not provide a way to indicate<br>
which of the facts being used are to be used as simplifications, as opposed<br>
to ordinary lemmas.<br>
For most of the (automated) proof methods, "using" does nothing else<br>
then insert the fact into the goal, e.g.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>have "P" using <code>Q</code> apply simp</p>
<p>leads to the simplifier trying to solve "Q ==&gt; P". On the other hand,<br>
facts passed by (e.g.) "simp:" will not become part of the goal.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this makes "using" more powerful: Whereas a fact passed by<br>
"simp:" will be used as-is (modulo some restricted preprocessing), the<br>
assumptions of a subgoal will be simplified before they are used for<br>
rewriting. This might help if the fact is not in normal form:</p>
<p>notepad begin<br>
    fix P :: "nat =&gt; bool"<br>
    assume *: "P 1"<br>
    have "P (2 - 1)"<br>
       apply (simp add: <em>)        (</em> does not solve, leaves P (Suc 0) *)<br>
       using * apply simp         (* solves, as P 1 is simplified to P<br>
(Suc 0) *)<br>
       done</p>
<p>It might also make "using" weaker:</p>
<p>definition P :: "'a =&gt; bool" where "P x = True"</p>
<p>notepad begin<br>
    fix x :: 'a and y :: 'b<br>
    have "P x = P y"<br>
      by (simp add: P_def)      (* works *)<br>
    have "P x = P y "<br>
      using P_def apply simp sorry  (* fails, unfolds only one P *)<br>
    have "P x = P y"<br>
      using P_def P_def by simp      (* works *)</p>
<p>The reason is that Isabelle can not quantify over types. Polymorphic<br>
facts are represented using schematic type variables. But these can only<br>
be instantiated once.</p>
<p>Similar things happen also for other automated tools.</p>
