<p>From: "W. Douglas Maurer" &lt;<a href="mailto:maurer@gwu.edu">maurer@gwu.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Before Isabelle2014 came out, I put together a write-up for my <br>
students, based on Isabelle2013, which, among other things, covered <br>
entering special characters using the tab key. For example, you could <br>
enter &lt;= followed by the tab key and the single less-than-or-equal <br>
character would come up on the screen. In Isabelle2014, this is <br>
improved; you just type &lt;= without the tab key and the single <br>
character comes up. That is helpful, and I will change my write-up to <br>
reflect that. (In particular, this is faster than finding the proper <br>
button in the Symbols panel and clicking that.)<br>
However, I now find that some of the other uses of the tab key don't <br>
work any more. In particular, I used to be able to type colon-tab to <br>
get the is-a-member-of character, and that doesn't work in <br>
Isabelle2014. If I hover over the button for that character in the <br>
Symbols panel, the only abbreviation that shows there is the colon <br>
character. I could still type \&lt;in&gt;, but doing that would not be <br>
faster than finding the button for is-a-member-of and clicking on it.<br>
The same problem arises for other characters, such as ! tab to get <br>
the forall character, and ? tab to get the exists character. I can <br>
still use ALL tab to get the forall character, but EX tab (for the <br>
exists character) doesn't work.<br>
Another problem (for which there is a workaround) would arise if I <br>
wanted to enter the string "&lt;=" . If I enter this directly, the &lt;= <br>
automatically converts to the single less-than-or-equal character. <br>
The workaround is to type "=" and then go back and insert the &lt; <br>
character before it. That does work, but it's clumsy.<br>
Other systems that I have used employ a convention here, involving <br>
the backspace (or delete) character. For example, when I type a row <br>
of asterisks on my word processing program, and then hit return, the <br>
asterisks convert to a row of small black squares. This looks nice, <br>
but, if I don't want this, I can immediately hit backspace, and the <br>
row of asterisks will reappear. I would like to be able to do this <br>
with &lt;= (so I would type &lt;= backspace and it would give me the two <br>
characters &lt; and = whether inside quotes or not).</p>

<p>If you want you can show me the write-up, so that I see what kind of <br>
really important information needs to be given in the Isabelle/jEdit <br>
manual.</p>

<p>Did you see the extended section "3.5 Completion" of the Isabelle/jEdit <br>
manual?</p>
<p>If there is anything missing or unclear in the text, I am ready to listen.</p>
<p>If there is anything missing or unclear in the concepts and their <br>
implementation, particular points might get queued in the pipeline (the <br>
metaphorical one one that leads from Central Asia to Europe).</p>

<p>I guess that above you merely experience the effect of the semantic <br>
context of completion in Isabelle2014.  It should work as expected, if you type<br>
into a term context, e.g. via the Isar command 'term' like this:</p>
<p>term ""<br>
         ^ now type text here, after waiting a bit</p>

<p>That is the same situation.</p>

<p>You can use "undo" of the editor to undo the completion, as explained in <br>
the "jedit" manual.</p>
