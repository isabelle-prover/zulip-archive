Hallo,</p>
<p>I just noticed that the "power" function is exported as</p>
<p>power :: forall a. (Power a) =&gt; a -&gt; Nat -&gt; a;<br>
power a n =<br>
   (if equal_nat n zero_nat then one<br>
     else times a (power a (minus_nat n one_nat)));</p>
<p>This looks pretty inefficient to me; something like iterated squaring <br>
should be much faster, and it's pretty easy to do. However, this only <br>
works in the type class mult_monoid; power, on the other hand, is <br>
defined in the type class "power". (the difference is essentially that <br>
the latter does not demand associativity, if I am not mistaken)</p>
<p>Is it still possible to use the more efficient iterative squaring when <br>
applicable? I attached something using code_unfold, but I'm not sure if <br>
that really does what one would want it to do.</p>
<p>Moreover, for rational numbers, one could optimise this even futher: <br>
multiplication on rational numbers reduces the numerator and denominator <br>
after the multiplication. In the case of "power", this is unnecessary, <br>
since the numerator and denominator of the result will always be coprime <br>
if they were coprime before. Perhaps this would be a worthwhile <br>
optimisation?</p>
<p>Lastly, I was wondering whether there was something like "divmod" in <br>
Isabelle, i.e. an operation that returns both the quotient and the <br>
remainder, since most languages have a corresponding operation that is <br>
more efficient than computing the two separately.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

Dear Manuel,</p>

mult_monoid assumes associativity of and neutrality of 1 for times. power does not impose <br>
any constraints; it is a superclass of mult_monoid.</p>

<blockquote>

want it to do.<br>
The code_unfold works if the call to power in the code equations is types with something <br>
of sort mult_monoid. So if the code equation uses power on one of the standard numeric <br>
types, everything is fine. But if you use power polymorphically for some 'a, then this <br>
does not work if mult_monoid is not a supersort of 'a's sort. For example, if you have <br>
something like</p>
</blockquote>
<p>definition map_power :: "'a :: power list =&gt; 'a list"<br>
   where "map_power = map power"</p>
<p>then if you use map_power, you will end up with the original slow implementation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, for rational numbers, one could optimise this even futher: multiplication on<br>
rational numbers reduces the numerator and denominator after the multiplication. In the<br>
case of "power", this is unnecessary, since the numerator and denominator of the result<br>
will always be coprime if they were coprime before. Perhaps this would be a worthwhile<br>
optimisation?<br>
Custom implementations for power are not possible with the current setup. You can have <br>
type-dependent implementations for a function only if that function is a type class <br>
parameter (unless you play some sophisticated tricks like in the Containers AFP entry). <br>
 From what I can see, it does not seem reasonable to make power a type class parameter, <br>
because then power cannot be a superclass of mult_monoid any more (you'd have to add power <br>
as a type class parameter to the whole algebraic type class hierarchy). But you could <br>
achieve something similar like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>class power_impl = power +<br>
   fixes power_impl :: "'a =&gt; nat =&gt; 'a"<br>
   assumes power_impl: "power = power_impl"</p>
<p>declare power_impl [code]</p>
<p>Then, of course, you have to instantiate the new class power_impl for all types that <br>
instantiate power and all users have to do the same for their own types. Unfortunately, we <br>
do not (yet) have a mechanism to instantiate such definitional type classes automatically. <br>
With this approach, you could declare custom code equations for instances like rat.</p>

<p>Lastly, I was wondering whether there was something like "divmod" in Isabelle, i.e. an<br>
operation that returns both the quotient and the remainder, since most languages have a<br>
corresponding operation that is more efficient than computing the two separately.<br>
There are various specialised divmod constants in HOL, e.g., divmod_integer, <br>
semiring_numeral_div_class.divmod and Divides.divmod_nat, but no systematic, algebraic <br>
treatment.</p>

I guess that's a pretty good compromise, isn't it? Most of the time, <br>
exported code using the "power" operation will probably be dealing with <br>
types that fulfil at least monoid_mult, and then this fast variant could <br>
be used.</p>
<p>Perhaps this should be put in the library?</p>

Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>I think that this can work for power, but it can also lead to surprises because the <br>
rewrite does not trigger always and users then have to understand the whole setup to find <br>
out. I had experimented with such rewrites for subset tests (end of theory <br>
Library/Cardinality), but this never worked as well as I had hoped, because the rewrite <br>
needed the sort card_UNIV, which was hardly present in any code equation.</p>
<p>René Thiemann and Christian Sternagel faced the same problem for linorders and <br>
comparators. They have implemented a custom function in ML that transforms the code <br>
equations, but users have to call this manually (see their ITP2015 paper). This approach <br>
is less convenient, but more robust.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

Dear Manuel,</p>
<p>If you care about efficiency, you might also have a look at improved code equations for divmod, e.g., under</p>

<p>for Isabelle 2015</p>
