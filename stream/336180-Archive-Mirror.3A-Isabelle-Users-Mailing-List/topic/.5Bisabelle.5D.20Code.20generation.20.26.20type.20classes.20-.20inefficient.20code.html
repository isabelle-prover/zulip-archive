<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>Generation of ML code from Isabelle mimics type classes by passing <br>
around explicit records containing the functions specific to the type class.</p>
<p>E.g., you might get a function "inner_product A_ a b = map (#times A_) <br>
(zip a b)" (roughly).</p>
<p>This works well, however, I noticed that the resulting code can be very <br>
inefficient because the same records are constructed over and over. For <br>
example, the term "[enumhd,enumhd,enumhd,enumhd,enumhd,enumhd] :: <br>
(bool<em>bool</em>bool<em>bool</em>bool) list" (where enumhd is some constant we <br>
defined using typeclass enum, the details are immaterial here) generates <br>
the code</p>
<p>val code = [ enumhd<br>
      (Enum.enum_prod Enum.enum_bool<br>
        (Enum.enum_prod Enum.enum_bool<br>
          (Enum.enum_prod Enum.enum_bool<br>
            (Enum.enum_prod Enum.enum_bool Enum.enum_bool)))),</p>
<p>... repeated six times ... ]</p>
<p>(Demonstrated in the attached Scratch.thy)</p>
<p>The effect of this is two-fold:</p>
<p>* The generated code becomes much longer and thus compiles potentially<br>
    very slowly (I had a term in my application that was ~2500 lines of<br>
    code, and became ~150 lines after removing the repeated type class<br>
    generation code. The 2500 lines took ~40-60 seconds to compile which<br>
    means that a simple "by eval" takes that long.)</p>
<p>* A runtime overhead is incurred. E.g., the Enum.enum_prod function<br>
    above is internally producing products of lists over an over again.<br>
    This could be prohibitive if the Enum.enum_prod (or similar) occurs<br>
    in a function that is used in a loop.</p>
<p>I would have expected code like this:</p>
<p>val code = let val enum1 = (Enum.enum_prod Enum.enum_bool<br>
            (Enum.enum_prod Enum.enum_bool<br>
              (Enum.enum_prod Enum.enum_bool<br>
                (Enum.enum_prod Enum.enum_bool Enum.enum_bool))))</p>
<p>val enumhd1 = enumhd enum1</p>
<p>in [enumhd1,enumhd1,enumhd1,enumhd1,enumhd1,enumhd1] end</p>
<p>This would compute every class only once (and if enumhd creates <br>
typeclasses, this would also be done only once during the computation of <br>
enumhd1).</p>
<p>(The general case would be: "f::args=&gt;result" becomes "fun f <br>
&lt;typeclasses&gt; = let &lt;compute type classes and instantiate constants&gt; in <br>
fn args =&gt; &lt;code&gt; end". This way, invoking "val f1 = f &lt;typeclasses&gt;" <br>
already computes all recursively type classes, and then "f1 args" can be <br>
used several times without recomputing the type classes.)</p>
<p>My questions:</p>
<p>* Is there a way to tell the code generator to do things more<br>
    efficiently? (E.g., the way I described.)</p>
<p>* Perhaps future versions of the code generator could do this? (I<br>
    don't know if the code generator is still being developed.)</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.<br>

<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Florian,</p>
<p>thank you for your suggestions. Unfortunately, after a lot of <br>
experiments I conclude that both approaches do not work in my case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma [code]:<br>
   ‹f x = let e = (enum :: …) in …›</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have written a conversation that does this automatically and added it <br>
to the codegeneration preprocessor. While that works (meaning, the code <br>
resulting code, by manual inspection, has less duplication), it does not <br>
help if the subgoal that is to be solved by "by eval" is large and thus <br>
contains a lot of recomputation of type classes. (In my case, the <br>
subgoal is the result from running the simplifier and there is no way to <br>
manually make a better subgoal.) I tried applying the aforementioned <br>
conversion directly to the subgoal (via "apply (tactic ...)") but <br>
applied to that eval just fails without error message (which is <br>
surprising since the goal before conversion could be solved by eval, <br>
albeit slowly). (I also tried "by normalization" which, to my surprise, <br>
gives an exception related to the allocation of a string above the <br>
maximum supported size.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>definition min_int :: ‹int =&gt; int =&gt; int›<br>
   [code_abbrev]: "min_int = min"</p>
<p>lemma [code]:<br>
   "min_int k l = …"<br>
This approach does not work because there are a lot of different types <br>
that occur. (I am working with typed matrices, so types would be, e.g., <br>
"('a,'b) bounded" (standing for bounded operator) with 'a,'b ranging <br>
over a number of different types like bit, bit<em>bit, bit</em>(bit*bit), <br>
(bit<em>bit)</em>bit etc. even within a single calculation (tensor products are <br>
involved).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, my conclusion is that I see nothing that can be done on the <br>
user level. To the best of my understanding, a change in the serializer <br>
would be the best solution (because an inspection of the thingol values <br>
that are produced do not compute the type class instances, this happens <br>
after serialization). I assume that these inefficiencies will crop up <br>
whenever whenever the enum type class is used, although possibly not to <br>
as extreme a degree as in my case. (It may be that most use cases will <br>
therefore not suffer from this.)</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

Hi Dominique,</p>
<p>I was not aware that you are using the eval method here.</p>
<p>Maybe something can be done by avoiding enum somehow altogether; is your<br>
specification somewhere available for inspection?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Florian,</p>
<p>sorry, I wasn't clear about my use of eval...</p>
<p>Yes, the code is available on GitHub. But it is part of a rather complex <br>
whole.</p>
<p>The repository is <a href="https://github.com/dominique-unruh/qrhl-tool">https://github.com/dominique-unruh/qrhl-tool</a>, the most <br>
recent commit (6978604) shows the problem.</p>
<p>The file with the problematic eval is examples/Teleport_Terse.thy <br>
(besides others).</p>
<p>The types on which I operate (('a,'b) Bounded and 'a linear_space) are <br>
defined in Bounded_Operators.thy and Complex_Inner_Product.thy, <br>
respectively (in the submodule isabelle-thys/Bounded_Operators).</p>
<p>Those types represent bounded operators from Hilbert space 'a to Hilbert <br>
space 'b, and closed subspaces of 'a, respectively. Furthermore, a <br>
concrete Hilbert space is 'a ell2 (for any type 'a), the type of square <br>
summable functions 'a=&gt;complex.</p>
<p>This is the general setting. In the specific case where 'a,'b are finite <br>
(more specifically, enum), ('a ell2,'b ell2) Bounded can be represented <br>
by matrices (and 'a ell2 subspace as a span of vectors).  For this <br>
specific case, I developed the theory QRHL_Code.thy to automate <br>
computations in this finite case (using the matrix code from <br>
AFP/Jordan_Normal_Form under the hood). Since the types Bounded and <br>
linear_space are not just for the finite case but a general theory of <br>
Hilbert spaces (and similar), I cannot replace them by something simpler <br>
just for the sake of code generation (e.g., the goal in <br>
Teleport_Terse.thy is a verification condition that arises from the <br>
semantics of a quantum language).</p>
<p>The line "apply (simp add: prepare_for_code)" rewrites the verification <br>
condition (which is not directly computable because it refers to <br>
operators operating on variables in an infinite-dimensional quantum <br>
memory) into an expression involving only operators on finite <br>
dimensional Hilbert spaces. Unfortunately, this rewriting leads to a <br>
very large term because a lot of auxiliary operators are introduced to <br>
"move" the applied operations to the right quantum variables (operators <br>
for swapping registers and for "doing associativity").</p>
<p>The resulting eval then struggles with a very large term. But most of <br>
the runtime for compiling and running the code actually comes from the <br>
duplication. (This I know because I tried generating the code for that <br>
subgoal using export_code, and then edited the code manually to avoid <br>
duplications, and the result was much shorter and faster.)</p>
<p>I have tried the following solutions:</p>
<p>* Writing simplification rules that rewrite the monster goal into one<br>
    that directly uses only the operations from AFP/Jordan_Normal_Form<br>
    (i.e., direct matrix operations). That is, I don't have any code<br>
    equations for Bounded and linear_space any more. I committed this in<br>
    branch experiment-code-rewrite. Unfortunately, this leads to a term<br>
    that contains lots of enum-constructions again, and running eval on<br>
    that term takes ages (or doesn't terminate). Also, even if that<br>
    approach would work, it is somewhat unsatisfactory because it means<br>
    that, if the enduser of my theories writes a new definition of a<br>
    function involving operators (e.g., definition square x = x * x),<br>
    then they have to also add a simplification rule for expanding it.<br>
    The automatic "[code]" that is part of the definition command won't<br>
    work.</p>
<p>* I wrote a conversion that removed duplications from terms (using<br>
    let) and applied it to the monster subgoal. I committed this in<br>
    branch experiment-code-hacks. This has two problems: First, the code<br>
    does not get much better because I can only avoid duplication it the<br>
    same constant is reused, but not if different constants use the same<br>
    type class. Second, it doesn't work: "by eval" fails without giving<br>
    an error message (even though before applying the conversion, by<br>
    eval succeeded). And "by normalization" (which is usually a goto<br>
    point for debugging failing "by eval"s) fails with "exception Size<br>
    raised (line 171 of "./basis/LibrarySupport.sml")" which if I am not<br>
    mistaken, means that it tries to allocate a very large string.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

A few things I forgot to mention:</p>
<p>* There is a lot of Scala code etc in that repository, but for the<br>
    problem at hand, only the Isabelle theories are relevant (in<br>
    isabelle-thys, isabelle-thys/Bounded_Operators, examples).</p>
<p>* The root of the repository contains a ROOTS file that can be used to<br>
    open all those theories in Isabelle/jEdit.</p>
<p>* The theories assume Isabelle2019, and AFP should be configured.<br>
    (Tested with RC4)</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>
