Hi Andreas,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the test data is not an Isabelle constant, the most<br>
prominent example are literal numbers like "42 :: code_numeral".<br>
However, export_code and its ML equivalent only accept constants, not<br>
general terms like "42". Therefore, we'd like to know how we can<br>
generate code for such terms.</p>
<p>We had a look at how "value [code]" achieves to evaluate arbitrary<br>
terms. After studying the sources, it seems to us that<br>
Code_Thingol.ensure_value does the necessary wrapping by introducing a<br>
code dependency "dummy_pattern = &lt;term to evaluate&gt;", then builds the<br>
code graph and removes "dummy_pattern" and the dependency again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This<br>
looks a bit hacky (I don't see a way to generalise this to multiple<br>
terms to evaluate) and uses lots of functions that Code_Thingol does not<br>
export.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first half of this sentence is the reason for the second half ;-).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had to do it manually, we would define constants for the arguments<br>
and feed them to the export_code command. However, in an automated<br>
system, our asynchronous testing command then would become a theory<br>
transformation that pollutes the name space if many test cases are run.<br>
Is there a simpler solution? For example, making a bunch of definitions<br>
solely for the invocation of the code generator that are forgotton<br>
afterwards again?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AFAIK, quickcheck achieves a similar effect by forking the theory,<br>
adding definitions (or even axiomatizations), generating code and<br>
throwing it away afterwards.  If I understand right, your business is<br>
also about testing, so this should also be applicable to your scenario.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>

Hi Florian,</p>
<p>We have been unable to find these temporary definitions in Quickcheck. The three <br>
generators random, exhaustive and narrowing package everything that is needed for testing <br>
in in a single term. Then, they call some version of Code_Thingol.dynamic_value which uses <br>
Code_Target.ensure_value to get the intermediate representation of the generated code. <br>
Finally, they run the code either with the usual mechanism from Code_Runtime or with <br>
Narrowing_Generators.value.</p>
<p>In principle, we could also stuff all our data into a large single term and then decompose <br>
it in the generated test driver again. Do you recommend that we follow this way? Or do you <br>
think that separate definitions are superior?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Andreas</p>

<p>this was my slip, I have been referring to the predicate compiler<br>

<p>The approach with a big tuple seems suitable, indeed.</p>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch">andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>We are trying to implement an evaluation system for Isabelle2013-2 that can generate code <br>
in different target languages, run generated functions on some input data, and process the <br>
result. Our goal is to automate testing of adaptations of the code generator setup <br>
(code_printing). To that end, we would like the code generator to generate the function to <br>
test and the test data.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the test data is not an Isabelle constant, the most prominent example are <br>
literal numbers like "42 :: code_numeral". However, export_code and its ML equivalent only <br>
accept constants, not general terms like "42". Therefore, we'd like to know how we can <br>
generate code for such terms.</p>
<p>We had a look at how "value [code]" achieves to evaluate arbitrary terms. After studying <br>
the sources, it seems to us that Code_Thingol.ensure_value does the necessary wrapping by <br>
introducing a code dependency "dummy_pattern = &lt;term to evaluate&gt;", then builds the code <br>
graph and removes "dummy_pattern" and the dependency again. This looks a bit hacky (I <br>
don't see a way to generalise this to multiple terms to evaluate) and uses lots of <br>
functions that Code_Thingol does not export. So, I wonder whether that is one way to go.</p>
<p>If we had to do it manually, we would define constants for the arguments and feed them to <br>
the export_code command. However, in an automated system, our asynchronous testing command <br>
then would become a theory transformation that pollutes the name space if many test cases <br>
are run. Is there a simpler solution? For example, making a bunch of definitions solely <br>
for the invocation of the code generator that are forgotton afterwards again?</p>
<p>Or are there simpler solutions that we have overlooked?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions and ideas,<br>
Andreas</p>
