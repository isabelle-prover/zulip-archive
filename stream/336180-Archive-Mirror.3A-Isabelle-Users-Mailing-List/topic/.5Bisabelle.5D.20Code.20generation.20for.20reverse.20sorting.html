Dear all,</p>
<p>for those of you who do not regularly check stackoverflow but might have<br>
an answer to my question there (yes I am looking at you Florian ;) ) I'm<br>
brazenly posting the link to my question here</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/32926842/476803">http://stackoverflow.com/q/32926842/476803</a></p>
<p>In short, my question is: What is the easiest way to generate code for a<br>
sorting algorithm that sorts its argument in reverse order, while<br>
building on top of the existing List.sort?</p>
<p>cheers</p>

Hi Christian,</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts about List.sort &amp; friends:</p>
<p>a) The first problem with List.sort and friends is that they are defined in the type class <br>
linorder, although their definitions could be made as well in the type class ord. Three <br>
years ago (2ada2be850cb), I have moved all the operations for red-black trees (RBT) into <br>
the linorder type class, precisely because I wanted to use them with other ordering <br>
relations. Ideally, the same should be done for List.sort and friends.</p>
<p>For the time being, you can still avoid some of the overheads by using the foundational <br>
constant linorder.sort_key, which takes the order as an additional argument. So, you can <br>
pass in the dual order. With a single interpretation for the dual order, you should get <br>
all the theorems you need. You can even define an abbreviation for it:</p>
<p>interpretation dual!: linorder "op ≥" "op &gt; :: _ :: linorder ⇒ _" by(rule dual_linorder)<br>
abbreviation "rsort == linorder.sort_key op ≥ (λx. x)"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, code generation does not work out of the box, because the code setup has <br>
only been done for the type-class based instance. If List.sort was defined in the type <br>
class ord, one could simply re-declare the code equations (as I did for the RBT operations <br>
in my AFP entry Containers). Alternatively, you can prove that sort &amp; friends are <br>
parametric (as Peter did for RBT operations in his AFP entry Collections) and exploit <br>
parametricity like he does, but my feeling is that this again requires unconditional <br>
equations, i.e., a definition in ord.</p>
<p>b) The second problem is that we want to implement List.sort with different algorithms <br>
during code generation. For linear orders, this is no problem, because the result is <br>
unique. However, if we pass in a non-linear order, the outcome might depend on the <br>
algorithm. Thus, we can only do program refinement for linear orders. In that view, even <br>
if we move List.sort to the type class ord, we still have problems, because we cannot <br>
prove the code equations for arbitrary ordering relations any more.</p>
<p>Ideally, we should separate the proving part from the code generation part. AFAICS, the <br>
following should work.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Move List.sort and friends to type class ord. For ease of use and compatibility, we can <br>
add sign constraints such that type inference infers the linorder sort constraints for <br>
List.sort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define a type 'a linorder of linear orders using typedef and an embedding</p>
<p>linorder_of :: "'a :: linorder itself =&gt; 'a linorder"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define operations for sorting lists that are parametrised with the order from the type <br>
'a linorder. Prove equations like "List.sort_key == sort_key_impl TYPE('a)".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adapt all the implementations for sorting such that they refine sort_key_impl rather <br>
than List.sort_key.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from sorting, such a setup could be used for further improvements to the generated <br>
code. For example, one could refine the type 'a linorder to provide a comparator instead <br>
of a comparison operation.</p>
<p>I guess such a change requires quite a lot of work to be carried out on the whole <br>
repository. At the moment, I do not have the time to carry all this out, but if the issue <br>
is pressing for you, you might want to try it yourself. But before you start, we should <br>
also ask Florian on his opinion.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

Hi Christian, hi Andreas,</p>
<p>I think there is one misperception concerning sort_key – it is not<br>
parametrized by an order, but by a morphism:</p>
<p>"sort_key" :: "('a ⇒ 'b) ⇒ 'a list ⇒ 'a list"</p>
<p>Hence reverse sorting is difficult to accomplish unless you have a<br>
structure where each element has a dual wrt. the underlying order.</p>
<p>Hence the only way possible I see with the matter »as it is« is indeed a<br>
separate interpretation of the linorder to its dual, together with<br>
suitable mixins:</p>
<p>theory Sort<br>
imports Main "~~/src/Tools/Permanent_Interpretation"<br>
begin</p>
<p>context linorder<br>
begin</p>
<p>permanent_interpretation dual!: linorder greater_eq greater for dummy :: 'b<br>
  defining<br>
    insort_rev_key = "dual.insort_key :: ('b ⇒ 'a) ⇒ 'b ⇒ 'b list ⇒ 'b list"<br>
    and sort_rev_key = "dual.sort_key :: ('b ⇒ 'a) ⇒ 'b list ⇒ 'b list"<br>
  by default auto</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>export_code sort_rev_key in Haskell</p>
<p>(Note that you need more mixins if you use the quicksort implementation<br>
from Multiset.thy)</p>
<p>Surely not very convincing due to all the mess generated by the dual order.</p>
<p>IMHO the best way to continue from here is to develope a <em>algorithmic</em><br>
theory on sorting, which is specifically designed for executability.  I<br>
guess this should follow the spirit of the Isabelle collection<br>
framework.  The sort in List.thy then could stand as it is.</p>
<p>All the best,<br>
    Florian<br>
