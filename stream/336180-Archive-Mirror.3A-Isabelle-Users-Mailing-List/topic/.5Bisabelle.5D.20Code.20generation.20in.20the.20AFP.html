<p>From: Lars Hupel &lt;<a href="mailto:hupel@in.tum.de">hupel@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear list,</p>
<p>sparked by a question from Tobias, I would like to draw attention to the<br>
current (technical) state of code generation as used in numerous AFP<br>
entries.</p>
<p>For now, let's only talk about self-contained code, i.e. no external<br>
dependencies required. Code that can be compiled with just "export_code<br>
... checking ...".</p>
<p>All Jenkins boxes have a uniform setup with GHC, ocamlc, scalac, and<br>
Poly/ML present. (Pinning the versions of GHC and ocamlc to make them<br>
independent of the platform version is a different story, too.)</p>
<p>Hence, it is no problem to use both "checking" and "in". People use<br>
both, and most (all?) generated artifacts are listed in<br>
"$AFP_BASE/.hgignore":</p>
<p>thys/Tree-Automata/code/haskell/generated/Nat.hs<br>
thys/Tree-Automata/code/haskell/generated/Ta.hs<br>
thys/Tree-Automata/code/ml/generated/Ta.ML<br>
thys/Tree-Automata/code/ocaml/generated/Ta.ml<br>
...</p>
<p>However, using "export_code ... in ... file ..." does not mean that the<br>
generated code is being compiled. For that, one needs to use "checking".<br>
But "checking" does not generate files, so when one wants to provide a<br>
session that allows both</p>
<p>a) downstream users to use "isabelle build" to produce artifacts<br>
b) testing (compiling) generated artifacts to avoid regressions</p>
<p>one has to use both commands.</p>
<p>It is additionally complicated by the fact that the AFP submission<br>
system, for security reasons, forbids writing files into "$AFP_BASE".<br>
Submitting a session that either uses "export_code ... in ... file ..."<br>
directly or indirectly (via a different session) will lead to build failure.</p>
<p>Maybe we should move towards allowing both use cases in a single<br>
command; coupled with a system option that's on by default determining<br>
whether actual files are written. One could then envision running</p>
<p>isabelle build -o codegen_artifacts=false ...</p>
<p>in the submission system, whereas nothing else changes for users.</p>
<p>Opinions?</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
In principle, writing files into the source file-system space is<br>
considered a legacy feature since &gt; 10 years, but I guess that I am now<br>
the only one who still remembers this.</p>
<p>So just the usual questions:</p>
<p>* Why is there a need to write files into the source directory in the<br>
first place? (Apart from old habits inherited from the 1970s or 1980s.)</p>
<p>* Which fine-tuning of Isabelle functionality is required to get rid<br>
of it?</p>
<p>It is important to note that the PIDE document model does not support<br>
the concept of files generated during execution. So it would be better<br>
to get rid of it altogether, or if there are good reasons for it to<br>
support it properly. Both requires to understand the true purpose behind it.</p>

I'm not sure how far up your priorities that is.</p>

<p>Users should be able to obtain code that they can compile. Possibly<br>
without having to open an editor. Possibly by using "isabelle build" for<br>
that.</p>
<p>I personally have no strong opinion on the workflow, but I suspect<br>
others might.</p>

This sounds like a special form of output of "resources" that have a<br>
"path" location (relative to a theory. E.g. in Isabelle/ML it could be<br>
done by (write_resource path text), analogously to (writeln text).</p>
<p>The result could be absorbed by the PIDE markup for the theory, and<br>
retried later by command-line tools. (This assumes that we already have<br>
persistent PIDE databases as result of "isabelle build", but we are<br>
close to that.)</p>
<p>Further applications of the same idea:</p>
<p>* Generated LaTeX document source: document output is always emitted,<br>
but not yet used with latex; the "isabelle document" tool does that<br>
later on, based on a persistent PIDE database.</p>
<p>* Generated HTML web pages (or even a web server), based on a<br>
persistent PIDE database -- essentially a continuation of<br>
"isabelle.preview" in Isabelle/jEdit.</p>

<p>From: "Achim D. Brucker" &lt;<a href="mailto:brucker@spamfence.net">brucker@spamfence.net</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>we are relying on generating source files for the test setups generated<br>
by HOL-TestGen. Getting rid of writing generated source files in general<br>
would be a severe limitation. Generating files in a dedicated output <br>
directory (similar to, or even the same as, the one used for the document<br>
generation) should be fine. </p>
<p>Being able to integrate the compilation of the generated source files (and <br>
external dependencies) into the build system (e.g., by providing a <a href="http://build.sh">build.sh</a> <br>
in the source output directory similar to custom document generation) would <br>
be a big plus ;-).</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Achim<br>

<p>The output of write_resource would be stored in the PIDE markup<br>

<p>Other tools could pick it up by Isabelle/Scala operations (still to be<br>
provided). One such tool could be "isabelle resources" to extract<br>
material from the database and copy it into a given directory. From<br>
there, one could continue in the old-fashioned manner of the<br>
1970s/1980s, with tools like "make" and its modern derivatives.</p>

<p>Most tools I've ever seen <em>can</em> be assimilated by Isabelle. People who<br>
don't want this, and can still stick to older traditions, e.g. like this<br>
in a Makefile:</p>
<p>isabelle build ...  # turn session sources into session database<br>
  isabelle resources ...  # extract certain files into a directory<br>
  do whatever ...</p>

<p>That's an entirely different discussion though, centered around who'd be <br>
willing to put in the effort and maintain build tools packaged as <br>
Isabelle components (or similar). But as long as there's a convenient <br>
command-line tool, it's a largely orthogonal discussion.</p>

Dear all,</p>
<p>I would also appreciate a more systematic treatment of generated code in<br>
the context of its applications.</p>
<p>Just a few further observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The following files apparently contain generated code but a part of<br>
the history:<br>
thys/LTL_to_DRA/Code/LTL_to_DRA_Translator.sml<br>
thys/Depth-First-Search/dfs.ML<br>
thys/Refine_Imperative_HOL/benchmarks/NestedDFS/isabelle/NDFS_Benchmark_export.sml<br>
thys/Refine_Imperative_HOL/benchmarks/Dijkstra/isabelle/dijkstra_export.sml<br>
thys/Refine_Imperative_HOL/benchmarks/Heapmap/isabelle/heapmap_export.sml<br>
thys/LTL/example/rewrite_example.sml</li>
</ul>
<p>Having generated data in the history is always a bad idea.  The least<br>
thing to todo is to remove this and put them into .hgrc (a second-best<br>
thing, though).</p>
<ul>
<li>A cursory <code>grep -rIPn ghc *</code> on the AFP reveals a couple of ad-hoc<br>
constructions to build tools from generated code using GHC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe it is time to think how such compiler invocations and their<br>
results and be integrated smoothly into a Isabelle session.  In that<br>
longer past I never attempted this due to lack of examples.</p>

I have already started working in that direction: see<br>
Isabelle/ac82ee617a75 with the following NEWS entries:</p>
<p><strong>* ML </strong>*</p>
<ul>
<li>Operation Export.export emits theory exports (arbitrary blobs), which<br>
are stored persistently in the session build database.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>* System </strong>*</p>
<ul>
<li>The command-line tool retrieves theory exports from the session build<br>
database.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no applications yet. It is likely that there will be further<br>
refinements, when it comes into practice.</p>
<p>I am presently also thinking in the direction to export proof terms<br>
(without storing them in ML), maybe even OpenTheory output.</p>
