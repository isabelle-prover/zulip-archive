Dear all,</p>
<p>We noticed that the code setup for the theory Fraction_Field in HOL/Library is broken, at <br>
least since Isabelle2013. We would like to use code generation in his formalisation of <br>
knot theory where the elements of the fraction fields are polynomials over integers. I had <br>
a brief look at the theory Fraction_Field and noticed that there is a smart <br>
pseudo-constructor Fract, which is declared as code_datatype. So this feels as if the code <br>
generation was working at some time in the distant past and got broken somewhen.</p>
<p>Does anyone know about the status of Fraction_Field?</p>
<p>I believe that it would be fairly easy to "fix" the problem of code generator setup by <br>
deriving a few code equation from the lemmas, but this will clearly result in suboptimal <br>
code for two reasons. First, we need tests whether the denominator is 0 all over the <br>
place. Second, the elements of the fraction fields will not be normalised automatically. <br>
For the application on polynomials, this means that we would need some Euclidean algorithm <br>
for cancelling common factors of polynomials. I dimly remember that there is some support <br>
for the Euclidean algorithm in the pipeline. What is the status there?</p>

It's all there in ~~/src/HOL/Number_Theory/Euclidean_Algorithm. However,<br>
if you want to do this for polynomials with integer coefficients, that<br>
is not going to work: polynomials over the integers are /not/ a<br>
Euclidean ring; they are not even a principal ideal domain.</p>
<p>The Euclidean algorithm can be adapted to work; the easiest way is<br>
probably to use subresultants, because this way, all intermediate<br>
results are also integer polynomials, whereas the classic Euclidean<br>
algorithm would have fractional coefficients.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch">andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Manuel and Florian,</p>
<p>Thank you for your quick replies. Let me summarise how I see the situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fraction fields are defined over integral domains (type class idom). With little <br>
effort, we could get a horribly inefficient setup for code generation by just massaging <br>
the existing equations a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For euclidean rings, we can get with reasonable effort a working code setup with <br>
reasonable efficiency. If we take that route, code generation only works for euclidean <br>
rings, but polynomials over integers are not such a ring (which is our application at the <br>
moment).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For fraction fields over polynomials over rings (rather than fields), one can use <br>
subresultants, but I have not been able to find them formalised in Isabelle. Are they <br>
hidden somewhere? If not, are there any plans to formalise them?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if we had subresultants, I do not yet see how they can be integrated with the <br>
Isabelle type classes. Obviously, we should have a uniform code setup for fraction fields, <br>
i.e., it should work for all instances the same way. AFAICS, this means that we need <br>
another type class which provides some sort of normalisation function normalise :: 'a =&gt; <br>
'a =&gt; 'a * 'a. For euclidean rings, this could just be delegated to Euclid's algorithm. <br>
For polynomials, the situation is not as clear. Either the instantiation always implements <br>
some normalisation algorithm (e.g. using subresultants) or it tests whether the base type <br>
is a field and if so, it uses Euclid's algorithm again. I do not know which of these is <br>
preferable in terms of efficiency. Do you have any idea?</p>
<p>What's your take on this?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

Dear Andreas,</p>
<p>Are subresultants really necessary for this? From my understanding, <br>
subresultant remainder sequences are just an improved version of <br>
pseudo-remainder sequences, by controlling coefficients growth. However, <br>
if not implemented properly (i.e. merely calculating subresultants <br>
through determinants), I don't think there is any advantage for <br>
subresultants over pseudo-divisions, while pseudo-divisions on <br>
polynomials are much easier to formalize. In fact, I did a formalization <br>
of polynomial pseudo-divisions by imitating Euclidean divisions in <br>
Library/Polynomial.thy, and the relation looks like:</p>
<p>definition ppdivmod_rel :: "'a::idom poly ⇒ 'a poly ⇒ 'a poly ⇒ 'a poly <br>
⇒ 'a ⇒ bool"<br>
where<br>
   "ppdivmod_rel x y q r m ⟷ (<br>
       smult m x = q * y + r ∧ (if y = 0 then q = 0 else r = 0 ∨ degree r <br>
&lt; degree y)<br>
       ∧  ( m= (if x=0 ∨ y=0 then 1 else (lead_coeff y) ^ (degree x + 1 - <br>
degree y))))"</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>

Dear Wenda,</p>
<p>I am not an expert on computer algebra, so I am happy to use whatever seems reasonable. <br>
Does your formalisation of pseudo-division also include an executable algorithm? Is your <br>
formalisation available?</p>

Hi Florian and Manuel,</p>
<p>I have experimented a bit with a normalisation function to be used in the operations over <br>
fraction fields and had a look at Euclidean_Algorithm in Number_Theory.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I noticed that there are the type classes euclidean_ring and euclidean_ring_gcd. Most <br>
of the theorems about gcd which I need are in euclidean_ring_gcd, but not in <br>
euclidean_ring itself. Unfortunately, the instantiations for nat, int, etc. are only done <br>
for euclidean_ring, not for euclidean_ring_gcd. What are the plans for these type classes? <br>
Should I spend any effort on adding instances for euclidean_ring_gcd? Or will this become <br>
obsolete with the polishing that is still due?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am no longer sure that an invariant-based approach is the optimal thing for fraction <br>
field. In the code equation for the arithmetic operation, I don't see any big <br>
opportunities to exploit the invariant that nominator and denominator are normalised in <br>
some unspecified form. Only the equality tests become simpler (as normal forms are unique <br>
and we thus save two multiplications). Instead, it seems much simpler to treat <br>
cancellation of common factors as an optimisation without logical significance. For <br>
example, we could just add a call to a simplification function before calls to the Fract <br>
constructor. The simplification function only has to return an element of the same <br>
equivalence class, so for nat and int, we could use a normalisation function based on <br>
Euclid's algorithm. For other types, the simplification function could also just be the <br>
identity. What do you think?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

<p>euclidean_ring_gcd is nothing but euclidean_ring with the additional<br>
assumption that gcd and Gcd (which are introduced in a syntactical<br>
typeclass and therefore have no a priori properties associated with<br>
them) are the same as the euclidean GCD (and the same for LCM).</p>
<p>So, in a sense, there is usually no proof work to be done to make<br>
anything an instance of euclidean_ring_gcd if you already have<br>
euclidean_ring; you can just define "gcd = gcd_eucl", "Gcd = Gcd_eucl"<br>
and so on and you get the instance for free.<br>
That's clear. However, nat and int already have their own implementation of the GCD...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is already an existing definition of gcd, you have to prove its<br>
equivalence to the Euclidean GCD etc., which you can do by showing that<br>
it fulfils the defining properties of the GCD and that it returns a<br>
normalised GCD, i.e. "1" and not "-1" for integers.<br>
Well, it is exactly this equivalence proof of which I am uncertain. If Florian <br>
restructures the whole hierarchy such that gcd/lcm definitions for int and nat are done in <br>
terms of gcd_eucl, then the equivalence proof becomes irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, from what I can see, the equivalences are not provable at all in Isabelle2015, <br>
because euclidean_ring_gcd also talks about the set versions Gcd and Lcm. And in <br>
Euclidean_Algorithm, Lcm_eucl and Gcd_eucl are defined such that they also work for <br>
infinite sets whereas in GCD, Lcm for nat is defined to be 0 for infinite sets. So what is <br>
the plan here?</p>

Dear all,</p>
<p>Some months ago I noticed the same thing. As Manuel says,<br>
euclidean_ring_gcd is just euclidean_ring + gcd = gcd_euclid (and the same<br>
for Gcd, lcm and Lcm).</p>
<p>Anyway, in my AFP entry called Echelon_Form there is another variant of the<br>
Manuel's file (see<br>
<a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/browser_info/current/AFP/Echelon_Form/Euclidean_Algorithm.html">http://afp.sourceforge.net/browser_info/current/AFP/Echelon_Form/Euclidean_Algorithm.html</a>).</p>
<p>I just slighly modified his version to move most of theorems presented in<br>
the euclidean_ring_gcd class to the euclidean_ring one. In other file (<br>
<a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/browser_info/current/AFP/Echelon_Form/Euclidean_Algorithm_Extension.html">http://afp.sourceforge.net/browser_info/current/AFP/Echelon_Form/Euclidean_Algorithm_Extension.html</a>),<br>
the following instances were also proven:</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it's worth noting that my files are independent with respect<br>
the Manuel's one (which is the one presented in the stardard library). In<br>
addition, my changes were done with respect to an old version of the<br>
Manuel's file, so probably there have been some<br>
improvements/restructurations on his file.</p>

I just looked at all of this again and found the situation to be much <br>
more painful than I had remembered. In the long run, we definitely want <br>
to replace the definitions of the gcd for natural numbers and integers <br>
with the gcd_eucl, and then add the current definitions as alternative <br>
definitions and code equations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just slighly modified his version to move most of theorems presented in<br>
the euclidean_ring_gcd class to the euclidean_ring one.<br>
I also concluded that that is pretty much the only viable option (other <br>
than doing the change I mentioned above, which is probably also what <br>
Andreas meant initially).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess Florian had planned to do this anyway in the course of his <br>
refactoring of algebraic type classes, but I don't know what his current <br>
status is on that.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

Hi all,</p>
<p>I am somehow lost how the »algebraic stack« is supposed to look like in<br>
the whole example.  Something like Fraction over Poly over Int?<br>
Since Poly over Int forms a factorial ring but not an euclidean ring,<br>
the question is how to generalize normalization of quotients a / b<br>
accordingly.  It won't work naturally with type classes:</p>
<p>Poly over Rat --&gt; normalization via gcd / eucl<br>
    Poly over Poly over Rat --&gt; somehow different</p>
<p>Hence, some type class magic would be needed to detect whether to use<br>
the rather efficient euclidean algorithm or something different – or<br>
even refrain from normalization at all!?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
    Florian<br>

This discussion is leaving the scope of isabelle-users since we are<br>
talking about ongoing developments in the Isabelle repository,<br>
nevertheless here a short preview:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The next Isabelle release will (in Complex-Main) contain type classes<br>
for generic gcd, lcm, Gcd, Lcm with the most fundamental instances<br>
(hence no euquivalence problems).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before we can continue to move the euclidean algorithm itself to<br>
Complex-Main, the existing theories must be cleaned-up by removing<br>
duplicates, generalizing what can be generalized etc concerning<br>
gcd/lcm/Gcd/Lcm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that, the euclidean algorithm can be absorbed into Complex-Main.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have this on my agenda, but not prioritized.  Any help concerning the<br>
GCD cleanup is appreciated.</p>
<p>Detaisl could be discussed on isabelle-dev.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
    Florian<br>
