<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch">andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>I am trying to convert the Coinductive entry in the AFP to use the new <br>
BNF package for the type definitions. So far, the type the type ('a, 'b) <br>
tlist has been defined as a quotient of ('a llist * 'b), where 'a llist <br>
has been constructed directly in a coinductive style. Most definitions <br>
and lemmas about tllist are simply lifted versions of their 'a llist <br>
counterparts.</p>
<p>Now, I am wondering whether it is sensible to convert this to BNF or <br>
whether I should better stick to the current setup. Or can I have it <br>
both ways? Can I define tllist with the BNF package and then setup the <br>
quotient package manually (similar to what setup_lifting does for <br>
typedefs)? Or can I define the type via quotient_type and then declare <br>
to the BNF package that tllist is actually</p>
<p>codata ('a, b) tllist = TNil 'b | TCons 'a "('a, b') tllist"</p>
<p>(this would be similar to rep_datatype)? How could I achieve this? Is <br>
there some documentation or example around?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions,<br>
Andreas</p>

Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>You can setup the Lifting package manually even for quotient types. <br>
Again by setup_lifting by providing the Quotient theorem (and optionally <br>
reflp theorem). See the documentation in The Isabelle/Isar Reference <br>
Manual. An example is in Word.thy. The command setup_lifting is not only <br>
for typedefs.</p>
<p>If you mean the Quotient package by Kaliszyk, Urban, I think you would <br>
have to go to the ML level (which doesn't exist, I know ;)) to setup the <br>
package manually.</p>

Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>If you go for the "quotient -&gt; BNF" direction, there are a couple of things you can do.</p>
<ol>
<li>The "wrap_data" command derives all the characteristic lemmas that are common for datatypes and codatatypes. It is somewhat similar to "rep_datatype" but not quite, because it has nothing to do with (co)induction and (co)recursion, only constructors, discriminators, and selectors. Here's an example of its use<p>wrap_data [Nil, Cons] list_case [] [[], [hd, tl]] [[hd: undefined, tl: Nil]]<br>
  apply -<br>
  apply (erule list.exhaust, assumption)<br>
  apply (rule list.inject)<br>
  apply (rule list.distinct)<br>
  apply (rule list.cases)+<br>
  done</p>
<p>print_theorems</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here "Nil", "Cons", and "list_case" must already exist, whereas "hd" and "tl" are defined by the command. The syntax is</p>
<p>wrap_data &lt;constructors&gt; &lt;case&gt; &lt;discriminator names&gt; &lt;selector names&gt; &lt;default values&gt;</p>
<p>(see "bnf_wrap.ML" for details). With a bit of ML, you could export the properties of codatatypes and their (co)iterators/recursors under the familiar names given by "codata". Ideally, we would rename "wrap_data" to, say, "wrap_pre_data" and provide additionally "wrap_data" and "wrap_codata" to finish the job. Perhaps you could help us design good interfaces for this pair, since you apparently would need "wrap_codata".</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>If you want to do (co)recursion through one of the "tllist" type arguments, you will need to register the type as a BNF. For this there currently is only one way, namely "bnf_def", which you already used before for the "option" type IIRC.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jasmin</p>

There is one Quotient package and there is Lifting and Transfer, which <br>
almost subsume the functionality of the Quotient package regarding <br>
defining new constants and transferring goals. When Lifting and Transfer <br>
subsume the Quotient package completely, the Quotient package will be <br>
probably outdated and eventually removed. Only the quotient_type command <br>
will be preserved. It's on my todo list but not really on the top <br>
because there are more important things to be done.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the only place where some extra features of the <br>
Quotient package (that are not covered by Lifting and Transfer) are used <br>
is Nominal2.</p>

<p>Right, at some point we tried to define a simple nominal datatype<br>

theorems that Quotient can.</p>
<p>For example the exhausts theorems for many datatypes fail to transfer<br>
with the Transfer package. It is possible to reprove them using the<br>
theorems that Transfer is able to use, but the purpose of the Quotient<br>
package is automating such tasks...</p>
<p>I do not know if the issue would be the same for the co-datatypes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, this sheds more light on the situation.  It also helps Isabelle <br>
users to keep an overview.</p>
<p>Concerning Nomimal2, someone was asking about it on the Nominal mailing <br>
list recently: to include some Isabelle application in AFP that depends on <br>
Nomimal2, it has to be available in some official manner.  AFP already has <br>
a "temporary" copy of Nominal2 now, but what is its relation to the main <br>
Nominal2 repository, and its relation to Nominal1 that is part of <br>
Isabelle2013 (and earlier)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the differences between Quotient and Lifting+Transfer, apart<br>
from missing regulatization (the above), Quotient has been designed to<br>
be used not only interactively, but also from the ML level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proper Isabelle/ML interfaces are indeed very important for <em>any</em> package. <br>
It is the first thing a tool author should do, before adding some conrete <br>
syntax icing on the cake (for end-users who won't build their own tools on <br>
top of other tools).</p>
<p>Generally, I hope that the misleading terminology of Isabelle "ML level" <br>
and "Scala layer" (which was introduced myself) will eventually disappear. <br>
It is just Isabelle/ML, Isabelle/Scala, Isabelle/Isar, Isabelle/Pure, <br>
Isabelle/HOL, Isabelle/....  Many aspects of a system, and many of them <br>
cannot be assigned to a "level" or "layer" at all, because they are <br>
intertwined.</p>
<p>The term "ML level" is particularly bad, because it sounds like something <br>
alien and inaccessible at the bottom of the pit.  If that were the case, <br>
the Prover IDE would not provide so much support for editing Isabelle/ML <br>
as part of regular theory sources.</p>
