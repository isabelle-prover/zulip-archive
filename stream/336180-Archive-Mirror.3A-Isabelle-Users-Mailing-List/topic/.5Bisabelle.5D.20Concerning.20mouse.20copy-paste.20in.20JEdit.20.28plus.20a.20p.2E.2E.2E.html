<p>From: Rafal Kolanski &lt;<a href="mailto:xs@xaph.net">xs@xaph.net</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I am having difficulty figuring out what the right forum is to cover<br>
this issue, but in 2012 people were complaining that copy-paste from the<br>
goals / query window does not work if you try select and then<br>
middle-paste. I don't think anyone except Isabelle users really uses<br>
JEdit anymore, so I'll try here.</p>
<p>I've encountered people who assume that this is because "it works in<br>
JEdit and Makarius just overwrote the settings because he doesn't care<br>
about X11 throwbacks or something". This is not the case.</p>
<p>JEdit code instructs plugin authors to use JEditEmbeddedTextArea<br>
(superclass: TextArea), which the JEdit plugin does correctly.<br>
For the main text area, JEdit uses JEditTextArea (superclass: TextArea).</p>
<p>JEditEmbeddedTextArea uses TextAreaMouseHandler for its mouse setup.<br>
JEditTextArea uses MouseHandler (superclass: TextAreaMouseHandler)for<br>
its mouse setup.</p>
<p>Now here's where it all went wrong: someone in the distant past<br>
(pre-2012 where the svn history ends) added the mouse copy-paste<br>
functionality, but only added it in MouseHandler. In fact, as it stands<br>
TextAreaMouseHandler's mouseClicked and mouseReleased are just outdated<br>
versions of those in MouseHandler. They are nearly identical, except for<br>
the copy-paste functionality and some better error checking.</p>
<p>The attached patch updates the TextAreaMouseHandler mouseClicked and<br>
mouseReleased actions to contain all the updated functionality of<br>
MouseHandler, making embedded text areas behave like the main text area<br>
for all editing purposes.<br>
I did leave one difference in: embedded text areas don't send out<br>
anything on the EditBus by default. That should be up to the plugin<br>
authors to do.</p>
<p>I'd like to contribute this to the JEdit repository, but there are so<br>
many outstanding patches and bug reports on the sourceforge page that I<br>
don't think there's anyone left who actually cares. Any advice?</p>
<p>If you want to patch this yourself, you can find a version of jEdit<br>
sources in the contrib directory:</p>
<p>e.g. ~/.isabelle/contrib/jedit_build-20150228/contrib/jEdit-patched.tar.gz</p>
<p>Unpack that somewhere.<br>
Go in there  (jEdit-patched folder from inside the archive) and do:</p>
<p>patch -p0 &lt; jedit_embeddedtextarea_mousehandler_fix.patch</p>
<p>then:</p>
<p>ant build</p>
<p>That takes about 4-5 minutes the first time as it'll fetch all the sources.</p>
<p>Don't forget to copy the resulting build/jedit.jar over the one in</p>
<p>~/.isabelle/contrib/jedit_build-20150228/contrib/jedit-5.2.0-patched</p>
<p>Happy copy-pasting.</p>

The proper name and spelling of jEdit is "jEdit".  Its Sourceforge project <br>
is here: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jedit">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jedit</a></p>
<p>There are various trackers to submit artifacts, such as "Patches" for <br>

<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jedit/patches">http://sourceforge.net/p/jedit/patches</a></p>

years: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jedit/patches/search/?q=makarius">http://sourceforge.net/p/jedit/patches/search/?q=makarius</a> -- it was <br>
mostly "closed-accepted".  Only my very first patch was "closed-rejected" <br>
for various reasons.</p>
<p>Discussions about jEdit development often happen right in the tracker <br>
threads -- all of that is copied automatically to the jedit-devel mailing <br>

<p>I still welcome comments from you on the actual content, as it affects<br>
Isabelle plugin users mainly. No other plugin uses<br>
JEditEmbeddedTextArea, and so it is a second-class citizen. Note how you<br>
have to rebind ctrl+c yourself to do copy from the output/query buffers.<br>
Another feature that people think is easy, but really isn't for this<br>
reason: how nice it would be to hop over to the output/query buffer with<br>
your keyboard, select some text to copy and hop back.</p>
<p>My small workaround I sent to isabelle-dev received a similar reaction<br>
from you to this one: no discussion of patch content / functionality.<br>
There is no patch tracker to submit that to.</p>

<p>Of course. It does make perfect sense to have a separate embedded text<br>
area, but in our case so is having the option of a middle ground that<br>
allows the obvious (w.r.t. jEdit shortcut setup) keyboard navigation and<br>
copy/paste setup.</p>
<p>For the mouse, I have made a conservative modification that should be<br>
safe and useful for everyone.</p>
<p>For the keyboard, I have investigated some kind of "if no text area in<br>
an edit pane has focus at present, ask the dockable window manager for<br>
if it has a focused text area we could apply the bound command to". So<br>
then next-char, select-paragraph, copy etc. would work in the output<br>
buffer. Sadly, this approach is a total hack and has the feeling of<br>
swimming upstream against better judgment. Hence my desire for feedback<br>
from those more experienced.</p>

<p>No worries. I apologize and understand, I just really wanted to start<br>
some kind of dialogue with you on this topic. We can resume this in a<br>
while, but for the record, the overall larger situation is:</p>
<p>I am instrumenting Chunk.java a bit to allow access to painting the<br>
glyphs that jEdit already has cached for us. Because they are the<br>
ultimate source of information on chunk positioning in a text area and<br>
already include the necessary font substitutions, we can leverage it to<br>
paint those same glyphs overlaid with text colors from Isabelle.</p>
<p>In that case:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The code in paint_chunk_list (Rich_Text_Area) doesn't have to worry<br>
   about fonts and font metrics anymore, only specify glyph colors.<br>
   Since the fonts are all resolved already, the painted glyphs will<br>
   line up perfectly with the jEdit chunk sizes in the background.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user_font() setup in Token_Markup doesn't need to request extra<br>
   chunk splits based on etc/symbols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fewer chunks means less memory used and faster draw code<br>
   (probably not significant)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>19*2 fewer potential entries reserved in the chunk ID for extended<br>
   styles. As the limit is 127, that may let us have more Isabelle-based<br>
   styles in future that are respected by jEdit's chunk creator<br>
   (parser?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fonts will not need to be specified in etc/symbols at all, making my<br>
   earlier workaround patch completely unnecessary by (hopefully)<br>
   obviating it with correct design</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm pretty sure I will have this working in a week for my own setup, as<br>
I have a mental layout that makes me compulsively customize colors and<br>
fonts. What I don't know is if anyone else would be interested in this<br>
change, in particular the creator and primary maintainer of the Isabelle<br>
plugin.</p>

<p>Please do not think I'm suggesting we have a patch tracker! I am merely<br>
trying to make sure I am approaching the situation correctly. I have<br>
been away from the Isabelle side of things for a while, and want to<br>
start making constructive contributions again.</p>
<p>This is also why you haven't heard anything from me when Isabelle 2015<br>
was in its release candidate status.</p>
<p>Though I still miss my vim input emulation, I am very impressed with<br>
what you have done.</p>
<p>The editor is still scriptable (earlier this week I implemented a "jump<br>
to first Isabelle error in the file" macro, a "set my color scheme"<br>
macro, a "what markup element does Isabelle think this is" macro).<br>
I was also pondering whether it would be possible to write macros in<br>
Scala, because trying to pass a closure to Isabelle code from the<br>
BeanShell is truly a "just don't" moment.</p>
<p>I'm glad to hear from you, and thank you for your time!</p>

<p>From: "Eugene W. Stark" &lt;<a href="mailto:isabelle-users@starkeffect.com">isabelle-users@starkeffect.com</a>&gt;<br>
If I am reading this right, then the inability to copy and middle-paste<br>
from the output window did indeed annoy me for a time, but then I found<br>
that I could work around using CTRL-C/CTRL-V to copy and paste from the<br>
output window into the source code window.  This has been very handy<br>
recently when the SMT sledgehammer tools in Isabelle2015 claim that a<br>
proof does not succeed, when in fact it does, if you can only copy and<br>
paste the suggestion.</p>
<p>I personally am not planning on rebuilding jEdit to try the patch,<br>
but I hope Isabelle developers will do so, as it would be nice if it<br>
worked with middle-click as well.</p>

If you want a weaker version of this functionality right now, for<br>
Isabelle-2015, without recompiling jEdit you can apply the attached<br>
patch with "git apply" in your isabelle source folder. It won't work for<br>
multiple-click select (e.g. triple-click), but it's a passable bandaid<br>
for click-and-drag selection.</p>
<p>I created this so my co-workers had something while I hunted for a more<br>
canonical solution.</p>
<p>I Hope this helps you out for the time being.</p>
