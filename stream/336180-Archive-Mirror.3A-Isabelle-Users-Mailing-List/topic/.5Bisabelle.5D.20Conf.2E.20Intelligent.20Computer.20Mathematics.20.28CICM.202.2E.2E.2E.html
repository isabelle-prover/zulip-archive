<p>As   computers   and   communications  technology   advance,   greater<br>
opportunities  arise for  intelligent mathematical  computation. While<br>
computer  algebra, automated  deduction,  mathematical publishing  and<br>
novel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,<br>
we  are now seeing  increasing opportunities  for synergy  among these<br>
areas. The  Conferences on  Intelligent Computer Mathematics  offers a<br>
venue for discussing these areas and their synergy.</p>
<p>The   conference  will   take  place   at  the   University   of  Bath<br>
(<a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk">www.bath.ac.uk</a>),  with James  Davenport  as the  local organiser.  It<br>
consists of four tracks:</p>
<p>Calculemus<br>
   Chair: Wolfgang Windsteiger<br>
Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML)<br>
   Chair: Petr Sojka<br>
Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)<br>
   Chair: David Aspinall<br>
Systems and Projects<br>
   Chair: Christoph Lange</p>
<p>As  in  previous  years,  there  will  be  a  Doctoral  Programme  for<br>

<p>The overall programme  will be organised by the  General Program Chair<br>
Jacques Carette.</p>

Calculemus<br>
==========</p>
<p>Calculemus   2013  invites   the  submission   of   original  research<br>
contributions to be considered for publication and presentation at the<br>
conference.  Calculemus  is a series  of conferences dedicated  to the<br>
integration  of  computer  algebra   systems  (CAS)  and  systems  for<br>
mechanised  reasoning  like   interactive  proof  assistants  (PA)  or<br>
automated theorem  provers (ATP).  Currently,  symbolic computation is<br>
divided into several (more  or less) independent branches: traditional<br>
ones  (e.g., computer  algebra and  mechanised reasoning)  as  well as<br>
newly emerging ones (on  user interfaces, knowledge management, theory<br>
exploration, etc.) The main concern  of the Calculemus community is to<br>
bring these  developments together in order to  facilitate the theory,<br>
design,  and  implementation   of  integrated  mathematical  assistant<br>
systems  that  will  be  used routinely  by  mathematicians,  computer<br>
scientists and  all others who need  computer-supported mathematics in<br>
their every day business.</p>
<p>All  topics  in  the  intersection  of computer  algebra  systems  and<br>
automated  reasoning systems  are  of interest  for Calculemus.  These<br>
include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated theorem proving in computer algebra systems.</li>
<li>Computer algebra in theorem proving systems.</li>
<li>Adding reasoning capabilities to computer algebra systems.</li>
<li>Adding computational capabilities to theorem proving systems.</li>
<li>
<p>Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for<br>
computer mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case studies and applications that involve a mix of computation and<br>
reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case studies in formalization of mathematical theories.</p>
</li>
<li>Representation of mathematics in computer algebra systems.</li>
<li>Theory exploration techniques.</li>
<li>Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction.</li>
<li>
<p>Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint languages,<br>
and modeling languages for mathematical assistant systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homotopy type theory.</p>
</li>
<li>Infrastructure for mathematical services.</li>
</ul>
<p>===<br>
DML<br>
===</p>
<p>Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed<br>
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked, validated and<br>
verified.   It is  estimated that  the entire  corpus  of mathematical<br>
knowledge  published over  the centuries  does not  exceed 100,000,000<br>
pages,   an   amount   easily   manageable  by   current   information<br>
technologies.</p>
<p>Track objective  is to provide  a forum for development  of math-aware<br>
technologies, standards, algorithms and formats towards fulfillment of<br>
the  dream  of global  digital  mathematical  library (DML).  Computer<br>
scientists  (D)  and librarians  of  digital  age  (L) are  especially<br>
welcome to  join mathematicians  (M) and discuss  many aspects  of DML<br>
preparation.</p>
<p>Track topics  are all topics of mathematical  knowledge management and<br>
digital  libraries  applicable  in  the  context of  DML  building  --<br>
processing of math knowledge expressed in scientific papers in natural<br>
languages, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Math-aware text mining (math mining) and MSC classification</li>
<li>Math-aware representations of mathematical knowledge</li>
<li>Math-aware computational linguistics and corpora</li>
<li>Math-aware tools for [meta]data and fulltext processing</li>
<li>Math-aware OCR and document analysis</li>
<li>Math-aware information retrieval</li>
<li>Math-aware indexing and search</li>
<li>Authoring languages and tools</li>
<li>MathML, OpenMath, TeX and other mathematical content standards</li>
<li>Web interfaces for DML content</li>
<li>Mathematics on the web, math crawling and indexing</li>
<li>Math-aware document processing workflows </li>
<li>Archives of written mathematics</li>
<li>DML management, business models</li>
<li>DML rights handling, funding, sustainability </li>
<li>DML content acquisition, validation and curation</li>
</ul>
<p>===<br>
MKM<br>
===</p>
<p>Mathematical  Knowledge Management  is an  interdisciplinary  field of<br>
research in the intersection of mathematics, computer science, library<br>
science, and scientific publishing. The objective of MKM is to develop<br>
new and better ways  of managing sophisticated mathematical knowledge,<br>
based on innovative technology  of computer science, the Internet, and<br>
intelligent   knowledge   processing.  MKM   is   expected  to   serve<br>
mathematicians,  scientists,   and  engineers  who   produce  and  use<br>
mathematical  knowledge; educators  and students  who teach  and learn<br>
mathematics;   publishers  who   offer   mathematical  textbooks   and<br>
disseminate   new    mathematical   results;   and    librarians   and<br>
mathematicians who catalog and organize mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p>The conference is concerned with all aspects of mathematical knowledge<br>
management. A non-exclusive list of important topics includes:</p>
<p>* Representations of mathematical knowledge<br>
  * Authoring languages and tools<br>
  * Repositories of formalized mathematics<br>
  * Deduction systems<br>
  * Mathematical digital libraries<br>
  * Diagrammatic representations<br>
  * Mathematical OCR<br>
  * Mathematical search and retrieval<br>
  * Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems<br>
  * MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards<br>
  * Web presentation of mathematics<br>
  * Data mining, discovery, theory exploration<br>
  * Computer algebra systems<br>
  * Collaboration tools for mathematics<br>
  * Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows</p>
