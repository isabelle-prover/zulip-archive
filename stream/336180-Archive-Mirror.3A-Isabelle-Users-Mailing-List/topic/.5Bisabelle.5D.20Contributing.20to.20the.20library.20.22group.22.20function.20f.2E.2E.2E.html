Hi Tobias,</p>
<p>2013-09-15 20:52 Tobias Nipkow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks, I'll import it into List as merge_eq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>let me use this occasion to ask what the general procedure is for<br>
contributing functionality to the library.  I said earlier that I have<br>
some material ready for submitting to the AFP, and I will do so within<br>
the next few weeks as soon as I find time.</p>
<p>However, some of my code is not "specialist" functionality, but<br>
functionality I would actually have expected to find in the standard<br>
library.  Please see, at<br>
<a href="https://github.com/formare/auctions/tree/master/isabelle/Auction">https://github.com/formare/auctions/tree/master/isabelle/Auction</a>, the<br>
files *Utils.thy, which are named after their library counterparts.<br>
None of them introduce new concepts (except for the notion of a<br>
"trivial" set in SetUtils), but they merely add lemmas, which I found<br>
useful in my work, to existing library concepts.  Some of them may be<br>
suitable as simp rules, but so far I have not yet gained sufficient<br>
experience as to what lemmas I should reasonably make simp rules.</p>
<p>I had so far been thinking of submitting these *Utils.thy theories as a<br>
separate AFP submission, on which my other, actual AFP submissions would<br>
depend, and then suggesting that some of it may be merged into the<br>
library.  Our license is compatible anyway.</p>
<p>But now, if there is a faster track to the library, I'll be happy to<br>
take it.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Christoph</p>

<p>From: Tobias Nipkow &lt;<a href="mailto:nipkow@in.tum.de">nipkow@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
If you have a small theory of some types and/or functions, the AFP is the right<br>
place. Such theories can be small to be reusable. Only in exceptional cases<br>
should they go into Main. Manuel's function is borderline: the theory is tiny<br>
and the functions is generic enough that I felt I would want it in List itself.</p>
<p>Theories that are merely collections of lemmas are not suitable as separate AFP<br>
entries. If one of the lemmas is non-trivial, it could go into Main. Your Utils<br>
theories however seem to consist mostly of variations and combinations of<br>
existing lemmas, which may well be useful in certain situations but are not<br>
clearly "needed" - a library can also become difficult to use if there is too<br>
much in it. However, some of your lemmas should clearly go in Main, eg</p>
<p>"{}\&lt;inverse&gt; = {}"</p>
<p>I will look through your Utils for more such nuggets.</p>
<p>The question of when something should become a simp lemma is delicate unless it<br>
is so obvious as in the above example. Usually there is no way around trying it<br>
out and seeing if many proofs break.</p>
