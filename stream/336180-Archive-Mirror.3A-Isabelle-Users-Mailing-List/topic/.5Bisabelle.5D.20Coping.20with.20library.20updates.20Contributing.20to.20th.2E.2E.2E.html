Dear Tobias, dear all,</p>
<p>let me divert one aspect of our private conversation back to the list,<br>
as it may be of general interest.</p>
<p>You had pointed out that some of the lemmas in our *Utils.thy theories<br>
at <a href="https://github.com/formare/auctions/tree/master/isabelle/Auction">https://github.com/formare/auctions/tree/master/isabelle/Auction</a>,<br>
which provide useful additions to library concepts, were redundant with<br>
the library.</p>
<p>You said that recent jEdit versions, like ProofGeneral, would point this<br>
out automatically.  Please excuse my stupid question, if it is stupid,<br>
but this probably only holds for the post-2013 development version.  In<br>
Isabelle2013 I don't see any warnings displayed for such redundant<br>
lemmas, but I would have to call "solve_direct" manually.  (So, @Tobias,<br>
sorry for wasting your time with making you review redundant lemmas!)</p>
<p>Some of the redundancies you'd pointed out (including<br>
Relation.converse_mono) only exist in post-2013.</p>
<p>But this makes me wonder:</p>
<ol>
<li>Should I switch to the development version?</li>
<li>
<p>What is the best way for a 3rd party library maintainer (which I<br>
consider myself) to cope with such improvements?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So far I had been reluctant to do so, as I had considered myself a<br>
mere end user.  I had been afraid of wasting time with bugs in the<br>
development version, which I wouldn't understand as a non-expert, but<br>
now it seems that I'm reinventing library functionality that already<br>
exists in the development version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We would like our formalisation to be reusable.  There are no other<br>
users so far, but we are advertising our library.  And we are preparing<br>
a submission of parts of it to the AFP.  All that suggests that our<br>
library should probably work with the last stable Isabelle release.  And<br>
that any functionality that's redundant with the latest development<br>
version should only be removed once the next Isabelle release is out.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What would you recommend?  Thanks for your advice!</p>

In ProofGeneral at last (but probably also in jEdit), there is the<br>
Isabelle setting "Auto Solve Direct" -- which has also been present in<br>
Isabelle-2012 and -2013.</p>

<p>I wasn't complaining. I did say that this was only added to jedit recently,<br>
being unsure which version your are on.</p>
<p>Clearly you should only ship a version of your theories that work with a release<br>
version of Isabelle. Putting your library into the AFP lets you have two<br>
versions, release and development. We discussed that recently here:<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2013-September/msg00013.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2013-September/msg00013.html</a></p>
<p>In another project (CAVA) we decided to stick with the release version and I now<br>
feel it would have been better to update to the development version more frequently.</p>

<p>Again an important official announcement about proper names:</p>
<p>* "jEdit" is a sophisticated text editor written in Java, see also<br>
<a href="http://www.jedit.org/">http://www.jedit.org/</a></p>
<p>* "Isabelle/jEdit" uses regular jEdit with some plugin and some<br>
     outermost application wrapper to deliver an implementation of the<br>
     idea of "Prover IDE" for Isabelle.</p>
<p>So "Isabelle/jEdit" is the name of the product, not "jEdit".  Or do you <br>
call "Proof General" after its editor just "Emacs"?</p>
<p>Since jEdit as a text editor is not as widely known as Emacs, I can <br>
understand that people who get exposed to it for the first time via <br>
Isabelle/jEdit then think the "jEdit" aspect would be sufficient to name <br>
the product.  Due to this potential of confusion, it is particularly <br>
important to get the names right.</p>
<p>"jEdit" means <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">http://www.jedit.org/</a> and "Isabelle/jEdit" means the default <br>
Prover IDE of Isabelle.</p>
<p>More deeply, the main functionality of Isabelle/jEdit is actually provided <br>
by the Prover IDE infrastructure of Isabelle/Scala and its Isabelle/ML <br>
counterpart, which has replaced the old READ-EVAL-PRINT loop some years <br>
ago.  Thus other projects like Isabelle/Eclipse (from Newcastle) or Clide <br>
(from Bremen) can benefit from many of its concepts, independently of the <br>
Isabelle/jEdit front-end.</p>
<p>When you say "recent jEdit versions ... would point this out <br>
automatically", it is actually the document-oriented prover infrastructure <br>
of Isabelle PIDE that will support certain notions of "asynchronous print <br>
function" and "query operation" natively in the coming Isabelle2013-1 <br>
release.  On the surface this will give you spontaneous feedback from a <br>
suite of "automatically tried" tools, but there is much more behind it <br>
than a former quick-and-dirty implementation for Proof General done right.</p>
<p>I do have to insist in careful terminology here, since these are <br>
scientifically relevant steps forward in the general understanding of <br>
interactive theorem proving.  (People who don't follow this are welcome to <br>
go back to the HOL-Light TTY loop, CoqIDE, or even Proof General if they <br>
enrol it its mailing list to help the last maintainers there to hold out.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But this makes me wonder:</p>
<ol>
<li>Should I switch to the development version?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>You should say "a development version", or "some development version" -- <br>
the latter in the sense of Hilber Choice in HOL (which is in constrast to <br>
definite description from a singleton set).</p>
<p>Everybody is welcome to test-drive Isabelle repository snapshots at any <br>
time, but one needs to develop a sense what a proper release is and what <br>
an arbitrary snapshot is.</p>
<p>Presently we are getting close to release candidates for Isabelle2013-1, <br>
so joining now on isabelle-dev you will participate in sorting out the <br>
remaining problems, until Isabelle2013-1-RC1 ... RCn (n approximately 4) <br>
become available for public testing in October / November 2013 (which will <br>
be again on isabelle-users, not isabelle-dev.)</p>
<p>Note that I keep pointing out the difference of proper releases versus <br>
arbitrary snapshots, because the very idea of software releases is <br>
seriously endangered in recent years.  We see that in particular with <br>
Linux distributions, where the noisy masses are demanding more and more <br>
"rolling releases" to get latest things more quickly (including latest <br>
problems).  That has done great harm to many Linux distributions, even <br>
Ubuntu, and many of its bundled applications.  The pressure to produce <br>
things ever faster leads to a continous decline of software quality -- it <br>
is just impossible to make a system that is "always on" stable and robust <br>
for serious applications.</p>
<p>Testing Linux distributions for the coming Isabelle2013-1, I've already <br>
reached a new level of desparation: not just Fedora again, but also plain <br>
Ubuntu 13.04, which put my nicely working 12.04 LTS laptop into a totally <br>
unstable system after update; and this is not even 13.10 beta, just <br>
"stable" 13.04.  This is getting close to Windows 95 quality -- and <br>
Windows 8 is actually not too bad these days.</p>

<p>That is a question of somewhat different dimension.  AFP already does a <br>
pretty good job to absorb many "library" things.  Its content can grow for <br>
a given, fixed Isabelle release. The AFP editors and contributors need to <br>
develop this further over the years.</p>
<p>The key question right now and probably the start of this thread, is what <br>
is the relation of adhoc additions to the core libraries of main <br>
Isabelle/HOL vs. AFP.  Only then you have to cope with arbitrary <br>
repository snapshots.</p>
