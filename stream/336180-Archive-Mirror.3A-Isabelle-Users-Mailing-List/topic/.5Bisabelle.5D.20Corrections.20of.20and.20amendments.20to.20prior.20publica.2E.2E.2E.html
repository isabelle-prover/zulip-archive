<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Members of the Research Community,</p>
<p>After a very fruitful debate with Russell O'Connor (who provided the proof of <br>
Goedel's First Incompleteness Theorem in Coq) I would like to correct and <br>
update some of my earlier publications.</p>
<p>Also, with the kind permission of Russell O'Connor, his definitions for <br>
carrying out Goedel's First Incompleteness Theorem in Peter B. Andrews' logic <br>
Q0, an improved variant of Church's type theory, including a sample proof for a <br>
case of theorem V, are attached at the end of this e-mail. Andrews' logic Q0 is <br>
specified in [Andrews, 2002, pp. 210-215; Andrews, 1986, pp. 161-165]. A short <br>
description is available online at [Andrews, 2014]:<br>

<p>Finally, a comparison of the proofs of Goedel's First Incompleteness Theorem by <br>
Russell O'Connor (in Coq) and Lawrence C. Paulson (in Isabelle) is undertaken <br>
in order to foster the understanding of the proof. The type system implemented <br>
by O'Connor is particularly well suited for demonstrating the three different <br>
language levels in the proof.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Ken Kubota</p>
<p>I. Corrections</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The critique of a presentation of Goedel's First Incompleteness Theorem in <br>
my 2013 article [Kubota, 2013] applies to that particular presentation only, <br>
but not to the original publication of Goedel's First Incompleteness Theorem <br>
[Gödel, 1931]. Since the work with the criticized presentation is a standard <br>
work on higher-order logic, and the author of that work is usually extremely <br>
precise and accurate, I did not expect the criticized presentation to <br>
substantially differ from Goedel's original proof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hypothesis in my 2015 article [Kubota, 2015] that there is a significant <br>
difference in the results between axiomatic (Hilbert-style) deductive systems <br>
(called "object logics" in the article) and natural deduction systems (called <br>
"meta-logics" in the article) cannot be upheld.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, although some presentations of Goedel's First Incompleteness <br>
Theorem fail, this doesn't seem to apply to Goedel's original proof, nor does <br>
it apply to the formalized (mechanized) proofs provided by Russell O'Connor (in <br>
Coq) and others. The result of the formal proof can be interpreted in the sense <br>
that there is a formula (having the form of a sentence) that is neither <br>
provable nor refutable, but calling this "incompleteness" depends on a specific <br>
philosophical view, the semantic approach (model theory). If one doesn't share <br>
the semantic view, Goedel's theorem, although it seems formally correct, <br>
doesn't have the philosophical relevance often associated with it.</p>
<p>II. Summary of the Proof</p>
<ol>
<li>Mathematical (formal) part</li>
</ol>
<p>a) Goedel begins with the introduction of a number of definitions supposed to <br>
represent the form of a mathematical proof using mathematical (arithmetic) <br>
means, up to the last definition "Bew" (for "beweisbare Formel", i.e., <br>
"provable formula").</p>
<p>b) In theorem V, Goedel shows that each relation R (with the property of being <br>
primitive recursive) is definable within the logistic system by syntactical <br>
means (i.e., provability) only, in other words, for each R, there is an r (with <br>
the free variables u_1, ..., u_n), such that<br>
    R(x_1, ..., x_n) -&gt; Bew(  Sb(r, u_1, Z(x_1), ..., u_n, Z(x_n))  )<br>
where Z is the numeral function, which returns the number in the language of <br>
the embedded language when supplying a (natural) number of the logistic system <br>
in which the proof is undertaken.<br>
The proof is of a rather technical nature and quite lengthy, and, <br>
unfortunately, in his presentation Goedel only sketched the idea. For an <br>
example, see the attached presentation by Russell O'Connor.</p>
<p>c) Newer presentations refer to a fixed-point theorem called the diagonal lemma <br>
(or diagonalization lemma), which is rather implicit in Goedel's original <br>
proof. It can be used to construe a formula with the form of a sentence (a <br>
boolean-valued well-formed formula with no free variables) g of the embedded <br>
language, such that (simplified)<br>
    ~Bew(g)<br>
and<br>
    ~Bew(not g).</p>
<p>For an excellent introduction to the diagonal lemma, see [Raatikainen, 2015], <br>
available online at<br>
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/goedel-incompleteness/sup2.html">http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/goedel-incompleteness/sup2.html</a></p>
<p>In order to use the least amount of prerequisites, one may consider Goedel's <br>
proof of the (simplified) formula<br>
    ~Bew(g) /\ ~Bew(not g)<br>
as a purely formal proof, where the definition of "Bew" is simply an <br>
abbreviation of a more complex number-theoretic well-formed formula.</p>
<p>However, for establishing the philosophical meaning associated with Goedel's <br>
First Incompleteness Theorem, namely incompleteness, two philosophical <br>
assumptions are necessary.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Philosophical part I: Correctness of definitions</li>
</ol>
<p>The first philosophical assumption is the correspondence of the definitions up <br>
to "Bew" with the form of mathematical proofs. Although it is obvious that the <br>
definitions do establish a proper representation of mathematical proofs, this <br>
fact goes beyond the formal part. For example, a proof verification system (or <br>
proof assistant) may prove<br>
    ~Bew(g) /\ ~Bew(not g)<br>
as a formal theorem, showing that, given the definitions, this theorem can be <br>
obtained. But the software does not verify whether the definitions actually <br>
match the form of mathematical proofs; this task is left to the reader. Goedel <br>
himself emphasizes that the definability of (primitive) recursive relations in <br>
the system P is expressed by theorem V "_without_ reference to any <br>
interpretation of the formulas of P" [Gödel, 1931, p. 606, emphasis in the <br>
original].</p>
<p>Goedel speaks of yielding "an isomorphic image of the system PM in the domain <br>
of arithmetic, and all metamathematical arguments can just as well be carried <br>
out in this isomorphic image." [Gödel, 1931, p. 597, fn. 9] The isomorphism <br>
itself, however, can only be seen from top, from the meta-perspective, i.e., <br>
from outside of the logistic system in which the proof is undertaken. A direct <br>
reference of the formal system to its own propositions is not possible.</p>
<p>Accordingly, O'Connor distinguishes between a Goedel quote function and a <br>
Goedel numbering (or encoding) function, saying that propositions are "opaque". <br>
The Goedel numbering (or encoding) function "G isn't a function from <br>
propositions to natural numbers. It is supposed to be a function from <br>
<em>syntactic</em> formulas to natural numbers and the type of syntactic formulas is <br>
completely different from the type of propositions.  Computations over <br>
syntactic formulas can inspect the intension[al] structure of the formula, but <br>
propositions are opaque and no such computation is possible." [Russell <br>
O'Connor, e-mail to Ken Kubota, February 8, 2016]</p>
<p>The same consideration was made by the author when mentioning the <br>
"non-definability of the Goedel encoding function" previously at<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-January/msg00029.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-January/msg00029.html</a></p>
<p>By verifying the definitions (which is not a purely mathematical / formal task) <br>
one then can reasonably state that "Bew" can be interpreted as "provable", and <br>
that there is a formula with the form of a sentence (a proposition with no free <br>
variables) that is neither provable nor refutable.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Philosophical part II: The semantic approach</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming<br>
    1. the correctness of the formal proof, and<br>
    2. the correctness of the definitions,<br>
the result obtained so far is that a well-formed formula exists, or more <br>
specifically, a formula of the form of an arithmetic proposition exists, which <br>
can neither be proven nor refuted.</p>
<p>Following the semantic approach, according to which meaning is obtained by an <br>
interpretation in some kind of meta-theory, either "g" or "not g" must be true, <br>
hence there must be a true but unprovable theorem. This discrepancy between <br>
syntax (provability) and semantics (truth, meaning) is what is commonly called <br>
"incompleteness".</p>
<p>The implicit assumption made here and not discussed in the original publication <br>
of Goedel's First Incompleteness Theorem in [Gödel, 1931] is the use of the <br>
semantic approach (also called model-theoretic approach). In his completeness <br>
essay published a year earlier, Goedel already makes use of the model-theoretic <br>
approach in which semantic evaluation is performed by substitution at a <br>
meta-level, without explicitly pointing out the use of a specific philosophical <br>
assumption: "A formula of this kind is said to be valid (tautological) if a <br>
true proposition results from every substitution of specific propositions and <br>
functions for X, Y, Z, ... and F(x), G(x,y), ..., respectively [...]." [Gödel, <br>
1930, p. 584, fn. 3]</p>
<p>In order to speak of "incompleteness", an expectation of "completeness" is <br>
necessary, which is generally defined as the provability of all true <br>
propositions. Hence, incompleteness is only possible if semantics (meaning) <br>
differs from syntax, as is the case with model theory (the semantic approach).</p>
<p>But the semantic approach itself is a specific philosophical view and not <br>
inherent in mathematics. If one, like the author, does not share the semantic <br>
approach, but a purely syntactic approach, such that meaning in mathematics is <br>
obtained by syntactical inference only (and the few rules of inference have <br>
their legitimation in philosophy, outside of formal logic and mathematics), <br>
then by definition there is no distinction between syntax and semantics.</p>
<p>In summary, if one assumes the philosophical assumption of the semantic <br>
approach, then there is mathematical (arithmetic) incompleteness. But if one <br>
doesn't, Goedel's First Incompleteness Theorem only shows that there is a <br>
formula with the form of a well-formed (arithmetic) proposition which is <br>
neither provable nor refutable, but may also be considered meaningless. Not <br>
every well-formed formula (proposition) necessarily has to have a meaning, if <br>
one doesn't follow the semantic approach. "Mathematics is liquid" is <br>
grammatically corre<br>
