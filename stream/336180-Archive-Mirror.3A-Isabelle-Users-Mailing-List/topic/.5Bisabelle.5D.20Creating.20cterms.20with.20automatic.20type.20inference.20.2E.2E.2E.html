<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>I would like to understand if there exists a canonical method for creating<br>
cterms with automatic type inference from several distinct terms in<br>
Isabelle/ML, given that some of these distinct terms are supplied by the<br>
user.  Unfortunately, given that some of the consts that are used in the<br>
terms provided by the user are not known in advance, the methods that I am<br>
aware of do not seem to be directly applicable or may, potentially, result<br>
in certain malpractices.</p>
<p>For example, I would like to perform an automatic type inference and create<br>
a certified term in the context of the following (significantly) simplified<br>
use case:</p>
<p>ML ‹</p>
<p>val A = @{term "A::'al⇒'ar⇒bool"};<br>
val B = @{term "B::'bl⇒'br⇒bool"};<br>
val RF = @{term rel_fun} (*in the use case, RF can represent an arbitrary<br>
const accepting an arbitrary number of arguments, as supplied by the user*)</p>
<p>val uterm = RF $ A $ B;<br>
(* fails because type inference is not applicable: *)<br>
val cterm = Thm.cterm_of @{context} uterm;</p>
<p>›</p>
<p>Of course, the default names of the 'TFree' types that are generated for<br>
rel_fun in the example above are not suitable when $ is used for combining<br>
terms. *It is very important to note that <strong>in my use case </strong>RF is provided<br>
by the user and, therefore, it may be different from rel_fun.*</p>
<p>I am aware of two methods that can be used for the solution of the problem.<br>
However, these methods do not seem to be ideal for my application, given<br>
that the consts are provided by the user:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Provide "tailor-made" type inference for each const, similar to the<br>
methodology used in <a href="http://hologic.ml">hologic.ml</a>, e.g. HOLogic.mk_eq. Unfortunately, in my<br>
use case, functions like HOLogic.mk_eq need to be generated 'on the fly'<br>
based on the user input. This solution seems to require an investment of a<br>
certain amount of effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define terms as strings and use Syntax.read_term to generate terms from<br>
the strings. This solution does not seem to be safe, although, its<br>
implementation is almost trivial.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I provide a code that demonstrates the methods that I am referring to in<br>
the clauses above after my signature. However, please note that the code is<br>
merely an example that is meant for the demonstration of the problem and it<br>
does not contain (almost) any parts of the intended solution. Therefore,<br>
please ignore various malpractices that are not related to the problem (in<br>
particular, the code does not provide guarantees that unique names are used<br>
and omits all error checks).</p>
<p>*Lastly, I would like to provide a summary of the question : *</p>
<p>- If there is a canonical method for combining arbitrary terms with type<br>
   inference that is different from the methods suggested in clauses 1 and 2<br>
   above, then I would highly appreciate if you could let me know about it. If<br>
   such a method does not exist, then I would like to know whether the<br>
   solution in clause 2 above is considered to be a standard practice or not.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

val B = @{term "B::'bl⇒'br⇒bool"};</p>
<p>(* -------------------------------------------- *)</p>

<p>Solution 1: the solution was inferred from the method suggested in section<br>
3.2<br>
(and other sections) in the document "The Isabelle Cookbook"<br>
(May 28, 2015 draft) by Christian Urban. According to this solution,<br>
a tailor-made type inference procedure needs to be provided for each const.<br>
Of course, for many existing standard consts this functionality has<br>
already been provided in hologic.ML (e.g. HOLogic.mk_eq).</p>
<p>The solution is difficult to implement because the consts are<br>
supplied by the user. Therefore, functions similar to HOLogic.mk_eq need to<br>
be<br>
generated 'on the fly'. Effectively, this would require the development of<br>
the functionality<br>
that would enable automatic generation of a significant part of the content<br>
of <a href="http://hologic.ml">hologic.ml</a>.</p>

    (A --&gt; C) --&gt;<br>
    (B --&gt; D) --&gt;<br>
    boolT);</p>
<p>fun get_types_rel_fun fts gts = (nth fts 0, nth fts 1, nth gts 0, nth gts<br>

  )<br>
  $ R1 $ R2;</p>
<p>val cterm = Thm.cterm_of @{context} (mk_rel_fun (A, B));</p>
<p>(*<br>
Solution 2: inferred from the code on page 118 in<br>
the document "The Isabelle/Isar Implementation" by Makarius Wenzel.</p>
<p>Can be implemented with ease, but requires the construction of terms<br>
from strings. I am not certain if this is considered to be a standard<br>
practice.<br>

Dear MLA,</p>
<p>(re-sending as I forgot to Cc the list)</p>
<p>I there is not really a well-established canonical method, since the<br>
needs of tools are quite different in the details.</p>
<p>What tools usually do is try to get to a "fully typed" stage as soon as<br>
possible in the outermost layers, and then work with full type<br>
information internally, which means that you must usually carry types<br>
around everywhere.</p>
<p>What I would try is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure you get the user-provided constants / terms in a polymorphic<br>
version, i.e., with schematic type variables. Here, the function<br>
"Variable.polymorphic" should help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, construct the combined terms as you need them, and run type<br>
checking on this. (-&gt; Syntax.check_terms). I think this should<br>
instantiate the type variables properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then you should get terms on which Thm.cterm_of should work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Syntax.check_terms includes several specific things like<br>
insertion of coercions etc. But it is the most general answer to "how do<br>
I check / infer types".</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Alexander Krauss,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email. Indeed, your reply pointed me in the right<br>
direction.</p>
<p>It seems that there is a nearly canonical solution for my problem (without<br>
the explicit use of the schematic type variables). The solution involves<br>
the use of the “place-holder” type dummyT, which is defined in term.ML (I<br>
can only assume it was defined specifically for this use case), e.g.</p>
<p>ML ‹<br>
val f = Const ("HOL.eq", dummyT);<br>
val A = @{term "A::'b"};<br>
val q = (f $ A $ A)<br>
  |&gt; Syntax.check_term @{context}<br>
  |&gt; Thm.cterm_of @{context};<br>
›</p>
<p>This method is presented in Section 3.5 in "The Isabelle Cookbook" (May 28,<br>
2015 draft) by Christian Urban. I can hardly believe that I missed the<br>
relevant example upon the first reading. Regretfully, I only have several<br>
days of experience in Isabelle/ML coding, therefore, please accept my<br>
apologies for the naive question.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>From: Alexander Krauss &lt;<a href="mailto:krauss@in.tum.de">krauss@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Glad you got it to work. Yes, dummyT is treated like a type variable by<br>
type inference, so this is the simplest solution if you just have a<br>
single constant and must figure out the correct type.</p>
