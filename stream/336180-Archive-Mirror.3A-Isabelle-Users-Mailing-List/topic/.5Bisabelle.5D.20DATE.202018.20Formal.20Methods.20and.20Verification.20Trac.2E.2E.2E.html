<strong>*</strong>* DATE 2018 — Call for Papers — Topic D4 Formal Methods and Verification <strong>*</strong>**</p>
<p>Design Methods and Tools Track @ DATE 2018</p>
<p>Dresden, Germany - March 19-23, 2018</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DEADLINES</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract  : Sunday, September 10, 2017 23:59:59 CET</li>
<li>Full paper: Sunday, September 17, 2017 23:59:59 CET.</li>

<p>The 21st DATE conference and exhibition is the main European event bringing together designers and design automation users, researchers and vendors,<br>
as well as specialists in the hardware and software design, test and manufacturing of electronic circuits and systems.<br>
DATE puts strong emphasis on both technology and systems, covering ICs/SoCs, reconfigurable hardware and embedded systems, and embedded software.</p>
<p>The five-day event consists of a conference with plenary invited papers, regular papers, panels, hot-topic sessions, tutorials and workshops,<br>
two special focus days and a track for executives. The scientific conference is complemented by a commercial exhibition showing the state-of-the-art<br>
in design and test tools, methodologies, IP and design services, reconfigurable and other hardware platforms, embedded software, and (industrial) design experiences<br>
from different application domains, e.g. automotive, wireless, telecom and multimedia applications. The organisation of user group meetings, fringe meetings,<br>
a university booth, a PhD forum, vendor presentations and social events offers a wide variety of extra opportunities to meet and exchange information on relevant issues<br>
for the design and test community. Special space will also be allocated for EU-funded projects to show their results.</p>
<p>The conference addresses all aspects of research into technologies for electronic and (embedded) systems engineering.<br>
It covers the design process, test, and tools for design automation of electronic products ranging from integrated circuits to distributed large-scale systems.<br>
This includes both hardware and embedded software design issues. The conference scope also includes the elaboration of design requirements and new architectures<br>
for challenging application fields such as telecom, wireless communications, multimedia, healthcare and automotive systems.<br>
Persons involved in innovative industrial designs are particularly encouraged to submit papers to foster the feedback from design to research.<br>
Panels, hot-topic sessions and embedded tutorials highlight and inform about emerging topics.</p>
<p>The Design Methods and Tools track addresses design automation, design tools and hardware architectures for electronic and embedded systems.<br>
The emphasis is on methods, algorithms, and tools related to the use of computers in designing complete systems.<br>
The track’s focus includes significant improvements on existing design methods and tools as well as forward-looking approaches to model<br>
and design future system architectures, design flows, and environments.<br>
The Formal Methods and Verification topic (D4) is one of the fourteen topics foreseen in the Design Methods and Tools Track.</p>
<p>TOPIC DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Formal Methods and Verification topic (D4) is devoted to the presentation and discussion of state-of-the-art advances in the theory and practice of<br>
formal verification methods. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Formal verification and specification techniques, including equivalence checking, model checking, symbolic simulation, theorem proving,<br>
abstraction and refinement techniques, decomposition techniques and compositional reasoning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Core algorithmic technologies supporting formal verification such as SAT, BDD, and SMT techniques</p>
</li>
<li>Formal verification of hardware (including IPs, SoCs, and cores), software, hardware / software systems, timed and hybrid systems</li>
<li>Semi-formal verification techniques</li>
<li>Integration of verification into design flows</li>
<li>Challenges of multi-cores, both as verification targets and as verification host platforms</li>
<li>Formal synthesis</li>
<li>Applications of formal and semi-formal techniques to asynchronous designs, analog and mixed-signal designs,<br>
  power modelling and analysis, hardware and software security, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>TOPIC TECHNICAL COMMITTEE</p>
<p>Armin Biere, Universitaet Linz, AT (co-chair)<br>
Gianpiero Cabodi, Politecnico di Torino, IT<br>
Alessandro Cimatti, Fondazione Bruno Kessler - Center for Information technology, IT,<br>
Julien Schmaltz, Eindhoven University of Technology, NL<br>
Christoph Scholl, University Freiburg, DE (chair)<br>
Daryl Stewart, ARM, GB</p>
<p>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>Submission instructions can be found on the conference web page: <a href="http://www.date-conference.com">www.date-conference.com</a></p>
<p>Papers can be submitted either as Scientific Papers for Oral Presentation or as<br>
Scientific Papers for Interactive Presentation.</p>
<p>Oral presentations require novel and complete research work supported by experimental results.<br>
They will be evaluated with regard to their suitability for the conference, originality, and technical soundness.<br>
Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings (max six pages) and will be presented in<br>
either 30-minute ("long") or 15-minute ("short") slots in the conference program in front of an audience.<br>
The Program Committee reserves the right to reorient Oral-Presentation papers to Interactive-Presentation, to obtain the most suitable presentation format.</p>
<p>Interactive presentations are expected to articulate emerging and future design,<br>
verification and test problems including work in progress and identify open problems that merit innovative future research.<br>
Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings (max four pages) and will be presented in a face-to-face discussion area.<br>
Presenters are required to prepare a poster (up to A0 format) to help the discussion.</p>
<p>The accepted file format is PDF.<br>
Submissions should be formatted as close as possible to the final format:<br>
A4 or letter pages, double column, single spaced, Times or equivalent font of minimum 10pt<br>
(templates are available on the DATE Web site for your convenience).<br>
To permit blind review, manuscripts should not include the author names nor affiliations.<br>
Manuscripts not in line with the above rules might be discarded.</p>
<p>Deadlines: The deadline to submit papers is Sunday, September 10, 2017 23:59:59 CET. For a paper to be considered a valid submission, at least a title, abstract,<br>
and the complete list of authors (cannot be modified after Sunday, September 10, 2017 23:59:59 CET) should be submitted by this date.<br>
The full paper can be submitted at the same time or later, but must be uploaded at the latest by Sunday, September 17, 2017 23:59:59 CET.<br>
Otherwise the initial submission will be automatically withdrawn. Please note that there will not be any additional deadline extensions beyond Sunday, September 17, 2017 23:59:59 CET.</p>
