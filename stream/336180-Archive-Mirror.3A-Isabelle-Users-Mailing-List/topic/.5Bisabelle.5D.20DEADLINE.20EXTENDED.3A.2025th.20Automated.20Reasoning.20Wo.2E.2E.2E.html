25th AUTOMATED REASONING WORKSHOP 2018</p>
<p>University of Cambridge, 12-13 April 2018<br>

<p>CALL FOR ABSTRACTS AND STUDENT TRAVEL GRANT APPLICATIONS</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The 25th Automated Reasoning Workshop (ARW 2018) will take place at the <br>
University of Cambridge on 12-13 April 2018.</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>
<p>Ekaterina Komendantskaya (Heriot-Watt University)<br>
Lawrence Paulson (University of Cambridge)</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The workshop provides an informal forum for the automated reasoning <br>
community to discuss recent work, new ideas and applications, and <br>
current trends. It aims to bring together researchers from all areas of <br>
automated reasoning in order to foster links among researchers from <br>
various disciplines; among theoreticians, implementers and users alike.</p>
<p>Topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theorem proving in classical and non-classical logics;</li>
<li>
<p>Interactive theorem proving, logical frameworks, proof assistants, <br>
proof<br>
   planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasoning methods:<br>
     * Saturation-based, instantiation-based, tableau, SAT<br>
     * Equational reasoning, unification<br>
     * Constraint satisfaction<br>
     * Decision procedures, SMT<br>
     * Combining reasoning systems<br>
     * Non-monotonic reasoning, commonsense reasoning<br>
     * Abduction, induction<br>
     * Model checking, model generation, explanation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal methods to specifying, deriving, transforming and verifying <br>
computer systems, requirements and software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logic-based knowledge representation and reasoning:<br>
     * Ontology engineering and reasoning<br>
     * Domain specific reasoning (spatial, temporal, epistemic,agents, <br>
etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logic and functional programming, deductive databases</p>
</li>
<li>Implementation issues and empirical results, demos</li>
<li>Machine learning and automated reasoning systems</li>
<li>Practical experience and applications of automated reasoning</li>
</ul>
<p>The workshop will be highly interactive, giving all attendees an <br>
opportunity to participate. There will be sessions for displaying <br>
posters and open discussion sessions organised around specific topics <br>
such as "Automated Reasoning meets Artificial Intelligenceâ€.</p>
<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>We invite the submission of camera-ready, two-page extended abstracts <br>
about recent work, work in progress, or a system description.  The <br>
abstract can describe work that has already been published elsewhere. <br>
The main objective of the abstracts is to spread information about <br>
recent work in our community, and we expect to accept most on-topic <br>
submissions, but we may ask for revisions.</p>
<p>To prepare your submission, please use the ARW LaTeX style file provided <br>
from the workshop website. Each submission should include the names and <br>
complete addresses (including email) of all authors.  For the final <br>
versions we require all sources (TeX file and any input files).</p>
<p>Please send your submissions via EasyChair at <br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arw2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arw2018</a>. Correspondence will be <br>
sent to corresponding authors indicated on EasyChair.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION DETAILS</p>
<p>Abstracts will be published in informal workshop notes and will be made <br>
available on the workshop page. After the workshop we are hoping to <br>
solicit inaugural 25th anniversary of ARW articles for publication.</p>
<p>PRESENTATIONS</p>
<p>Each workshop participant will be asked to give a short talk (around 10 <br>
minutes depending on time constraints) to introduce their research. Each <br>
participant will also be allocated space in a poster session (poster <br>
size up to A0), where they can further present and discuss their work. <br>
Please prepare posters for the event.</p>
<p>STUDENT GRANTS</p>
<p>We have a limited number of grants available to support PhD students in <br>
attending the event. If you are interested, please refer to the workshop <br>
website for details. The deadline to apply for student grants is 1 March <br>
2018.</p>
