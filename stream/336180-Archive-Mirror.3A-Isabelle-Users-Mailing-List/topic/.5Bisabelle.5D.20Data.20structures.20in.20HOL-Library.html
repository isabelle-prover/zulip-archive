<p>From: Lukas Bulwahn &lt;<a href="mailto:bulwahn@in.tum.de">bulwahn@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi everyone,</p>
<p>in a private discussion with Andreas Lochbihler and Florian Haftmann, we <br>
have noticed that we should split the theories for data structures in <br>
HOL-Library (currently: RBT_Impl, RBT, AssocList, DList, CSet, Mapping) <br>
into more fine-grained theories.</p>
<p>If you require the implementation of one data structure, but you want to <br>
connect an abstract type with other data structure,<br>
the code equations must be manually deleted for one and added for the <br>
other because implementation and their connection to abstract type are <br>
within the same theory you would import from the Library.</p>
<p>Therefore, we propose the following naming scheme:</p>
<p>-- theories name of the representation types would end on "Impl", short <br>
for implementation.</p>
<p>-- theories that define the invariant-ensuring type and lift operations <br>
have no suffix in its theory name.</p>
<p>-- theories that connect the invariant-ensuring type and the abstract <br>
type are named by the scheme &lt;invariant-ensuring type&gt;_&lt;abstract type&gt;.</p>
<p>This would result in the following renamings:</p>
<p>for Red-Black trees: RBT_Impl remains RBT_Impl. RBT is split into RBT <br>
and RBT_Mapping.</p>
<p>for association lists: AssocList is split into AssocList_Impl and <br>
AssocList_Mapping. [AssocList is removed because AssocList has no <br>
invariant-ensuring type (yet).]</p>
<p>for distinct lists: DList is split into DList_Impl, DList, and DList_Cset.</p>
<p>for computable sets: Cset is split into Cset and List_Cset.</p>
<p>This way, the different layers are clearly separated in different theories.</p>
<p>For most users, this would mainly be noticed one would have to import, <br>
e.g., RBT_Mapping, instead of RBT to get executable Mappings based on <br>
red-black trees.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Lukas</p>
