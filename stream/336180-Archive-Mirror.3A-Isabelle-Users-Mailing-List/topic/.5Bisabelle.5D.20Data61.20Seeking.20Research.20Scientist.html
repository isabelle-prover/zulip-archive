<p>From: <a href="mailto:Gerwin.Klein@data61.csiro.au">Gerwin.Klein@data61.csiro.au</a><br>
We also have one open position for an early-career research scientist in formal verification.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Gerwin</p>
<p>Data61 Seeking Research Scientist<br>
=================================</p>
<p>We are looking for a full-time research scientist in formal verification to<br>
join us, the Trustworthy Systems group, at Data61, CSIRO. Our highly<br>
international team is located on the UNSW campus, close to the beautiful<br>
beaches of sunny Sydney, Australia, one of the world's most liveable cities.</p>
<p>Our vision is a world in which computer users can choose all three: correct,<br>
secure, and fast. We believe that most current approaches to building systems<br>
are fundamentally flawed. We aim to demonstrate a better way. Our approach is<br>
rooted in foundational, formal verification using theorem provers (e.g.,<br>
Isabelle, HOL4), and high-performance system design. If you find this vision<br>
appealing, and have ideas about how to pursue it, we want to hear from you.</p>
<p>Our team brings together a unique combination of expertise in systems,<br>
security, formal verification, and programming languages. We are the creators<br>
of seL4, the world's first operating system microkernel with a<br>
machine-checked proof (in Isabelle/HOL). seL4 boasts both extreme performance<br>
and foundational binary-level correctness and security proofs. We are also<br>
involved in CakeML, the most realistic verified compiler for a functional<br>
programming language, and a promising approach to scaling full verification<br>
up to applications code.</p>
<p>We are building on these successes in various directions, including<br>
concurrency (formal reasoning and implementation), timing (real-time<br>
guarantees and timing channels), and whole-system verification using<br>
component systems (e.g., CAmKES) and code+proof co-generation.</p>
<p>We publish in top conferences, and are involved in multiple international<br>
research collaborations. You will have the opportunity to teach at UNSW<br>
should you wish to take it. We have a flexible, friendly, and intellectually<br>
stimulating work environment.</p>
<p>We value diversity in all forms and welcome applications from people of all<br>
ages, including people with disabilities, and those who identify as LGBTIQ.<br>
See <a href="https://ts.data61.csiro.au/diversity/">https://ts.data61.csiro.au/diversity/</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The salary range for this position is AUD 95-103K (plus superannuation),<br>
depending on experience and qualifications.</p>
<p>Apply online here:<br>
<a href="https://jobs.csiro.au/job/Sydney%2C-NSW-Research-Scientist-in-Formal-Verification/438798200/">https://jobs.csiro.au/job/Sydney%2C-NSW-Research-Scientist-in-Formal-Verification/438798200/</a></p>
<p>Your application should include a cover letter, CV, short research statement,<br>
and contact information for two references.</p>
<p>This round of applications closes 21 November 2017.</p>
