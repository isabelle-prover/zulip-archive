Data61 Seeking Proof Engineers<br>
==============================</p>
<p>We are are hiring again!</p>
<p>If only there were a place where I could prove theorems for money,<br>
change the world, and have fun while doing it...</p>
<p>Sounds too good to exist?</p>
<p>In the Trustworthy Systems team at Data61 that's what we do for a<br>
living. We are the creators of seL4, the world's first fully formally<br>
verified operating system kernel with extreme performance and strong<br>
security &amp; correctness proofs. Our highly international team is located<br>
on the UNSW campus, close to the beautiful beaches of sunny Sydney,<br>
Australia, one of the world's most liveable cities.</p>
<p>We are looking for multiple motivated proof engineers who want to join<br>
our team in Sydney, move things forward, and have global impact. You<br>
would</p>
<p>- work on industrial-scale formal proofs in Isabelle/HOL<br>
  - develop formally verified infrastructure for building secure systems<br>
    on top of seL4</p>
<p>- contribute to improved proof automation and reasoning techniques<br>
  - apply formal proof to real-world systems and tools</p>
<p>To apply for this position, you should possess a significant subset of<br>
the following skills.</p>
<p>- functional programming in a language like Haskell, ML, or OCaml<br>
  - first-order or higher-order formal logic<br>
  - basic experience in C<br>
  - ability and desire to quickly learn new techniques<br>
  - undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, or similar<br>
  - ability and desire to work in a larger team</p>
<p>We are hiring at two levels, so if you are more qualified or<br>
experienced than the above would suggest, you can come in as a senior<br>
proof engineer.</p>
<p>If you additionally have experience</p>
<p>- in software verification with an interactive theorem prover such as<br>
    Isabelle/HOL, HOL4, or Coq, and/or</p>
<p>- with operating systems and microkernels</p>
<p>you should definitely apply!</p>
<p>If you have the right skills and background, we can provide training on<br>
the job. Continual learning is a central component of everything we do.<br>
You will work with a unique world-leading combination of OS and formal<br>
methods experts, students at undergraduate and PhD level, engineers,<br>
and researchers from 5 continents, speaking over 15 languages.<br>
Trustworthy Systems is a fun, creative, and welcoming workplace with<br>
flexible hours &amp; work arrangements.</p>
<p>We value diversity in all forms and welcome applications from people of<br>
all ages, including people with disabilities, and those who identify as<br>
LGBTIQ. See <a href="https://ts.data61.csiro.au/diversity/">https://ts.data61.csiro.au/diversity/</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Salary ranges, in AUD (plus superannuation):</p>
<ul>
<li>Junior Proof Engineer: 73k-93k</li>
<li>Senior Proof Engineer: 97k-105k<br>
depending on experience and qualifications.</li>
</ul>

transcript (if applicable), and contact information for two references.</p>
