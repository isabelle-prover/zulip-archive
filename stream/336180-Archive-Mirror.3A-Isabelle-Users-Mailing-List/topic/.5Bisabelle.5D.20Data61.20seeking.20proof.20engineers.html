We are are hiring again! 3 open positions for proof engineers in Sydney.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Gerwin</p>
<p>Data61 Seeking Proof Engineers<br>
==============================</p>
<p>If only there were a place where I could prove theorems for money, change the<br>
world, and have fun while doing it...</p>
<p>Sounds too good to exist?</p>
<p>In the Trustworthy Systems team at Data61 that's what we do for a living. We<br>
are the creators of seL4, the world's first fully formally verified operating<br>
system kernel with extreme performance and strong security &amp; correctness<br>
proofs. Our highly international team is located on the UNSW campus, close to<br>
the beautiful beaches of sunny Sydney, Australia, one of the world's most<br>
liveable cities.</p>
<p>We are looking for 3 motivated proof engineers who want to join our team in Sydney,<br>
move things forward, and have global impact. We are expanding our team,<br>
because seL4 is going places. There are active projects around the world in</p>
<p>- Automotive - because cars have been hacked enough<br>
  - Aviation - for more security and safety for autonomous vehicles<br>
  - Defence - protecting confidential information<br>
  - Connected consumer devices - with security built in from the start<br>
  - Spaceflight - because awesome</p>
<p>To make these projects successful, we need to scale formal verification.<br>
You would</p>
<p>- work on industrial-scale formal proofs in Isabelle/HOL<br>
  - develop formally verified infrastructure for building secure systems<br>
    on top of seL4</p>
<p>- contribute to improved proof automation and better reasoning techniques<br>
  - apply formal proof to real-world systems and tools</p>
<p>To apply for this position, you should possess a significant subset of the<br>
following skills.</p>
<p>- functional programming in a language like Haskell, ML, or OCaml<br>
  - first-order or higher-order formal logic<br>
  - basic experience in C<br>
  - ability and desire to quickly learn new techniques<br>
  - undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, or similar<br>
  - ability and desire to work in a larger team</p>
<p>We are hiring at two levels, so if you are more qualified or experienced than<br>
the above would suggest, you can come in as a senior proof engineer.</p>
<p>If you additionally have experience</p>
<p>- in software verification with an interactive theorem prover such as<br>
    Isabelle/HOL, HOL4, or Coq, and/or</p>
<p>- with operating systems and microkernels</p>
<p>you should definitely apply!</p>
<p>If you have the right skills and background, we can provide training on the<br>
job. Continual learning is a central component of everything we do. You will<br>
work with a unique world-leading combination of OS and formal methods<br>
experts, students at undergraduate and PhD level, engineers, and researchers<br>
from 5 continents, speaking over 15 languages. Trustworthy Systems is a fun,<br>
creative, and welcoming workplace with flexible hours &amp; work arrangements.</p>
<p>We value diversity in all forms and welcome applications from people of all<br>
ages, including people with disabilities, and those who identify as LGBTIQ.<br>
See <a href="https://ts.data61.csiro.au/diversity/">https://ts.data61.csiro.au/diversity/</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Salary ranges for this position, in AUD (plus superannuation):</p>
<ul>
<li>Junior: 80-91K</li>
<li>Senior: 95-103K<br>
depending on experience and qualifications.</li>
</ul>

The good news is that a lot of helpful people seem to have read this to the end.</p>
<p>The also good news (but bad news for my embarrassment) is that the closing date is of course not Nov 2017. It is 15 April 2018. </p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Gerwin</p>
