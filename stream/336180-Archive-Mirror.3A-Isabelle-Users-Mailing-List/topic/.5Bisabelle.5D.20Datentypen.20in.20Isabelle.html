Hi,<br>
I’ve a question regarding Datatypes in Isabelle/HOL. I want to define a new Datatype which is modeled as a set of tupels of traces where a trace is a list of some basic actions:<br>
  typedecl actions<br>
  type_synonym trace = "(actions list) × (actions list)"<br>
  type_synonym program = "trace set"</p>
<p>However I need to restrict the structure of the list: The list of action elements have to obey some constraints in order to be of type trace.<br>
At the moment I define a normal set to state the constraints of a trace and all my theorems are stated with “P” of type “program”  and include a separate assumption “P &lt;= CP” in order<br>
to make use of some properties elicited by the set CP. The set CP is defined as follows:<br>
  inductive_set<br>
    CP :: compensable_program<br>
  where<br>
    cp_skip: "([], []) ∈ CP" |<br>
    cp_error: "([!], []) ∈ CP" |<br>
    cp_a_base: "([Some a], [Some (inverse a)]) ∈ CP" |<br>
    cp_a_ind: "(p, pi) ∈ CP ⟹ (Some a # p, pi @ [Some (inverse a)]) ∈ CP"</p>
<p>This works fine, however it would be much nicer if I could define a Datatype CP instead of using the set CP. Hence I could state all the theorems simply as “P” of type “CP” without the assumption that “P” is a subset of CP.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Diego</p>

Dear Diego,</p>
<p>at the moment, program is just a type abbreviation, not a type constructor. <br>
Hence, you can use all functions on sets for programs, e.g., membership, <br>
subsets, bounded quantification. When you want to restrict the type of programs <br>
to those sets of traces from CP, you have to model program as a type of its own, <br>
i.e., you must define all the set operations you need on the new type. It is up <br>
to you to decide whether this is worth the effort. Here's how you would do it in <br>
Isabelle2012:</p>
<p>inductive_set CP ...</p>
<p>typedef (open) program = "Pow CP" by auto</p>
<p>This defines the new type program. It is inhabited by all sets of traces all of <br>
which are in CP. The function Abs_program constructs from an arbitrary set of <br>
traces the program that inhabits type program, Rep_program unpacks a program <br>
into the set of traces. For sets of traces not all of which are in CP, <br>
Abs_program is unspecified. Since you make assumptions about the sets of traces <br>
that are programs, you cannot define program via datatype.</p>
<p>The new lifting facility might help you in transferring and working with the <br>
type program.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
Andreas</p>
<p>PS: The rule cp_a_base in CP's definition is redundant, because it is a special <br>
case of cp_a_ind with cp_skip for the premise and simplification for @.</p>
