<p>Extended Deadline:<br>
  Abstracts: May 20, 2016<br>

<p>The abstracts of contributed talks and posters will be published on the<br>
conference proceedings website. The length is maximum 300 words.<br>
Abstracts and posters should be submitted in as unformatted texts on the<br>
Easy Chair system: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cadgme2016">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cadgme2016</a></p>
<p>Aims of the working group eduTPS:</p>
<p>Mathematics is not only calculating, numeric and symbolic calculation,<br>
not only explaining with figures --- the distiguishing feature of math<br>
is justifying and deducing properties of mathematical objects and<br>
operations on firm grounds of logics.<br>
So Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) model calculation, Dynamic Geometry<br>
Systems (DGS) model figures --- and (Computer) Theorem Provers (TPS)<br>
model deduction and reasoning, mechanised by formal logic.</p>
<p>TPS are widely unknown despite the fact, that recent advances in<br>
mathematics could not have been done without them (e.g. mechanised<br>
proofs of the Four Colour Theorem, of the Kepler Conjecture, etc.), that<br>
TPS are becoming indispensable in verification of requirements on<br>
complex technical systems (e.g. google car) and despite the fact, that<br>
leading TPS have math mechanised from first principles (axioms) to all<br>
undergraduate math and beyond.<br>
So the working group "eduTPS: justifying (in) math" addresses a wide<br>
range of topics, from educational concepts of reasoning, explaining and<br>
justifying and from respective classroom experience on the one side to<br>
technical concepts and software tools, which mechanise and support these<br>
mathematical activities, on the other side.</p>
<p>We elicit contributions from educators to the educational side as well<br>
as from TP experts to the technical side --- the working group shall<br>
interactively elaborate on the connections between the two sides,<br>
connections which are not yet clarified to a considerable extent.<br>
Narrowing the apparent gap between TP technology and educational<br>
practice (and theory!) concerns the distinguishing essence of<br>
mathematics and may well lead to considerable innovations in how we<br>
teach and learn mathematics in the future.</p>
<p>Points of interest include:</p>
<p>* Adaption of TP -- concepts and technologies for education: knowledge<br>
    representation, simplifiers, reasoners; undefinednes, level of<br>
    abstraction, etc.</p>
<p>* Requirements on software support for reasoning -- reasoning appears<br>
    as the most advanced method of human thought, so at which age<br>
    which kind of support by TP should be provided?</p>
<p>* Automated TP in geometry -- relating intuitive evidence with logical<br>
    rigor: specific provers, adaption of axioms and theorems, visual<br>
    proofs, etc.</p>
<p>* TP components in SW for engineers -- Formal Methods<br>
    increasingly advance into engineering practice, so educational<br>
    software based on TP components could anticipate that advancement.</p>
<p>* Levels of authoring -- in order to cope with generality of TP:<br>
    experts adapt to specifics of countries or levels, teachers adapt<br>
    to courses and students.</p>
<p>* Adaptive dialogues, students modeling and learning paths -- services<br>
    for user guidance provided by TP technology: which interfaces<br>
    enable flexible generation of adaptive user guidance?</p>
<p>* Next-step-guidance -- suggesting a next step when a student gets<br>
    stuck in problem solving: which computational methods can extend<br>
    TP for that purpose?</p>
<p>* TP as unifying foundation -- for the integration of technologies<br>
 like CAS, DGS, Spreadsheets etc: interfaces for unified support of<br>
    reasoning?</p>
<p>* Continuous tool chains -- for mathematics education from high-school<br>
    to university, from algebra and geometry to graph theory, from<br>
educational tools to professional tools for engineers and<br>
    scientists.</p>
