<p>From: "John F. Hughes" &lt;<a href="mailto:jfh@cs.brown.edu">jfh@cs.brown.edu</a>&gt;<br>
As a mathematician, I thought I had a decent idea of what a "function" was,<br>
but perhaps I'm missing something important. Looking at</p>
<p><a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Projective_Geometry/Projective_Space_Axioms.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Projective_Geometry/Projective_Space_Axioms.html</a></p>
<p>I see the following (slightly edited by thinning comments):</p>
<p>(* One has a type of points *)<br>
typedecl "points"<br>
(* One has a type of lines *)<br>
typedecl "lines"<br>
(* There is a relation of incidence between points and lines *)<br>
consts incid :: "points ⇒ lines ⇒ bool"<br>
 axiomatization where<br>
(* The relation of incidence is decidable *)<br>
incid_dec: "(incid P l) ∨ ¬(incid P l)"</p>
<p>That last axiom seems to me to follow from the nothing that "incid" is a<br>
function, and that {True, False} is its codomain. Can someone explain to me<br>
why this might not be so?</p>
<p>I'm quite happy with the notion that it might not be known to Isabelle<br>
whether "incid P l" is True or False, and indeed, perhaps in some situation<br>
where "incid" is described or characterized peculiarly, it might not be<br>
possible for Isabelle to determine which of the two values it takes ---<br>
exactly what Isabelle can compute is still baffling to me. But it seems to<br>
me that if Isabelle is in fact modeling mathematical functions, then "incid<br>
P l" is either True or False, in which case its negation is either False or<br>
True respectively, hence the disjucntion is always True, and this needn't<br>
be an additional axiom. So I'm a little bit mystified.</p>

<p>This use of "typedecl" and "axiomatization" is somewhat "old-fashioned".<br>
These days, one would probably just use a locale for this kind of thing,<br>
which has the advantage of being modular in the sense that you can<br>
actually give different interpretations for these constants instead of<br>
axiomatising them in the logic.</p>

<p>It follows from the law of the excluded middle. This is an axiom in HOL,<br>
so it is superfluous here. My guess would be that the author comes from<br>
the word of constructive type theory (e.g. Coq); the comment about<br>
"decidability" of incidence certainly seems to suggest that. In a system<br>
like Coq, the statement "P x ∨ ¬P x" is not necessarily true for all P<br>
and if it is true, it means that P is a decidable predicate.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the style of this AFP entry is a bit unidiomatic for<br>
Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: I don't actually know very much about Coq and constructive<br>
type theory. I hope what I said is mostly correct)</p>
