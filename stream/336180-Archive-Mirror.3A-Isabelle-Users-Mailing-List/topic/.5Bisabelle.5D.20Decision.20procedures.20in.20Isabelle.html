Hello,</p>
<p>I'm wondering about the decision procedures present in Isabelle - which<br>
ones have been implemented.</p>
<p>In particular, I am considering implementing some, probably based on<br>
term normalisation, and then trying to automatically find bijective<br>
mappings between theories in progress and those to which known decision<br>
procedures apply. Any comments and suggestions on existing work in<br>
Isabelle (or other systems) is most welcome.</p>
<p>thanks,<br>
lucas</p>

Dear Lucas,</p>
<p>Here are the decision procedures I know of in Isabelle. There are surely<br>
more, which are not related to arithmetic.</p>
<p>1) First-order formulas (semi-decision) --- This is early work by Larry<br>
Paulson and "recent" work by Joe Hurd. Of course they are available in<br>
all HOL families.</p>
<p>2) Fourrier-Motzkin method for linear arithmetic. This is also available<br>
in all HOL Families and as far as I heard also in Coq (maybe an other<br>
algorithm Omega by Pugh which works for integers). Typically it proves<br>
universal theorems over linear real arithmetic, but it can be very<br>
easily changed to prove theorems over the integers (and consequently<br>
natural numbers). This is also available in Isabelle and HOL Light (I<br>
guess in HOL4 too).</p>
<p>3) Quantifier elimination for linear integer arithmetic (Presburger<br>
Arithmetic). This is available in Isabelle/HOL, HOL Light and HOL 4</p>
<p>4) Quantifier elimination for Tarski-algebra (Real numbers with plus and<br>
times and ordering). This is available in HOL Light and in HOL (88?).<br>
Not yet in Isabelle, but there is some work going on.</p>
<p>5) Quantifier elimination for the complex numbers. This is available in<br>
HOL Light and I have also ported it to Isabelle/HOL but never found its<br>
way in to the distribution, because it was quite slow on interesting<br>
examples and there was no real applications.</p>
<p>6) Quantifier elimination for Dense linear orders. This is available in<br>
Isabelle/HOL (Maybe in other HOL families --- but is really too simple<br>
to be worth mentioning).</p>
<p>7) Quantifier elimination for linear real arithmetic. This is available<br>
in Isabelle/HOL (the algorithm of Ferrante Rackoff and if you do some<br>
transformations you can apply a Variant of Loos Weispfenning formalized<br>
by Tobias Nipkow).</p>
<p>There is also a version where you are allowed to multiply quantifier<br>
variables with non-linear parameters.</p>
<p>All theses apply to any ordered zero-totalized field (and hence for the<br>
real numbers are a subclass of Tarski-algebra).</p>
<p>8) Universal inequalities over the real numbers --- Using sums of<br>
squares and semidefinite programming. This is available in HOL Light and<br>
has also been ported to Isabelle/HOL. Laurent Thery also ported two<br>
years (or so) ago to Coq.</p>
<p>9) Universal equalities in Rings (using Groebner Bases). This is<br>
available in HOL Light and Isabelle. The extension to an interesting<br>
forall-exists fragment for ring-equalities is also available in both<br>
systems. In Coq there is a very basic version of this which tells you OK<br>
if two ring terms are equal (without using assumptions).</p>
<p>10) Quantifier elimination for mixed linear-real arithmetic (using the<br>
floor-function). This is available in Isabelle/HOL. I am not aware of<br>
any other theorem prover having this decision procedure.</p>
<p>11) There is also a formalization of DPLL (T) and SAT by Filip Maric and<br>
Predrag Janicic in Isabelle/HOL</p>
<p>Hope it helps,<br>
Amine.<br>
You might be interested in glancing at the following paper which<br>
addresses the issue of writing proof-method which work under<br>
interpretation of locales --- i.e. apply to several structures at once:</p>

<p>I believe the "Omega" implemented in Coq is just F-M elimination (and<br>
thus incomplete for the integers).  This was the case a few years ago.<br>
The full Omega is implemented in HOL4, and is a quantifier elimination<br>
procedure for Presburger arithmetic over the integers.  I recommend<br>
its implementation if you're looking for something to do in Isabelle:<br>
it performs better than Cooper's algorithm on many typical problems.<br>
(There are also other problems where Cooper's is better.)</p>
