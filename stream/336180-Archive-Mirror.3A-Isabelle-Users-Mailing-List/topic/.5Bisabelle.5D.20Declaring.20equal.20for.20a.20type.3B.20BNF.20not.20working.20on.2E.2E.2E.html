<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I think I understand that BNF is a work in progress, but I report some <br>
errors I get when trying to use it. I'll do that second, since the first <br>
part sets the context. The good news is that it works well enough to use it.</p>
<p>For the first part, I have a datatype, "'a mT", and an equality function <br>
for that type, mTeq. I want to declare mTeq as equality for "'a mT", but <br>
I don't understand all the complexities of overloading in Isabelle.</p>
<p>I want to make the simple statement, "foo x y ==&gt; (x::'a mT) = y", but I <br>
can't. I would have to introduce new notation for "=", and then use that.</p>
<p>For anyone who has time, I give a brief summary of my application, I <br>
include the source at the bottom, and I attach the file.</p>
<p>I have a main datatype:</p>
<p>datatype 'a mT =<br>
   mTp "'a * int"<br>
  |mTL "'a mT list"</p>
<p>And then a secondary datatype:</p>
<p>datatype_new 'a mS =<br>
   mSp "'a * int"<br>
  |mSS "'a mS fset"</p>
<p>The type "'a mT" is list of ordered pairs, and nested lists of ordered <br>
pairs. For a pair "mTp (x,y)", y is the multiplicity, where the <br>
multiplicities of pairs with the same first component name, at the save <br>
level of nesting, can be added together. The type int allows for <br>
negative quantities, where int could be replaced with a type class, such <br>
as linordered_ab_group_add.</p>
<p>For an equality function, I first define a function mTcomb, which <br>
combines any pairs with the same name, at the same level of nesting, <br>
into one pair, by adding their multiplicities.</p>
<p>I then define a function mTset. This converts lists to fsets, the lists <br>
and fsets used in the constructors <code>mTL "'a mT list"</code> and <code>mSS "'a mS 
fset"</code>.</p>
<p>My equality function is then mTeq, with 3 simple cases, and the fourth <br>
case using mTcomb and mTset:</p>
<p>"mTeq (mTL x) (mTL y) = (mTset (mTL(mTcomb [] (mTL x))) = mTset <br>
(mTL(mTcomb [] (mTL y))))"</p>
<p>That takes you to the bottom of my file, where I try to instantiate type <br>
mT as type class equal. It doesn't work, which makes me wonder why I <br>
think I need to do that.</p>
<p>---CONCERNING BNF ERRORS</p>
<p>As to BNF, again I have this datatype:</p>
<p>datatype_new 'a mS =<br>
   mSp "'a * int"<br>
  |mSS "'a mS fset"</p>
<p>What I think I've found is that I can use it on the right side of <br>
recursive functions, but I can't use it on the left side.</p>
<p>I try using datatype_new_compat, and also primrec instead of fun. I <br>
tried to define a function to use "'a mS fset option", but it doesn't <br>
work, where a function like that for mT does work.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch">andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Gottfried,</p>
<p>You cannot define equality in Isabelle/HOL for any type as you wish, as the HOL axioms <br>
already define it for all types. The datatype package (and the BNF package) introduce an <br>
algebraic type whose constructors are free, i.e., injective and their ranges pairwise <br>
distinct. If you want to have a coarser notion of equality, you can define your own <br>
function such as mTeq with fancy notation such as (infix "==="), but you cannot use HOL <br>
equality = for it, and the proof tools (esp. the simplifier) will not treat it as equality <br>
either.</p>
<p>If you really want a type with your custom equality relation, you have to quotient your <br>
datatype through your custom equality relation [1] or directly construct a type with <br>
non-free type constructors [2]. You find more information on that in the references, but I <br>
have not examined your use case to see which route seems easier or feasible.</p>

The BNF crew can officially consider that this error report has been <br>
resolved to my satisfaction, primarily because I should have been using <br>
primrec_new instead of primrec, though up to this point, I've stayed <br>
away from using primrec, because the magic of fun can kick in where the <br>
magic of primrec ends. Consequently, there being no fun_new caused me to <br>
forget about primrec_new, until things led me back to datatype.pdf</p>
<p>Here, Andrea's answer to my question about equality led me to a <br>
reference he gave me, which led me back to datatype.pdf.</p>
<p>I don't care that I can't make fun work with datatype_new, as long as <br>
primrec_new is working for me.</p>
<p>However, if one of the BNF crew cares, below is what I get, which could <br>
be due to me doing things wrong, or not knowing how to register <br>
something to make it work. I give an example of "value" returning an <br>
error, where I know that "value" and the code generator can be a whole <br>
different matter.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Andreas,</p>
<p>Thanks for the help again. I looked at [2] a little, but without knowing <br>
the advantages of either, I'd pick [2] over [1]. That's because I <br>
constantly see emails about lifting and transfer, where quotients are a <br>
part of that, so I need to learn all that anyway. The doc [2] also gives <br>
some instruction about specific Isar commands related to that, and <br>
explains things like Reb and Abs.</p>
<p>From [1], they write, "Building a theory library that implements a new <br>
abstract type can take a lot of work." If I knew my datatype was going <br>
to be a winner, then I'd want to research it all and set things up <br>
right, because you only want to do things once. However, the datatype <br>
could be a loser, so I first need to prove enough theorems about it to <br>
think it's worth setting up in a more sophisticated way.</p>
<p>Also, I need the experience working with more basic things anyway, <br>
because I'm still working on learning how to use datatype, fun, primrec, <br>
and function.</p>
<p>Thinking about equality can be a brainbuster, because it's so basic, and <br>
you generally just use "=".</p>
<p>Other than the methods you mentioned, there's an easy way to associate a <br>
function with HOL.eq, and that's with an axiom.</p>
<p>That's what I did with another type, where the type has to have axioms. <br>
I can easily say `theorem bar [intro?]: "foo a b ==&gt; a = b", because the <br>
axiom says "(foo a b) &lt;-&gt; (a = b)". So "=" is still the function HOL.eq, <br>
but the intro rule makes it easy to set up proving equality, which came <br>
from a tip by Lars.</p>
<p>I thought using my new type in a local might be the thing to do, but I <br>
don't understand locales that well. From what you told me, I sort of <br>
left off here:</p>
<p>1) Variable 'a is special.</p>
<p>2) Instantiation sometimes works in the background to help you out, but <br>
sometimes it doesn't, at which times you must know what you're doing.</p>
<p>I put me an assumes axiom in a local like this:</p>
<p>locale mTloc =<br>
assumes mTeq_ax: "mTeq == HOL.eq"<br>
begin<br>
theorem mTeq_imp_HOL_eq [simp]:<br>
"(mTeq x y) ==&gt; (x = y)"<br>
by (metis (full_types) mT.distinct(1) mTeq.simps(3) mTeq_ax)<br>
end</p>
<p>Doing that confused the issue for me even more about how type variables <br>
are used in locales. First, the locale complains with this warning:</p>
<p>"Additional type variable(s) in locale specification "mTloc": 'a∷type "</p>
<p>It then uses 'b variables in the theorem. My goal was to determine <br>
whether what's proved in the locale is only true in the locale, where I <br>
already know that some things proved in a local are not completely <br>
localized:</p>
<p>locale P_by_sorry<br>
begin<br>
theorem P_is_true: "P" sorry<br>
end</p>
<p>theorem "True &amp; False"<br>
by(rule, simp, rule P_by_sorry.P_is_true)</p>
<p>So I tried to prove this outside the locale:</p>
<p>theorem "(mTeq x y) ==&gt; (x = y)"<br>
(*variables:<br>
x, y :: 'a mT<br>
type variables:<br>
'a :: type *)<br>
oops</p>
<p>It can't use the locale theorem to prove the global theorem because the <br>
locale theorem is using 'b variables, and the global theorem is using 'a <br>
variables. I am left pondering the subject of type variables, though I <br>
must move on.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>Dmitriy,</p>
<p>Thanks. One error leads to another. That got me to the usual type of errors:</p>
<p>Wellsortedness error:<br>
Type 'a∷type mS not of sort equal<br>
No type arity mS :: equal</p>
<p>I might figure out how to fix that someday. On the other hand, my type <br>
mT, which is based on lists rather than fsets, doesn't give me that <br>
error, so it's just easier to go with the magic.</p>

<p>I guess it should be obvious that I wouldn't want the axiom "mTeq x y <br>
&lt;-&gt; x = y" anywhere, since I'll commonly have "mTeq x y = True" when I <br>
have "HOL.eq x y = False". I suppose that's the difference between <br>
starting with a new type where you make all the rules, and a type you <br>
use which already has lots of rules with it.</p>
