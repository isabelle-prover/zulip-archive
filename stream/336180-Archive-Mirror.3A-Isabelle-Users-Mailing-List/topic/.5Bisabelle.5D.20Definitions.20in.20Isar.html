<p>No. What's being talked about on [isabelle-dev] and what I'm thinking <br>
about are apparently two different things. I'd say I'm wasting your <br>

<p>I'm wasn't talking about proofs, but having to use any HOL operator, <br>

<p>This next definition is what I'm talking about, which is the one single <br>

don't care if you tell me that, but I'd hate to be forced to always work <br>
at the object-logic level soley because that's what you think I should do.</p>
<p>I'm imagining some 2-year plan by the devs to push the meta-logic <br>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I'll generalize this comment thread I started, and here I'll play the <br>
part of Joe User Advocate. The details I was talking about are covered <br>
by this generalization, and after this I'll just take what comes. I <br>
don't expect any changes to be withheld because of me, and I'm basically <br>
going to start making all my plans based on what the next release is.</p>
<p>Maybe two weeks ago, my perception was that Isabelle2012 is a prime-time <br>
product, not a throw-away research product, as it's been described in <br>
the past by one of the primary developers.</p>
<p>Today, I'm thinking about two points, based on how I've seen changes <br>
implemented:</p>
<p>1) For Isabelle/HOL, there is zero commitment to backwards compatibility <br>
by the developers.</p>
<p>2) For Isabelle/HOL, there is no long term, future forecasts published <br>
by the developers so that users can plan for the future, to help users <br>
not get tied into things which are going to disappear.</p>
<p>Here, I'm reminded of an email by a user about three months ago who had <br>
put a lot of work into a version such as Isabelle2009, but who is now <br>
out of luck with the new versions. Change is necessary, but I take that <br>
as a lesson for what's coming down the road for me.</p>
<p>Formalizing math is a multi-year project, like a 10, 20, or 30 year <br>
project. From today, I estimate that in five years, I might have <br>
something that's worthwhile. I don't want to put a year or more of work <br>
into something, and then not be able to use it.</p>
<p>The short story is that I've decided that I could get locked into <br>
Isabelle2012 today, and it would get me through another 20 years, <br>
running either on Windows, Linux, or on VirtualBox. Being prepared to <br>
get locked into any version is my solution to 1) and 2) above.</p>
<p>I would lose the ability to coordinate what I do with others, but I'm my <br>
own highest priority. I don't have to wonder whether the ZFC axioms are <br>
going to be the same in 6 months, so I'm not going to stay in some <br>
constant state of flux as far as the software.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that a running, multi-year forecast of changes be <br>
published, to help other Joe Users get a feel for the future.</p>

<p>That was not really on the thread that you have seen on isabelle-dev. <br>
Basic == of Isabelle/Pure is perfectly adequate for situations where you <br>
make Pure definitions, e.g. like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>definition MFalse :: "prop" where<br>
 "MFalse == (!!P. PROP P)"</p>

<p>When you work in Isabelle/HOL, what most users do most of the time, it is <br>
better to use its plain =, though.  This helps to make specifications and <br>
proofs uniform and with reduced surprise of proof tools that cannot cope <br>
with pure == (e.g. certain calculation reasoning rules in HOL).</p>

<p>The general principle is: the right tool for the right job.  When you work <br>
in Isabelle/Pure directly, without Isabelle/HOL, then == is fine, and in <br>
fact the only option for actual "meta" definitions.</p>
<p>Other object-logics like Isabelle/ZF cannot internalize all definition <br>
forms into their own = and sometimes have to evade into Pure for that, but <br>
this extra complication is not needed in Isabelle/HOL.</p>

<p>Does it mean you are not converted to Isabelle2013 yet?  Isabelle release <br>

<p>You should say "Isabelle" in general, not Isabelle/HOL (before you have <br>
pointed out an interest to work directly with Isabelle/Pure, ignoring the <br>
huge Isabelle/HOL library).</p>
<p>I am myself involved in Isabelle only since 1993, but I've never seen a <br>
commitment to "backwards compatibility".  Instead there has always been a <br>
natural flow of updating the system technically, conceptually, introducing <br>
new things, discontinuing old things (the latter requires a lot of work).</p>
<p>Without that principle, Isabelle2012 would not have been as nice as it was <br>
last year (now Isabelle2013 is nicer).  You may also browse through the <br>
recorded history to see yourself if you want to stack back in 1993:</p>
<p><a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/831a9a7ab9f3">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/831a9a7ab9f3</a></p>
<p>or lets say 1998:</p>
<p><a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/be6b5edbca9f">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/be6b5edbca9f</a></p>
<p>The 1998 vintage was actually an exceptionally good one.</p>

<p>Isabelle2009 was a long time ago.  People who don't mange to keep <br>
up-to-date all the time can put their material into shape for AFP, where <br>
it usually gets updated "automagically".</p>

<p>You can look at Isabelle/NEWS to get a feeling for the continuity of <br>
changes in Isabelle, and project them into the future.</p>
<p>If I compare this to the Java distribution that is even a bit younger than <br>
Isabelle, I wonder which project turns out as more professional and <br>
reliable in the end.</p>
<p>E.g. see <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/">http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/</a> for the precise forecast <br>
that has been changed so many times.  Tomorrow should be the "Developer <br>
Preview" of Java 8, and <em>if</em> it happens I expect it to have most of the <br>
old problems of Java 7 again, in perfect backwards compatibility.</p>

complex, the vulgar masses will corrupt the official Latin either out of <br>
ignorance, or to make it practical to use in everyday conversation.</p>
<p>I can call '==' an Isabelle/Pure operator, but then the emphasis is all <br>
wrong. There are three Isabelle/Pure operators, \&lt;And&gt;, !!, and ==, that <br>
are a seamless part of the Isar language. Because the high-level part of <br>
Isar is the high-level language I want to use, I want vocabulary that <br>
emphasizes that's the level I'm concerned about.</p>
<p>Inside a command ML{...}, I would never call the '=' operator an Isar <br>
operator, even though I've been told that everything between "theory" <br>
and "end" is Isar.</p>
<p>However, given the inner syntax part of the two lines <code>theorem "A == B"</code> <br>
and <code>theorem "A = B"</code>, there is nothing special that marks '==' and '=' <br>
to differentiate one as a Pure operator, and one as a HOL operator. So, <br>
if '==' is an operator that is seamlessly integrated into Isar, and <br>
high-level Isar is what I care about, rather than the low-level ML that <br>
makes up the bulk of Pure, then I definitely am inclined to call '==' an <br>
Isar operator.</p>
<p>It's Isar. It's an operator that can be used in inner syntax. It's an <br>
Isar operator. That it's also a Pure operator, and a meta-logic <br>
operator, that just reflects complexity and sophistication. It's "Pure <br>
operator" that's going to be neglected, because I only look at the files <br>
that define Pure when I click on something in jEdit that opens up an ML <br>
file.</p>
<p>It's not that important. It's just convenient. Severe torture could be <br>

occasionally it leads to discovery of something good. With software, one <br>

<p>It becomes a matter of emphasis again. The signs indicate that it is <br>
specifically Isabelle/HOL of Isabelle that is going to rule the world. I <br>
don't ignore the Isabelle/HOL library at all, it's just taking me a <br>
while to get through HOL.thy. The library as part of the distribution is <br>
a big part of what makes Isabelle/HOL convenient to use.</p>
<p>Other practical matters also rule. It's preliminary, but I'm interested <br>
in working up some meta-logic, such as intro and elim rules, along with <br>
pseudo-sequents, but only within Isabelle/HOL. With a little planning, I <br>
can maybe keep things independent, but because it's Isabelle/HOL I'm <br>
working in, everything can potentially be used in Isabelle/HOL, along <br>
with the potential of extracting what's been set up to be independent. <br>
Keeping some logic independent within a locale, that's only dependent on <br>
the independent meta-logic, would again allow it to then be used with <br>
HOL, but yet be extracted. I guess. I'm talking about things I haven't <br>
worked out.</p>
<p>It's not practical to spend years learning formal logic, and then not be <br>
able to use the concepts you've learned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am myself involved in Isabelle only since 1993, but I've never seen <br>
a commitment to "backwards compatibility".  Instead there has always <br>
been a natural flow of updating the system technically, conceptually, <br>
introducing new things, discontinuing old things (the latter requires <br>
a lot of work).</p>

<p>Consequently, because of your lack of promising to be all things to all <br>
people, to take care of Americans in all ways, and not promising <br>
everyone a small rose garden, the tally of those who vote for you when <br>
you run for political office will be equal to a small integer n.</p>

in 1993:</p>

<p>I had downloaded 1999-2 to see what users would have had available to <br>
them in that year. The number systems are pretty much non-existent. The <br>
differences are big enough that it makes it too much work to want to <br>
spend any time figuring out what the differences are.</p>
<p>For me, starting with Isabelle2013-1, there is the current version, and <br>
that's all there is. If I don't have a solution to be able to say that, <br>
then it's not worth the risk of continuing. But I do have a solution, to <br>
at least address one scenario.</p>

<p>I'll put my most important comment first. I take the view that the <br>
non-structural parts of language, such as spelling, pronunciation, and <br>
word choice, are largely arbitrary in nature. For example, which is it, <br>
welcome, willkommen, or bienvenida? Consequently, I try to be willing to <br>
adopt official, technical vocabulary, but to do that I have to have <br>
something that officially tells me what the official vocabulary is, with <br>
some explanations and examples explaining subtleties.</p>
<p>I have heard that the French work very hard to preserve and protect <br>
their language. There is the reputation of the French, that when an <br>
American goes to Paris and tries to ask questions in English, the French <br>
will act as if they don't know English, when they do (and we know they <br>
all speak English).</p>
<p>There is also the Academie francaise, the spelling of which I, of <br>
course, slaughter, as every mono-lingual English speaker should:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise</a></p>
<p>I have no problem with people aggressively trying to protect their language.</p>
<p>As to Isabelle, there should be a section in the Isar reference manual <br>
which gives users something to authoritatively quote to explain to <br>
others how to talk about the different parts of Isabelle.</p>
<p>When there are 10,000 users, I guarantee, you will be overwhelmed if no <br>
such section exists.</p>
<p>If there's something official to quote, then 2,000 experienced users of <br>
the 10,000 can act as the Academy of Isabelle, even if the vocabulary <br>
doesn't always make sense.</p>

<p>You've now changed what I should or shouldn't say. I was taking as <br>
authoritative the statement "everything between 'theory' and 'end' is by <br>
definition the Isar source language".</p>
<p>Now, you say Isar is "outer syntax", where your use of "mostly" doesn't <br>
help me figure out whether inner syntax can or can't be labeled as Isar.</p>
<p>And there is the general meaning of "level" which is interfering here. <br>
"Level" can commonly mean "level of abstraction".</p>
<p>Hexadecimal machine code is low-level. Assembly language is low-level, <br>
but higher-level than machine code. C language is finally high-level, <br>
but with pointers, not as high-level as Java.</p>
<p>If everything in a THY is Isar, I need to talk about what's in ML{<em>...</em>} <br>
as low-level Isar. Generally speaking, ML is a lower-level language than <br>
much of Isar. The context is merely the level of abstraction of ML <br>
versus the level of abstraction of Isar.</p>
<p>Here, I say this, "Give me an example of a popular programming language <br>
that can't be referred to with just one word or phrase, where, or <br>
course, Isabelle/HOL and Isar are not programming languages, though <br>
there's no official documentation that I can quote from to say that, and <br>
even now, I'm not sure I'm right in saying that about Isabelle/HOL, <br>
because, again, there's no authoritative documentation or book to sort <br>
it all out for me."</p>
<p>Coq has a language, Gallina, but everyone just calls Coq one thing, <br>
"Coq". It's easy to talk about Coq when you want to talk about Coq. You <br>
just talk about Coq.</p>
<p>Calling Isabelle "Isabelle" is way too general. There's the popular <br>
logic Isabelle/HOL, the secondary logic Isabelle/ZF, and then many minor <br>
logics, all composed of languages that elude being given one label. <br>
Wanting to work at a high level of abstraction, I try to use "Isar", but <br>
you contest my use of "Isar".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does '==' from the logical environment get in here?  What is your <br>
meaning of "Isar"?  If you call it "logical operator" it is all fine: <br>

</blockquote>
<p>My meaning of Isar was your description of Isar, that everything between <br>
"theory" and "end" is Isar. If only outer syntax is Isar, I must <br>
reconsider this matter of correct vocabulary usage, more than I prefer to.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It's Isar. It's an operator that can be used in inner syntax. It's an <br>
Isar operator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is contradictory.  A classic simplified view is:</p>
<p>Isar --- "outer syntax"<br>
  logical language --- "inner syntax"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the phrase <code>Isar --- "outer syntax"</code> is being enforced ex post facto, <br>
it's clear that I'm breaking the law.</p>
<p>I immediately ask, "If inner syntax is not Isar, what one word can I use <br>
to label the language that's being used in inner syntax? 'Syntax' <br>
implies the use of a language."</p>
<p>Suppose I'm told, "It's not a language, but a logic." (Here, others' <br>
past emphasis on the difference between a logic and a programming <br>
language interfered with me focusing on there being "languages of logic".)</p>
<p>I say, "Fine, I can go with logic. The creator gets the liberty to make <br>
the rules axiomatically."</p>
<p>I now immediately ask, "What is the one word I can use to describe the <br>
logic being used in inner syntax?"</p>
<p>If I'm told, "It's not that simple. There are multiple logics being used <br>
in the inner syntax."</p>
<p>I say, "Okay. It is what you say it is. In <code>A = B ==&gt; A = B</code>, it is <br>
clear that '==&gt;' is meta-logic or Pure, and that 'A = B' is HOL logic. <br>
There is a complication, though, because I know that 'A = B' is being <br>
coercied to type prop, so what is the one word to use to emphasize that <br>
<code>A = B</code> is both a meta-logic term and an object-logic term?"</p>
<p>If I'm told. "There is no one word, you must use a lengthy phrase, or a <br>
word that is too general to capture the meaning of what you want to say."</p>
<p>I then say, "It's time to rebel against the creator, at least in my mind."</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I like to try bring to an end my part of these kind of threads as fast <br>
as possible. First, I tell you my plan for the future, and then I try <br>
and explain it.</p>
<p>Unless I brainstorm for a better solution to fit my needs, in my mind, <br>
it's "Isar operator". It's possible that what is in my mind will make <br>
its way into something I put out on the Web, and what I put on the Web, <br>
I will never ask anyone here for any kind of editorial review. That's <br>
the great thing about proof assistants, auto-review is built in. That <br>
the logic is correct, that's the main thing.</p>
<p>I need a language, and I need a name for the language. Here, let me <br>
start by calling it the NN language, for the no-name language.</p>
<p>You have provided many languages, so I pick the four that are most <br>
related to what I'm doing: Isabelle/ML, Isabelle/HOL, Isabelle/Pure, and <br>
Isabelle/Isar.</p>
<p>It's hard not to go on tangents. As to Isabelle/HOL being a language, I <br>
see many places where HOL is called a logic, but there's only the <br>
occasional, half-hearted comment where it's called a language. It <br>
doesn't even sound right to call it a language, but I'll call it a language.</p>
<p>Here I describe the parts of the languages of Isabelle that I'm using:</p>
<p>1) Outer syntax commands to state theorems and to make proof statements.<br>
2) Inner syntax that is mainly formulas made up of meta-logic operators, <br>
HOL operators, and HOL functions.</p>
<p>I don't use any ML. I don't use any Latex. I don't use any  annotations. <br>
The inner syntax I'm using consists of item 2 that I've listed. So far, <br>
what I'm doing looks more like the contents of a Mathematica document <br>
than an ML or Coq document. We could call much of it "cryptic <br>
natural-language-like mathematics."</p>
<p>That you've clarified to me that the logic of ML can be used in inner <br>
syntax makes "inner syntax" even less suitable to describe the language <br>
that I'm using. The name of a language doesn't give us exact details, <br>
but it can precisely rule out some things. With Java, we know that <br>
pointers aren't being used.</p>
<p>If inner syntax can be ML as the logical language, and I don't use ML, <br>
then "inner syntax" ends up being too general to describe what I'm doing <br>
in Isar.</p>
<p>Here the imaginary conversation starts:</p>
<p>/Someone/: "You're using the language Pure."</p>
<p>/Me/: "But I'm exclusively working in the logic Isabelle/HOL. I don't <br>
foresee working in any other logic, and I'm using HOL to do the bulk of <br>
what I'm doing."</p>
<p>/Someone/: "Then obviously you're using the language Isabelle/HOL."</p>
<p>/Me/: "Not necessarily. I could be creating some meta-logic in HOL <br>
that's independent of HOL. There's also the issue that the three Pure <br>
operators and the HOL operators have so much in common that they deserve <br>
to be considered as part of the same language."</p>
<p>/Someone/: "Whatever you do, it's clear that 'Isar' can't be the word <br>
you use."</p>
<p>/Me/: "No, of course not, not without at least explaining my specific <br>
use of 'Isar' in the preface of a document."</p>
<p>So, with a name for a language, I can then start modifying it with <br>
things like "NN operator". That's pretty normal, as I see it.</p>
<p>It won't really matter if no one is interested in what I'm doing. If <br>
they are interested, that's good for me, and good for Isabelle.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

slaughter, as every mono-lingual English speaker should:</p>

<p>I have no problem with people aggressively trying to protect their language.</p>

<p>There are many jokes about that centralized language committee of France, <br>
both inside and outside the country.  Sometimes they do some interesting <br>
job.  E.g. email is officially called "courriel", while spam is <br>
"pourriel".  Unfortunately that ingenious linguistic construction is <br>
hardly ever used in practice: the man on the street just says "email" and <br>
"spam" with a strange French pronounciation.  Thus the pop culture from <br>
North America has overcome Central European sophistication.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is getting a bit off-topic.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...Because the high-level part of Isar is the high-level language I want <br>
to use, I want vocabulary that emphasizes that's the level I'm concerned <br>
about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't quite understand that.  Maybe the use of "level" causes again <br>
confusion.  The Isar language is mostly about so-called "outer syntax": <br>
commands like 'theorem' or 'proof' / 'qed' with a certain token language, <br>
like "..." or {* ... <em>} or (</em> ... *).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You've now changed what I should or shouldn't say. I was taking as <br>
authoritative the statement "everything between 'theory' and 'end' is by <br>
definition the Isar source language".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is definitely Isar (as outer syntax).  Then you can embed any other <br>
language inside it (as inner syntax), and repeat or alternate that <br>
principle ad infinitum.  After some nesting, it becomes difficult to hold <br>
up the simplifying termninolgy of "outer" vs. "inner", although the <br>
outermost Isar token language always remains as a starting point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Level" can commonly mean "level of abstraction".</p>
<p>Hexadecimal machine code is low-level. Assembly language is low-level, but <br>
higher-level than machine code. C language is finally high-level, but with <br>
pointers, not as high-level as Java.</p>
<p>If everything in a THY is Isar, I need to talk about what's in ML{<em>...</em>} <br>
as low-level Isar. Generally speaking, ML is a lower-level language than <br>
much of Isar. The context is merely the level of abstraction of ML <br>
versus the level of abstraction of Isar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is leading in the wrong direction; the level of abstraction does not <br>
matter here.  Isabelle/ML and Isabelle/Isar are both high-level languages, <br>
but of quite different kind and purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coq has a language, Gallina, but everyone just calls Coq one thing, <br>
"Coq". It's easy to talk about Coq when you want to talk about Coq. You <br>
just talk about Coq.</p>
<p>Calling Isabelle "Isabelle" is way too general. There's the popular <br>
logic Isabelle/HOL, the secondary logic Isabelle/ZF, and then many minor <br>
logics, all composed of languages that elude being given one label.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would say as first approximation it is fine to say "Isabelle source <br>
text" for any of the Isabelle languages.  You then become specific <br>
according to the context: Isabelle/ML, Isabelle/HOL etc.</p>
<p>The situation is not fundamentally different in Coq, although they never <br>
worked out the integration of different languages as systematically as was <br>
done in Isabelle in the last 10 years.  Moreover there is a cultural <br>
difference: French Type Theorists like to eat everything from one plate, <br>
so there is a tendency to internalize everything into the core logic <br>
(which then becomes huge and hard to manage conceptually).</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is contradictory.  A classic simplified view is:</p>
<p>Isar --- "outer syntax"<br>
  logical language --- "inner syntax"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the phrase <code>Isar --- "outer syntax"</code> is being enforced ex post facto, it's <br>
clear that I'm breaking the law.</p>
<p>I immediately ask, "If inner syntax is not Isar, what one word can I use to <br>
label the language that's being used in inner syntax? 'Syntax' implies the <br>
use of a language."</p>
<p>Suppose I'm told, "It's not a language, but a logic." (Here, others' past <br>
emphasis on the difference between a logic and a programming language <br>
interfered with me focusing on there being "languages of logic".)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A logic is also a language.  So if you just say "the logic" or "the <br>
logical language", either for Isabelle/Pure or Isabelle/HOL, it will be <br>
right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I say, "Okay. It is what you say it is. In <code>A = B ==&gt; A = B</code>, it is clear <br>
that '==&gt;' is meta-logic or Pure, and that 'A = B' is HOL logic. There is a <br>
complication, though, because I know that 'A = B' is being coercied to type <br>
prop, so what is the one word to use to emphasize that <code>A = B</code> is both a <br>
meta-logic term and an object-logic term?"</p>
<p>If I'm told. "There is no one word, you must use a lengthy phrase, or a word <br>
that is too general to capture the meaning of what you want to say."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a big fan of the distinction of Isabelle/Pure vs. Isabelle/HOL, but <br>
you should not overemphasize Pure as "the meta-logic".  There is not much <br>
"meta" going on here: you can't reason about other logics with Pure.</p>
<p>Instead, what really happens is that you use Isabelle/Pure connectives !! <br>
and ==&gt; to outline the structure of natural deduction rules that you want <br>
do use in everyday work in Isabelle/HOL.  So Pure is mainly a framework <br>
work higher-order natural deduction, with declarative composition of rules <br>
according to a few principles (notably higher-order unification).</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Makarius,</p>
<p>I assume you read that other email. All that email was is a statement of <br>
my decision to finalize what I'm going to do, with some forewarning, in <br>
case it matters in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Any complaining and arguing I do is indirectly a note of thanks, where <br>
I'm trying to limit how much I thank you. There's like 3 main features <br>
of Isabelle as I see it, jEdit user interface, Isar language syntax, and <br>
a powerful logic engine which allows the control of proof steps from <br>
precise statements all the way to full automation. I don't know what the <br>
limitations of the software are, but there's nothing else on the market <br>
like Isabelle.</p>
<p>You control the distribution, but as far as language, you're not in <br>
complete control of the language.</p>
<p>Most of what I'm saying can be represented by this statement: For me, <br>
there has to be one word for a language, call it "NN", in which I can <br>
say "NN operator", where "NN operator" refers to the three Pure <br>
operators, ==&gt;, !!, and ==, along with any object logic operator in a <br>
THY file.</p>
<p>When you give me one word for your choice of "NN", I'm thinking that's <br>
when I'm ready to start conforming on this matter.</p>
<p>Just consider me a representative of the users to come. I can't lose on <br>
this. The nature of things like art, philosophy, religion, politics, and <br>
general acts of creation is that there's continual evolution and <br>
morphing of one thing to another. People pick and choose what they want.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm refusing to do any work with Isabelle, to force myself to <br>
get up to speed on some audio/video software. If I'm more successful <br>
than you at getting a popular following, then it's possible I'll have <br>
more influence than you on how the word "Isar" is eventually used.</p>
<p>No one can authoritatively correct me if there's nothing authoritative <br>
to quote from. I've tried authoritatively quoting from mailing list <br>
emails. It doesn't work for sorting out the complexities of the <br>
vocabulary of Isabelle. It's regrettable that writing would take up <br>
valuable resources on your part, but I can't help that. However, mere <br>
writing wouldn't solve me not having a "NN operator", as I described.</p>

<p>So maybe for you, "level" means "level of logic", which you consider <br>
wrong, rather than some common meaning like "level of abstraction". My <br>
main point was that you're fighting other common usages of the word <br>
"level", and I don't see you winning. That {a_i} is notation for a <br>
sequence is messed up, but nothing any time soon is going to change that <br>
it's the dominant notation.</p>

<p>There are many places I could say this, but the vocabulary is too <br>
complex. I don't actually care that the vocabulary is complex. I think I <br>
understand enough for why you require it to be complex. It's too complex <br>
without some document existing to enforce the vocabulary, along with the <br>
vocabulary meeting more than just your needs.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Many places in all this, we're crossing into Ph.D. logic territory, <br>
where most mathematicians of the world (me not being one) don't <br>
understand Ph.D. level logic anymore than I do, where I'm already above <br>
average as to understanding logic.</p>
<p>As to the "meta" in "meta-logic", I quickly admit that I don't <br>
understand in-depth the connection between meta-languages and <br>
object-languages.</p>
<p>However, with Isabelle, I can take a purely definitional view of <br>
"meta-logic" to mean the three operators ==&gt;, !!, and ==, along with <br>
what I can do with them in a THY file.</p>
<p>I myself, rather than one of the many Ph.Ds here, discovered that I can <br>
define and use meta-false as (!!P. PROP P), along with what I call <br>
hybrid-false, (!!P. P::bool), which end up giving me the standard <br>
connectives, without using ML.</p>
<p>It could be I'm wasting my time pursuing this line of logic. Finding <br>
that out must wait until I work my way through the audio/video software.</p>
<blockquote>

composition of rules according to a few principles (notably <br>
higher-order unification).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm willing to recognize my lack of knowledge, and recognize others' <br>
superior knowledge, but when the student learns enough, the student <br>
begins to challenge the master.</p>
<p>I don't accept at all the limitation of Pure as a framework, with only 3 <br>
operators, meant to be used only to defined object-logics. If my view of <br>
Pure is ridiculously narrow and trivializes the bulk of Pure's purpose, <br>
what is that to me? I work in a THY file, see the three operators and <br>
prop as the face of Pure, and have quit wanting to ignore them.</p>
<p>I had asked myself this question, "What are the limitations of using the <br>
standard logic connectives of Pure, without being able to add any axioms?"</p>
<p>I'm past that question.</p>
<p>If I add global axioms to HOL, it's not HOL anymore. There is the <br>
possibility, though, of adding axioms in locales in HOL, and using, as <br>
much as possible, operators which are abbreviations of ==&gt;, !!, ==, and <br>
meta-false. That sounds like more than only using Pure as a framework. <br>
It's actually the concept that's important, not whether there's a fatal <br>
flaw to prevent me from following through.</p>
<p>If I spend a lot of time trying to do these things, and decide you've <br>
been right all along, you're the man, along with many others. If it <br>
leads to something great, you're still the man, along with many others. <br>
I'm doing the easy part.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

To finish this perspective of more flexibile local definitions within <br>
proofs, in conformance to 'definition' for local theories, the general <br>
form would be like this:</p>
<p>define f where "f x y z = t" for x y z</p>
<p>All composed from standard parts that we have elsewhere for many years <br>
already.  (When it actually happens, further fine points will come <br>
naturally from "deriving the implementation" properly and carefully from <br>
the existing framework.)</p>
