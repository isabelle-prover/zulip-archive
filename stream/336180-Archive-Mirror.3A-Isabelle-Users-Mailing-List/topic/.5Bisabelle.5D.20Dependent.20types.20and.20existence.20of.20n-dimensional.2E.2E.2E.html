Dear Isabelle Users</p>
<p>I know that dependent types do not exist in Isabelle. But there should be some alternative way to express any (simple) mathematical fact, should not it? I really need the following lemma.</p>
<p>Lemma. Fix natural number n. Then there exist a n-dimensional real vector space R^n</p>
<p>This fact is absolutely obvious, and it is crucial for my formalization.<br>
In Isabelle, for, say, n=100,  I can easily obtain 100-dimensional space by writing</p>
<p>have “CARD(100)=100” by auto<br>
from this obtain A where “A = (UNIV :: (real^100) set)” and “dim A = 100”  by (simp add: dim_univ)</p>
<p>But I need this for general n. I can write</p>
<p>fix n :: nat<br>
assume “CARD('m :: finite)=n”<br>
from this obtain A where “A = (UNIV :: (real^'m) set)” and “dim A = n”  by (simp add: dim_univ)</p>
<p>But now I need to obtain a n-dimensional universe without additional assumptions. Can somebody help me?</p>
<p>P. S. I hope this is possible. Otherwise how we can hope to formalize significant part of mathematics if we cannot prove such a simple fact? </p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Bogdan Grechuk.</p>

<p>From: Brian Huffman &lt;<a href="mailto:brianh@cs.pdx.edu">brianh@cs.pdx.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Isabelle's lack of dependent types means that all types mentioned in a<br>
proof must be fixed up front (like they are in your sample proof<br>
above). You cannot obtain a new type variable in the middle of a proof<br>
that depends on values obtained earlier in the proof.</p>
<p>Higher Order Logic is strictly less powerful than ZF set theory, so<br>
eventually you might hit a point where HOL simply can't formalize the<br>
mathematics you want. Fortunately, I think you are still a long way<br>
from that point.</p>
<p>So you have a proof that might need to refer to a vector space of<br>
arbitrary finite dimension (where no upper bound on the dimension is<br>
known ahead of time). Essentially you would like to existentially<br>
quantify over a countable family of types: real^n for all finite n.<br>
The way to deal with this in HOL is to define a single type that is<br>
large enough to embed all of those types; then you can quantify over<br>
the finite-dimensional subspaces of that type.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a type that would work for this purpose:</p>
<p>typedef inf_vector = "{X::nat =&gt; real. finite {n. X n ~= 0}}"</p>
<p>Values of this type are infinite sequences of reals with only finitely<br>
many non-zero entries. You should be able to make inf_vector an<br>
instance of all the relevant type classes for doing linear algebra:<br>
You can define addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, metric,<br>
norm, and inner product, and prove that those operations satisfy the<br>
appropriate laws.</p>
<p>I know that this is a lot more work than what would be required in a<br>
system with dependent types. But at least it is possible, and you<br>
still get to enjoy all the other benefits (type inference, etc) of<br>
HOL.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<p>This is an unfortunate side effect of the formalization of finite<br>

probably the only sensible formalization possible in HOL. Otherwise all<br>
the advantages of having types is lost and we could also work in ZF.</p>

<p>Actually, I am proving lemma "Every convex nonempty set S has a nonempty relative interior", and n is the dimension of set S.<br>
So, I would say that n is a fixed variable at the toplevel, no induction here or similar, I just have fixed set S and it has a fixed dimension. Can I use "some finite type variable"? But I cannot "assume "CARD('n :: finite) = n" inside the proof, in this case I have error when try to write "qed".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi Bogdan,</p>
<p>In this particular case, since "S" has a specific (finite) dimension<br>
that is fixed in advance, you should not need to resort to using the<br>
inf_vector type that I recommended in my previous email. You should be<br>
able to prove your lemma using only types like "real^'n".</p>
<p>In order to help you more, I will need to know more details about the<br>
lemma you are trying to prove. I guess that "Every convex nonempty set<br>
S has a nonempty relative interior" would be formalized like</p>
<p>lemma fixes S :: ??? obtains T :: ??? where &lt;some formula of S and T&gt;</p>
<p>or "ALL S::???. EX T::???. &lt;some formula of S and T&gt;"</p>
<p>In particular, I need to know the types of S and T, which would be in<br>
place of "???" above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, my critical lemma</p>
<p>fixes n :: nat obtains A where “A = (UNIV :: (real^'m) set)” and “dim A = n”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My earlier advice applies here: Instead of trying to quantify over<br>
types, you need to rephrase this by quantifying over subspaces of a<br>
single fixed type.</p>
<p>It seems like you are trying to say:</p>
<p>"ALL n::nat. EX 'm. (dim (UNIV :: (real^'m) set)) = n"</p>
<p>which is true, but nonsense in HOL because you can't quantify over types.</p>
<p>Instead, you should be trying to prove something like this, where type<br>
'm is fixed, and you quantify over subsets of real^'m:</p>
<p>"ALL n::nat. n &lt;= CARD('m) --&gt; EX A::(real^'m) set. dim A = n"</p>
<p>Again, it's hard to give more specific advice without knowing more<br>
details about what exactly you are trying to prove.</p>

<p>From: grechukbogdan &lt;<a href="mailto:grechukbogdan@yandex.ru">grechukbogdan@yandex.ru</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Brian</p>
<p>No, unfortunately, I really need exactly what I have asked.</p>
<p>lemma *: fixes n :: nat obtains A where “A = (UNIV :: (real^'m) set)” and “dim A = n”</p>
<p>Here is the citation from the book which I am formalizing</p>
<p>"m-dimentional affine hull of S can be regarded as a copy of space R^m. It is often possible in this manner to reduce a question about general convex set to the special case where the convex set is of full dimension, i.e. has the whole space as its affine hull."</p>
<p>After this remark every second prove in the book start with "without loss of generality assume that S is of full dimension", so I actually cannot proceed without formalization of this remark.</p>
<p>The plan of proving any property P of set S in this way is the following<br>
1) Prove it for the case when S is of full dimension<br>
2) Prove that property P is preserved under isomorphism<br>
3) Constract an isomorphism from affine hull S to the WHOLE SPACE with the same dimension.</p>
<p>So, I cannot rephrase this by quantifying over subspaces of a single fixed type. I really need to use that A in the lemma * ubove is the whole space, whole universe, not a subspace. For example, I need inclusion "ball 0 1 &lt;= A" which does not hold if A is just a subspace.</p>
<p>In my particular case property P is "has nonempty relative interior". <br>
So, first, I have proved this for the case of full dimension:</p>
<p>lemma interior_convex_ndim_nonempty: <br>
fixes S :: "(real^'n) set" <br>
assumes "convex S" and "aff_dim S = int(CARD('n))"<br>
shows "rel_interior S ~= {}" </p>
<p>Then I have proved that relative interior is preserved under the injective linear transformation</p>
<p>lemma rel_interior_injective_on_span_linear_image:<br>
fixes f :: "(real ^'m) =&gt; (real ^'n)"<br>
fixes S :: "(real ^'m) set"<br>
assumes "bounded_linear f" and "inj_on f (span S)"<br>
shows "rel_interior (f <code> S) = f </code> (rel_interior S)" </p>
<p>And finally, I have lemma subspace_isomorphism, stating that any two subspaces of the same dimension are isomorpic, and I can use it to construct the desired isomorhism f (provided that I can obtain universe A with the same dimension as S)</p>
<p>obtain A where A_def: "A = (UNIV :: (real^'m::finite) set)" and A: "dim A = dim S" sorry <br>
obtain f where f_def: "linear f &amp; f ` span S = (UNIV :: (real^'m) set) &amp; inj_on f (span S)"<br>
  using subspace_isomorphism[of "span S" "(UNIV :: (real^'m) set)"] <br>
  A_def A dim_span[of S] subspace_span[of S] by auto</p>
<p>Again, what is important, I will need this isomorphism to UNIV for many other lemmas.</p>
<p>Probably, now it is claer, that type</p>
<p>typedef inf_vector = "{X::nat =&gt; real. finite {n. X n ~= 0}}"</p>
<p>of infinite sequences of reals with only finitely many non-zero entries, does not work at all. Here the universe is infinite-dimensional, and what I need is m-dimensional universe...</p>
<p>So, is there a point where HOL simply can't formalize the mathematics I want? </p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Bogdan.</p>

<p>From: Lawrence Paulson &lt;<a href="mailto:lp15@cam.ac.uk">lp15@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Let's go back to first principles and consider how a mathematician would represent a point in a multi-dimensional space. If we are to include finite and infinite dimensions in the same framework, then a point must be a map from an ordinal into the set of real numbers. I can't think of a better approach. Note that such a point contains in it not merely the values of its components, but its dimension.</p>
<p>Such an approach can be done in higher-order logic, although with more effort. Possibly you could use the primitives in Library/FuncSet.thy. You could fix some linearly ordered type to use in place of the ordinals, or make the construction parametric in a type of variable belonging to class linorder. A point would be given by an element N of this index type, coupled with a map from the initial segment of elements below N into the reals. If you only need finite-dimensional spaces, then a point could obviously be represented by a list of real numbers. You</p>
<p>But it looks to me like you have adopted an approach in which the dimension of a point is part of its type, rather than part of its value. This is inevitably going to be a lot less flexible; it is similar to the situation in group theory, where the carrier of a group really must be formalised as a set rather than as a type.</p>
