<p>From: Joachim Breitner &lt;<a href="mailto:breitner@kit.edu">breitner@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>here at Karlsruhe we are offering a practical Course on Isabelle which<br>
began last week and we were badly surprised that Isabelle/jEdit 2013 had<br>
severe issues on the machines in the student’s pool room: A short while<br>
into editing the highlighting (errors and the light blue) and the output<br>
window are no longer updated.</p>
<p>We could reproduce it most easily by writing, say,<br>
        theory Scratch imports Main begin lemma "foobar"<br>
and then changing "lemma" to "le mma" and back in very rapid succession.</p>
<p>The machines in question are Fedora 18 systems, 64 bit, 4GB RAM, no swap<br>
and the file systems on NFS. We also reproduced it on machines with more<br>
RAM and on machien with the 32 bit libraries installed in addition. We<br>
cannot reproduce it on our own workstations, though.</p>
<p>It seems it is happening more easily on slower machine. Maybe some race<br>
condition?</p>
<p>We are at a loss here – any idea how to get it working more reliable?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Joachim<br>

I occasionally had similar problems but did not manage to produce a <br>
reproducible example yet. However, I managed to get the system back to <br>
working by hitting the "Cancel' button in the "Theories" window a few times.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, the problem occurred often when editing a proof <br>
which was followed by a "lemma (in LOC)" where LOC was a reasonably big <br>
locale from HOL-Algebra.</p>
<p>This occurred both with Isabelle 2013 and a recent Isabelle development <br>
snapshot. Debian with a 64-bit Isabelle, 6GB RAM, Core 2 Duo and a Gnome <br>
3 desktop.</p>

<p>From: Denis Lohner &lt;<a href="mailto:denis.lohner@kit.edu">denis.lohner@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Unfortunately, hitting "Cancel" doesn't work here at Karlsruhe. However, <br>
in the student's computer pool hitting "Check" while a large theory file <br>
is being processed, seems to reliabely result in the same freeze of the <br>
Output panel.</p>
<p>As there is no error message in the Output panel or at the command line, <br>
what are our options to investigate the problem? Is there an option to <br>
log the communication between jEdit and the isabelle process? Would this <br>
information help to find the cause?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
   Denis</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The "Protocol" panel in Isabelle/jEdit gives a full transcript of the two <br>
processes communicating, although that slows down things considerably, and <br>
usually makes such non-deterministic problems disappear.</p>
<p>There have been reports about several such real-time reactivity problems <br>
in the past few months, but so far very few concrete hints of the actual <br>
reasons.  Problems with Fedora 18 in particular had been reported before, <br>
but this does not say much -- recent Linux distributions all tend towards <br>
instabilities that were not there 1 or 2 years ago.</p>
<p>In the next round of refinements of Isabelle/Scala and Isabelle/jEdit, I <br>
will be more defensive in the use of certain Java 7 GUI / window popup <br>
features, and also in the use of Scala actors.  There are reasons to <br>
believe that these basic building blocks of the interactive framework are <br>
not 100% reliable.</p>
<p>Apart from that, any more concrete observation where things don't work in <br>
Isabelle2013 will be treated with the usual scrutiny.</p>
