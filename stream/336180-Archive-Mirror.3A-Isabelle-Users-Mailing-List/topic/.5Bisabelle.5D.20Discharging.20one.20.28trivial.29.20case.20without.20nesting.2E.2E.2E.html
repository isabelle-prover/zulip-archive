<p>From: Joachim Breitner &lt;<a href="mailto:breitner@kit.edu">breitner@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle users (and devs),</p>
<p>Chrisoph’s question (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16629417">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16629417</a>) proofs<br>
by cases reminded me of a feature wish that I wanted to talk about for a<br>
while.</p>
<p>In pen-and-paper proofs, if there are corner cases for which the result<br>
is immediate, I just mention them at the beginning and continue with the<br>
interesting cases:</p>
<p>Lemma: Every set that has property Q also has property P.</p>
<p>Proof: Let S be a set with property Q. Clearly, empty sets have <br>
         property P, so assume x ∈ S.<br>
         [long proof]<br>
         So S has property P.</p>
<p>In Isar, I would have to write:</p>
<p>lemma "Q S → P S"<br>
        proof<br>
          assume "Q S"<br>
          show "P S"<br>
          proof(cases "S = {}")<br>
            assume True thus "P S" by simp<br>
          next<br>
            assume False<br>
            then obtain "x ∈ S" by auto<br>
            ..<br>
            show "P S"<br>
          qed<br>
        qed</p>
<p>What I don’t like about this is that the main proof (..) is indented<br>
deeper than it is in my mental model of the proof.</p>
<p>Note that if I could conclude False from "S = {}" and my current facts,<br>
I could write the proof without additional indenting, e.g. using obtain.<br>
But showing False or showing that the result holds is not a huge<br>
difference in my understanding of a particular proof, so what I would<br>
like to see is, for example,</p>
<p>lemma "Q S → P S"<br>
    proof<br>
      assume "Q S"</p>
<p>trivially "S ~= {}"<br>
      proof<br>
    assume "~ ~ S = {}"<br>
        show "P S" by simp<br>
      qed<br>
      then obtain "x ∈ S" by auto<br>
      ..<br>
      show "P S"<br>
    qed</p>
<p>where (attention, obviously inaccurate understanding of Isar’s workings<br>
under the hood following:) "trivially P" opens a proof goal "~P ==&gt; ?P",<br>
and the user is expected to finish this proof with "show Q" where Q is<br>
the same result that he will show in the outer block. After the<br>
"trivially P" command, P is added to the facts and to this. Note the<br>
similarity with the obtain command, where I have to shown an abstract<br>
"that".</p>
<p>I know that this is but a small reshuffling of the statements that I’d<br>
have to write with "show Q proof(cases P)...", but it does make a<br>
difference for the readability of the proof.</p>
<p>Bonus points if somehow inside the proof block opened by tivially the<br>
statement to be shown is somehow inferred, so that I can just write </p>
<p>lemma "Q S → P S"<br>
    proof<br>
      assume "Q S"</p>
<p>trivially "S ~= {}" by simp<br>
      then obtain "x ∈ S" by auto<br>
      ..<br>
      show "P S"<br>
    qed</p>
<p>Greetings and happy Whitsun,<br>

<p>Instead, you could write:</p>
<p>lemma "Q S --&gt; P S"<br>
proof<br>
   assume "Q S"<br>
   show "P S"<br>
   proof (cases "S = {}")<br>
     assume "S ~= {}"<br>
     then obtain "x : S" by auto<br>
     ...<br>
     show "P S"<br>
   qed simp<br>
qed</p>
<p>which looks (I guess) very similar to what you suggested:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma "Q S → P S"<br>
     proof<br>
       assume "Q S"<br>
       trivially "S ~= {}"<br>
       proof<br>
         assume "~ ~ S = {}"<br>
         show "P S" by simp<br>
       qed<br>
       then obtain "x ∈ S" by auto<br>
       ..<br>
       show "P S"<br>
     qed<br>
</p>

<p>Maybe I do not get your main point?</p>
<p>cheers</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>It does look similar, but I still have to start the proof by stating<br>
what I want to show (which I would not do in the pen-and-paper proof),<br>
and I still have to have two nested blocks.</p>
<p>I also have cases in mind where the „trivial“ proof is a bit more<br>
involved than something that you would put after qed, but still much<br>
shorter than the „main proof“.</p>
<p>Also, putting it after the qed almost completely hides that the case is<br>
handled. Compare this with the pen-and-paper-proof: The trivial case is<br>
mentioned beforehand (and then discharged as uninteresting).</p>
<p>I know that my arguing is very much on the „personal preference and<br>
perception“ level, and getting proofs to look good and to be a pleasant<br>
read is a very subjective thing...</p>
<p>Maybe I could also state my idea this way, which does not talk about<br>
style any more and might allow other uses as well:</p>
<p>Would it be possible to get a variant of obtains where the proof<br>
        obligation is not an abstract "this", but rather the actually<br>
        goal shown afterwards?</p>
<p>This introduces a non-linearity into the proof that might feel very<br>
wrong in ProofGeneral, but with the parallel style of jedit, this might<br>
actually make sense. One would probably start with a proof of "sorry"<br>
for the proof, continue the rest, and then finish the obtains proof when<br>
the conclusion correctly known.</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
Joachim<br>
