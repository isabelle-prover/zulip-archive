Hi all,</p>
<p>The latest candidates for the upcoming Isabelle release contain some changes to reduce disk usage of heap images. So I<br>
thought it might be a good time to ask other disk usage related questions. None of the below is intended to be<br>
interpreted as a request for changes to the upcoming release; just questions seeking clarification.</p>
<p>When Isabelle detects that it is missing a component (Poly/ML, JDK, etc.) it fetches a tarball of this to<br>
~/.isabelle/contrib and then decompresses it here. Each tarball contains necessary files for all supported platforms.<br>
I.e. in the extreme, a component like Poly/ML contains subdirectories for 32-bit Linux, 64-bit Linux, 32-bit Mac OS,<br>
64-bit Mac OS and 32-bit Cygwin. My question is, why is Isabelle fetching all these things that will remain unused on my<br>
platform? Is this the result of a "disk space and bandwidth are free" mode of thought? Or a decision made for ease of<br>
packaging? None of this is meant as a criticism, I would just like to understand the motivation(s).</p>
<p>My interest is driven by one of my machines where disk space <em>is</em> an issue. A quick scan of ~/isabelle/contrib reveals<br>
2.7GB of files I could easily do without. A minimal first step to reducing this in future would seem to be to download<br>
the tarballs to a temporary location, then delete them after decompressing. Is there a need for them to persist? Perhaps<br>
there are some deeper issues I'm not aware of here.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Matt</p>

I always carry a large bag of workarounds and little hope of upstream<br>
changes. So while your question awaits a more comprehensive answer, some<br>
observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you can delete the .tar.gz files in contrib, they don't get<br>
  re-downloaded as long as the component itself exists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inside the jdk directories, you can delete the platforms you don't<br>
  need; e.g. jdk-8u72 is 1.4GB, but its x86_64-linux dir is only 353MB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everything else doesn't occupy much space - closest candidate is<br>
  polyml weighing in at a whopping 83MB</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above can be written into a script, although since component updates<br>
happen about twice a year I haven't bothered. On that note, could you<br>
send me your isabelle components mirror fallback mod?</p>
<p>Raf.</p>

You are completely correct, Makarius. I forgot that we (Data61) were using a repository snapshot, rather than a release.<br>
Apologies for the confusion. Some further clarification inline below.</p>

<p>Yes, I was not suggesting that "isabelle components" should ever delete older components.</p>

So what are the reasons for people at Data61 using a repository snapshot?<br>
I thought that vice had been given up in 2005.</p>
<p>Or is it an official Isabelle release that has been "spiced up" by local <br>
patches?</p>
<p>In the latter case, I recommend to produce a proper release locally, with <br>
a name that is derived from the official one, but different from it. <br>
E.g. like this:</p>
<p>hg tag Isabelle2016-Data61<br>
   Admin/Release/build -O -r Isabelle2016-Data61</p>
<p>This works in Linux and Mac OS X (e.g. Mountain Lion), but the latter is <br>
required to produce macos bundles.  Linux can produce only linux and <br>
windows bundles, and the fonts of documentation is bad, because Gerwin and <br>
Tobias like strange fonts.</p>

<p>It is precisely that. It just looks like a repository setup for locals.</p>

<p>This is difficult from a configuration management point of view. Like in the Isabelle repository itself we want to be able to go back to old versions in history and have a link from our proofs to precisely the Isabelle version (change id, including any spice) and configuration that was applicable there. It’s also very useful to have the Isabelle repository directly there, to be able to study history, and to manage any additional spice as version-controlled branches.</p>
<p>This means we effectively deal with a Isabelle repository setup. I’m happy with that trade-off, but some of us are more perfectionist ;-) I think with the information so far, we can optimise our setup, though.</p>

As I have pointed out some years ago, the document in question is <br>
prog-prove.  On Debianistic Linux systems (e.g. Ubuntu) the result looks <br>
very ugly, with low-resolution bitmap fonts.</p>
<p>I guess the problem is this combination:</p>
<p>\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}<br>
\usepackage{ccfonts}<br>
\usepackage[euler-digits]{eulervm}</p>
<p>See also Admin/Release/CHECKLIST:</p>
<ul>
<li>check scalable fonts, e.g. src/Doc/Prog_Prove (NOTE: T1 encoding<br>
   requires cm-super fonts, which are usually available on MacTeX or<br>
   Cygwin, but not on Ubuntu/Debian);</li>
</ul>
<p>The T1 problem was later avoided for regular LaTeX CM fonts:</p>
<p>\usepackage{lmodern}</p>
<p>This explains why most Isabelle manuals have a very long underscore, but <br>
one that can be searched for in the PDF.</p>
<p>Since T1 works uniformly with MacTeX (Mac OS X) and MikTeX (Windows), it <br>
is probably just due to an "improved" version of TeXLive on Debian-based <br>
systems.  Someone should investigate the Debian repositories and figure <br>
out which patches needs to be removed.</p>
