<p>From: Lukas Bulwahn &lt;<a href="mailto:bulwahn@in.tum.de">bulwahn@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>the email snipplet below shows one of those often arising discussions <br>
about documentation of Isabelle's ML sources.</p>
<p>In fact, documentation of ML sources come in various facets:</p>
<ul>
<li>the existing ML source</li>
<li>the historical variants of the ML sources in the last twenty years</li>
<li>the annotations to the changesets</li>
<li>Isabelle's mailing lists</li>
<li>the unchecked code comments, that usually tells you what did not work <br>
in the past or could have been improved in the past</li>
</ul>
<p>When modifying existing implementations, it is certainly profitable to <br>
spend an hour or two, investigating the sources and look at the changes, <br>
and search through the mailing list. Often, subtle "surprises" have been <br>
touched before, and implementations go through a number of iterations <br>
with some "pros" and "cons".</p>
<p>The ideas of the existing implementation is further documented in the <br>
Isabelle implementation manual.<br>
Reading it provides a dense reference of concepts for people, that want <br>
to understand concepts in more detail.</p>
<p>The Isabelle developer tutorial provides an simple access to programming <br>
in Isabelle with various examples, and a rather simplified view on some <br>
topic. It is helpful for starters and beginners, but also only scratches <br>
the surface of some functionalities.</p>
<p>I envisaged the Quickcheck tool for Isabelle's ML (presented last week <br>
in Munich) as some further project to address documentation of the sources.<br>
In the short term, I wanted that specifications would allow us to <br>
document oddities in the system by grading surprising specifications of <br>
functions, which could then be addressed at any point in the future if <br>
we consider the surprise severe enough to change.</p>
<p>In the long term, I was thinking that users and developers could discuss <br>
their expectations about functions in this formal setting of properties <br>
or contracts, and the Quickcheck tool would motivate using <br>
specifications when implementing, and a run-time monitoring tool for <br>
specifications would ease changing code in the maintenance process.</p>
<p>NB: Brian agreed with the idea of contracts, as he was pushing for more <br>
fine-grained types. His ideas were much more intrusive changing the <br>
implementation, whereas specifications/contracts would only add some <br>
fine-grained information in other files.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there is very much documentation for Isabelle's ML <br>
sources. As far as I see it, there are two further opportunities for <br>
improvements in a very long-term range:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide ways to cross-link the various documentation sources (and user <br>
interfaces to get all relevant documents)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide more fine-grained descriptions (e.g., provide specs that can <br>
be checked with the Quickcheck tool) and investigate if this simplifies <br>
or hinders our development process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lukas</p>
