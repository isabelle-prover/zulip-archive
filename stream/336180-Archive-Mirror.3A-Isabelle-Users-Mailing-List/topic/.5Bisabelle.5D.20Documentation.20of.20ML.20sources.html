<p>The Isabelle developer tutorial provides an simple access to programming <br>
in Isabelle with various examples, and a rather simplified view on some <br>
topic. It is helpful for starters and beginners, but also only scratches <br>
the surface of some functionalities.</p>
<p>I envisaged the Quickcheck tool for Isabelle's ML (presented last week <br>
in Munich) as some further project to address documentation of the <br>
sources. In the short term, I wanted that specifications would allow us <br>
to document oddities in the system by grading surprising specifications <br>
of functions, which could then be addressed at any point in the future <br>
if we consider the surprise severe enough to change.</p>
<p>In the long term, I was thinking that users and developers could discuss <br>
their expectations about functions in this formal setting of properties <br>
or contracts, and the Quickcheck tool would motivate using <br>
specifications when implementing, and a run-time monitoring tool for <br>
specifications would ease changing code in the maintenance process.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that I don't think myself in these categories when <br>
reading or (re)writing sources.  In the past 20 years, I've always felt <br>
myself this discrepancy of what is being taught in class, and what you do <br>
in practice to get very sophisticated systems working and keep them <br>
running. What you teach in class has also change many times in that <br>
timespan, and there is no indication that the last word has been said now.</p>
<p>I also want to point generically to several talks by Alan Kay on the web <br>
(e.g. the one called "Programming and Scaling"), where he makes a critical <br>
reflection on his past decades of shaping the programming language <br>
community.  He is now at 72 and has grown quite wise.  In this context, it <br>
would be an interesting research project to investigate what this received <br>
Isabelle development actually is, i.e. turn things from the head on their <br>
feet.  In any case, I shall probably add some thoughtful Alan Kay <br>
citations to the Isabelle/Isar implementation manual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NB: Brian agreed with the idea of contracts, as he was pushing for more <br>
fine-grained types. His ideas were much more intrusive changing the <br>
implementation, whereas specifications/contracts would only add some <br>
fine-grained information in other files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's an old topic.  One needs to be more specific about it. <br>
Historically, we've had situations where more detailed types have improved <br>
the situation (say type Graph.T module instead of former ad-hoc functions <br>
on lists of pairs), and sometimes types make things worse (e.g. every tool <br>
having its own "simpset"-style thing, instead of using the universal <br>
untyped Proof.context in the proper way).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, there is very much documentation for Isabelle's ML sources. As <br>
far as I see it, there are two further opportunities for improvements in a <br>
very long-term range:<br>
- Provide ways to cross-link the various documentation sources (and user <br>
interfaces to get all relevant documents)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main reference manuals (isar-ref, system, implementation) are already <br>
formally marked-up in this respect.  It is merely a matter of improving <br>
the browser facilities to link it up with the Prover IDE, say.  So looking <br>
at some ML snipped formally within the editor, one would get annotations / <br>
links pointing to occurrences in the massive manuals, for further reading. <br>
I've seen this work for Java libraries in Java IDEs, so it is not <br>
rocked-science.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Provide more fine-grained descriptions (e.g., provide specs that can <br>
be checked with the Quickcheck tool) and investigate if this simplifies <br>
or hinders our development process.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Without being specific about it, my spontaneous reaction is "hinder". <br>
There need to be convincing applications first: How would it improve the <br>
actual problems that we occasionally have: wrong context used in some <br>
tool, wrong use of "free" vs. "fixed" variables in the context, non-linear <br>
use of theory/local_theory.</p>
<p>Anyway, comparing our code base with that of Java and its standard <br>
libraries, we are in a surprisingly good situation --- or Java is <br>
surprisingly bad.  Scala + library is better, but also faces problems we <br>
could never dream of in our pure ML world.</p>
