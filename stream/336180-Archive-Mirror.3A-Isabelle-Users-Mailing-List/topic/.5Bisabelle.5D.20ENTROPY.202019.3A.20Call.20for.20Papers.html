<p>Call for papers — ENTROPY 2019<br>
           ENabling TRust through Os Proofs … and beYond</p>
<p>Second International workshop on the use of theorem provers for<br>
modelling and verification at the hardware-software interface</p>
<p>Co-located with EuroS&amp;P'19, KTH, Stockholm, June 2019</p>
<hr>
<p>AIM AND SCOPE</p>
<p>Low level software such as kernels and drivers, along with the hardware<br>
this software runs on, is critical for application security. In contrast<br>
with user applications, OS kernel software runs in privileged CPU mode<br>
and is thus highly critical. Large projects such as seL4, VeriSoft,<br>
CertiKoS and Prosper have invested considerable resources in developing<br>
formally verified systems such as hypervisors and microkernels,<br>
supplying proofs that they satisfy critical properties. Such proofs are<br>
delicate in terms of the scale and complexity of real systems, the<br>
models used in performing the proof search, and the relations between<br>
the two, which recent vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown have<br>
shown to be a highly non-trivial issue.</p>
<p>The purpose of this workshop is to share, compare and disseminate best<br>
practices, tools and methodologies to verify OS kernels, also setting<br>
the stage for future steps in the direction of fully verified systems,<br>
dealing with issues related to modelling, model validation, and large<br>
proof maintenance through system evolution. On one hand, we need to make<br>
low-level proofs more scalable, modular and cost-effective. On the other<br>
hand, once certified systems are available, preservation and maintenance<br>
of their proofs of validity become key questions.</p>
<p>The goal of the ENTROPY workshop is to provide a forum for researchers<br>
and practitioners in this space, linking operating systems, formal<br>
methods, and hardware architecture, interested in system design as well<br>
as machine verified mathematical proofs using proof assistants such as<br>
Coq, Isabelle and HOL4.</p>
<p>This will be the second edition of the ENTROPY workshop series. The<br>
first workshop was organised by the Pip Development Team at University<br>
of Lille in 2018.</p>
