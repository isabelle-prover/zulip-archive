<p>AIM AND SCOPE</p>
<p>Low level software such as kernels and drivers, along with the hardware<br>
this software runs on, is critical for application security. In contrast<br>
with user applications, OS kernel software runs in privileged CPU mode<br>
and is thus highly critical. Large projects such as seL4, VeriSoft,<br>
CertiKoS and Prosper have invested considerable resources in developing<br>
formally verified systems such as hypervisors and microkernels, supplying<br>
proofs that they satisfy critical properties. Such proofs are delicate in<br>
terms of the scale and complexity of real systems, the models used in<br>
performing the proof search, and the relations between the two, which<br>
recent vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown have shown to be a<br>
highly non-trivial issue.</p>
<p>The purpose of this workshop is to share, compare and disseminate best<br>
practices, tools and methodologies to verify OS kernels, also setting the<br>
stage for future steps in the direction of fully verified systems,<br>
dealing with issues related to modelling, model validation, and large<br>
proof maintenance through system evolution. On one hand, we need to make<br>
low-level proofs more scalable, modular and cost-effective. On the other<br>
hand, once certified systems are available, preservation and maintenance<br>
of their proofs of validity become key questions.</p>
<p>The goal of the ENTROPY workshop is to provide a forum for researchers<br>
and practitioners in this space, linking operating systems, formal<br>
methods, and hardware architecture, interested in system design as well<br>
as machine verified mathematical proofs using proof assistants such as<br>
Coq, Isabelle and HOL4.</p>
<p>This will be the second edition of the ENTROPY workshop series. The<br>
first workshop was organised by the Pip Development Team at University<br>
of Lille in 2018.</p>
<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST</p>
<p>Specific topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified kernels and hypervisors</li>
<li>Verified security architectures and models</li>
<li>Tools and frameworks for hardware security analysis</li>
<li>Tools and frameworks for security analysis</li>
<li>Formal hardware models and model validation techniques</li>
<li>Theorem prover based tools and frameworks for verification of low level code</li>
<li>Combinations of static analysis and theorem proving</li>
<li>Theories and techniques for compositional security analysis</li>
<li>Case studies and industrial experience reports</li>
<li>Proof maintenance techniques and problems</li>
<li>Compositional models and verification techniques</li>
<li>Proof oriented design</li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of the workshop is to stimulate innovation and active exchange<br>
of ideas, so position papers, work-in-progress and industrial<br>
experience submissions are welcome.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION</p>
<p>There are two categories of submissions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete results<br>
(10 pages, references included, IEEE format)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short papers, position papers, industry experience reports,<br>
work-in-progress submissions (4 pages, references included, IEEE<br>
format)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All papers should be in English and describe original work that has not<br>
been published or submitted elsewhere. The submission category should<br>
be clearly indicated. All submissions will be fully reviewed by members<br>
of the Programme Committee. Papers will appear in IEEE Xplore in a<br>
companion volume to the regular EuroS&amp;P proceedings. For formatting and<br>
submission instructions see <a href="https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/h5JtCjZroMFQkjkKFW-1Th?domain=entropy2019.sciencesconf.org">https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/h5JtCjZroMFQkjkKFW-1Th?domain=entropy2019.sciencesconf.org</a>.</p>
