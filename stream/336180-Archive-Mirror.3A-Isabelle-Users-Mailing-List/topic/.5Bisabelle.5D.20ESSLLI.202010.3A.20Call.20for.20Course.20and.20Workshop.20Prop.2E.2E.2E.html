<p>22nd European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information</p>
<p>ESSLLI 2010, 9-20 August, 2010, University of Copenhagen, Denmark</p>
<p>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</p>
<p>CALL FOR COURSE and WORKSHOP PROPOSALS</p>
<p>The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI)  <br>
is organized every year by the Association for Logic,<br>
Language and Information (FoLLI, <a href="http://www.folli.org">http://www.folli.org</a>) in different  <br>
sites around Europe. The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface<br>
between linguistics, logic and computation. ESSLLI offers  <br>
foundational, introductory and advanced courses, as well as workshops,<br>
covering a wide variety of topics within the three areas of interest:  <br>
Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic and<br>
Computation. Previous summer schools have been highly successful,  <br>
attracting up to 500 students from Europe and elsewhere. The<br>
school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for  <br>
discussion for students and researchers interested in the<br>
interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information.<br>
For more information, visit the FoLLI website, as well as ESSLLI?2009  <br>
website: <a href="http://esslli2009.labri.fr/">http://esslli2009.labri.fr/</a>.</p>
<p>The ESSLLI 2010 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational,  <br>
introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the<br>
22nd annual Summer School on important topics of active research in  <br>
the broad interdisciplinary area connecting logic, linguistics,<br>
computer science, and the cognitive sciences, structured within the 3  <br>
traditional ESSLLI streams:</p>
<p>-Language and Computation<br>
-Language and Logic<br>
-Logic and Computation<br>
We also welcome proposals that do not exactly fit one of these categories.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: All proposals should be submitted, using a  <br>
prescribed form that will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010<br>
website <a href="http://www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010">www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010</a>, through EasyChair on  <br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2010">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2010</a>, not later than</p>
<p><strong>*</strong><strong> Monday, September 7, 2009 </strong><strong>*</strong></p>
<p>Proposers must hold PhD or equivalent degrees and should follow the  <br>
guidelines below while preparing their submissions; proposals that<br>
do not conform with these guidelines may not be considered.</p>
<p>GUIDELINES FOR COURSE AND WORKSHOP PROPOSALS:</p>
<p>ALL COURSES: Courses are given over one week (Monday-Friday) and  <br>
consist of five 90 minutes sessions, one per day. Course<br>
proposals should give a brief overview of the topic and a tentative  <br>
content and structure of the course, as well as state the course?s<br>
objectives and clearly specify prerequisites, if any. Lecturers who  <br>
want to offer a long, two-week course, should submit two independent<br>
one-week courses (for example an introductory course in the first week  <br>
of ESSLLI, and a more advanced course during the second). The<br>
ESSLLI program committee has the right to select only one of the two  <br>
proposed courses.</p>
<p>TIMETABLE FOR COURSE PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:</p>
<p>Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline</p>
<p>Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline</p>
<p>Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course material  <br>
by the ESSLLI?2010 local organizers</p>
<p>FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: These are strictly elementary courses not  <br>
assuming any background knowledge. They are intended for<br>
people who wish to get acquainted with the problems and techniques of  <br>
areas new to them. Ideally, they should allow researchers from<br>
other fields to acquire the key competencies of neighboring  <br>
disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly  <br>
interdisciplinary<br>
research community. Foundational courses should require no special  <br>
prerequisites, but may presuppose some experience with scientific<br>
methods and general appreciation of the field of the course.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to the  <br>
activities of the Summer School. They are intended to provide an<br>
introduction to the (interdisciplinary) field for students, young  <br>
researchers, and other non-specialists, and to equip them with a good<br>
understanding of the course field's basic methods and techniques. Such  <br>
courses should enable experienced researchers from other fields<br>
to acquire the key competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus  <br>
encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary research<br>
community. Introductory courses in, for instance, Language and  <br>
Computation, can build on some knowledge of the component fields; e.g.,<br>
an introductory course in computational linguistics should address an  <br>
audience which is familiar with the basics of linguistics and<br>
computation. Proposals for introductory courses should indicate the  <br>
level of the course as compared to standard texts in the area (if any).</p>
<p>ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of  <br>
advanced Masters or PhD students. Proposals for<br>
advanced courses should specify the prerequisites in detail.</p>
<p>WORKSHOPS: Workshops run over one week and consist of five 90-minutes  <br>
sessions, one per day. The aim of the workshops is to<br>
provide a forum for advanced Ph.D. students and other researchers to  <br>
present and discuss their work. Workshops should have a well<br>
defined theme, and workshop organizers should be specialists in the  <br>
theme of the workshop. The proposals for workshops should justify<br>
the choice of topic, give an estimate of the number of attendants and  <br>
expected submissions, and provide a list of at least 15 potential<br>
submitters working in the field of the workshop. The organizers are  <br>
required to give a general introduction to the theme during the first<br>
session of the workshop. They are also responsible for the  <br>
organization and program of the workshop including inviting the  <br>
submission of<br>
papers, reviewing, expenses of invited speakers, etc. In particular,  <br>
each workshop organizer will be responsible for sending out a Call for<br>
Papers for the workshop and to organize the selection of the  <br>
submissions by the deadlines specified below. The call for workshop<br>
submissions must make it clear that the workshop is open to all  <br>
members of the ESSLLI community and should indicate that all workshop<br>
contributors must register for the Summer School.</p>

Summer School; however, they will be able to register at a reduced rate<br>
to be determined by the Local Organizers.</p>
<p>FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS: A form for submitting course and workshop  <br>
proposals will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010 website<br>
<a href="http://www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010">www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010</a>.</p>
<p>The proposers are required to submit the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name(s) of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s), at most two  <br>
per course or workshop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact addresses, homepages, phones, and fax numbers (if  <br>
available), of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Title of proposed course/workshop;</p>
</li>
<li>Type (workshop, foundational, introductory, or advanced course)</li>
<li>
<p>Stream (one of: Language &amp; Computation, Language &amp; Logic, Logic &amp;  <br>
Computation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Description (in at most 300 words, provide justification, relevance  <br>
to ESSLLI, proposed contents and structure of the courses, resp.<br>
   expected participation in the workshops)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>External funding (whether the proposers will be able to obtain  <br>
external funding for travel and accommodation expenses)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further particulars (any further information that is required by the  <br>
above guidelines should be included here; in particular, course<br>
   objectives and prerequisites, as well as the lecturers teaching  <br>
experience relevant to the proposed course, and generally in the<br>
   interdisciplinary field scope of ESSLLI.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FINANCIAL ASPECTS: Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers  <br>
should be aware that all teaching and organizing at the summer<br>
schools is done on a voluntary basis in order to keep the participants  <br>
fees as low as possible. Lecturers and organizers are not paid for<br>
their contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation  <br>
(up to fixed maximum amounts, that will be communicated to the<br>
lecturers upon notification). It should be stressed that while  <br>
proposals from all over the world are welcomed, the School cannot  <br>
guarantee<br>
full reimbursement of travel costs, especially from destinations  <br>
outside Europe. Please note that in case a course or workshop is to be<br>
taught/organized by two lecturers, a lump sum will be reimbursed to  <br>
cover travel and accommodation expenses for one lecturer; the<br>
splitting of that sum is up to the lecturers.</p>
<p>The local organizers would highly appreciate it if, whenever possible,  <br>
lecturers and workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover<br>
travel and accommodation expenses, as that would help us keep the cost  <br>
of attending ESSLLI?2010 lower.</p>
