<p>Workshop on Trends, Extensions, Applications and<br>
            Semantics of Logic Programming (TEASE-LP 2020)<br>
                  Dublin, Ireland, 25 April 2020<br>
                   (co-located with ETAPS 2020)<br>

<p>Logic programming is a framework for expressing programs, propositions<br>
and relations as Horn clause theories, with the purpose of performing<br>
automatic inference in these theories. Horn clause theories are famous<br>
for their well-understood declarative semantics, in which models of<br>
logic programs are given inductively or coinductively. At the same time,<br>
Horn clauses give rise to efficient inference procedures, usually involving<br>
resolution. Logic programming found applications in type inference,<br>
verification, and AI. While logic programming was originally conceived<br>
for describing simple facts, it was extended to account for much more<br>
complex theories. This includes higher-order theories, inductive and<br>
coinductive data, and stochastic/probabilistic theories.</p>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers that work on<br>
extensions of logic programming and inference methods, and to foster an<br>
exchange of methods and applications that have emerged in different<br>
communities.</p>
<p>Topics</p>
<hr>
<p>The central idea of this workshop is to discuss the theory of logic<br>
programming and associated topics that have as well the goal to<br>
automatically infer knowledge and proofs. Our intention is to bring<br>
together researchers that work on the numerous topics that contribute to<br>
automatic proof inference and foster an exchange that may lead to  advances<br>
in the theory of logic programming.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>* Proof theory (e.g. focalised and uniform proofs),<br>
    * Logic programming beyond the classical Horn clause theories<br>
      (e.g. coinduction, higher-order Horn clauses, probabilities,<br>
      categorical logic, inductive LP),</p>
<p>* Extensions of logic programming (e.g. DataLog, description logic,<br>
      relational programming),</p>
<p>* Advanced implementations (e.g. λProlog, ELPI, miniKanren),<br>
    * Type theory (e.g. polarised λ-calculus, proofs-as-programs,<br>
       types for logic programming),</p>
<p>* Semantics (e.g. classical, categorical, algebraic, coalgebraic) , and<br>
    * Applications.</p>

<p>Submission Instructions</p>
<hr>
<p>Since the aim of the workshop is to foster exchange and discussions<br>
on trends, extensions, applications and semantics of logic programming,<br>
we invite presentations of possibly already published as well as ongoing<br>
work. Submissions should be abstracts of at most two pages in<br>
EPTCS style (<a href="http://style.eptcs.org/">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>) and will be only be published in<br>
the informal pre-proceedings and on the website of the workshop.<br>
Post-proceedings volume may be solicited by the PC, based on the quality<br>
of contributions. Contributions should be submitted via the Easychair<br>
system:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=teaselp2020">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=teaselp2020</a></p>
<p>All contributions will be refereed by the programme committee and it is<br>
expected that at least one of the authors will be present during the<br>
workshop.</p>
