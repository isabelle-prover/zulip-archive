Hi,</p>
<p>We use Isabelle/HOL in a compiler runtime verification <br>
environment. The verification process comprises "lookup <br>
operations" in lists, function updates and sets, i.e. <br>
proving lemmata of the following form:</p>
<p>lemma "a mem [...,a,...]"<br>
lemma "f (...,a:= b,...) a = b"<br>
lemma "a : {...,a,...}"</p>
<p>If the lists, function updates, and sets grow large, these <br>
lookups take up almost all of the time of a verification <br>
run. In our current version we instantiate Isabelle's <br>
simplifier with some simple rules like</p>
<p>"x  = a | x : A ==&gt; x : insert a A"</p>
<p>to achieve time linear to the size of the underlying <br>
structure the lookup is conducted on.<br>
However a lookup still takes quite long: several minutes <br>
for a list of a few thousand elements. For the <br>
verification of some relatively small programs thousands <br>
of lookups are needed in structures containing thousands <br>
of elements.</p>
<p>Is anyone aware of a technique to do this faster?</p>
<p>What do you think of "bypassing" Isabelle's simplifier to <br>
make such lookups faster? One problem is probably that we <br>
would "spoil" the Isabelle implementation and the "trusted <br>
computing base" would grow larger.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

There are several possible solutions.</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>
<p>If your application is executable you may be able to generate ML code <br>
from it and run it completely independently of Isabelle. The speedup <br>
will be about 100. If it is almost executable, it may be worth making it <br>
fully executable (eg an implementation of finite sets as lists is <br>
already in the Library).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, as you say, bypass the the simplifier by writing an oracle, i.e. <br>
trusted piece of ML code that checks if an element is in a list/set. <br>
This is probably the quick an dirty solution (although you need to <br>
familiarize yourself with oracles).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You explicitly use some efficient data structure rather than a list <br>
or set, eg a binary tree. This is completely safe, requires no low-level <br>
coding, but you will need to develop the efficient data structure (the <br>
theory BinarySearchTree in the AFP may provide much of what you need) <br>
and will need to use it rather than the abstract type of <br>
list/function/set (which should not complicate proofs much).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative 0 can also be used "locally" by compiling executable <br>
goals like "a mem [...]" into ML and executing them there. The <br>
development version of Isabelle contains a proof method "evaluation" <br>
which does just this. However, currently it can only be used to solve a <br>
goal outright and it is not integrated with other proof tools. More <br>
flexible versions are in preparation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use "reflection" to translate you list/function/set problem <br>
into some efficient data structure and execute it there. In contrast to <br>
alternative 2 you only do this reflection at specific points (when you <br>
need to solve expensive goals) but otherwise work with the usual <br>
mathematical types of lists/sets/etc. Efficiency is guaranteed as in 3.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for bringing this up. Efficient executability is an important <br>
issue we are working on at the moment. Challenge problems are welcome.</p>

<p>From: Brian Huffman &lt;<a href="mailto:brianh@csee.ogi.edu">brianh@csee.ogi.edu</a>&gt;<br>
A good solution might be to write a simplification procedure (or simproc) to <br>
solve these kinds of subgoals. A simproc is an ML function that takes a term <br>
t as an argument, and optionally returns a theorem of the form t == t'. You <br>
can learn more about them in the Isabelle reference manual.</p>
<p>For example, you could write some ML code that examines terms of the form x : <br>
A, checking to see whether term x occurs explicitly in the term A. If so, it <br>
could then build theorem of the form "x : A == True" using Eq_TrueI, insertI1 <br>
and insertI2 together with some simple theorem combinators. If term x is not <br>
found in the term A, the simproc would just fail and do nothing (hopefully <br>
this is not the common case).</p>
<p>Note that since a simproc builds an actual theorem that proves the equality, <br>
you aren't adding anything to the trusted code base. You should still get a <br>
significant speedup, because the ML code would be much faster than making <br>
hundreds of recursive calls to the simplifier.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

There is one more solution possibility, you could use the compute oracle <br>
in Pure/Tools/compute.ML.<br>
It is already included in your Isabelle build (so it is somewhere <br>
between the "trusted base" and the rest :-)),<br>
you can invoke it by calling once</p>
<p>Compute.basic_make ....</p>
<p>and then each time you simplify a term by</p>
<p>Compute.rewrite ...</p>
<p>There are two major drawbacks to this method:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can only simplify terms which contain no type variables.</li>
<li>You have to configure the rewrite by calling Compute.basic_make and <br>
give it ALL the theorems used for rewriting;<br>
    these theorems must not contain type variables, either;</li>
</ol>
<p>The no-type-variables limitation in 2) is not so bad if you know what <br>
types you can possibly have in your terms; you can just instantiate the <br>
polymorphic rewrite theorems with all types you need and give these to <br>
Compute.basic_make.</p>
<p>I have used above technique successfully for fast matrix multiplication, <br>
gaining a speed-up-factor comparable to compilation.<br>
It is more trustworthy than compilation, though, because it builds <br>
directly on Pure and makes no additional assumptions.</p>
