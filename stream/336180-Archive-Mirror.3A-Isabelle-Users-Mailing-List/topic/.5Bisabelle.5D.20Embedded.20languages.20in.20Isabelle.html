Here are further examples for embedded languages in Isabelle:</p>
<p>Isabelle2019/src/Pure/Tools/rail.ML<br>
  Isabelle2019/src/Pure/Syntax/simple_syntax.ML</p>
<p>Both is based on Isabelle parser combinators. There is also proper<br>
support for formal positions and Prover IDE markup in the rail<br>
application -- without that an Isabelle language is not complete.</p>
<p>(Note on browsing sources in Isabelle/Pure: Documentation panel, entry<br>
src/Pure/ROOT.ML + its explanation at the top of the file.)</p>
<p>I don't think that your first idea to change the Isabelle term language<br>
will work out in general: certain assumptions about lexical syntax and<br>
identifiers are deeply rooted in the system. There are some explanations<br>
on formal names in section 1.2 of the "implementation" manual (see the<br>
Documentation panel in Isabelle/jEdit). In particular, the system may<br>
transform names within a term in certain situation, e.g. "x" could<br>
become "x_" or "xa" or "?xa" later on.</p>
<p>You did not say anything about the application context nor the overall<br>
motivation. There might be more plain and basic approaches, e.g. an<br>
application notation \&lt;app&gt; where this newly allocated Isabelle symbol<br>
is rendered as a thin space.</p>

<p>From: Daniel Kirchner &lt;<a href="mailto:daniel@ekpyron.org">daniel@ekpyron.org</a>&gt;<br>
Thank you very much for your pointers!<br>
I already looked at Pure/Syntax/simple_syntax.ML, but Pure/Tools/rail.ML <br>
indeed looks quite helpful, especially with respect to the Prover IDE markup <br>
(I already tried to implement that in my preliminary approaches, but the <br>
example will prove very helpful, even though I might move to a different <br>
approach altogether for my current application at least for now, see below).</p>
<p>To say a bit more about my application: I'm constructing a shallow semantic <br>
embedding of a philosophical logic (Edward Zalta's "Theory of Abstract <br>
Objects"). That logic is quite different from HOL in multiple ways, which makes <br>
this an interesting research project. For example the language contains two <br>
kinds of atomic formulas, i.e. Fxy "x and y 'exemplify' F" and xyF "x and y <br>
'encode' F", neither of which can be implemented as mere function application <br>
in an embedding in HOL. The variable names have type implications, e.g. x and <br>
y have a different type than F and G, which again have a different type from <br>
e.g. \kappa, etc. - some of these types map directly to types in HOL, others I <br>
need to implement with guarding behind additional constants, etc.<br>
My basic implementation maps all these concepts to constructs in the Isabelle <br>
term language in a working, but not in a user-friendly way - e.g. I need <br>
special syntax for both exemplification and encoding and at times explicit type <br>
annotations (resp. "type guard constants"), etc.<br>
In other words I have a working implementation of the logic, but not of its <br>
syntax (i.e. I can map formulas of the logic to corresponding "not-so-nice-<br>
looking" formulas in Isabelle's term language, but this mapping is "manual <br>
effort").</p>
<p>So what I'm currently trying to research is how close I can get to the actual <br>
syntax of the target language directly in Isabelle, so that a person who is <br>
used to the target logic has an easier time working with the embedding.</p>
<p>The target logic itself also defines new symbols in terms of its basic symbols, <br>
so the implementation should be extensible very much like with mixfix <br>
annotations to constants or "syntax" commands. That's why I'm trying to avoid <br>
duplicating an implementation of a priority grammar. (The definitions in the <br>
target logic themselves are not quite the same as Isar definitions, so I will <br>
probably introduce new outer syntax commands for them, but in the end they <br>
will translate to "plain", but more complex definitions satisfying the narrowly <br>
defined inferential role of definitions in the hyper-intensional free logic of <br>
the target system).</p>
<p>At the moment I'm trying to only <em>parse</em> the actual syntax of the language, <br>
not to print it, i.e. a formula given in the syntax of the target logic, will <br>
be translated to its representation in Isabelle's term logic and further <br>
reasoning will be done in Isabelle's term logic directly (I think this should <br>
alleviate the problem of transformed names like x_ and xa, but at a later <br>
stage it might also be interesting to go further and print in the target <br>
logic's syntax and continue reasoning in it as well, for which this indeed <br>
will be an issue).</p>
<p>Given that I basically need to support something like mixfix notation for <br>
extending the syntax and reproducing a suitable variant of the Isabelle term <br>
language manually from strings or cartouches in the end seems like an <br>
unnecessary duplication of work (especially since Pure/Syntax/syntax.ML, Pure/<br>
Syntax/syntax_phases.ML, etc., are not exactly meant to be used like this), <br>
I'm now trying to mainly stay within the Isabelle term language itself. <br>
Interestingly, only now after looking through the syntax parsing ML code I <br>
realize that I can do much more than I thought within its boundaries.</p>
<p>Simplified that approach will look like</p>
<p>consts valid :: "p =&gt; bool"<br>
consts emb_implies :: "p =&gt; p =&gt; p"<br>
nonterminal q<br>
syntax valid :: "q =&gt; bool" ("[\Turnstile _]")<br>
             emb_implies "q =&gt; q =&gt; q" (infixl "-&gt;" 8)<br>
             emb_not "q =&gt; q" ("\&lt;not&gt;_" [40] 70)<br>
             "_atomic_formula" :: "id_position =&gt; q" ("_")<br>
etc.</p>
<p>and then installing a parse_ast_translation for "_atomic_formula" which splits <br>
up e.g. "Fxy" to "(_exe F x y)" and "xyF" to "(_enc x y F)", which is then <br>
translated to the corresponding term in a parse_translation.</p>
<p>So far this is working out quite well and is alleviating the need to deal with <br>
markup myself for now, so I will see how far I will get with this approach.</p>
<p>Regarding your suggestion to introduce something like "\&lt;app&gt;", printed as a <br>
thin space: I actually tried this at one point and attempted to introduce <br>
"\&lt;delim&gt;" to be printed as zero-width-space, but (1) this still makes it <br>
harder to type formulas in the target logic and might actually be quite <br>
confusing and (2) I had some issues with jedit at least with zero-width spaces <br>
(I'm not sure about thin spaces anymore) - unfortunately I don't quite <br>
remember what these issues were right now.</p>
<p>In any case: I think I can work with this for now and thank you very much for <br>
your help so far and for clarifying the fact that the ML parsing <br>
infrastructure for Isabelle's term language is probably best not to be re-/<br>
abused for purposes like this.</p>
<p>In general in the long run it would, of course, be nice to have a self-<br>
contained "reentrant" and "public" version of the parser for Isabelle's term <br>
language in ML, in which every aspect could be customized, including the <br>
lexicon and tokenizing and maybe even the generation of "fresh" variable <br>
names, etc. - but I realize that this is way too much to ask especially for my <br>
very specific and probably rather exotic use case :-).</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>

<p>Thanks for the general application outline -- it is always important to<br>
keep the big picture in mind. A language that is very different from the<br>
Isabelle/Pure lambda calculus (which is reused in the Isabelle/HOL<br>
library) definitely poses a challenge. It will require very careful<br>
exploration to do just the right thing, otherwise it will lead to an<br>
unmaintainable blob of "code" that nobody can understand nor maintain.</p>

<p>Note that there are different levels of complexity rolled into Isabelle<br>
term notation. A command like 'notation' with plain mixfix is relatively<br>
close to the priority grammer: if you subtract special things like<br>
'binder' from the mixfix syntax, it is even simpler. In contrast,<br>
'syntax' + 'translations' (or 'parse_translation' etc.) opens a not so<br>
clearly defined space of adhoc syntax additions. If your own language<br>
does not require that, it would greatly simplify a standalone<br>
implementation of it (one that is independent of the Isabelle "syntax<br>
phases").</p>

<p>BTW, printing also means document output of the sources in HTML or<br>
LaTeX. There is an implicit assumption that adjacent letters for one<br>
word, not individual identifiers. Compare this with LaTeX typesetting of<br>
$abc$ vs. \emph{abc}. Presently, there is no proper way in the document<br>
preparation system to change the typesetting of names, but it is<br>
conceivable that a future notion of antiquotations within terms could<br>
also go through document presentation.</p>

<p>This looks much better to me. It deescalates the overall complexity of<br>
the implementation by some orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Apart from id_position you can also experiment with cartouches for<br>
certain well-defined sub-languages.</p>

<p>This sounds a bit like marketing talk for "software frameworks". Such<br>
software components don't exist, and where people have tried it its has<br>
lead to maintenance nightmares.</p>
<p>The inner syntax implementation of Isabelle/Pure is the opposite of<br>
that. It has many special tricks based on the particular situation to<br>
make it just work by accident. I have reworked the architecture and<br>
implementation many times in the past 25 years. A few more reforms of it<br>
are still in the pipeline, e.g. subterm PIDE markup as seen in the tiny<br>
rail example.</p>
<p>Such reforms naturally break bad applications of it -- or the other way<br>
round: bad applications prevent further reforms.</p>
