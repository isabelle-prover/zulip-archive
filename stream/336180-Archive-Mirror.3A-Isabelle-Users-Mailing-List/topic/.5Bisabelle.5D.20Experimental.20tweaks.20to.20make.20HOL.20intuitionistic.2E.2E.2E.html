<p>From: Josh Tilles &lt;<a href="mailto:merelyapseudonym@gmail.com">merelyapseudonym@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
I've come across a few errors that are blocking my progress. I'm not sure<br>
what to do besides trying to become familiar with <em>all</em> of Isabelle's<br>
internals, so I'd appreciate any advice/direction—particularly on the two<br>
specific errors I present below.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>
--Josh Tilles</p>
<p>These errors have arisen because I've returned to a task that I last<br>
attempted a year or so ago: adapting HOL to make it possible to selectively<br>
"opt-in" to classical logic. I've thought of a few approaches that would<br>
work as initial proof-of-concepts. My intuition is that any of the below<br>
<em>should</em> be possible, but one might be more tractable than the others.</p>
<p>Extract HOL.True_or_False into a locale.</p>
<p>- seems like the ideal solution<br>
   - Ultimately, I think the locale <em>should</em> be named classical <em>but</em> I've<br>
   currently named it NonIntuitionistic because there's a lemma that's also<br>
   named classical and an ML structure named Classical. So if I wanted the<br>
   locale usage to stand out in these prototypes, I needed a different name.</p>
<p>- The problem is that the elim rules break:<br>
      - on the line "declare NonIntuitionistic.iffCE [elim!]" we see the<br>
      message:<br>
      exception THM 1 raised (line 332 of "drule.ML"):</p>
<p>RSN: no unifiers<br>
      PROP NonIntuitionistic ⟹ ?P = ?Q ⟹ (?P ⟹ ?Q ⟹ ?R) ⟹ (¬ ?P ⟹ ¬ ?Q ⟹<br>
      ?R) ⟹ ?R<br>
      PROP NonIntuitionistic ⟹ (¬ ?P ⟹ ?P) ⟹ ?P</p>
<p>Extract non-classical code into IHOL.thy, which the normal/classical HOL.thy<br>
subsequently imports.</p>
<p>- Took a lot of time the last time I tried it a year ago, so I don't<br>
   have a demonstration patch (yet)</p>
<p>- A major problem is that all future theories will need to be split<br>
   similarly</p>
<p>- For example, IOrderings.thy for all of the lemmas and theorems that<br>
      work in an intuitionistic context, and Orderings.thy as the theory<br>
      that contains everything in IOrderings.thy <em>plus</em> any lemmas/theories<br>
      that actually depend on classical logic.</p>
<p>Replace the global HOL.True_or_False axiomatization with many local<br>
assumptions/dependencies on the individual lemmas and theorems.</p>
<p>- probably the least amount of broad structural change (effectively,<br>
   we're just adding one more assumption to any classical lemmas)</p>
<p>- but tedious to make lots of minor changes to make to the proofs of the<br>
   lemmas</p>
<p>- you can see examples of this in my attached patch<br>
      - I totally acknowledge that my updated proofs are super-hacky at the<br>
      moment.</p>
<p>- needed to move the declarations of a bunch of lemmas as elimination<br>
   rules <em>before</em> the Hypsubst and Classical structures, otherwise I get an<br>
   error:</p>
<p>- on the line "declare iffCE [elim!]" we see the message:<br>
      exception Option raised (line 81 of "General/basics.ML")</p>
<p>- but if those particular errors go away if I relocate the<br>
      declarations</p>
<p>- unfortunately, anything elim-related fails with the same error</p>

There is certainly something to learn from it: how proof assistants were <br>
implemented in the early 1990-ies. See also the famous Handbook article by <br>
Larry Paulson "Designing a theorem prover": <br>

<p>The newer "Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning" by John <br>
Harrison also has a chapter on "Interactive theorem proving", see also <br>
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/atp">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/atp</a> --- it describes HOL-Light, so the <br>
prover architecture is very minimalistic.</p>
<p>That won't help in the project to remove the classical principle from <br>
Isabelle/HOL, which I would consider futile.  Why change the logic anyway? <br>
Better use it (and its many ad-on tools) to model your own language and <br>
logic inside it.</p>

<p>Are you being tongue-in-cheek? I can't tell. Like, I wouldn't have <br>
guessed that implementation techniques from twenty years ago are <br>
relevant now...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not intend to make jokes about old, but important articles.  There <br>
is definitely something to learn from ancient times, where the concepts <br>
are easier to see without all the rest around it that emerged over the <br>
decades.  Of course, you need to put things into the historical <br>
perspective, and see the key points of newer prover architecture -- <br>
Isabelle is very rich in that respect.</p>

<p>Note that HOL-Light is interesting in being a minimalistic model of an <br>
LCF-style prover that is in actual use.  That is part of its culture, and <br>
in contrast to Isabelle, but contrast also helps to learn something.</p>

<p>See what Larry said about non-standard analysis.  When you want to do <br>
realistic applications, it is better to keep the existing logical <br>
foundations, and build within that huge building what you need in <br>
addition.</p>
