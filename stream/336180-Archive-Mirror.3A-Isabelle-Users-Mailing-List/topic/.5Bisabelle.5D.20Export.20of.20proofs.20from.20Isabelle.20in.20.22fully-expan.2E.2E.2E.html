<p>From: Robin Green &lt;<a href="mailto:greenrd@greenrd.org">greenrd@greenrd.org</a>&gt;<br>
A question about transforming Isabelle proofs into really elementary, <br>
long-winded form:</p>
<p>I have not used Isabelle yet, but I have read in three places that <br>
Isabelle is designed to support many different logics and theories by <br>
having a relatively simple core language upon which everything else is <br>
implemented. It should, therefore, be possible to get Isabelle to output <br>
a proof _entirely_ in this core language (i.e. so that it uses only the <br>
very primitive notation from this core language, and only the most <br>
elementary possible inferences are used, and no other files are referred <br>
to), so that it can be independently verified by a very small, <br>
easy-to-reason-about proof verifier. (Of course that still leaves the <br>
question of whether the translation is correct, but let's ignore that <br>
for now.)</p>
<p>When I talk about "the most elementary possible inferences", I am <br>
thinking of something like Metamath[1], which is apparently based <br>
entirely on simple substitution rules. In other words, emphatically not <br>
(non-trivial) tactics.</p>
<p>In [2], I found a tantalising hint which suggests that this feature <br>
became available in Isabelle 99:</p>
<p>"The Isabelle 98 version is used in this thesis, although a later <br>
version (Isabelle99) has since been released. These recent versions<br>
of Isabelle support the construction and export of proof derivations, a <br>
feature that was not available in early versions of Isabelle."</p>
<p>However, I've been unable to ascertain, by browsing the documentation, <br>
where this export feature that Watson refers to, is. Is it there but <br>
undocumented, have I missed it, or have I misunderstood what it is? Or <br>
is it simply not there?</p>

<p>See Stefan Berghofer's thesis for a slightly more up-to-date report on <br>
proof terms (based on lambda calculus) for Isabelle/Pure. The Introduction <br>
and chapter 2 should give you some idea how this looks like.</p>

<p>I would consider the Metamath format slightly low-level, with adhoc <br>
handling of bound variable scopes; lambda calculus provides a more <br>
abstract and clean notion of variable binding and substitution.</p>
<p>Also note that the actual primary proof format for Isabelle is that of the <br>
Isar proof language, which admits writing proofs in a human-readable <br>
fashion.  Needless to say, everything will end up as a primitive internal <br>
proof object eventually, but normally these are getting too large to <br>
inspect them directly.  This is why humans would normally stay at the <br>
level of Isabelle/Isar proof documents -- printed in LaTeX/PDF.</p>

Replying to my own post -</p>
<p>My apologies. I read the paragraph I quoted too hastily and <br>
misunderstood it! Dr. Watson has informed me that the export of proof <br>
derivations _was_ supported in Isabelle 98 (not Isabelle 99 as I misread <br>
it) - and is covered in his thesis, from which that quotation was taken.</p>
<p>(Any further information not covered in that thesis would of course be <br>
appreciated.)</p>
