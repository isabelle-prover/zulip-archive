<p>Programming Languages for Mechanized Mathematics Workshop</p>
<p>As part of Calculemus 2007 <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/Calculemus2007/">http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/Calculemus2007/</a>&gt;<br>
Hagenbergs, Austria<br>
June 29-30, 2007.</p>
<p>The intent of this workshop is to examine more closely the intersection between<br>
programming languages and mechanized mathematics systems (MMS). By MMS, we<br>
understand computer algebra systems (CAS), [automated] theorem provers<br>
(TP/ATP), all heading towards the development of fully unified systems (the<br>
MMS), sometimes also called universal mathematical assistant systems (MAS) (see<br>
Calculemus 2007<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/Calculemus2007/">http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/Calculemus2007/</a>&gt;).</p>
<p>There are various ways in which these two subjects of /programming languages/ and /systems for mathematics/ meet:</p>
<p>* Many systems for mathematics contain a dedicated programming<br>
     language. For instance, most computer algebra systems contain a<br>
     dedicated language (and are frequently built in that same<br>
     language); some proof assistants (like the Ltac language for Coq)<br>
     also have an embedded programming language. Note that in many<br>
     instances this language captures only algorithmic content, and<br>
     /declarative/ or /representational/ issues are avoided.</p>
<p>* The /mathematical languages/ of many systems for mathematics are<br>
     very close to a functional programming language. For instance the<br>
     language of ACL2 is just Lisp, and the language of Coq is very<br>
     close to Haskell. But even the mathematical language of the HOL<br>
     system can be used as a functional programming language that is<br>
     very close to ML and Haskell. On the other hand, these languages<br>
     also contain very rich specification capabilities, which are<br>
     rarely available in most computation-oriented programming<br>
     languages. And even then, many specification languages (B, Z,<br>
     Maude, OBJ3, CASL, etc) can still teach MMSes a trick or two<br>
     regarding representational power.</p>
<p>* Conversely, functional programming languages have been getting<br>
     "more mathematical" all the time. For instance, they seem to have<br>
     discovered the value of dependent types rather recently. But they<br>
     are still not quite ready to 'host' mathematics (the non-success<br>
     of docon &lt;<a href="http://www.haskell.org/docon/">http://www.haskell.org/docon/</a>&gt; being typical). There are<br>
     some promising languages on the horizon (Epigram<br>
     &lt;<a href="http://www.e-pig.org/">http://www.e-pig.org/</a>&gt;, Omega<br>
     &lt;<a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/%7Esheard/Omega/index.html">http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/%7Esheard/Omega/index.html</a>&gt;) as well as<br>
     some hybrid systems (Agda &lt;<a href="http://agda.sourceforge.net/">http://agda.sourceforge.net/</a>&gt;, Focal<br>
     &lt;<a href="http://focal.inria.fr/site/index.php">http://focal.inria.fr/site/index.php</a>&gt;), although it is unclear if<br>
     they are truly capable of expressing the full range of ideas<br>
     present in mathematics.</p>
<p>* Systems for mathematics are used to prove programs correct. (One<br>
     method is to generate "correctness conditions" from a program that<br>
     has been annotated in the style of Hoare logic and then prove<br>
     those conditions in a proof assistant.) An interesting question is<br>
     what improvements are needed for this both on the side of the<br>
     mathematical systems and on the side of the programming languages.</p>
<p>We are interested in all these issues. We hope that a certain synergy will<br>
develop between those issues by having them explored in parallel.</p>
<p>These issues have a very colourful history. Many programming language<br>
innovations first appeared in either CASes or Proof Assistants, before<br>
migrating towards more mainstream languages. One can cite (in no particular<br>
order) type inference, dependent types, generics, term-rewriting, first-class<br>
types, first-class expressions, first-class modules, code extraction, and so<br>
on. However, a number of these innovations were never aggressively pursued by<br>
system builders, letting them instead be developped (slowly) by programming<br>
language researchers. Some, like type inference and generics have flourished.<br>
Others, like first-class types and first-class expressions, are not seemingly<br>
being researched by anyone.</p>
<p>We want to critically examine what has worked, and what has not. Why are all<br>
the current ``popular''[1] computer algebra systems untyped? Why are the<br>
(strongly typed) proof assistants so much harder to use than a typical CAS? But<br>
also look at question like what forms of polymorphism exists in mathematics?<br>
What forms of dependent types exist in mathematics? How can MMS regain the<br>
upper hand on issues of 'genericity'? What are the biggest barriers to using a<br>
more mainstream language as a host language for a CAS or an ATP?</p>
<p>This workshop will accept two kinds of submissions: full research papers as<br>
well as position papers. Research papers should be nore more than 15 pages in<br>
length, and positions papers no more than 3 pages. Submission will be through<br>
_EasyChair_. An informal version of the proceedings will be available at the<br>
workshop, with a more formal version to appear later. We are looking into<br>
having the best papers completed into full papers and published as a special<br>
issue of a Journal (details to follow).</p>
