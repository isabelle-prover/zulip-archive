<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>I would like to provide a brief update on the status of the development of<br>
the extension of Types-To-Sets (<br>
<a href="https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-TTS-Ext/tree/ba4d22cac7fbcb907aad28ecbe00b6098c1f956c">https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-TTS-Ext/tree/ba4d22cac7fbcb907aad28ecbe00b6098c1f956c</a><br>
 and <a href="https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-SML-Relativization">https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-SML-Relativization</a>) and ask several<br>
questions. The primary motivation for the development of the framework were<br>
some of my personal applied formalization efforts. However, while my<br>
extension of the framework Types-To-Sets has reached a certain level of<br>
maturity, I slowly converged on the opinion that I would prefer not to rely<br>
on it in my own applied formalization work (the reasons for converging on<br>
this opinion are, primarily, subjective). Moreover, my personal<br>
circumstances have changed and I can no longer afford to spend as much time<br>
working on it as I was able around this summer.</p>
<p>Due to what is outlined in the previous paragraph, it no longer seems<br>
feasible for me to continue investing a significant amount of time in the<br>
further development of this framework (quite frankly, I have nearly<br>
abandoned this project at some point in September). Nevertheless, given<br>
that others have found Types-To-Sets useful, and I would like to think that<br>
the extension that I developed significantly improves the user experience<br>
for most of the routine relativization tasks, I am curious whether this<br>
work could be considered/recommended for the submission to the AFP, despite<br>
being somewhat rough.</p>
<p>Complete disclosure: the initial plans for further development included<br>
(informal) proofs of what I considered to be the critical parts of the<br>
implementation, unit testing of the less critical parts, user input<br>
verification (in conjunction with the proof/unit testing), refactoring the<br>
code and improvement of efficiency (the existing implementation is highly<br>
suboptimal in almost every aspect), provision of the documentation and<br>
further examples. Given my current circumstances, I would consider<br>
improving the user input verification (without any testing or proof and,<br>
therefore, without too much confidence) and providing documentation in the<br>
style consistent with the Isabelle/Isar reference manual/tutorials prior to<br>
the submission. However, refactoring, proof and/or unit testing would<br>
require more time than I would like to dedicate to further development of<br>
this framework.</p>
<p>I am reasonably impartial as to whether this work will be published on the<br>
AFP or not. Therefore, the question comes down to whether the authors of<br>
the original idea, those who have taken it further in the past and the<br>
existing users of Types-To-Sets would consider adopting my implementation.<br>
Most certainly, I would be keen to provide continuous support in the form<br>
of bug fixes and explanations of any design decisions/functionality. If I<br>
receive sufficient encouragement to submit it to the AFP, then I will<br>
allocate (approximately) 2 hours every week (perhaps, a little bit more<br>
time around Christmas) towards the completion of the development of a<br>
system for the user input verification and the documentation. In this case,<br>
I will be aiming to prepare it for the submission to the AFP before the end<br>
of January. However, I expect that most of the code will remain as it<br>
stands (the only exception being the removal of certain auxiliary and<br>
unfinished features).</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

It would be interesting to know why you decided not to use your <br>
framework in your own work - because of the framework, or because e.g., <br>
it builds on additional axioms?</p>

This sounds very nice: if it significantly improves the user experience <br>

<p>I think I would prefer to would use your framework instead of e.g., the <br>
ad-hoc developments in e.g., Types_To_Sets/Examples/Linear_Algebra_On.thy</p>
<p>I did not look at the details of your implementation in a while, so I <br>
cannot judge the technical quality of your work.<br>
But ultimately that is up to the editors of the AFP.</p>

<p>No. And I at least have never heard of any academic conference or<br>
journal that does that.</p>

<p>If possible, yes. If there are only a few minor problematic aspects,<br>
authors are usually encouraged to remedy them and resubmit.</p>
<p>Source: I am an AFP editor.</p>
<p>We have not had many AFP entries so far that contained a significant<br>
amount of ML code, let alone that consist entirely of ML code. Moreover,<br>
I think René Thiemann is the only AFP editor who has ever worked with<br>
Types-to-Sets at all and I don't know if he is familiar with its<br>
internals. This might make your entry a bit tough to review, but I'm<br>
sure we'll figure it out.</p>

<p>Lastly, I can imagine that the users of this mailing list are, most likely,<br>
tired of hearing about Types-To-Sets.</p>

<p>If they are, they will have to endure it. ;)</p>
<p>Types-to-Sets is an important subject and anything that makes it more<br>
usable in Isabelle is worth being discussed on the list. (Any decent<br>
email program allows muting threads easily for those who are not interested)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
