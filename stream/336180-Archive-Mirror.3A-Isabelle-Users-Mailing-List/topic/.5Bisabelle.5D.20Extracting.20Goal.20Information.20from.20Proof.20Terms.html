<p>From: Colin Farquhar &lt;<a href="mailto:cif30@hw.ac.uk">cif30@hw.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle users,</p>
<p>Im currently working on something which requires proofs constructed in<br>
Isabelle to be translated into Prolog in order to work with a machine<br>
learning tool. After some testing I have found that using proof terms is the<br>
easiest way to find the structure of a proof and which tactics are being<br>
used and in which order, but I also need the details of the goals the<br>
tactics are applied to.</p>
<p>For example, take the following lemma:</p>
<p>lemma a: A /\ B à B /\ A</p>
<p>apply (rule impI)</p>
<p>apply (erule conjE)</p>
<p>apply (rule conjI)</p>
<p>apply assumption</p>
<p>apply assumption</p>
<p>done</p>
<p>Using full_prf a gives me the proof term, while using val pterm_a =<br>
Proofterm.Proof_of (Proofterm.strip_thm (Thm.proof_body_of @{thm a})) gives<br>
a detailed description. The code I have written already provides a list of<br>
tactics in the order they are used, where each nested list contains the<br>
tactic(s) applied to the subgoal(s) generated by the previous tactic, eg.<br>
here the list would be [impI [conje [conjI [assumption,assumption]]]]. Im<br>
trying to get something similar for goals where each nested list contains<br>
the subgoal(s) generated by applying a tactic to the previous goal ( eg. [A<br>
/\ B à B /\ A [A /\ B è B /\ A [ A è B è B /\ A [A è B è B, A è B è A]]]] )<br>
which I can then map to the list of tactics to get a list of (tactic, goal)<br>
pairs. The problem is, I cant find a way to extract the details of the<br>
subgoals in the middle of the proof. Is this even possible using proof terms<br>
in this way? If so, can anyone help me with where I can find the information<br>
Im looking for?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

I am not sure if you've got any further in this quest in the meantime.</p>
<p>Proof terms are sometimes useful to see the foundational reasoning going <br>
on deep in the bottom of the inference engine, but they are hard to work <br>
with productively.  For two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Proof terms are very expensive for anything but rather small<br>
     applications of Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>(2) Analyzing proof terms is relatively difficult, because most of the<br>
     original resoning structure is lost; in particular, the original<br>
     tactical goal state is no longer there, as you have already noticed.</p>
<p>So we are back to what "proofs constructed in Isabelle to be translated <br>
into Prolog" really means.  Does it refer to arbitrary proofs found in the <br>
wild of actual applications, lets say the Archive of formal Proof?  Or <br>
does it mean some specific proof examples that you construct yourself?</p>
<p>Moreover, when you say "tactic" above, I guess that you mean "theorem". <br>
Is this correct?</p>
