Formal Aspects of Component Software (FACS 2009)</p>
<p>Call for Papers</p>
<p>6th International Workshop on Formal Aspects of Component Software</p>
<p>November 2-3, 2009<br>
                          Eindhoven, the Netherlands</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iist.unu.edu/facs09/">http://www.iist.unu.edu/facs09/</a></p>
<p>Submission deadline June 26, 2009</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Topics:</p>
<p>Component-based software has emerged as a promising paradigm to deal<br>
   with the ever increasing need for mastering systems' complexity,<br>
   for enabling evolution and reuse, and for bringing sound production<br>
   and engineering standards into software engineering. However, many<br>
   issues in component-based software development remain open and<br>
   pose challenging research questions.</p>
<p>Formal methods consist of mathematically-based<br>
   techniques for the specification, development and verification of<br>
   software and hardware systems. They have shown their great utility<br>
   for setting up the formal foundations of component software and working<br>
   out challenging issues such as mathematical models for components,<br>
   their composition and adaptation, or rigorous approaches to<br>
   verification, deployment, testing and certification.</p>
<p>The objective of FACS'09 is to bring together researchers in the<br>
   areas of component software and formal methods to promote a deep<br>
   understanding of this paradigm and its applications. The workshop<br>
   will also be interested in defining the common aspects of<br>
   components and component-based development. It is expected that<br>
   formal paper presentations will be followed by lively<br>
   discussions. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>- formal models for software components and component interaction<br>
   - design and verification methods for component software<br>
   - component composition and deployment: models, calculi, languages<br>
   - component testing, re-engineering and reuse<br>
   - specification of extra-functional properties in component<br>
     software</p>
<p>- certification of components and software architectures<br>
   - component software vs. object orientation, multi-agent systems,<br>
     and aspect oriented development</p>
<p>- components for real-time, safety-critical, secure and/or embedded<br>
     systems</p>
<p>- standard models for software components (e.g. Fractal, GCM, etc.)<br>
   - industrial or experience reports, and case studies in<br>
     component software</p>
<p>- partial behavior models for software components<br>
   - update and reconfiguration of component architectures<br>
   - component systems evolution and maintenance<br>
   - formal methods and modeling languages for components<br>
   - trust models for components<br>
   - autonomic components and self-managed applications<br>
   - formal / rigorous approaches to software adaptation and<br>
     self-adaptive systems</p>
<p>- formal aspects of Web services and business processes<br>
   - component-based Web services and service-oriented<br>
     architectures</p>
<p>- QoS issues in web services, multi-agent systems and<br>
     component-based systems</p>
<p>FACS'09 is the 6th event in a series of workshops, founded by<br>
   the International Institute for Software Technology of the United<br>
   Nations University (UNU-IIST). The first FACS workshop was<br>
   co-located with FM'03 (Pisa, Italy, September 2003). The<br>
   following FACS workshops were organised as standalone events,<br>
   respectively at UNU-IIST in Macau (October 2005), at Charles<br>
   University in Prague (September 2006), at INRIA in<br>
   Sophia-Antipolis (September 2007), and at University of Málaga in<br>
   Spain (September 2008). FACS'09 is planned to be co-located with<br>
   a number of events together under the heading of Formal Methods Week<br>
   (Eindhoven, the Netherlands, October 2009).</p>
<p>Submission &amp; proceedings:</p>
<p>Submissions to the workshop must present original research<br>
   that is unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>
   elsewhere. Papers will be judged on the basis of originality,<br>
   relevance, technical soundness and presentation quality.  Papers<br>
   must be written in English and not exceed 15 pages in the ENTCS<br>
   format. Note that to encourage submission of work still in<br>
   progress, we may also accept promising papers to be presented at<br>
   the workshop. The presenters of these papers will be entitled to<br>
   submit a revised version for full review for inclusion in the formal<br>
   (post-)proceedings to be published in ENTCS. Extended versions of all<br>
   accepted papers will be eligible for selection for a journal special<br>
   issue.  The final version of the papers must be prepared in LaTeX,<br>
   adhering to the ENTCS format (see <a href="http://www.entcs.org/final.html">http://www.entcs.org/final.html</a>).</p>
<p>Papers/abstracts can be submitted via the following link:<br>

<p>A special issue consisting of extended versions of selected papers from<br>
   FACS 2009 will be published in Science of Computer Programming. Selected<br>
   participants will be invited to submit an extended version of their <br>
papers<br>
   after the workshop. These extended versions will be reviewed by the<br>
   international program committee of FACS'09, which will decide on their<br>
   suitability for final publication in the special issue.</p>
