Pittsburgh, PA, USA</p>
<p>Affiliated with LICS 2008 and CSF 21</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>
===============</p>
<p>Papers due:   March 30<br>
Notification: May 16<br>
Final papers: June 01</p>
<p>SCOPE<br>
=====</p>
<p>The aim of the joint workshop FCS-ARSPA-WITS'08 is to provide a forum<br>
for continued activity in different areas of computer security,<br>
bringing computer security researchers in closer contact with the LICS<br>
community and giving LICS attendees an opportunity to talk to experts<br>
in computer security, on the one hand, and contribute to bridging the<br>
gap between logical methods and computer security foundations, on the<br>
other.</p>
<p>We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security<br>
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions<br>
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in<br>
new results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques<br>
and tools for the formal specification and analysis of security<br>
protocols. We thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work<br>
and on work in progress.</p>
<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Automated reasoning techniques, Composition issues, Formal<br>
specification, Foundations of verification, Information flow analysis,<br>
Language-based security, Logic-based design, Program transformation,<br>
Security models, Static analysis, Statistical methods, Tools, Trust<br>
management</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>Access and resource usage control, Authentication, Availability and<br>
denial of service, Covert channels, Confidentiality, Integrity and<br>
privacy, Intrusion detection, Malicious code, Mobile code, Mutual<br>
distrust, Privacy, Security policies, Security protocols</p>
<p>WITS is the official annual workshop organised by the IFIP WG 1.7 on<br>
"Theoretical Foundations of Security Analysis and Design", established<br>
to promote the investigation on the theoretical foundations of<br>
security, discovering and promoting new areas of application of<br>
theoretical techniques in computer security and supporting the<br>
systematic use of formal techniques in the development of security<br>
related applications. This is the eighth meeting in the series.</p>
<p>The workshop FCS continues a tradition, initiated with the Workshops<br>
on Formal Methods and Security Protocols (FMSP) in 1998 and 1999, then<br>
with the Workshop on Formal Methods and Computer Security (FMCS) in<br>
2000, and finally with the LICS satellite Workshop on Foundations of<br>
Computer Security (FCS) in 2002 through 2005, of bringing together<br>
formal methods and the security community.</p>
<p>ARSPA is a series of workshops on Automated Reasoning for Security<br>
Protocol Analysis, bringing together researchers and practitioners<br>
from both the security and the formal methods communities, from<br>
academia and industry, who are working on developing and applying<br>
automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal specification<br>
and analysis of security protocols. The first two ARSPA workshops were<br>
held as satellite events of the 2nd International Joint Conference on<br>
Automated Reasoning (IJCAR'04) and of the 32nd International<br>
Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP'05),<br>
respectively.</p>
<p>FCS and ARSPA have been joining forces since 2006: FCS-ARSPA'06 was<br>
affiliated with LICS'06, in the context of FLoC'06, and FCS-ARSPA'07<br>
was affiliated with LICS'07 and ICALP'07.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION<br>
==========</p>
<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must<br>
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.</p>
<p>Submissions should be at most 15 pages (a4paper, 11pt), including<br>
references.  The cover page should include title, names of authors,<br>
co-ordinates of the corresponding author, an abstract, and a list of<br>
keywords. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected<br>
immediately.  Additional material intended for the referees but not<br>
for publication in the final version - for example details of proofs -<br>
may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the<br>
page limit.</p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit their papers electronically, as portable<br>
document format (pdf) or postscript (ps); please, do not send files<br>
formatted for work processing packages (e.g., Microsoft Word or<br>
Wordperfect files).</p>
<p>Submission instructions will be published shortly on the workshop's<br>
webpage.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION<br>
===========</p>
<p>Informal proceedings will be made available in electronic format and<br>
they will be distributed to all participants of the workshop.</p>
<p>Moreover, workshop participants will be invited to submit full<br>
versions of their papers to a special issue of the Journal of<br>
Automated Reasoning, which will be open also to non-participants, in<br>
all cases with fresh reviewing.</p>
