CALL FOR PAPERS<br>
================</p>
<p>FCS'09</p>
<p>Workshop on Foundations of Computer Security<br>
<a href="http://www.loria.fr/~cortier/FCS09/">http://www.loria.fr/~cortier/FCS09/</a></p>
<p>August 9-10, 2009, Los Angeles, California, USA<br>
Affiliated with LICS'09.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>
================<br>
Papers due:     Extended to April 19, 2009<br>
Notification of acceptance:     May 29, 2009<br>
Final papers:     June 30, 2009</p>
<p>SCOPE<br>
======<br>
Computer security is an established field of computer science of both<br>
theoretical and practical significance. In recent years, there has<br>
been increasing interest in logic-based foundations for various<br>
methods in computer security, including the formal specification,<br>
analysis and design of security protocols and their applications, the<br>
formal definition of various aspects of security such as access<br>
control mechanisms, mobile code security and denial-of-service<br>
attacks, and the modeling of information flow and its application to<br>
confidentiality policies, system composition, and covert channel<br>
analysis.</p>
<p>The aim of the workshop FCS'09 is to provide a forum for continued<br>
activity in different areas of computer security, bringing computer<br>
security researchers in closer contact with the LICS community and<br>
giving LICS attendees an opportunity to talk to experts in computer<br>
security, on the one hand, and contribute to bridging the gap between<br>
logical methods and computer security foundations, on the other.</p>
<p>We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security<br>
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions<br>
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in<br>
new results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques<br>
and tools for the formal specification and analysis of security<br>
protocols. We thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work<br>
(possibly based on already published material) and on work in progress.</p>
<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:<br>
Automated reasoning techniques, Composition issues, Formal<br>
specification, Foundations of verification, Information flow analysis,<br>
Language-based security, Logic-based design, Program transformation,<br>
Security models, Static analysis, Statistical methods, Tools, Trust<br>
management<br>
for     Access control and resource usage control, Authentication,<br>
Availability and denial of service, Covert channels, Confidentiality,<br>
Integrity and privacy, Intrusion detection, Malicious code, Mobile<br>
code, Mutual distrust, Privacy, Security policies, Security protocols</p>
<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must<br>
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION<br>
===========<br>
Submissions should be at most 15 pages (a4paper, 11pt), including<br>
references.<br>
The cover page should include title, names of authors, co-ordinates of<br>
the corresponding author, an abstract, and a list of<br>
keywords. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected<br>
immediately. Additional material intended for the referees but not for<br>
publication in the final version - for example details of proofs - may<br>
be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the<br>
page limit.</p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit their papers electronically, as portable<br>
document format (pdf) or postscript (ps); please, do not send files<br>
formatted for work processing packages (e.g., Microsoft Word or<br>
Wordperfect files). The only mechanism for paper submissions is via<br>
the dedicated easychair submission web page.<br>
