<p>FHIES 2011<br>
                      International Symposium on<br>
Foundations of Health Information Engineering and Systems<br>
                (<a href="http://www.iist.unu.edu/ICTAC/FHIES2011/">http://www.iist.unu.edu/ICTAC/FHIES2011/</a>)<br>
           27-29 August 2011 Mabalingwe Nature Reserve, South Africa<br>
                   (Colocated with ICTAC 2011)</p>
<p>Information and communication technology plays an increasingly enabling <br>
role in addressing the global challenges of healthcare, in both the <br>
developed and the developing world, that are<br>
  the concern of the United Nations, its Peoples and Members States. The <br>
use of software in medical devices is already raising issues in relation <br>
to safety and efficacy for manufacturers and regulators. Health <br>
information systems raise issues of both privacy and confidentiality, on <br>
the one hand, and, increasingly, patient safety on the other. Hospital <br>
and other information systems raise important issues of efficacy and <br>
interoperability. However, to capitalize on the potential of this <br>
technology in reshaping healthcare demands focused research on sound and <br>
safe development techniques from software engineering, electronic <br>
engineering, computing science, information science, mathematics, and <br>
industrial engineering.</p>
<p>Aims<br>
=====<br>
The purpose of the new symposium series on Foundations of Software <br>
Engineering Health Informatics (FHIES) is to promote a nascent research <br>
area that aims to develop and apply theories and techniques in computing <br>
science and software engineering to modelling, building and certifying <br>
software based systems in the application domain of healthcare. Many of <br>
these systems are already regulated in many jurisdictions and many more <br>
of them will become regulated in the future.</p>
<p>Research on theories, techniques and tools of software modelling, <br>
verification and validation has been an important area of computer <br>
science and software engineering, known as Formal Methods. This research <br>
addresses the challenging problem of design and certification of safety <br>
or mission critical software systems through abstraction and <br>
decomposition techniques based on the use of mathematical modelling <br>
theories and sound engineering methods. Formal methods have primarily <br>
addressed the correctness of systems used in the industrial, financial, <br>
and defense applications. However, they have recently found application <br>
in modelling and analysis of complex systems that involve interacting <br>
behaviour of many kinds of objects and agents, including software <br>
systems, physical objects and humans. The models of these systems have <br>
both discrete and continuous behaviour, and both qualitative and <br>
quantitative (e.g., spatial timing and probabilistic) properties. It is <br>
believed that these methods can be used for modelling problems of health <br>
informatics, which presents the challenge of scalability.</p>
<p>Software plays a critical role in sustainable health care, both as part <br>
of the solution and as part of the problem. Software intensive <br>
information systems are needed to support the collection and processing <br>
of vast amounts of data via different devices, and allow policy makers <br>
to access and share these data, and to support their decision making and <br>
validation. Software systems can be developed for managing, controlling <br>
and monitoring policies, processes and workflows in medical systems. <br>
Software systems can be developed to help create the sophisticated <br>
medical devices that are simply impossible to build without the <br>
software. On the other hand, the application of software raises <br>
challenging issues in safety, security and privacy, and increases the <br>
complexity of healthcare workflows and the need for new business policies.</p>
<p>Paper Submissions<br>
==============</p>
<p>We solicit high quality submissions reporting on</p>
<p>1. original research contributions (18 pages maximum in LNCS format)<br>
    2. application experience, case studies and software prototypes (18 <br>
pages maximum in LNCS format)</p>
<p>3. surveys, comparisons, and state-of-the-art reports (18 pages <br>
maximum in LNCS format)</p>
<p>4. position papers that define research projects with identified <br>
challenges and milestones (10 pages maximum in LNCS format)</p>
<p>5. proposals for panel discussions, with at least three named <br>
panellists, about a topical question (5 pages maximum in LNCS format).</p>
<p>All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution <br>
to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the <br>
conference. Submissions should be in English, prepared in the LNCS <br>
format (see here for details). Submission constitutes a commitment to <br>
attend and present a paper, if accepted.</p>
<p>All accepted papers will be included in the pre-event proceedings of the <br>
symposium and considered for EXCEPT FOR the proposals for panel <br>
discussions inclusion in a special issue of the Springer Innovations in <br>
Systems and Software Engineering (ISSE), following revision and <br>
re-review.. The post proceedings will include a brief summary of panel <br>
discussions.</p>
