<p>FHIES 2011<br>
                      International Symposium on<br>
Foundations of Health Information Engineering and Systems<br>
                (<a href="http://www.ictac.net/FHIES2011/">http://www.ictac.net/FHIES2011/</a>)<br>
           27-29 August 2011 Mabalingwe Nature Reserve, South Africa<br>
                   (Colocated with ICTAC 2011)</p>
<p>Information and communication technology plays an increasingly enabling<br>
role in addressing the global challenges of healthcare, in both the <br>
developed and the developing world, that are the concern of the United <br>
Nations, its Peoples and Members States. The use of software in medical <br>
devices is already raising issues in relation to safety and efficacy for <br>
manufacturers and regulators. Health information systems raise  issues <br>
of both privacy and confidentiality, on the one hand, and, increasingly, <br>
patient safety on the other. Hospital and other information systems <br>
raise important issues of efficacy and interoperability. However, to <br>
capitalize on the potential of this technology in reshaping healthcare <br>
demands focused research on sound  and safe development techniques from <br>
software engineering, electronic  engineering, computing science, <br>
information science, mathematics, and  industrial engineering.</p>
<p>Aims<br>
=====<br>
The purpose of the new symposium series on Foundations of Software <br>
Engineering Health Informatics (FHIES) is to promote a nascent research <br>
area that aims to develop and apply theories and techniques in computing <br>
science and software engineering to modelling, building and certifying <br>
software based systems in the application domain of healthcare. Many of <br>
these systems are already regulated in many jurisdictions and many more <br>
of them will become regulated in the future.</p>
<p>Research on theories, techniques and tools of software modelling, <br>
verification and validation has been an important area of computer <br>
science and software engineering, known as Formal Methods. This research <br>
addresses the challenging problem of design and certification of safety <br>
or mission critical software systems through abstraction and <br>
decomposition techniques based on the use of mathematical modelling <br>
theories and sound engineering methods. Formal methods have primarily <br>
addressed the correctness of systems used in the industrial, financial, <br>
and defence applications. However, they have recently found application <br>
in modelling and analysis of complex systems that involve interacting <br>
behaviour of many kinds of objects and agents, including software <br>
systems, physical objects and humans. The models of these systems have <br>
both discrete and continuous behaviour, and both qualitative and <br>
quantitative (e.g., spatial timing and probabilistic) properties. It is <br>
believed that these methods can be used for modelling problems of health <br>
informatics, which presents the challenge of scalability. Software plays <br>
a critical role in sustainable health care, both as part of the solution <br>
and as part of the problem. Software intensive information systems are <br>
needed to support the collection and processing of vast amounts of data <br>
via different devices, and allow policy makers to access and share these <br>
data, and to support their decision making and validation. Software <br>
systems can be developed for managing, controlling and monitoring <br>
policies, processes and workflows in medical systems. Software systems <br>
can be developed to help create the sophisticated medical devices that <br>
are simply impossible to build without the software. On the other hand, <br>
the application of software raises challenging issues in safety, <br>
security and privacy, and increases the complexity of healthcare <br>
workflows and the need for new business policies.</p>
<p>Paper Submissions<br>
==============</p>
<p>We solicit high quality submissions reporting on</p>
<p>1. original research contributions (18 pages maximum in LNCS format)<br>
    2. application experience, case studies and software prototypes (18 <br>
pages maximum in LNCS format)</p>
<p>3. surveys, comparisons, and state-of-the-art reports (18 pages <br>
maximum in LNCS format)</p>
<p>4. position papers that define research projects with identified <br>
challenges and milestones (10 pages maximum in LNCS format)</p>
<p>5. proposals for panel discussions, with at least three named <br>
panellists, about a topical question (5 pages maximum in LNCS format).</p>
<p>All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution <br>
to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the <br>
conference. Submissions should be in English, prepared in the LNCS <br>
format. Papers should be submitted at <br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fhies2011">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fhies2011</a>. Submission <br>
constitutes a commitment to attend and present a paper, if accepted.</p>
<p>All accepted papers will be included in the pre-event proceedings of the <br>
symposium and considered for EXCEPT FOR the proposals for panel <br>
discussions inclusion in a special issue of the Springer Innovations in <br>
Systems and Software Engineering (ISSE), following revision and re-review.</p>
