                     International Symposium on<br>
Foundations of Health Information Engineering and Systems<br>
               (<a href="http://www.iist.unu.edu/ICTAC/FHIES2011/">http://www.iist.unu.edu/ICTAC/FHIES2011/</a>)<br>
          27-29 August 2011 Mabalingwe Nature Reserve, South Africa<br>
                  (Colocated with ICTAC 2011)</p>
<p>Information and communication technology plays an increasingly enabling<br>
role in addressing the global challenges of healthcare, in both the<br>
developed and the developing world, that are the concern of the United<br>
Nations, its Peoples and Members States. The use of software in medical<br>
devices is already raising issues in relation to safety and efficacy for<br>
manufacturers and regulators. Health information systems raise issues of<br>
both privacy and confidentiality, on the one hand, and, increasingly,<br>
patient safety on the other. Hospital and other information systems<br>
raise important issues of efficacy and interoperability. However, to<br>
capitalize on the potential of this technology in reshaping healthcare<br>
demands focused research on sound and safe development techniques from<br>
software engineering, electronic engineering, computing science,<br>
information science, mathematics, and industrial engineering.</p>
<p>Aims<br>
=====<br>
The purpose of the new symposium series on Foundations of Software<br>
Engineering Health Informatics (FHIES) is to promote a nascent research<br>
area that aims to develop and apply theories and techniques in computing<br>
science and software engineering to modelling, building and certifying<br>
software based systems in the application domain of healthcare. Many of<br>
these systems are already regulated in many jurisdictions and many more<br>
of them will become regulated in the future.</p>
<p>Research on theories, techniques and tools of software modelling,<br>
verification and validation has been an important area of computer<br>
science and software engineering, known as Formal Methods. This research<br>
addresses the challenging problem of design and certification of safety<br>
or mission critical software systems through<br>
abstraction and decomposition techniques based on the use of<br>
mathematical modelling theories and sound engineering methods. Formal<br>
methods have primarily addressed the correctness of systems used in the<br>
industrial, financial, and defence applications. However, they have<br>
recently found application in modelling and analysis of complex systems<br>
that involve interacting behaviour of many kinds of objects and agents,<br>
including software systems, physical objects and humans. The models of<br>
these systems have both discrete and continuous behaviour, and both<br>
qualitative and quantitative (e.g., spatial timing and probabilistic)<br>
properties. It is believed that these methods can be used for modelling<br>
problems of health informatics, which presents the challenge of scalability.</p>
<p>Software plays a critical role in sustainable health care, both as part<br>
of the solution and as part of the problem. Software intensive<br>
information systems are needed to support the collection and processing<br>
of vast amounts of data via different devices, and allow policy makers<br>
to access and share these data, and to support their decision making and<br>
validation. Software systems can be developed for managing, controlling<br>
and monitoring policies, processes and workflows in medical systems.<br>
Software systems can be developed to help create the sophisticated<br>
medical devices that are simply impossible to build without the<br>
software. On the other hand, the application of software raises<br>
challenging issues in safety, security and privacy, and increases the<br>
complexity of healthcare workflows and the need for new business policies.</p>
<p>Paper Submissions<br>
==============</p>
<p>We solicit high quality submissions reporting on</p>
<p>1. original research contributions (18 pages maximum in LNCS format)<br>
   2. application experience, case studies and software prototypes<br>
      (18 pages maximum in LNCS format)</p>
<p>3. surveys, comparisons, and state-of-the-art reports<br>
      (18 pages maximum in LNCS format)</p>
<p>4. position papers that define research projects with identified<br>
      challenges and milestones (10 pages maximum in LNCS format)</p>
<p>5. proposals for panel discussions, with at least three named<br>
      panellists, about a topical question (5 pages maximum in LNCS<br>
      format).</p>
<p>All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution<br>
to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the<br>
conference. Submissions should be in English, prepared in the LNCS<br>
format (see here for details). Submission constitutes a commitment to<br>
attend and present a paper, if accepted.</p>
<p>All accepted papers will be included in the pre-event proceedings of the<br>
symposium. It is the plan to publish the post event proceedings either<br>
by ACM or Springer in the LNCS series, and it will include all the<br>
accepted submissions, EXCEPT FOR the proposals for panel discussions.<br>
The post proceedings will include a brief summary of panel discussions.</p>
