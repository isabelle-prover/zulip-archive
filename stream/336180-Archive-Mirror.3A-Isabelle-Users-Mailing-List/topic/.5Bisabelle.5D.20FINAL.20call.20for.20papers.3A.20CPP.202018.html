FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>The 7th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference<br>
     on Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP 2018)</p>
<p>co-located with POPL 2018<br>
           in cooperation with ACM SIGLOG</p>
<p><a href="http://conf.researchr.org/track/CPP-2018/CPP-2018">http://conf.researchr.org/track/CPP-2018/CPP-2018</a></p>
<p>8-9 January, 2018, Los Angeles, USA</p>
<p>NOTE: Deadline approaching!</p>
<p>Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP) is an international forum on<br>
theoretical and practical topics in all areas, including computer<br>
science, mathematics, and education, that consider certification as an<br>
essential paradigm for their work. Certification here means formal,<br>
mechanized verification of some sort, preferably with production of<br>
independently checkable certificates.</p>
<p>Important dates</p>
<hr>
<p>- Abstract submission deadline:   Fri 6 Oct 2017<br>
  - Full paper submission deadline: Wed 11 Oct 2017<br>
  - Notification:                   Tue 14 Nov 2017<br>
  - Camera-ready deadline:          Sun 26 Nov 2017<br>
  - Conference dates:               Mon 8 - Tue 9 Jan 2018</p>
<p>Topics of interest</p>
<hr>
<p>We welcome submissions in research areas related to formal<br>
certification of programs and proofs. The following is a suggested<br>
list of topics of interests to CPP. This is a non-exhaustive list and<br>
should be read as a guideline rather than a requirement.</p>
<p>- certified or certifying programming, compilation, linking, OS<br>
    kernels, runtime systems, and security monitors;</p>
<p>- program logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code;<br>
  - certified decision procedures, mathematical libraries, and<br>
    mathematical theorems;</p>
<p>- proof assistants and proof theory;<br>
  - new languages and tools for certified programming;<br>
  - program analysis, program verification, and proof-carrying code;<br>
  - certified secure protocols and transactions;<br>
  - certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra,<br>
    polynomial systems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of<br>
    interest;</p>
<p>- certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality,<br>
    first-order logic, and higher-order unification;</p>
<p>- certificates for program termination;<br>
  - logics for certifying concurrent and distributed programs;<br>
  - higher-order logics, logical systems, separation logics, and logics<br>
    for security;</p>
<p>- teaching mathematics and computer science with proof assistants.</p>
<p>Submission Guidelines</p>
<hr>
<p>Papers should be submitted in PDF format through the EasyChair<br>
submission page at</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2018</a></p>
<p>Submitted papers must be formatted following the ACM SIGPLAN<br>
Proceedings format using the acmart format with the sigplan option,<br>
using 10 point font for the main text.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/">http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/</a></p>
<p>Submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages, including tables and<br>
figures, but excluding bibliography. Shorter papers are welcome and<br>
will be given equal consideration.</p>
<p>Abstracts must be submitted by October 6, 2017 (AOE). The deadline for<br>
full papers is October 11, 2017 (AOE), and authors have the option to<br>
withdraw their papers during the window between the two.</p>
<p>Submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient detail<br>
to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper. They<br>
should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the<br>
main results, and a brief explanation of their significance and<br>
relevance to the conference, all phrased for the<br>
non-specialist. Technical and formal developments directed to the<br>
specialist should follow. References and comparisons with related work<br>
should be included. Papers not conforming to the above requirements<br>
concerning format and length may be rejected without further<br>
consideration.</p>
<p>Whenever appropriate, the submission should come along with a formal<br>
development, using whatever prover, e.g., Agda, Coq, Dafny, Elf, HOL,<br>
HOL-Light, Isabelle, Lean, Matita, Mizar, NQTHM, PVS, Vampire,<br>
etc. Such formal developments must be submitted together with the<br>
paper as auxiliary material, and will be taken into account during the<br>
reviewing process.</p>
<p>The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>
elsewhere, including the proceedings of other published conferences or<br>
workshops. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work<br>
submitted to a conference or journal in advance of<br>
submission. Original formal proofs of known results in mathematics or<br>
computer science are welcome. One author of each accepted paper is<br>
expected to present it at the conference.</p>
<p>For any questions about the formatting or submission of papers, please<br>
consult the PC chairs.</p>
