==========================================================================<br>
Abstract Submission Deadline: April 30, 2007<br>
Paper Submission Deadline:    May 7, 2007<br>

<p>SCOPE OF CONFERENCE<br>
==========================================================================<br>
FMCAD 2007 is the seventh in a series of conferences on the theory and <br>
application of formal methods in hardware and system design and <br>
verification. In 2005, the bi-annual FMCAD and sister conference CHARME <br>
decided to merge to form an annual conference with a unified community. <br>
The resulting unified FMCAD provides a leading international forum to <br>
researchers and practitioners in academia and industry for presenting <br>
and discussing groundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical <br>
results, and tools for formally reasoning about computing systems, as <br>
well as open challenges therein. FMCAD 2007 will include a full day of <br>
tutorials, and will be co-located with the ACL2 Workshop. Topics of <br>
interest for the technical program include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Foundations: advancing industrial-strength technologies in model <br>
checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and <br>
refinement techniques, property-preserving reduction techniques, <br>
compositional methods, decision procedures, SAT- and BDD-based methods, <br>
combining deductive methods with decision procedures, and probabilistic <br>
methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification applications: tools, industrial experience reports, and <br>
case studies.  We encourage the submission of materials relating to <br>
novel and challenging industrial-scale applications of formal methods, <br>
including problem domains where formal methods worked well or even fell <br>
short. We also encourage submissions relating to the development and <br>
execution of methodologies for formal and informal verification strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of formal methods in design: topics relating to the <br>
application and applicability of assertion-based verification, <br>
equivalence checking, transaction-level verification, semi-formal <br>
verification, runtime verification, simulation and testcase generation, <br>
coverage analysis, microcode verification, embedded systems, software <br>
verification, concurrent systems, timing verification, and formal <br>
approaches to performance and power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model-based approaches: modeling and specification languages, <br>
system-level design and verification, design derivation and <br>
transformation, and correct-by-construction methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal methods for the design and verification of emerging and novel <br>
technologies: nano, quantum, biological, video, gaming, and multimedia <br>
applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS<br>
==========================================================================<br>
Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format through the FMCAD <br>
Web site,   <a href="http://fmcad.org/2007">http://fmcad.org/2007</a>. The proceedings will be published by <br>
the IEEE and will be available online in the ACM Digital Library and the <br>
IEEE Xplore Digital Library. There are two categories of papers:</p>
<p>A. REGULAR PAPERS</p>
<p>Regular papers are limited to 8 pages using the IEEE Transactions format <br>
on letter-size paper with a 10-point font size (see <br>
<a href="http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html">http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html</a>). We <br>
recommend that self-citations be written in the third person, though <br>
authors will be required to identify themselves on their submissions. <br>
Submissions must contain original research that has not been previously <br>
published, nor concurrently submitted for publication. Any partial <br>
overlap with any published or concurrently submitted paper must be <br>
clearly indicated. If experimental results are reported, authors are <br>
strongly encouraged to provide adequate access to their data so that <br>
results can be independently verified. Papers should contain a short <br>
abstract of approximately 150 words clearly stating the contribution of <br>
the submission. Refer to <a href="http://fmcad.org/2007">http://fmcad.org/2007</a> for evolving submission <br>
details.  A small number of accepted papers will be considered for a <br>
distinguished paper award.</p>
<p>B. SHORT PAPERS</p>
<p>The page limit is 4 pages using the same format as for regular papers. <br>
Short papers can describe applications, case studies, industrial <br>
experience reports, emerging results, or implemented tools with novel <br>
features.  A demonstration will be required for accepted tool papers.</p>
