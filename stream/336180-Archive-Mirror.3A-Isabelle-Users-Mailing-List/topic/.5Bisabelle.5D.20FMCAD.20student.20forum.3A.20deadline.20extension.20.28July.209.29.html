<p>Submissions for the event must be short reports describing<br>
research ideas or ongoing work that the student is currently pursuing,<br>
and must be within the  scope of FMCAD.  Work, part of which has been<br>
previously published, will be considered; the novel aspect to be<br>
addressed in future work must be clearly described in such cases.  All<br>
submissions will be reviewed by a select group of program committee<br>
members.</p>
<p>The event will consist of short presentations by the student<br>
authors of each accepted submission, and of a poster that<br>
will be on display throughout the duration of the<br>
conference.  Accepted submissions will be listed, with title<br>
and author name, in the event description in the conference<br>
proceedings.  The authors will also have the option to<br>
upload their poster and presentation to the FMCAD web site.<br>
The best contribution (determined by the committee based<br>
on the quality of the submission and the presentation)<br>
will be given public recognition and a certificate at the event.</p>
<p>Limited funds will be available for travel assistance for<br>
US students with accepted contributions.</p>
<p>We kindly ask faculty members to help us advertise the event<br>
by displaying the posters available from the web-page in<br>
their departments.</p>
<p>If you have questions, please contact the forum chair<br>
Georg Weissenbacher (Vienna University of Technology, Austria).</p>
