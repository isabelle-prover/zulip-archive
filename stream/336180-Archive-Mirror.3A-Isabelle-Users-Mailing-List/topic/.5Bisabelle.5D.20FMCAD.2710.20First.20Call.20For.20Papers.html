<p>FMCAD 2010<br>
                   Call for Papers<br>
International Conference on Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design<br>
               Lugano, Switzerland<br>
               20-23 October 2010<br>
<a href="http://fmcad10.iaik.tugraz.at/">http://fmcad10.iaik.tugraz.at/</a></p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>Paper Submission:    5 May 2010<br>
Author Notification:  7 July 2010<br>
Final Version:         28 July 2010<br>
Conference:  20-23 October 2010</p>
<p>CONFERENCE SCOPE</p>
<p>FMCAD 2010 is the tenth in a series of conferences on the theory and<br>
application of formal methods in hardware and system design and<br>
verification.  FMCAD provides a leading international forum to researchers<br>
and practitioners in academia and industry for presenting and discussing<br>
novel methods, technologies, theoretical results, and tools for formally<br>
reasoning about computing systems, as well as open challenges therein. This<br>
year, FMCAD is privileged to have Joseph Sifakis, Founder and Director of<br>
VERIMAG Laboratory, a Turing Award 2007 winner, to deliver its keynote<br>
address on Scientific Challenges and Work Directions in Embedded Systems<br>
Design.</p>
<p>NEW: FMCAD 2010 has two tracks (but no parallel sessions): the research<br>
track and the industrial track.</p>
<p>RESEARCH TRACK</p>
<p>Topics of interest:</p>
<p>Advancing industrial-strength technologies in Model Checking,<br>
   Theorem Proving, Equivalence Checking, Abstraction and Refinement<br>
   Techniques, Reduction and Abstraction Techniques, Compositional<br>
   Methods, Decision Procedures, SMT solvers, Bit-Precise Reasoning,<br>
   Word-Level Techniques, SAT- and BDD-based methods, Probabilistic<br>
   Methods, and Combinations of Deductive Methods and Decision<br>
   Procedures.</p>
<p>Applications of Formal Methods in Specification, Design and<br>
   Verification</p>
<p>Topics relating to the application and applicability of Property-Based<br>
   Verification, Equivalence Checking, Semi-formal Verification, Runtime<br>
   Verification, Simulation and Test-case Generation, Coverage Analysis,<br>
   Microcode Verification, Concurrent Systems, Timing Verification, and<br>
   Formal Approaches to Performance and Power.</p>
<p>System-Level Design and Verification, especially for Embedded<br>
   Systems, Software Verification, HW/SW Co-Design and Verification,<br>
   Transaction-Level Verification.</p>
<p>Modeling and Specification Languages, Model-Based Design,<br>
   Verification-Based Testing, Design Derivation and Transformation,<br>
   Correct-by-Construction Methods.</p>
<p>INDUSTRIAL TRACK</p>
<p>This track is dedicated to industry users of formal methods, including<br>
   work on real industrial-scale designs being done in universities and<br>
   research organizations. We invite such users to describe their experience with<br>
   formal methods, including evaluations of commercial tools, case studies of<br>
   industrial-scale applications, experience reports on novel and challenging<br>
   applications, or methodologies for the incorporation of formal or semi-<br>
   formal methods into the industrial design flow.  Finally, we invite tool<br>
   presentations, of industrial-strength commercial tools as well as novel<br>
   academic tools that are not yet industrial strength, but address a real<br>
   industrial need.  Tool presentations should describe the capabilities or<br>
   novel features of the tool, or an innovative algorithm, a new approach,<br>
   or original application methodology.</p>
<p>EXHIBITION </p>
<p>FMCAD 2010 will feature also an exhibition with limited free-of-charge<br>
   booth space for which academic novelty is not a requirement.  Note that <br>
   since space is limited, we will not be able to accept every request for a booth, <br>
   and that preference will be given to requests by authors of accepted tool <br>
   presentations.  EDA vendors are especially encouraged to submit a tool <br>
   presentation and/or to request booth space in order to demo their tools.</p>
<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair.<br>
   More details will be provided on the FMCAD web site.  The<br>
   proceedings are planned to be published by IEEE and ACM and will be<br>
   available online in the ACM Digital Library and at IEEE Xplore.</p>
<p>Research Track Submissions</p>
<p>Two categories of research papers can be submitted: regular papers (8<br>
   pages) containing original research, and short papers (4 pages) describing<br>
   emerging results and work-in-progress.</p>
<p>Industrial Track Submissions</p>
<p>Submitters to the industrial track will have the option of submitting a<br>
   regular paper (8 pages), a short paper (4 pages), or a deck of up to<br>
   25 slides (for tool presentations: 4 pages or 15 slides). Both papers<br>
   and slide submissions will be reviewed. Regular and short papers will<br>
   appear in the proceedings as usual, while authors of accepted slide <br>
   presentations will be invited to write a one page abstract for the <br>
   proceedings.</p>
<p>For exhibition space, submission is not required and an email request to<br>
   the industrial track chairs is sufficient.  However, due to limited space<br>
   we will not be able to accept every request.  We therefore strongly<br>
   advise those interested in exhibition space to submit a tool presentation, <br>
   as we will give preference for booth space to authors of accepted tool <br>
   presentations.</p>
<p>Regular and short papers must use the IEEE Transactions format on<br>
   letter-size paper using a 10-point font (see<br>
<a href="http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html">www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html</a>).<br>
   Research Track papers must contain original research that has not been<br>
   previously published, nor concurrently submitted for publication.  For<br>
   both research and industry submissions, any partial overlap with a<br>
   published or concurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated.<br>
   (For slide decks, use an extra slide to discuss overlaps; this slide may<br>
   be excluded from the final presentation.)  By submitting their work,<br>
   the authors agree to present it at the conference if selected. Authors<br>
   are strongly encouraged to provide adequate access to their<br>
   experimental data for verification.</p>
<p>A small number of accepted papers will be considered for a<br>
   distinguished paper award.</p>
