FMICS-AVoCS 2016</p>
<p>International Workshop on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems<br>
and Automated Verification of Critical Systems</p>
<p><a href="http://fmics-avocs.isti.cnr.it/">http://fmics-avocs.isti.cnr.it/</a></p>
<p>26-29 September 2016<br>
CNR, Pisa, Italy</p>
<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Call for Papers <br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>The aim of the FMICS workshop series is to provide a forum for <br>
researchers who<br>
are interested in the development and application of formal methods in <br>
industry.<br>
The aim of the AVoCS workshop series is to contribute to the interaction and<br>
exchange of ideas among members of the international research community on<br>
tools and techniques for the verification of critical systems. In 2016, <br>
FMICS and<br>
AVoCS join their forces to hold a workshop combining their themes on formal<br>
methods and automated verification. For FMICS, this will be the 21st, <br>
for AVoCS<br>
the 16th edition.</p>
<p>In particular, FMICS-AVoCS 2016 aims to bring together scientists and <br>
engineers<br>
that are active in the area of formal methods, develop tools and <br>
techniques for the<br>
automated verification of critical systems, and are interested in <br>
exchanging their<br>
experiences in the industrial usage of these methods and tools.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>Abstract submission for full papers (extended): May 2, 2016<br>
Submission of full papers (extended): May 9, 2016<br>
Notification for full papers: June 19, 2016<br>

Notification for research ideas: August 17, 2016<br>
FMICS-AVoCS workshop: September 26-29, 2016</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>
<p>Thomas Arts (QuviQ AB, Gothenburg, Sweden)<br>
Jan Peleska (University of Bremen, Germany)</p>
<p>TOPICS of INTEREST include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Design, specification, refinement, code generation and testing of <br>
critical systems<br>
   based on formal methods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methods, techniques and tools to support automated analysis, <br>
certification,<br>
   debugging, learning, optimization and transformation of critical <br>
systems, in<br>
   particular distributed, real-time systems and embedded systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated verification (model checking, theorem proving, SAT/SMT <br>
constraint<br>
   solving, abstract interpretation, etc.) of critical systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification and validation methods that address shortcomings of <br>
existing methods<br>
   with respect to their industrial applicability (e.g., scalability and <br>
usability issues)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools for the development of formal design descriptions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case studies and experience reports on industrial applications of <br>
formal methods,<br>
   focusing on lessons learned or identification of new research directions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impact of the adoption of formal methods on the development process and<br>
   associated costs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application of formal methods in standardization and industrial forums</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SUBMISSION and PUBLICATION</p>
<p>Full paper submissions must describe authors' original research work and <br>
results.<br>
Submitted papers must not have previously appeared in a journal or <br>
conference with<br>
published proceedings and must not be concurrently submitted to any <br>
other peer-<br>
reviewed workshop, symposium, conference or archival journal. Any <br>
partial overlap<br>
with any such published or concurrently submitted paper must be clearly <br>
indicated.</p>
<p>Full paper submissions should clearly demonstrate relevance to <br>
industrial application.<br>
Case study papers should identify lessons learned, validate theoretical <br>
results<br>
(such as scalability of methods) or provide specific motivation for <br>
further research<br>
and development.</p>
<p>Full paper submissions should not exceed 15 pages formatted according to <br>
the LNCS<br>
style (Springer). All submissions will be reviewed by the Program <br>
Committee who<br>
will make a selection among the submissions based on the novelty, <br>
soundness and<br>
applicability of the presented ideas and results.</p>
<p>Research ideas: FMICS-AVoCS encourages the submissions of research ideas <br>
in order to<br>
stimulate discussions at the workshop. Reports on ongoing work or <br>
surveys on work<br>
published elsewhere are welcome. The Program Committee will select <br>
research ideas on<br>
the basis of submitted abstracts according to their significance and <br>
general interest.<br>
Abstracts of research ideas should not exceed 3 pages and they will not <br>
be part of<br>
the published proceedings.</p>
<p>Full papers and research ideas must be written in English and should be <br>
submitted as<br>
Portable Document Format (PDF) files using the EasyChair submission site:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmicsavocs2016">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmicsavocs2016</a></p>
<p>The workshop proceedings will be published by Springer in their LNCS <br>
series, while<br>
authors of the best full papers will be invited to submit extended <br>
versions to a<br>
special issue of the International Journal on Software Tools for <br>
Technology Transfer.</p>
