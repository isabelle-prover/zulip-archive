EXTENDED DEADLINE<br>
Call for Papers: FMIS 2007<br>
2nd International Workshop on Formal Methods for Interactive Systems<br>
A Satellite Workshop of HCI 2007<br>
Lancaster, UK - 4th September, 2007</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/research/imc/hum/fmis2007/">http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/research/imc/hum/fmis2007/</a></p>
<p>Important Dates<br>
            Submission deadline: 1 July 2007<br>
            Acceptance notification: 27 July, 2007<br>
            Workshop: 4th September, 2007</p>
<p>Background and Objectives</p>
<p>Reducing the likelihood of human error in the use of interactive systems<br>
is increasingly important: the use of such systems is becoming<br>
widespread in applications that demand high reliability due to safety,<br>
security, financial or similar considerations. Interactive systems are<br>
also becoming increasingly ubiquitous and being used in new and more<br>
complex situations. Consequently, the use of formal methods in verifying<br>
the correctness of interactive systems should also include analysis of<br>
human behaviour in interacting with the interface and with the wider<br>
socio-technical system.</p>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers in computer<br>
science, cognitive psychology, and other areas of HCI, from both<br>
academia and industry, who are interested in both formal methods and<br>
interactive system design.</p>
<p>Submitted papers should address issues of how formal methods can be<br>
applied to interactive system design. Topics of interest include, for<br>
example, the development of formal tools, techniques and methodologies<br>
based on cognitive psychology results, the development and use of formal<br>
user models, case studies applying formal methods to interface design,<br>
and formal analysis of the design of the wider socio-technical systems.<br>
The scope of HCI issues covered extends to all aspects of applying<br>
formal methods to interactive systems, including usability, user<br>
experience, human error, etc. We also welcome papers with a focus on<br>
theory provided a link to interactive systems is argued.</p>
<p>Application areas considered include but are not limited to:  mobile<br>
devices, embedded systems, safety-critical systems,  high-reliability<br>
systems,  shared control systems, digital libraries, eGovernment,<br>
pervasive systems,  augmented reality,  ubiquitous computing, and<br>
computer security applications.</p>
<p>Related Conferences</p>
<p>The workshop will be held in conjunction with HCI 2007<br>
(<a href="http://www.bcs-hci.org.uk/hci2007/">www.bcs-hci.org.uk/hci2007/</a>)  and prior to SEFM 2007: the 5th IEEE<br>
International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods<br>
(<a href="http://www.iist.unu.edu/SEFM07/">www.iist.unu.edu/SEFM07/</a>) which will be held in London the following<br>
week. Participants interested in  the themes of FMIS: HCI and formal<br>
methods may therefore wish to attend both  conferences following the<br>
workshop.</p>
<p>Submission</p>
<p>Submissions to the workshop must not have been published or be<br>
concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will<br>
be peer-reviewed and judged on the basis of originality, contribution to<br>
the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the<br>
workshop. Papers should be written in English and not exceed 16 pages.<br>
Papers may be accepted either for full presentation or short<br>
presentation at the workshop.</p>
<p>Negotiations are in progress to have the proceedings published  by<br>
Elsevier in the series Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science<br>
(ENTCS) as for FMIS 2006. Papers accepted as short presentations will be<br>
published in the participants proceedings at the workshop only, not the<br>
full published post-proceedings.</p>
<p>Publication of a selection of the papers in a journal special issue is<br>
also under consideration.</p>
<p>Detailed information on the submission procedure and formats required<br>
will be made available on the workshop website.</p>
