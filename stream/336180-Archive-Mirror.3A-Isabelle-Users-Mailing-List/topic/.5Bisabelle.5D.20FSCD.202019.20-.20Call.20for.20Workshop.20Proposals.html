<p>FSCD 2019 Call for Workshop Proposals<br>
(Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction, June 2019, Dortmund, Germany)<br>
<a href="http://easyconferences.eu/fscd2019/">http://easyconferences.eu/fscd2019/</a></p>
<hr>
<p>FSCD 2019 will be the fourth edition of the International Conference on Formal <br>
Structures for Computation and Deduction. The FSCD conference was created <br>
by the communities behind two major conferences, RTA (Rewriting Techniques <br>
and Applications) and TLCA (Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications). The first<br>
event took place in Porto, Portugal in June 2016 and was extremely successful,<br>
attracting 186 participants and 11 workshops.</p>
<p>We invite proposals for workshops, tutorials or other satellite<br>
events, on any topic to related formal structures in computation and<br>
deduction, from theoretical foundations to tools and applications. A<br>
full list of suggested topics is given here:<br>
<a href="http://fscdconference.org/editions/fscd-2019/cfpFSCD2019.pdf">http://fscdconference.org/editions/fscd-2019/cfpFSCD2019.pdf</a></p>
<p>Satellite events will take place on 24 June and 29-30 June, before and after <br>
the main conference on 25-28 June. It is expected that satellite events<br>
would run for 1 or 2 days, and be open to participants of parallel events.</p>
<p>PROPOSALS</p>
<p>Proposals should be submitted by email directly to the local workshop chair <br>
<a href="mailto:boris.d@di.ku.dk">boris.d@di.ku.dk</a>, with the following information:</p>

relevance to FSCD;</p>

presentations, tutorials, demo sessions, etc.);</p>
<p>* plans for invited speakers or special sessions;<br>
  * estimate of the number of participants;<br>

<p>* tentative schedule for paper submission and notification of acceptance;<br>
  * a brief description (up to 120 words) of the event for the website<br>
and publicity material;</p>
<p>* any other special requirements.</p>
<p>The organizers of satellite events are expected to create and maintain<br>
a website for the event; handle paper selection, reviewing and<br>
acceptance; draw up a programme of talks; advertise their event though<br>
specialist mailing lists; prepare the informal pre-proceedings (if<br>
applicable) in a timely fashion; and arrange any post-proceedings.</p>
<p>The FSCD 2019 organizing committee will handle promotion of the event<br>
on the main conference website; integration of the event's programme<br>
into the overall timetable; registration of participants; arrangement <br>
of an appropriate meeting room; and provision of lunch and coffee <br>
breaks for participants. We will waive the registration fees for <br>
