<p>From: Lars Hupel &lt;<a href="mailto:hupel@in.tum.de">hupel@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear list,</p>
<p>while trying to run some performance tests on potential future Jenkins<br>
servers, I've encountered a  in my opinion  severe problem. The setup is<br>
as follows:</p>
<p>$ isabelle version<br>
Isabelle2015: May 2015</p>
<p>$ uname -a<br>
Linux lars-demon 4.2.3-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Oct 3 18:52:50 CEST 2015<br>
x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>
<p>$ hg id # afp-2015 repository<br>
770bf7fe6d2b tip</p>
<p>If I now run the session "ConcurrentGC", this happens:</p>
<p>$ isabelle build -bv -d thys -o threads=1 ConcurrentGC<br>
[...]<br>
ML_PLATFORM="x86-linux"<br>
ML_HOME="/opt/Isabelle2015/contrib/polyml-5.5.2-3/x86-linux"<br>
ML_SYSTEM="polyml-5.5.2"<br>
ML_OPTIONS="-H 500"<br>
[...]<br>
*** A total of 104 subgoals...<br>
*** At command "by" (line 130 of "~/proj/afp-2015/thys/ConcurrentGC/TSO.thy")<br>
Unfinished session(s): ConcurrentGC</p>
<p>Exactly the same error occurs with the following settings:</p>
<p>ML_PLATFORM="x86_64-linux"<br>
ML_HOME="/opt/Isabelle2015/contrib/polyml-5.5.2-3/x86_64-linux"<br>
ML_SYSTEM="polyml-5.5.2"<br>
ML_OPTIONS="-H 2000"</p>
<p>I have managed to reproduce this behaviour on three different machines.<br>
However, now comes the worrying part: If I load the failing theory in<br>
Isabelle/jEdit, it goes through just fine! Same goes for building without<br>
"-o threads=1" *. This is a real problem, because I was actually planning<br>
to run each session of the AFP with "-o threads=1". Can anybody reproduce<br>
this behaviour? I'm scared ...</p>
<p>Best<br>
Lars</p>

<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:lammich@in.tum.de">lammich@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
We have analysed the problem:<br>
It appears in both, Isabelle2015 and Isabelle 40ca618e1b2d.</p>
<p>The behaviour of PARALLEL_GOALS may differ depending on whether there<br>
is one or more threads. It seems nowhere documented what are the<br>
constraints such that the behaviour for the parallel and sequential case<br>
matches, except a NEWS-file entry from 2011, which talks about no<br>
schematic variables and "uniform" behaviour.</p>
<p>The "vcg_jackhammer" tactic implemented in ConcurrentGC seems to run in<br>
one of the cases with different behaviour, and thus triggers the<br>
observed error.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the problem lies in the jackhammer-tactic or the<br>
PARALLEL_GOALS combinator. In any case, the current state is very<br>
unfortunate, as proof methods may behave differently depending on the<br>
number of threads. </p>
<p>In my opinion, the PARALLEL_GOALS-tactics should completely hide the<br>
effects of parallelism from the user, even if this means some slowdown<br>
in the sequential case (Note: Removing the optimization for the<br>
sequential case in PARALLEL_GOALS, and using the same map-reduce<br>
approach with retrofitting as in the parallel case, fixes the problem in<br>
ConcurrentGC)</p>

<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:lammich@in.tum.de">lammich@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
"Fix" was meant in the sense "make disappear this very instance of the<br>
problem". Actually the described change aligns the behaviour for<br>
threads=1 and threads&gt;1, sacrificing the optimization that is currently<br>
there for threads=1.</p>
<p>However, to general questions remain:</p>
<p>1) Is it intentional/desirable to have the behaviour of PARALLEL_GOALS<br>
depend on the number of threads:<br>
  Pro: This allows the current optimization for threads=1<br>
  Con: This makes debugging of tactics/proofs which use PARALLEL_GOALS<br>
harder, as one has to test for threads=1 and threads&gt;1 separately.</p>
<p>2) Is there any documentation on what are the preconditions of<br>
PARALLEL_GOALS such that it shows no diverging behaviour in the<br>
parallel/sequential case? This information is required by anyone who<br>
wants to use PARALLEL_GOALS in a thread-safe way.</p>

method can look again and explain the situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if the AFP entry gets changed, we have a broader problem here. Let<br>
me explain.</p>
<p>As Peter already said, there is no mention of "PARALLEL_GOALS" (or<br>
related combinators) in the official documentation. The only relevant<br>
mention we found is the following NEWS entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Refined PARALLEL_GOALS tactical: degrades gracefully for schematic<br>
goal states; body tactic needs to address all subgoals uniformly.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, there are only few occurrences in the visible Isabelle<br>
universe: The distribution uses it in "clasimp" and "simp", and there<br>
are only two more occurrences in the AFP which are not derived from what<br>
is used in the distribution ("AWN" and "Slicing") *. Hence, the usual<br>
heuristics of looking for canonical examples in the sources to figure<br>
out how it should be used fails. (Also, both "AWN" and "Slicing" build<br>
fine in single-threaded mode.)</p>
<p>Looking just at the implementation, it becomes obvious that the<br>
sequential case stems from a – what I would call – "performance<br>
optimization"; that is, if there is only one thread, there is no point<br>
in setting up auxiliary goal states, so the inner tactic can proceed<br>
undisturbed.</p>
<p>Now, there may very well be invariants which a tactic should fulfill in<br>
order to make both the sequential and the parallel execution<br>
observationally equivalent. My point is that this invariant – in<br>
contrast to many others – are not checked in this combinator, which<br>
allows for inconsistencies to sneak into the official AFP sources. Even<br>
if the AFP entry gets edited in such a way that the usage of the<br>
"PARALLEL_GOALS" combinator is canonical, there might be future<br>
non-canonical uses which are difficult to detect (needless to say, ML<br>
tactic code – while often being necessary – is hard to understand). In<br>
fact, the are only two ways I can think of: Time-intensive review of ML<br>
code or running entries in both single- and multi-threaded mode.</p>
<p>I'm a fairly young user on the general Isabelle time scale, but as far<br>
as I remember, additional checks have been introduced quite often to<br>
prevent the user from doing things which might "just work" but are not<br>
intended to happen (e.g. context discipline). In my opinion the best way<br>
to proceed is to both edit the AFP entry, and to either remove the<br>
optimization in the combinator or add additional robustness checks. In<br>
the case of the "ParallelGC" session, these two measures are independent<br>
of each other.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>
<ul>
<li>There is one more occurrence in "Isabelle_Meta_Model", but that seems<br>
like a copy of what happens in the simplifier.</li>

Hello Peter,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why would you want that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think we want that; I believe it is by accident. From what<br>
you're saying it sounds like your tactic is indeed "uniform", so should<br>
be acceptable for use with PARALLEL_GOALS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(What is the point of running single-threaded these days?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I only discovered that as part of my investigations into how to reliably<br>
build the AFP. There are essentially two axes for parallelism: Internal<br>
to a session (multi-threaded, e.g. parallel proofs, parallel theories)<br>
and between sessions (multi-process, i.e. independent AFP sessions can<br>
be run in parallel). Gerwin and I suspect that it would be most<br>
efficient to exploit the latter on the cost of the former, since the AFP<br>
dependency graph is quite sparse.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>

<p>Doing an exhaustive hypersearch on NEWS in Isabelle2015 provides the <br>
following bits of information:</p>
<p>Isabelle2009-1 (December 2009)</p>
<p>* PARALLEL_CHOICE and PARALLEL_GOALS provide basic support for<br>
   parallel tactical reasoning.</p>
<p>Isabelle2011-1 (October 2011)</p>
<p>* Refined PARALLEL_GOALS tactical: degrades gracefully for schematic<br>
   goal states; body tactic needs to address all subgoals uniformly.</p>
<p>Isabelle2015 (May 2015)</p>
<p>* Tactical PARALLEL_ALLGOALS is the most common way to refer to<br>
   PARALLEL_GOALS.</p>
<p>This provides a glimpse on the typical bottom-up construction of new <br>
Isabelle concepts.  We start with something we know already (<a href="http://Par_List.map">Par_List.map</a>) <br>
and work our way through further system structures, e.g. tactical <br>
reasoning with goal and subgoal addressing.</p>
<p>You probably know that the Larry-Paulson-goal-state is great in many <br>
respects, but also more concrete than semantically intended.  This means <br>
ML tactics and Isar proof methods need to be "well-behaved" in certain <br>
ways.  This is quite explicitly documented in the "implementation" manual, <br>
but I still see violations routinely in Isabelle applications.  The proof <br>
parallelization occasionally changes the representation of goal states, <br>
and tactic expressions seen in the wild break down.</p>
<p>The present situation seems to be much less spectacular, though.</p>
<p>For the PARALLEL_GOALS, the October 2011 NEWS snipped says "body tactic <br>
needs to address all subgoals uniformly".  This means it needs to ignore <br>
the accidental number of subgoals that it sees, and operate on all <br>
subgoals that happen to be there, e.g. like simp_all.</p>
<p>Since it already turned out a bit impractical to take this extra condition <br>
into account in applications, and all concrete uses were using ALLGOALS, <br>
the May 2015 version formalizes that situation by a new PARALLEL_ALLGOALS <br>
combinator and makes it "the most common way" in the NEWS.</p>
<p>The ConcurrentIMP session was added before the Isabelle2015 release, where <br>
PARALLEL_ALLGOALS was not yet available as canonical shortcut.  Thus it <br>
fell into the gap of the historical confusion of what PARALLEL_GOALS <br>
really means.</p>
<p>So this is just a routine case of updating existing AFP entries. What is <br>
less routine is the total run-time of that session, which makes <br>
maintenance more difficult.  I have already reduced it a lot by using the <br>
newer 'subgoal' Isar command, but that is for the next Isabelle release.</p>

<p>I will standardize all occurrences, but only in afp-devel.</p>

The behaviour and the name should fit together. A tactical that is a <br>
parallel version of ALLGOALS should be called like that. If PARALLEL_GOALS <br>
had been like PARALLEL_ALLGOALS from the outset, I would have also used <br>

<p>From: Peter Gammie &lt;<a href="mailto:peteg42@gmail.com">peteg42@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
I’m not doing anything clever here - my use of PARALLEL_GOALS was intended to have the same semantics as ALLGOALS (IIRC - it’s been a while). As far as I’m concerned it’s just an optimisation, albeit one that was somewhat essential to invariant discovery.</p>
<p>The goals produced by vcg_jackhammer should be completely independent (no schematics etc).</p>
<p>I never tested the single-threaded mode, and don’t see the point in it having an observably-distinct (wrt goal states etc.) semantics from the multi-threaded one. Why would you want that? (What is the point of running single-threaded these days?)</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for the diagnoses.</p>

<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>I had in mind to revisit it now-ish, but you’ve beaten me to it. The idea was to turn vcg_jackhammer into something case-like, so the larger proofs would look like:</p>
<p>proof vcg_jackhammer<br>
  case (statement_label x y z) then show ?thesis<br>
    &lt; existing apply gloop &gt;<br>
…</p>
<p>We talked about this earlier. I now have time to chase up your pointers. I hoped this would yield the kind of parallelism your “subgoal”s do now, with the advantage that it’d be more maintainable. Perhaps it’s a wash at this stage.</p>

<p>What always happens in such situations is that the total runtime converges <br>

The relevant changeset for Isabelle_Meta_Model is AFP/c4abbb09645a, but it <br>
merely conflates proper use of (PARALLEL_GOALS o ALLGOALS) to <br>
PARALLEL_ALLGOALS.</p>
<p>The remaining change for ConcurrentGC is included here -- I leave it to <br>
the author/maintainer to apply it on afp-2015 and/or afp-devel.  (E.g. <br>
with "hg import".)</p>
<p>That is the result of staring a rather long time at not-quite-canonical <br>
tactic definitions, to figure out how subgoal addressing is used. <br>
Non-standard indentation and overlong source lines make it more difficult <br>
to read the text than necessary.</p>
<p>Earlier on this thread, I claimed that there was merely a confusion of <br>
PARALLEL_GOALS vs. the newer PARALLEL_ALLGOALS, but basic goal addressing <br>
without parallelism was already unclear.  Here are relevant paragraphs <br>
from the "implementation" manual:</p>
<p>Operating on a particular subgoal means to replace it by an interval<br>
   of zero or more subgoals in the same place; other subgoals must not<br>
   be affected, apart from instantiating schematic variables ranging<br>
   over the whole goal state.</p>
<p>A common pattern of composing tactics with subgoal addressing is to<br>
   try the first one, and then the second one only if the subgoal has<br>
   not been solved yet.  Special care is required here to avoid bumping<br>
   into unrelated subgoals that happen to come after the original<br>
   subgoal.  Assuming that there is only a single initial subgoal is a<br>
   very common error when implementing tactics!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Some of these conditions are checked by higher-level goal<br>
   infrastructure (\secref{sec:struct-goals}); others are not checked<br>
   explicitly, and violating them merely results in ill-behaved tactics<br>
   experienced by the user (e.g.\ tactics that insist in being<br>
   applicable only to singleton goals, or prevent composition via<br>
   standard tacticals such as @{ML REPEAT}).</p>
<p>Testing this minor change required exceedingly long time, just to get 4-5 <br>
attempts work out eventually.</p>
<p>Are there deeper reasons for these proofs to be so slow?  The elapsed time <br>
of ConncurrentIMP is about that of all of the rest of AFP taken together.</p>
<p>As another peepwhole optimization, it should be possible to conflate</p>
<p>apply m1<br>
   apply m2<br>
   done</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>by m1 m2</p>
<p>This is forked in Isabelle/jEdit.  Unlike batch builds, more complex <br>

<p>Makarius, I am on holidays presently and will not get to this until February 2016 or later.</p>
<p>You have previously pushed substantial changes to ConcurrentGC without discussing them with me at all, and I don’t see why this should be any different. If it is important to you, go ahead and commit it. It should be clear that I simply want those tactics to work - I have no deep insight into the Isabelle tactic API, for otherwise I would have got it right before now.

<p>As for runtimes: Florian’s email on isabelle-dev 2015-11-26 (why is this thread I’m responding to on isabelle-users? Aren’t we talking about the development version of the AFP for the upcoming Isabelle2016 release? <em>brain explodes</em>):</p>

<p>The machine is ancient, but ConcurrentGC has always been that slow. <br>
