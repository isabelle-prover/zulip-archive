Hi *,</p>
<p>I stumbled upon some funny behaviour which prevents the simplifier in <br>
proving "True" in Isabelle2012 (also in 8a1ef12f7e6d). The reduced <br>
example is attached.</p>

<p>the warning message is printed not only for non-matching equalities but <br>

<p>Perhaps I can explain this better. Here's how the Nat_Arith<br>
cancellation simprocs worked before yesterday's rev. 868dc809c8a2 --<br>
note that this technique is <em>wrong</em> and simproc writers must avoid it!</p>
<p>The idea is to prove e.g. "(a + x + b &lt; c + x + d) = (a + b &lt; c + d)"<br>
by inserting "x" on the right, and then doing ac rewriting. The<br>
simproc does the same steps as this proof script:</p>
<p>schematic_lemma<br>
  "(a + size (x::?'b1::size) + b &lt; c + size (x::?'b1::size) + d) = (a</p>
<ul>
<li>b &lt; c + d)"<br>
apply (rule_tac ?k.1 = "size x" in nat_add_left_cancel_less [THEN subst_equals])<br>
apply (simp only: add_ac)</li>
</ul>
<p>Stepping through this proof with "show_sorts" enabled reveals the<br>
problem: The inserted "x" has type "?'b3" instead of "?'b1", because<br>
rule_tac automatically renames schematics in the rule to avoid clashes<br>
with schematics in the proof goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So you decided against the generic approach of importing the schematic<br>
variables? Was it because of efficiency?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't looked at efficiency yet. The more serious problem is that<br>
simprocs that use this approach now are broken! The simprocs in<br>
Provers/Arith/cancel_numerals.ML already try to use<br>
Variable.import_terms and Variable.export to temporarily fix<br>
schematics. But on Dmitriy's original example, natless_cancel_numerals<br>
returns an equation that cannot be used by the simplifier because its<br>
schematic type variables are instantiated.</p>
<p>I'm not sure, but there might be a bug in Variable.export and related<br>
functions. For example:</p>
<p>ML_val {*<br>
let<br>
  val ctxt = @{context}<br>
  val ts1 = [Thm.term_of @{cpat "size (x::?'a::size)"}]<br>
  val (ts2, ctxt') = Variable.import_terms true ts1 ctxt<br>
  val ts3 = Variable.export_terms ctxt' ctxt ts2<br>
in<br>
  (ts1, ts2, ts3)<br>
end<br>
*}</p>
<p>val it =<br>
   ([Const ("Nat.size_class.size", "?'a \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; nat") $ Free<br>
("x", "?'a")],<br>
    [Const ("Nat.size_class.size", "'a \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; nat") $ Free ("x", "'a")],<br>
    [Const ("Nat.size_class.size", "'a \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; nat") $ Free ("x", "'a")]):<br>
   term list * term list * term list</p>
<p>The export_terms step does nothing at all! (This example actually<br>
works correctly if we replace "x" with "?x" in the input term.)</p>
<p>I'm afraid we can't recommend simproc writers to use the<br>
Variable.import/export technique, at least not until we figure this<br>
out.</p>

<p>This is a hard crash, not a tactic failure.  Generally, goal states with <br>
polymorphic content (schematic type variables) are pathologic; many proof <br>
tools will choke on them.  It is of the "don't do it then category": <br>
posing goals with schematic type variables is asking for trouble.</p>
<p>Above this happens above after piping the "this" fact into the True goal <br>
via the "insert" phase of simp. Instead of 'using' polymoprhic facts, <br>
typically those from the background library, one should "add" them somehow <br>
to the automated tools, e.g. (simp add: ...), (auto simp add: ...), (auto <br>
iff: ...) ...</p>
<p>Anyway, did you have a concrete application where unresolved types in <br>
goals were required, or was it just one of the common accidents to get <br>
them via bad luck?</p>
<p>This incident remindes me again that I wanted to work out some refined <br>
color scheme for term variables with unexpected poloypmorphism, <br>
potentially with some extra tool tips apart from the coloring.</p>

<p>What is wrong, fixed, broken now?  I am confused.</p>
<p>The simproc under consideration stems from 1997, when I was supervising <br>
Stefan Berghofer in a very small student project.  According to the <br>
Mercurial history, it has not really been improved since then.  I first <br>
thought that it was covered by Brian's general simproc renovation project <br>
for Isabelle2012, but it does not seem the case.</p>
<p>IIRC, the system was more aggressive back then to reject goals with <br>
schematic types outright.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea is to prove e.g. "(a + x + b &lt; c + x + d) = (a + b &lt; c + d)"<br>
by inserting "x" on the right, and then doing ac rewriting. The<br>
simproc does the same steps as this proof script:</p>
<p>schematic_lemma<br>
 "(a + size (x::?'b1::size) + b &lt; c + size (x::?'b1::size) + d) = (a<br>
+ b &lt; c + d)"<br>
apply (rule_tac ?k.1 = "size x" in nat_add_left_cancel_less [THEN subst_equals])<br>
apply (simp only: add_ac)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goals with schematic type variables routinely lead to undefined behaviour. <br>
Schematic types for fixed term variables are especially pathologic. Does <br>
this example have any practical relevance?</p>
<p>Anyway, a more profound deficiency of this modest simproc is this: It is <br>
supposed to normalize certain outer algebraic structure, but it retains <br>
the concrete subterms.  Thus the normalization might do non-sense with the <br>
accidental substructure, not just with its hidden polymorphism as above.</p>
<p>This was already known in 1997, but we did not have the technology so do <br>
better on the spot.  Today in 2012, it should be trivial to use the local <br>
context of the simproc (from the "ss") to introduce fresh fixes for the <br>
terms (ts, us, vs), then prove the result in its generalized form with <br>
fully opaque subterms, finally export the resulting equation to hand it <br>
back to the simplifier.  Thus the local goal is fully fixed with fixed <br>
types, and the result as schematic and poylmorphic as required. The <br>
simplifier will apply higher-order matching to recover the concrete <br>
instance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure, but there might be a bug in Variable.export and related<br>
functions. For example:</p>
<p>ML_val {*<br>
let<br>
 val ctxt = @{context}<br>
 val ts1 = [Thm.term_of @{cpat "size (x::?'a::size)"}]<br>

<p>A fixed term variable x::?'a with schematic type should normally not occur <br>
during logical inference.  It conceptually means that the type-inference <br>
phase did not finish its job before entering the logic.  It might also <br>
mean that old and new tools were combined in a odd way, without the <br>
"proper context" or things not declared properly in the context.</p>
<p>Fixed type variables within fixed term variables are still fixed, <br>
according to Hindley-Milner polymorphism.  So the above export looks <br>
right. If subterms with their potential hidden polymorphism are made <br>
abstract as sketched above, such problems will not occur.</p>

<p>A simproc must never instantiate any schematic variable. Some<br>

<p>Perhaps I can explain this better. Here's how the Nat_Arith<br>
cancellation simprocs worked before yesterday's rev. 868dc809c8a2 --<br>
note that this technique is <em>wrong</em> and simproc writers must avoid it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is wrong, fixed, broken now?  I am confused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's wrong: The implementation of the simprocs in<br>
HOL/Tools/nat_arith.ML of Isabelle2012. (In particular, the function<br>
gen_uncancel_tac is not robust in the presence of schematics.) Writers<br>
of new simprocs should not emulate this code.</p>
<p>What's fixed: Since rev. 868dc809c8a2, the simprocs in<br>
HOL/Tools/nat_arith.ML work correctly on goals with schematics.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea is to prove e.g. "(a + x + b &lt; c + x + d) = (a + b &lt; c + d)"<br>
by inserting "x" on the right, and then doing ac rewriting. The<br>
simproc does the same steps as this proof script:</p>
<p>schematic_lemma<br>
 "(a + size (x::?'b1::size) + b &lt; c + size (x::?'b1::size) + d) = (a<br>
+ b &lt; c + d)"<br>
apply (rule_tac ?k.1 = "size x" in nat_add_left_cancel_less [THEN<br>
subst_equals])<br>
apply (simp only: add_ac)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goals with schematic type variables routinely lead to undefined behaviour.<br>
Schematic types for fixed term variables are especially pathologic. Does<br>
this example have any practical relevance?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it does.</p>
<p>Sometimes users have proof goals containing schematics. Sometimes they<br>
run the simplifier on such goals. This can result in simprocs being<br>
asked to rewrite terms containing schematics. For example, a simproc<br>
may need to internally prove the equality "(a + size (x::?'b1::size) +<br>
b &lt; c + size (x::?'b1::size) + d) = (a + b &lt; c + d)".</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the proof script above is not a <em>user</em> proof; it<br>
represents the internal proof done by a simproc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, a more profound deficiency of this modest simproc is this: It is<br>
supposed to normalize certain outer algebraic structure, but it retains the<br>
concrete subterms.  Thus the normalization might do non-sense with the<br>
accidental substructure, not just with its hidden polymorphism as above.</p>
<p>This was already known in 1997, but we did not have the technology so do<br>
better on the spot.  Today in 2012, it should be trivial to use the local<br>
context of the simproc (from the "ss") to introduce fresh fixes for the<br>
terms (ts, us, vs), then prove the result in its generalized form with fully<br>
opaque subterms, finally export the resulting equation to hand it back to<br>
the simplifier.  Thus the local goal is fully fixed with fixed types, and<br>
the result as schematic and poylmorphic as required. The simplifier will<br>
apply higher-order matching to recover the concrete instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think your idea would work. However it seems like it would be<br>
non-trivial to implement: You would have to determine the high-level<br>
structure of the original term, identify which of the complex subterms<br>
are equal, and then build new, abstract terms with fresh variables in<br>
the right places. Do you think we should recommend this technique as a<br>
standard best-practice for simproc writers?</p>
<p>The technique used by the simprocs in<br>
HOL/Tools/nat_numeral_simprocs.ML (based on an ML functor from<br>
Provers/Arith/cancel_numerals.ML) is much easier to use: Just do a<br>
Variable.import_terms at the beginning to locally fix the schematics,<br>
and then run Variable.export on the resulting equation.</p>
<p>I think the Variable.import/export technique would make a good<br>
official recommendation for simproc writers (something for the<br>
Cookbook, maybe) if it only worked right! This is why I complained of<br>
a possible bug in Variable.export.</p>
<p>In Dmitriy's original example, the simp trace reveals that the<br>
natless_cancel_numerals simproc (which uses the import/export<br>
technique) returns an unusable rule where some of the locally-fixed<br>
type variables have not been properly generalized again.</p>

<p>Of course, if we completely redesigned all of our simprocs, we could<br>
avoid all these problems.</p>
<p>What we need, though, is a simple, practical technique that any<br>
simproc writer can use. The Variable.import/export technique would be<br>
just the thing, but we need to address the bugs in Variable.export<br>
first.</p>
