Dear all,</p>
<p>I would ask that when you ctrl+hover on a function definition <br>
(such as mysucc in attached hover.thy) then not only the <br>
typing information of mysucc ("nat =&gt; nat") shows up but <br>
also the body of the function ("mysucc n = n + 1"). Or does that <br>
feature already exist?</p>

Hi Holger,</p>
<p>I find that if you ctrl+click on a function name, then the focus jumps to the definition of that function.</p>

Hi John,</p>
<p>Ctrl+Click is certainly useful and well-intentioned. But I feel jumping <br>
with the focus disrupts workflow more than it would just show up as <br>
tool tip (by Ctrl+hover). Also, if I understand correctly (again, maybe I <br>
miss sth) when I use Ctrl+Click on a function name then there is no <br>
single-key way back (like pressing "Esc" or something ...) to where <br>
the focus was before. </p>
<p>Best,</p>

<p>I did not know this one yet -- Fabian is lucky with his US keyboard <br>

<p>Myself I do it in a more basic way: C-W to close the target buffer.  This <br>

<p>I've found it unconvincing when I tried some months ago -- one of the <br>
weaker jEdit plugins.  It looks like really good navigation needs to be <br>
provided as Isabelle/jEdit functionality.  Don't hold your breath for the <br>
coming release, though.  If someone can point to a good specification how <br>
this should work, lets say in Firefox, it can be accelerated.  Or someone <br>
else might sit down himself and improve the jEdit Navigator plugin <br>
upstream.</p>
<p>Another idea in the pipeline is to improve the content and flexibility of <br>
the Isabelle/jEdit popup window: it could show you the part of the <br>
relevant source outright, or some documentation.  The next release will <br>
already have a popup that is recursively again a jEdit text area at a <br>
small scale, but without the extra functionality sketched here.</p>

<p>It's not quite orthogonal.  Having my own window popping up, allows to <br>
define its content.  I started experimenting with that already in 2010, <br>
and then stopped after desparation with different Java look-and-feels, <br>
platforms, window managers.  In the version for the coming release, I <br>
actually did try twm with spontaneous focus change and it worked.  You <br>
surely have your own strange fvwm configuration.  Wasn't that fvwm2 back <br>
then in 1995?  Or do you have fvwm95 with the Windows 95 retro look?</p>

<p>Checked this (should have done so before), it was really just my<br>
configuration, e.g. works fine with fvwm default configuration when<br>
wheezy debian package is just installed without fiddling. Further<br>

the disappearing jEdit subwindow for my configuration (without having to use <br>

the new-window feature because it allows (combined with above request for <br>

be unfolded step-by-step to arbitrary depth by the user.</p>

<p>There is sufficient information to determine the full definition range, <br>
lets say the language element like "fun ..." with all its equations, or <br>
"function ..." with the following proof.  For the latter example there is <br>
a special case, though: there is a second part following somewhere as <br>

<p>I will look at this again myself.  Someone else has reported focus <br>
inversion problems with the latest Unity/Compiz of Ubuntu 12.10, so this <br>

<p>"Sufficient information to determine the full definition range" <br>
sounds promising :-) </p>
<p>Why am I asking whether the end point information is available?<br>
To my post of 17 Dec I attached a file hover.thy:<br>
If we know that the definition of "mysucc" is in file hover.thy,<br>
characters 0x49 to 0x5a, then it could perhaps be easy to implement<br>
to display this information (that is, in this example, "mysucc n = n + 1") <br>
once you ctrl+hover on mysucc (without having to jump through<br>
the theories). From a usage perspective, I think<br>
this could be very convenient, especially if one reads a theory<br>
sb else has written ("what was this abbreviation she is using ...").</p>

<p>I will look at this again myself.  Someone else has reported focus<br>
inversion problems with the latest Unity/Compiz of Ubuntu 12.10, so<br>
this might be more than just an incident of vintage window managers.</p>

<p>Thanks for properly fixing this. That is, fvwm-wise, it now works not <br>
only with fvwm SloppyFocus pointer focus model, but also with the fvwm <br>
FocusFollowsMouse pointer focus model.</p>
<p>Happy 2013,</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The "definition range" is the whole command span, starting with <br>
"definition ..." and ending with "mysucc n = n + 1" in this example. <br>
This is what I meant to show in the popup eventually.</p>
<p>In general, there is not just one equation defining a term, e.g. in "fun" <br>
with several recursive equations, or several functions defined at the same <br>
time.  Showing the whole specification text should give sufficient clues <br>
to the user.  Lets see again how it looks when it is actually there (not <br>
in the coming release.)</p>

Dear Isabelle Users,</p>
<p>I have a simple question (request?) considering this topic of  discussion.<br>
I find this<br>
feature extremely helpful, especially when after Ctrl+Hover+click<br>
 transfers me<br>
a definition/rule/lemma in  any theory which happens to be part of  Main.</p>
<p>For instance, in the last few days I have been a bit engaged in writing<br>
detailed<br>
proofs in Isar which are concerned with the splitting of if´s. So after<br>
jumping<br>
to HOL.thy   and  examining the split_if lemma I  wanted to continue<br>
using this (Ctrl+Hover+Click) feature and jumping to the definition of the<br>
case_split rule, for<br>
example.</p>
<p>But this feature does not seem to available any more in the file HOL.thy or<br>
any other<br>
theory loaded in jedit and which is part of Main. Am I doing<br>
something wrong here [...probably...]?</p>
<p>Best!</p>
