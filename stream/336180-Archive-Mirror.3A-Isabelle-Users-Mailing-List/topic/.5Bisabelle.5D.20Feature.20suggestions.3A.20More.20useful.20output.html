<p>From: Joachim Breitner &lt;<a href="mailto:breitner@kit.edu">breitner@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Dear developers,</p>
<p>I’d like to share some ideas how working with Isabelle could be a bit<br>
more efficient, at least for me and my workflow.</p>
<p>All I am describing is the 2012 release, used via jEdit.</p>
<p>Generally, I could imagine the output window being a bit more<br>
informative, in particular with error messages.</p>
<p>For example, a failed "by method" currently just prints “Failed to<br>
finish proof.” To fix this, I now have to change the "by" to "apply",<br>
look at the result, fix it, and change it back. Could it not print<br>
“Failed to finish proof. Remaining goals: ....”?</p>
<p>A command that does not provide any output at all is “lemma” (and also<br>
“lemmas”). Sometimes, I feel the need to check how Isabelle actually<br>
sees the lemma, e.g. to see what types she has inferred, or to check<br>
whether I am really done or if there is still a [!] behind the lemma¹.<br>
Currently, I have to use “thm name” after the lemma for that (and give<br>
the lemma a name if it does not have one yet). Would it be possible to<br>
have the lemma command already print that information?</p>
<p>Another error that could be make more helpful is “Unknown fact "..."”.<br>
Often I don’t remember the name of a lemma exactly – was it set_finite<br>
or finite_set? I then have to fire up "find_theorems name:..", which is<br>
quite a bit of typing.<br>
GHC recently has started to give spelling corrections (the 10 best fits<br>
based on edit distance, IIRC) for every kind of unknown-something error.<br>
If Isabelle could do the same, this would be great. I’d imagine that in<br>
the context of Isabelle lemmas the edit distance should give special<br>
treatment to reordering the parts of the string that are separated by<br>
‘_’, as it is often the order of the components of the name that I fail<br>
to remember, and count that as one step.<br>
I guess Isabelle usually has many more lemmas in scope than GHC has<br>
functions and this might be a bit slow. But the output does not have to<br>
be generated at once and if the error message is printed before the list<br>
is calculated, this should not harm anyone.²</p>
<p>Last on my list for today is a more interactive variant of print_cases.<br>
When I currently write<br>
        lemma "n + 1 = 1 + (n::nat)"<br>
        proof(induct n)<br>
I have<br>
        proof (state): step 1</p>
<p>goal (2 subgoals):</p>
<p>1. 0 + 1 = 1 + 0<br>
         2. ⋀n. n + 1 = 1 + n ⟹ Suc n + 1 = 1 + Suc n <br>
and with <br>
        print_cases<br>
it prints<br>
        cases:<br>
          0:<br>
            let "?case" = "0 + 1 = 1 + 0"<br>
          Suc:<br>
            fix n_<br>
            let "?case" = "Suc n_ + 1 = 1 + Suc n_"<br>
            assume Suc.hyps: "n_ + 1 = 1 + n_" and Suc.prems: </p>
<p>What I am missing is a combination of both that is ready to be used as<br>
the structure of an Isar proof, e.g. either completely explicit:</p>
<p>show "0 + 1 = 1 + 0"<br>
            sorry<br>
        next<br>
          fix n<br>
          assume "n + 1 = 1 + (n::nat)"<br>
          show "Suc n + 1 = 1 + Suc n"<br>
            sorry<br>
        qed</p>
<p>or, depending on personal preference and number and complexity of the<br>
hypotheses, using the provided case names (and using "case goal1..." if<br>
there are no case names):</p>
<p>case 0<br>
          show ?case<br>
            sorry<br>
        next<br>
          case (Suc n)<br>
          show ?case<br>
            sorry<br>
        qed</p>
<p>From there I guess it would be a small step to allow the user to insert<br>
the output of this command (say print_isar_structure) into the proof<br>
document with one click, similar to how sledgehammer works.</p>
<p>That’s it for today. Thanks for your work,<br>
Joachim</p>
<p>¹ And just to not only list things that I am missing: I find this<br>
marking of lemmas whose prove contains a sorry very useful feedback. It<br>
it were not done, I’d have to ask for it :-)</p>
<p>² Actually, it seems that implementing this feature would be a very<br>
local task that is suitable for first-time Isabelle contributors. If you<br>
say that such a feature would be accepted, I could give it a shot.<br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
That is not a function of the output window, but of the prover to report <br>
things in a certain way.  During this summer, and now in fall moving <br>
towards the coming winter release, I've made many refinements in both <br>
areas, and hopefully manage to add 2-3 more rounds of refinement before <br>
the next release.  The general tendencies are like this:</p>
<p>(1) Output is becoming less and less important (it is an old TTY thing).<br>
     Instead the information is directly attached to the source.  So the<br>
     messages are right there where things happen, while remaining<br>
     accessible in output for nostalgic reasons (for people who want to<br>
     make long moves with the mouse in the old way).</p>
<p>(2) Error feedback of Isar commands involving search/enumertion of<br>
     possibilities: this is an ancient issue from &gt; 10 years ago, which I<br>
     have re-opened some weeks ago.  So in the next release, you will see<br>
     proper errors for "by method", and the need to use 'apply' to imitate<br>
     that will be no longer there.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This is in a transitional state, between old TTY things that no longer <br>
work, and proper global status summaries in the Prover IDE.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the internal derivation object cannot be displayed to the <br>
user while editing and asynchronous/parallel checking continues.  I've no <br>
particular plans for the coming release here -- too many other things need <br>
to be consolidated first.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Sounds like the GHC guys have 10 times more resources to spend.  There are <br>
many ideas about formal entity lookup in the pipeline, including <br>
context-sensitive completion, but nothing like the above so far.</p>
<p>Ask again after some more years of Isabelle/jEdit Prover IDE development.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
'print_cases' is indeed a dinosaur from the TTY age.  Producing proof <br>
outlines for induction proofs is the standard application for smart <br>
templating, I have it on my list for a long time already.  This summer I <br>
got quite close to see how it can be implemented relatively easily, at <br>
least the abstract case / show ?case form, because printing of terms in a <br>
parsable way is still needs further investigation.  It is unlikely to <br>
happen for the coming release, though.</p>
<p>Also note that goal1, ..., goal42 are not Isar-conformant at all: they <br>
produce fragile proofs with lots of funny indices.  It is often better <br>
make an unstructured script in the traditional manner here.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The implementation work for anything is usually an order of magnitude more <br>
than first anticipated, and an order of magitude less than the cumulative <br>
efforts for maintaining the result in the long run.</p>
