user: If he sees lots of lemmas he did not write himself or does not<br>
know, he can leave the simp call as it is. But if the lemmas are roughly<br>
what he expected, why not allow him to make that explicit?</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
What i would find more useful would be output in the form of 'Use "apply<br>
(simp add: foo bar baz bam bang)"', i. e. if it showed a list of the<br>
rewrite rules that it used and that are not in the simp set anyway.<br>
This, if I am not mistaken, would not lead to the problem of exposing<br>
any of these these internal details but still provide a similar<br>
functionality. I for one use "simp add:" much more often than "simp<br>
only:" and have often found myself removing rules from the "add" clause<br>
by trial and error to find out which of them are actually necessary.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Manuel</p>

<p>From: Timothy Bourke &lt;<a href="mailto:tim@tbrk.org">tim@tbrk.org</a>&gt;<br>
I wonder if such a feature would be more practical and useful if<br>
restricted to a particular theory (or set of theories):</p>
<p>apply (simp minimize: Invariants add: foo)</p>
<p>where rules from a theory called "Invariants" would be listed for<br>
possible one-click substitution.</p>
<p>During the verification of a model, for instance, it's certainly more<br>
efficient (for the user) to have most lemmas applied automatically,<br>
but afterward it would sometimes be nice to know exactly which lemmas<br>
(from a subset of interesting ones) were actually used. Both for<br>
refactoring, as already mentioned, and for better understanding the<br>
result.</p>
<p>But, perhaps this would be better in a separate "reporting tool"?</p>

imagine (too) many variations on this idea.</p>

Dear Isabelle users (and devs, I guess),</p>
<p>I am using sledgehammer/metis more and more even for very simple and<br>
obvious lemmas that I could mostly also solve with simp or auto. The<br>
great thing about sledgehammer is that it searched a proof taking many<br>
lemmas into account, but then produces a command that explicitly<br>
mentions the lemmas that are required, which is very useful feedback to<br>
me, and helps, for example, in refactoring.</p>
<p>Is there a chance to get a similar feature for the simplifier? I could<br>
imagine that when I write<br>
        apply (simp minimize add: foo)<br>
the simplifier would run as usual, but it would also keep track of which<br>
simplification rules were actually used. The output window would then<br>
say something along the lines<br>
        simplification used 5 lemmas.<br>
        Use "apply (simp only: foo bar baz bam bang)" (12ms) to<br>
        reproduce.<br>
and in the IDE I could click on that to replace the original invocation<br>
with this more explicit command.</p>
<p>It could work similarly (but maybe harder to implement, I presume) for<br>
auto.</p>
<p>More generally, as I’m basically working with Isabelle fulltime these<br>
days, there are more usability improvement ideas cropping up. Is this<br>
the right forum and form to suggest them?</p>
