<p>FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS -- SETS 2018</p>
<hr>
<p>3rd International Workshop about Sets and Tools (SETS 2018)<br>
                      June 5, 2018, Southampton, UK<br>
                          Affiliated to ABZ 2018<br>

<p>AIM</p>
<p>Sets and constructs built upon them like relations, functions and<br>
sequences are the main modeling ingredients of formalisms such as VDM,<br>
Z, B, or Event-B. Sets also occur in the formalization of mathematics,<br>
as evidenced by the large library of the Mizar proof system, for<br>
example. In addition, still in the domain of verification, there is an<br>
increasing interest to automate set theory (which is known to be a<br>
difficult problem), with some concrete realizations, such as mp (the<br>
"main prover" of Atelier B) or Muscadet (an automated theorem prover<br>
for natural deduction, which gives some good performances in set<br>
theory). Sets are also the main features of some programming languages<br>
like the former SetL language or the more recent {log} language<br>
(pronounced as setlog).</p>
<p>The workshop aims at bringing together researchers interested in set<br>
theory, especially to design tools for dealing with set theory, such as<br>
interactive or automated theorem provers, proof checkers, theories for<br>
general purpose proof tools, constraint solvers, programming languages<br>
etc. We are interested in specialized tools for set theory as well as<br>
general-purpose tools where sets coexist with other theories.<br>
Contributions by theoreticians working on the mechanical processing of<br>
(fragment of) set theory, and by practitioners using set-based tools<br>
are both welcome. We are also interested in contributions providing<br>
some comparisons between set modeling techniques and other formalisms,<br>
such as type theory (and its variants) for instance. Finally, regarding<br>
the domains of application, we mainly expect contributions in the<br>
framework of formal methods, but we are open to, for instance,<br>
contributions reporting formalizations of mathematics using set theory.</p>
<p>TOPICS</p>
<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of set theory<br>
and corresponding tools. More specifically, some suggested topics are:</p>
<p>* Proof tools for sets<br>
   * Constraint solvers for sets<br>
   * Set-based programming languages<br>
   * Automated verification in set theory<br>
   * Encoding of sets in provers<br>
   * Set theories for SMT solvers<br>
   * Use of set-based tools in formal methods<br>
   * Use of set-based tools in mathematics<br>
   * Using any of the above tools to teach set theory<br>
   * Comparison of set-based tools<br>
   * Comparison between set and type theories<br>
   * Experience reports</p>
<p>CONTRIBUTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>Submitted papers must be 6-15 pages long, following the Springer LNCS<br>
format. These submissions may be:</p>
<p>* Research papers providing new concepts and results<br>
   * Position papers and research perspectives<br>
   * Experience reports<br>
   * Tool presentations</p>
<p>Proceedings, including all the papers selected for the workshop, will<br>
be published as online proceedings in the CEUR workshop proceedings<br>
series (<a href="http://CEUR-WS.org">CEUR-WS.org</a>).</p>
