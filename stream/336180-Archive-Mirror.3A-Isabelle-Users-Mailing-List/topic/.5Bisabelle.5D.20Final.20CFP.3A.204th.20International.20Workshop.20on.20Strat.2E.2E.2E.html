4th International Workshop on Strategic Reasoning (SR2016)<br>
To be held as Satellite Workshop of LICS 2016<br>
9-10 July 2016, New York City, USA.<br>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Strategic reasoning is a key topic in the multi-agent systems research<br>
area. The literature in this field is extensive and includes a variety<br>
of logics used for reasoning about the strategic abilities of the agents<br>
in the system. Results stemming from this research have been used in a<br>
wide range of applications, including robotic teams endowed with<br>
adaptive strategies, and automatic players capable of beating expert<br>
human adversaries. A common feature in all these domains is the<br>
requirement for sound theoretical foundations and tools accounting for<br>
the strategies that agents may adopt in the presence of adversaries.</p>
<p>The SR international workshop series aims to bring together researchers<br>
working on different aspects of strategic reasoning in computer science,<br>
both from a theoretical and a practical point of view.</p>
<p>Topics of interest</p>
<p>The topics covered by the workshop include, but are not limited to, the<br>
following:</p>
<p>Logics for reasoning about strategic abilities;<br>
Logics for multi-agent mechanism design, verification, and synthesis;<br>
Logical foundations of decision theory for multi-agent systems;<br>
Strategic reasoning in formal verification;<br>
Automata theory for strategy synthesis;<br>
Applications and tools for cooperative and adversarial reasoning;<br>
Robust planning and optimization in multi-agent systems;<br>
Risk and uncertainty in multi-agent systems;<br>
Quantitative aspects in strategic reasoning.</p>

<p>Submissions</p>
<p>Submitted contributions should not exceed 10 pages using the EPTCS<br>
format. If necessary, submitted papers can be supplemented with a<br>
clearly marked appendix, which will be consulted at the discretion of<br>
the program committee. Submitted papers should be formatted in PDF and<br>
uploaded to</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sr2016">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sr2016</a></p>
<p>Two types of submission will be considered:<br>
articles reporting on novel research;<br>
expository papers reporting on published work.<br>
Each submission should be clearly identified as belonging to one<br>
category or the other.</p>
<p>Novel research abstracts will be held to the usual high standards of<br>
novel research publications. In particular, they will be expected to<br>
contain enough information to enable the program committee to identify<br>
the main contribution of the work, explain the significance of the work,<br>
its novelty, and its practical or theoretical implications, and include<br>
comparisons with and references to relevant literature.</p>
<p>Expository abstracts, which will be held to similarly high standards,<br>
may survey an area or report on a more specific previously published<br>
work. Submissions should make clear the relevance to the strategic<br>
reasoning audience.</p>
<p>Authors of the contributions accepted for presentation (in both<br>
categories) will be invited to publish their work as part of an EPTCS<br>
volume to be published around the time of the workshop.</p>
<p>Submissions from PC members is allowed.</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
<p>6 April 2016: Abstract submission deadline.<br>
8 April 2016: Submission deadline.<br>
29 April 2016: Acceptance notification.<br>
15 May 2016: Camera-ready version deadline.<br>
9-10 July 2016: SR 2016.</p>
<p>Proceedings</p>
<p>A volume in the EPTCS will be published as in previous years. Authors of<br>
contributions presented at the workshop and previously unpublished will<br>
be given an opportunity for the paper to be included. Inclusion in EPTCS<br>
volume is not mandatory.</p>
<p>As in the past, extended and revised versions of the contributions<br>
judged to be particularly significant will be published in a special<br>
issue of the International Journal of Information and Computation.</p>
