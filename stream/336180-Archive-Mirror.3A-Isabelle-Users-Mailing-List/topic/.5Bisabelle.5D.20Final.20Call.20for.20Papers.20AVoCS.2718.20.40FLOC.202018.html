<p>AVoCS 2018 Call for Papers<br>
   18th International Workshop on Automated Verification of Critical Systems<br>
              Oxford University, UK, July 18-19, 2018<br>
                 Website: <a href="http://avocs18.irisa.fr">http://avocs18.irisa.fr</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Deadline extended to April 20th, 2018</p>
<hr>
<p>OVERVIEW<br>
The aim of the AVoCS workshop series is to contribute to the<br>
interaction and exchange of ideas among members of the international<br>
research community on tools and techniques for the verification of<br>
critical systems. In particular, AVoCS 2018 aims to bring together<br>
scientists and engineers that are active in the area of formal<br>
methods, develop tools and techniques for the automated verification<br>
of critical systems, and are interested in exchanging their<br>
experiences in the industrial usage of these methods and tools.</p>
<p>SCOPE<br>
The subject is to be interpreted broadly and inclusively. It covers<br>
all aspects of automated verification, including model checking,<br>
theorem proving, SAT/SMT constraint solving, abstract interpretation,<br>
and refinement pertaining to various types of critical systems which<br>
need to meet stringent dependability requirements (safety-critical,<br>
business-critical, performance-critical, etc.). Contributions that<br>
describe different techniques or industrial case studies are<br>
encouraged.</p>
<p>The technical programme will consist of invited and contributed talks<br>
and also allow for short presentations of research ideas. The workshop<br>
will be relatively informal, with an emphasis on discussion where<br>
special discussion sessions will be organised around the research<br>
ideas presentations. Topics include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>- Model Checking<br>
    - Automatic and Interactive Theorem Proving<br>
    - SAT, SMT or Constraint Solving for Verification<br>
    - Abstract Interpretation<br>
    - Specification and Refinement<br>
    - Requirements Capture and Analysis<br>
    - Verification of Software and Hardware<br>
    - Specification and Verification of Fault Tolerance and Resilience<br>
    - Probabilistic and Real-Time Systems<br>
    - Dependable Systems<br>
    - Verified System Development<br>
    - Industrial Applications</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>
We are please to announce the following invited talks:</p>
<p>- Michael Emmi, SRI International, USA<br>
   - Antoine Miné, Sorbonne Université, LIP6, France</p>
<p>VENUE<br>
The event will at the Department of Computer Science, University of<br>
Oxford. AVoCS is an affiliated event of FM 2018 and it will be hosted <br>
within FLoC 2018 (<a href="http://www.floc2018.org">http://www.floc2018.org</a>). FLoC is a federated <br>
conference of several international conferences related with<br>
mathematical logics and computer science, for example CAV, FSCD,<br>
ICLP, IJCAR, ITP and SAT.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION DETAILS<br>
Submissions of full papers to the workshop must not have been<br>
published or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All<br>
submissions will be peer-reviewed and judged on the basis of<br>
originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation<br>
quality, and relevance to the workshop. Submissions are handled via<br>
Easychair:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=avocs2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=avocs2018</a></p>
<p>The papers must be written in English and should not exceed 15 pages, <br>
not counting references and appendices, in Springer LNCS format.</p>
<p>AVoCS also encourages the submissions of research ideas in order to<br>
stimulate discussions at the workshop. Reports on ongoing work or<br>
surveys on work published elsewhere are welcome. The Programme<br>
Committee will select research ideas on the basis of submitted<br>
abstracts according to significance and general interest. Research<br>
ideas must be written in English and not exceed 2 pages using the<br>
Springer LNCS format. The presentation of these ideas will be organised<br>
around discussions, where the presenter should also prepare a set of<br>
questions in which the audience will discuss.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>
Paper submission: April 20th, 2018 <br>
Notification: May 15th, 2018 <br>
Final version of papers due: May 31st, 2018 <br>
AVoCS Conference: July 18-19th, 2018 <br>
FLoC Conference: July 6-19th, 2018 </p>
<p>PROCEEDINGS<br>
At the workshop, pre-proceedings will be available in the form of a<br>
FLoC 2018 pre-proceedings; this report will also<br>
include the research ideas.  After the workshop, the authors of<br>
accepted full papers will have about one month in order to revise<br>
their papers for publication in the workshop post-proceedings<br>
which will appear in the Electronic Communications of the EASST<br>
Open Access Journal. Research ideas will not be part of the<br>
proceedings in the Open Access Journal.</p>
<p>SPECIAL SCP JOURNAL ISSUE<br>
Authors of a selection of the best papers presented at the workshop<br>
will be invited to submit extended versions of their work for<br>
publication in a special issue of Elsevier's journal Science of<br>
Computer Programming.</p>
