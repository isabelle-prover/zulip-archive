<p>Call for Contributions</p>
<p>WiL 2020: 4th Women in Logic Workshop<br>
                                     virtual<br>
                              30 June 2020</p>

<p>Women in Logic 2020 is part of "Paris Nord Summer of LoVe 2020"<br>
(<a href="https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/summer-of-love-2020/">https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/summer-of-love-2020/</a>), a joint event on<br>
LOgic and VErification, made of Petri Nets 2020, IJCAR 2020, FSCD 2020,<br>
and over 20 satellite events.</p>
<p>The Women in Logic workshop (WiL) provides an opportunity to increase<br>
awareness of the valuable contributions made by women in the area of<br>
logic in computer science. Its main purpose is to promote the excellent<br>
research done by women, with the ultimate goal of increasing their<br>
visibility and representation in the community. Our aim is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>provide a platform for female researchers to share their work and<br>
achievements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the feelings of community and belonging, especially among<br>
junior faculty, post-docs and students through positive interactions<br>
with peers and more established faculty;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish new connections and collaborations;</p>
</li>
<li>foster a welcoming culture of mutual support and growth within the<br>
logic research community.<br>
We believe these aspects will benefit women working in logic and computer<br>
science, particularly early-career researchers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Previous versions of Women in Logic (Reykjavik, Iceland 2017,<br>
Oxford, UK 2018 and Vancouver, Canada 2019) were very successful<br>
in showcasing women's work and as catalysts for recognition of the<br>
need for change in the community.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to: automata<br>
theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,<br>
concurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,<br>
constructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,<br>
description logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects<br>
of program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,<br>
games and logic, higher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi,<br>
linear logic, logic in artificial intelligence, logic programming,<br>
logical aspects of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational<br>
complexity, logical aspects of quantum computation, logical<br>
