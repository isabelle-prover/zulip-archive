<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>I have the following setting:</p>
<p>- In an external program I load an Isabelle theory Test (via<br>
   libisabelle). From the Isabelle point of view, this is a call to<br>
   Thy_Info.use_thy.</p>
<p>- If Test.thy contains errors, Thy_Info.use_thy will usually fail. This<br>
   is desired from my side.</p>
<p>- However, in some cases (e.g., a "by" that fails, or a use of "sorry"<br>
   without quick_and_dirty mode), errors occur inside futures (I think). Then<br>
   Thy_Info.use_thy will succeed. This is not desired because I want to give<br>
   an error message when loading fails.</p>
<p>How can I, on the Isabelle/ML level, force all futures involved in a theory<br>
to finish in order to throw any potential exceptions? (Something like "val
_ = Thy_Info.use_thy "Draft.Test"; val thy = Thy_Info.get_theory<br>
"Draft.Test"; val _ = join_theory thy (* This one does not exist *)")</p>
<p>I believe this should be possible because the build process does give<br>
errors when a proof fails, after all, instead of simply storing a failing<br>
future in the heap image.</p>
<p>To avoid misunderstandings: I am not working in the bootstrap<br>
ML-environment, but the proper Isabelle/ML environment.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

<p>Thy_Info.use_thy should to the full join_theory for you. If it does not,<br>
there is something wrong somewhere.</p>
<p>Note that "ML level" is outdated terminology from 20 years ago. Today we<br>
have two main ML environments:</p>
<p>(1) Isabelle/ML: this is regular user-space Isabelle/ML (inside a<br>
theory context).</p>
<p>(2) The ML bootstrap environment (Poly/ML with some add-ons). Normally<br>
only Isabelle system tools use that, but it is also possible do<br>
"isabelle process" invocations, analogously to how "isabelle build".</p>

<p>If you are actually using Thy_Info.use_thy inside regular user-space<br>
Isabelle/ML, this is not going to work. Maybe that is the actual problem<br>
here.</p>
<p>Again the usual questions: What is your greater application context?<br>
What are you trying to do?</p>
<p>The new Isabelle PIDE server might be better for it, but it is still<br>
unused / untested in Isabelle2018. After the release, I have made my own<br>
applications on top of it: to process all of Isabelle + AFP and<br>
overserve resulting theory status and markup. This required some<br>
reworking on the server, and it probably needs more reworking to make it<br>
applicable in even more applications.</p>

<p>I am using libisabelle. So <em>essentially</em> I do is: I instantiate Isabelle<br>
with libisabelle. I issue a command from libisabelle to Isabelle to load a<br>
theory which uses Thy_Info.use_thy. This operation completes (that is, I<br>
know that I get a theory and not a "theory future" back because I do<br>
successfully, e.g., print theorems from it). At some point I am asking for<br>
a proof term, and this leads to a delayed exception. On the level of the<br>
theory that is loaded, however, I don't do weird ML. I can get the error<br>
with something as simple as a "sorry" in quick_and_dirty=false mode.</p>
<p>Thy_Info.use_thy should be strict under normal circumstances. Can you</p>
<blockquote>
<p>show an example where it succeeds?<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could, I think, but it would be quite some work. (Since I would have to<br>
rewrite the whole setting involving libisabelle described above from<br>
scratch since the problem is too deeply buried in my application. Including<br>
setting up all the build environment etc. I don't see a way to make it<br>
happen without libisabelle because, as you pointed out, using use_thy<br>
inside a normal Isabelle session does not work.)</p>
<p>Interestingly, when trying to get the same to happen using<br>
"Isabelle2018/bin/isabelle console -l HOL -s" and then entering<br>
Thy_Info.use_thy, the problem does not occur (the theory fails right away).<br>
So it might actually be a problem with libisabelle.</p>
<p>I will ask Lars Hupel, perhaps he knows something about this.</p>
<p>But if you know some hotfix (i.e., some way to force the theory to join<br>
after it has loaded even if we don't understand why it hasn't been fully<br>
joined in the first place) I would be happy. Because this problem looks<br>
like it's going to be confusing to track down.</p>
<p>Again the usual questions: What is your greater application context?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you trying to do?<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a scala application (<a href="https://github.com/dominique-unruh/qrhl-tool">https://github.com/dominique-unruh/qrhl-tool</a>)<br>
that uses Isabelle as a backend for reasoning about terms. For this,<br>
Isabelle gets loaded via libisabelle, the Isabelle session containing my<br>
theories gets loaded via libisabelle, and then various ML-snippets (e.g.,<br>
for calling the simplifier on a term) are invoked via libisabelle.</p>
<p>The new Isabelle PIDE server might be better for it, but it is still</p>
<blockquote>
<p>unused / untested in Isabelle2018. After the release, I have made my own<br>

applicable in even more applications.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had a look at the PIDE server. While I didn't fully understand the scope<br>
of it, I had the feeling that it was more for "highlevel" operations (like<br>
"build a theory"), and not for things like "simplify this particular term".</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

<p>I can corroborate this (mostly). When developing the Isabelle<br>
integration with Leon, I used "Goal.parallel_proofs := 0" quite<br>
liberally. In my case the problem was less with loading theories;<br>
rather, running arbitrary ML code that may or may not throw asynchronous<br>
exceptions.</p>

<p>If you can send me a minimal example how I can reproduce the problem, I<br>
could take a look.</p>

Hi Lars,</p>
<p>I managed to make a minimal example (attached).</p>
<p>The actual code is in src/main/scala/test/Test.thy, and the bad theory is<br>
TestEx.thy.<br>
The line "val response = ..." is the offending code which fails to give an<br>
error.<br>
Interestingly, a variation of this line (included and commented out) does<br>
raise an error!</p>
<p>You can test the code simply using "sbt run".</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.<br>
