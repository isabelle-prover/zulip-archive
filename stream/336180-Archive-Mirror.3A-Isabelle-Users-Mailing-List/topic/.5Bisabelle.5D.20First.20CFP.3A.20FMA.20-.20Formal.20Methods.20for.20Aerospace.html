<p>BACKGROUND:<br>
Aerospace systems are not only safety critical, but also mission  <br>
critical, and often have very high performance requirements. For  <br>
example, while there is no safety issue regarding a planetary rover,  <br>
the system performance must justify the great cost of deploying it.  <br>
Consequently, if we are to tackle to development and analysis of  <br>
aeronautical systems is a formal way, we must enrich traditional  <br>
formal methods with new (or, at least, rarely investigated) research  <br>
issues. This naturally leads to a interdisciplinary approach, which  <br>
might: underline the importance of some research problems from  <br>
aeronautics to the formal method community; and promote new formal  <br>
techniques combining principles from artificial intelligence and  <br>
control engineering.<br>
The source of new problems comes from the great diversity of  <br>
aeronautical systems, including satellites, UAVs, terrestrial or other  <br>
kinds of flying robots. These systems can be involved in complex  <br>
activities such as space exploration, telecommunications support, fire  <br>
detection, geo-mapping, weather prognoses, geo-rectification, search &amp;  <br>
rescue, traffic surveillance, target tracking, etc. From these  <br>
applications, concepts such as autonomy, collective behaviour,  <br>
information fusion, cognitive skills, coordination, flocking, are  <br>
required and new solutions, such as digital pheromones, swarms, system  <br>
of systems of robots, sensing, physical actuation, are developed.  <br>
Considering this rich landscape of research problems and potential  <br>
solutions, interdisciplinarity seems to be the most natural route.  <br>
Formal methods could benefit from integration with well-developed  <br>
methods from other disciplines. Many such opportunities are easily at  <br>
hand, for example the coordination of UAVs or satellites, which have  <br>
been successfully tackled using various techniques from control  <br>
engineering and numerical tools from dynamic programming. In addition,  <br>
there exist an abundance of examples of the use of artificial  <br>
intelligence techniques in aeronautics (target tracking, rover  <br>
planning, multi-agent technologies and so on). The implementation of  <br>
these methods could benefit from formal development. Conversely, from  <br>
the cross-fertilization of multidisciplinary approaches we can expect  <br>
more robust, safe and mechanizable development and verification  <br>
methods for aerospace systems.</p>
<p>AIM AND SCOPE:<br>
The main workshop objective is to promote a holistic view and  <br>
interdisciplinary methods for design, verification and co-ordination  <br>
of aeronautical systems, by combining formal methods with techniques  <br>
from control engineering and artificial intelligence. The very  <br>
demanding safety, robustness and performance requirements of these  <br>
systems require unprecedented integration of heterogeneous techniques  <br>
and models. The aim of FMA is to bring together active researchers  <br>
from all the above areas to discuss and present their work. Relevant  <br>
topics include, but are not limited to (all with a focus on potential  <br>
application in aerospace design or engineering):<br>
  new modeling paradigms<br>
  formal verification of safety and performance properties<br>
  combining formal and analytical techniques in modeling and verification<br>
  heterogeneous and hybrid system models<br>
  probabilistic and stochastic modeling and verification methods<br>
  agent technologies<br>
  multi-agent coordination<br>
  runtime monitoring<br>
  trajectory specification languages<br>
  runtime monitoring</p>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSION:<br>
We invite submissions of high quality, original papers in the above  <br>
areas. Papers should be written in English, formatted according to the  <br>
Springer LNCS style, and not exceed 16 pages including figures,  <br>
references, etc. At least one author of the accepted papers should  <br>
register at the workshop. Submissions must be made via  <br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fma09">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fma09</a>.</p>
<p>The pre-proceedings will be available as an online technical report  <br>
and disseminated at the workshop. We are in negotiation for a journal  <br>
special issue for selected (extended and revised) papers.</p>
