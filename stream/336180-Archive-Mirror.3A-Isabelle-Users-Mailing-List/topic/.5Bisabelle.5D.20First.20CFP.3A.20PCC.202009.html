<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<hr>
<p>Papers due:   May 29, 2009<br>
Notification of acceptance:     June 22, 2009<br>
Final version due:  July 10, 2009</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<hr>
<p>Software certification demonstrates the reliability, safety, or<br>
security of software systems in such a way that it can be checked by<br>
an independent authority with minimal trust in the techniques and<br>
tools used in the certification process itself. It can build on<br>
existing validation and verification (V&amp;V) techniques but introduces<br>
the notion of explicit software certificates, which contain all the<br>
information necessary for an independent assessment of the<br>
demonstrated properties. One such example is proof-carrying code (PCC)<br>
which is an important and distinctive approach to enhancing trust in<br>
programs. It provides a practical framework for independent assurance<br>
of program behaviour; especially where source code is not available,<br>
or the code author and user are unknown to each other.</p>
<p>The workshop will address theoretical foundations of logic-based<br>
software certification as well as practical examples and work on<br>
alternative application domains. Here "certificate" is construed<br>
broadly, to include not just mathematical derivations and proofs but<br>
also safety and assurance cases, or any formal evidence that supports<br>
the semantic analysis of programs: that is, evidence about an<br>
intrinsic property of code and its behaviour that can be independently<br>
checked by any user, intermediary, or third party. These guarantees<br>
mean that software certificates raise trust in the code itself,<br>
distinct from and complementary to any existing trust in the creator<br>
of the code, the process used to produce it, or its distributor.</p>
<p>In addition to the contributed talks, the workshop will feature two<br>
invited talks.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION</p>
<hr>
<p>Two types of submissions are solicited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard papers (at most 10 pages) describing novel research results.</li>
<li>Short papers (at most 5 pages) describing a novel idea that is<br>
work-in-progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication<br>
in the final version may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that<br>
is not included in the page limit.</p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit their papers electronically, in PDF<br>
format via the EasyChair submission web page:<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pcc09">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pcc09</a></p>
<p>All submissions will be fully reviewed.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION</p>
<hr>
<p>Proceedings will be made available in electronic format as a technical<br>
report. A follow-up special issue of a journal on the topics of<br>
proof-carrying code and software certification is under consideration.</p>
