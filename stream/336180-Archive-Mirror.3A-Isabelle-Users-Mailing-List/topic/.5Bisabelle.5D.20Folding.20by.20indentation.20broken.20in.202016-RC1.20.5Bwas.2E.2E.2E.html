Dear Isabelle developers,</p>
<p>as the Isabelle/jEdit folding feature has no support for folding proofs <br>
based on proof structure I used to use indentation based folding in <br>
jEdit. In 2016-RC1 this seems to be broken and I get very wired folding <br>
that doesn't correspond to my indentation. I enabled "fold mode: indent" <br>
in the global editing options.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>lemma x<br>
proof<br>
   have y proof<br>
     (<em>stuff</em>)<br>
   qed<br>
   have z sorry proof<br>
     (<em>stuff</em>)<br>
   qed<br>
qed</p>
<p>folding at the first proof in line 2 used to yield</p>
<p>lemma x<br>
proof [6 lines]<br>
qed</p>
<p>with 2016-RC1 it yields</p>
<p>lemma x<br>
proof [3 lines]<br>
   have z sorry proof<br>
     (<em>stuff</em>)<br>
   qed<br>
qed</p>
<p>and awkwardly moving the proof from line 2 to line 1 and folding there <br>
folds the hole proof as expected.</p>
<p>Best<br>
    Benedikt</p>

<p>I think there are 3 mistakes here:</p>
<p>1) Isabelle2016-RC1 has indeed a problem with the fold depth for<br>
      proof-qed parentheses, which were not counted as blocks in<br>
      Isabelle2015 at all.  This should work better with the next release<br>
      candidate.</p>

<p>3) I guess that in the experiment, the fold mode was actually "isabelle"<br>
      and not "indent".</p>
<p>I don't really know how "indent" fold mode works: if there is a change in <br>
that respect from Isabelle2015 to Isabelle2016-RC1 it might be an issue of <br>
jedit-5.2.0 vs. jedit-5.3.0.</p>
<p>Or there might be a problem of jEdit selecting the fold mode that you've <br>
had in mind.</p>

It worked by folding up to the next line with same or less indentation, <br>
thereby giving the user full control over what needs to be folded away. <br>
In particular it allowed one to fold away cases such that even in a <br>
deeply nested proof with many cases one could have all assumptions made <br>
before on screen at the same time. I.e. folding from a proof to the <br>
"next" statement.<br>
That approach was already obsolete in Isabelle2015, see this old NEWS <br>
entry:<br>
I wouldn't call it obsolete if it had useful features that the new <br>
method didn't have.<br>

Yes I just tried out the RC2 version, folding from proof to qed works <br>
now fine, which is very nice, but  I still can't fold away a case i.e. <br>
to the "next" statement. I could start making case distinctions like <br>
"proof cases assume a show ?case proof - ... qed" but its additional <br>
boilerplate code.<br>
  2) Your example has one 'sorry' too much for proper nesting of proof<br>
     structure.  Or is this part of the bad situation?<br>
Yes sorry, messed that up but it wouldn't have made a difference for <br>
folding by indentation.<br>
  3) I guess that in the experiment, the fold mode was actually <br>
"isabelle"<br>
     and not "indent".<br>
I double checked the fold mode was set to indent, I also switched it <br>
back and forth.<br>
Or there might be a problem of jEdit selecting the fold mode that <br>
you've had in mind.<br>
Yes, it seems like the setting is ignored or somehow overwritten to <br>
isabelle folding. Even if I select "none" I still get Isabelle folding.</p>

<p>By the way, after updating to RC2 (I need do mention that I'm working of <br>
the isabelle-release repository because I have my bsup/esub display <br>
patch running on top) the jEdit window wouldn't start up after building <br>
HOL and I had to kill and restart the process. Afterwards it started <br>
fine but there was no output panel anywhere, but this might be a side <br>
effect of my old configuration where it was a floating instance. <br>
(Running on OS X by the way)</p>

Ignore this, just downloaded the genuine RC2 from the website, works <br>
fine there.</p>
