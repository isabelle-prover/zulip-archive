<p>From: Rafal Kolanski &lt;<a href="mailto:xs@xaph.net">xs@xaph.net</a>&gt;<br>
As you may know, the current font handling system in the Isabelle plugin<br>
completely bypasses the one used in jEdit.<br>
The symptoms of this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Global Options -&gt; Text Area -&gt; "Additional fonts with font<br>
   substitution" has no effect, confusing new users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can't use Your Favorite Font™ and have missing glyphs fall<br>
   back to the fonts you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isabelle symbols can configure the font used, but there's a global<br>
   maximum of two user fonts (see user_font in token_markup.scala).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>jEdit splits chunks at <em>all</em> Isabelle symbols</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>jEdit's font substitution system works really well. I wanted<br>
Isabelle users to be able to benefit from it and enjoy tweaking fonts to<br>
their heart's content, so I performed the necessary modifications to<br>
make it work. The resulting code is simpler (though obviously Makarius<br>
will tune naming to be more canonical) and I believe more<br>
understandable.</p>
<p>I promised last week I'd deliver the change this week, and here it is.<br>
I've also included some ad-hoc documentation on the situation and design<br>
in the latter part of this email, hence its length. If you ever want to<br>
tune the symbol/token/chunk system, this might be useful.</p>
<p>If you want to try it out, two patches are attached (use git apply):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>jEdit: 0003-Allow-specification-of-sizes-for-fallback-fonts.patch<br>
   (see discussion at: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jedit/patches/569/">https://sourceforge.net/p/jedit/patches/569/</a> )</p>
<p>This allows one to specify desired sizes for fallback fonts. The<br>
 reality is that font metrics between fonts don't agree. One font at<br>
 12 pt is the same size as another at 16 pt.</p>
<p>It also exposes queries on the font substitution system in Chunk.java<br>
 so that the plugin authors can use the information for their own<br>
 rendering.</p>
<p>This patch on its own does <em>not</em> affect existing jEdit/Isabelle users<br>
 and is safe to apply.</p>
<p>If you just want my version of jedit.jar, let me know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isabelle plugin: 0001-Redo-Isabelle-plugin-chunk-rendering.patch<br>
   (Isabelle 2015 version, but I can easily produce one that applies to<br>
   current development branch)</p>
<p>This removes the user_font setup in token_markup.scala and<br>
 modifies the paint_chunk_list code in rich_text_area.scala to match<br>
 the underlying chunk layout provided by jEdit even when font<br>
 substitution is enabled.</p>
<p>This depends on the jEdit patch (1).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Outcome</p>
<p>You can now set up whatever font chain you want. For example mine is:<br>
Lucida Console 16 -&gt; Cambria Math 18 -&gt; DejaVu Sans 16 -&gt; IsabelleText<br>
16 -&gt; search all system fonts.</p>
<p>The setup is flexible enough that you can now use bizarre Unicode code<br>
points (yes, even those above 0xFFFF) in your notation (output) if you<br>
have the fonts to display it, e.g. I tested with:<br>
    U+1F0A4 PLAYING CARD FOUR OF SPADES<br>
    U+10147 GREEK ACROPHONIC ATTIC FIFTY THOUSAND</p>
<p>The chunk rendering code in rich_text_area.scala is simpler and should<br>
be easier to understand.</p>
<p>By not using the user_font workaround, we free up 19*2 extended style<br>
IDs that we can use for whatever we like. My suggestion: we can now do<br>
<em>two</em> levels of super/subscript.</p>
<p>The "font" specification in etc/symbols now does nothing. Pick the<br>
Unicode code point you want the symbol to display as and you're done.</p>
<p>The Details (only read if you are interested or Makarius)</p>
<p>jEdit's TextArea lays out chunks based on tokens it receives from the<br>
relevant parser. Consecutive tokens with the same ID are grouped into<br>
one chunk.  One chunk has a single style (font, text color, background<br>
color) plus a layout of GlyphVectors. If no font substitution was done,<br>
the entire chunk is laid out as a single vector. Font substitution<br>
splits vectors when the chunk is laid out, but the chunk is not split.</p>
<p>The Isabelle plugin provides a parser which lets jEdit parse and lay out<br>
chunks. This results in inner syntax appearing as LITERAL1 (i.e. a<br>
string). Once this process is done, all chunks are laid out, have<br>
specified sizes and all font substitutions are done.</p>
<p>That's not the end of the story though. Once processed by Isabelle, we<br>
acquire extra information. For example a part of that LITERAL1 is<br>
actually a free variable, so should get a different text color! This<br>
needs to be overlaid on the existing chunk somehow.</p>
<p>The way the Isabelle plugin performs the overlay of text colors is by<br>
turning off the existing TextArea chunk renderer and doing the rendering<br>
itself (see rich_text_area.scala). However, it isn't dumb and does not<br>
lay out the underlying chunks again. This means that the rendering must<br>
match up with the underlying chunk layout <em>exactly</em> in order to have the<br>
glyphs and cursor appear in the right place within the chunk.</p>
<p>So if we want sub/superscript, we need to get jEdit to lay it out as<br>
sub/superscript for us, or rendering our own ideas over it won't match<br>
up!</p>
<p>There is a patch to jEdit (src/Tools/jEdit/patches/extended_styles)<br>
which extends the n jEdit styles available (about 19) to 127 (max in<br>
Java byte). That way we can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>0..n-1     : jEdit</li>
<li>n..2*n-1   : superscript</li>
<li>2<em>n..3</em>n-1 : subscript</li>
<li>3<em>n..4</em>n-1 : bold</li>
<li>4<em>n..6</em>n-1 : user_font</li>
<li>6*n        : invisible (e.g. \&lt;^sub&gt; token itself)<br>
When jEdit sees these, it lays them out according to the extended style<br>
specified. We set these up to match the n jEdit styles, but tweaked in<br>
the desired way (size, font, style, elevation, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>The user_font setup handles Isabelle symbols, but it's not very flexible<br>
and it unnecessarily splits chunks (e.g. "sμn ⟶ mσσn" lays out as 9<br>
chunks instead of one).<br>
The renderer in Rich_Text_Area assumes one font per chunk, and user_font<br>
only handles Isabelle symbols and not general code points present in the<br>
text. The result is that with font substitution enabled in jEdit, using<br>
code points not in your main font (yes, even IsabelleText has these)<br>
will also result in glyph rendering misalignment.</p>
<p>As Isabelle plugin developers we cannot reuse the internal glyph<br>
vectors stored in the chunk for rendering our text colors, because if<br>
all code points are present in your main font, then "sμn ⟶ mσσn" will<br>
not only be a single chunk, but also a single glyph vector. After it's<br>
assembled, we can't get at which part means what.</p>
<p>So what do we do instead?</p>
<p>Create an AttributeString to contain all the rendering information for<br>
the chunk. AttributeStrings are great. They store all style information<br>
we need, but also font information.</p>
<p>For each Isabelle text color in the chunk, mark that range in the<br>
AttributeString with that color, defaulting to chunk's default text<br>
color and font. Mark where the cursor is as inverted-color.</p>
<p>Access the font lookup mechanism in Chunk.java (possible with the<br>
patch).  If jEdit didn't do font substitution, we don't either.<br>
Otherwise: go through the AttributeString looking for code points the<br>
chunk's font can't display. Ask Chunk if there's a substitute font to<br>
use to display it. If there is, mark the range of the code point in the<br>
AttributeString with that font.</p>
<p>Render resulting AttributeString. Watch as it lines up perfectly with<br>
jEdit's layout regardless of what code points you dug out from the<br>
depths of Unicode.</p>
<p>The end. It really is simpler, and I think a good change for Isabelle to<br>
adopt.</p>
<p>Makarius: I know you probably won't like CustomChunk, or at the very<br>
least its name. I just wanted to encapsulate the AttributeString<br>
operations for simplicity and understandability. As always, if you're<br>
not happy with something and want me to change/redo, let me know. I want<br>
to make useful contributions.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>From: Rafal Kolanski &lt;<a href="mailto:xs@xaph.net">xs@xaph.net</a>&gt;<br>
There is a small update to this. Because some fonts (e.g. IsabelleText)<br>
are dynamically inserted at Isabelle plugin load into the graphics<br>
context <em>after</em> jEdit has loaded all properties ("settings"), jEdit<br>
doesn't see them.</p>
<p>Since the Isabelle plugin makes changes to existing contexts that affect<br>
the interpretation of jEdit properties, after some deliberation (and<br>
about a week of testing) I suggest the following solution.</p>
<p>In src/Tools/jEdit/src/plugin.scala, at the end of the start() method,<br>
we inform jEdit that it should look at its properties again:</p>
<p>diff --git a/src/Tools/jEdit/src/plugin.scala<br>
b/src/Tools/jEdit/src/plugin.scala<br>
index ac081b1..31db703 100644<br>

         PIDE.startup_failure = Some(exn)<br>
         PIDE.startup_notified = false<br>

+</p>
<ul>
<li>// new fonts loaded; references to them in config will now work</li>
<li>jEdit.propertiesChanged()<br>
   }</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry for the noise. Getting this change right is important to me, and<br>
feedback is a bit scarce. Now that Makarius potentially has time to look<br>
at this, I want to offer as much assistance as I can.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
I have recently made various reforms in the isabelle.Main vs. jedit.jar <br>
initialization sequence, which is relevant for the coming winter release <br>
of Isabelle2016.</p>
<p>If there are remaining problems, we should continue the discussion on the <br>
isabelle-dev mailing list.  The current point of reference is changeset <br>
be3a5fee11e3.</p>
