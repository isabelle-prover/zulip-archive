<p>Call for Posters &amp; Research Tool Demonstrations<br>
   14th International Formal Methods Symposium (FM'06)<br>
           McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada<br>
                  August 21-27, 2006<br>
<a href="http://fm06.mcmaster.ca">http://fm06.mcmaster.ca</a></p>
<p>FM'06 is the fourteenth in a series of symposia organized by Formal<br>
Methods Europe, an independent association whose aim is to stimulate<br>
the use of, and research on, formal methods for software development.<br>
The symposia have been notably successful in bringing together<br>
innovators and practitioners in precise mathematical methods for<br>
software development, industrial users as well as researchers.</p>
<p>Tools are central to the success of formal methods in practice.<br>
Hence, tool demonstrations will have a prominent role in the<br>
conference. Demonstrators will be expected to present their tools<br>
during specially-designated time that will be scheduled into the<br>
conference program.  Tool demonstrations should be accompanied<br>
by a poster.  In addition, a collection of short papers (2-3<br>
pages), for every accepted tool demonstration, will be published as a<br>
technical report and available to conference attendees.  The authors<br>
maintain copyright on their written tool description.</p>
<p>We solicit proposals for tool demonstrations related to automated<br>
reasoning using formal methods.  Tools can range from alpha-versions<br>
to fully developed products that are being prepared for<br>
commercialization. Products that are currently being commercialized<br>
will not be accepted as subjects of demonstrations (see call for<br>
commercial exhibits and tool demonstrations). Research tool<br>
demonstrations are not intended to be sales pitches, and should<br>
consequently highlight technical contributions. For further<br>
clarification, please contact the tool demonstrations chair.</p>
<p>Priority will be given to tools based on sound, rigorous research<br>
results to support the automation of analysis and/or verification of<br>
software or hardware systems.</p>
<p>We also solicit posters describing late-breaking results related to<br>
the theme of the conference.  Like tool demonstrations, accepted<br>
posters will be accompanied by a short paper published as a technical<br>
report and available to conference attendees.  Poster presenters are<br>
expected to be available during a specially-scheduled time during the<br>
conference to present their work.</p>
<p>Review Process</p>
<p>The Posters &amp; Demos Committee will review each submission using<br>
the standard FM criteria: originality and importance of contribution,<br>
soundness of rationale or demonstration, quality of written and<br>
graphic presentation, and appropriate consideration of relevant<br>
literature.</p>
<p>Equipment</p>
<p>Demonstrators are expected to provide their own equipment.</p>
<p>How to submit</p>
<p>Submissions of proposals for posters &amp; tool demonstrations must:</p>
<p>For demos:</p>
<p>* be no more than 3 pages in LNCS format, describing the<br>
technology or approach, what is the research that has gone into the<br>
tool, how it relates to other industrial or research efforts,<br>
including references, and what are the expected benefits.</p>
<p>* have an appendix (not included in the 3-page count) that<br>
provides a detailed description of how the presentation would be<br>
conducted (possibly illustrated with a number of snapshots),<br>
information on tool availability and maturity, and the URL of a<br>
web-page for the tool (if one exists).</p>
<p>For Posters:</p>
<p>* be no more than 3 pages in LNCS format, describing the<br>
approach, how it relates to other industrial or research efforts,<br>
including references, and what are the expected benefits.</p>
<p>For Demos and Posters:</p>
<p>* be sent to by email to Marsha Chechik (chechik at cs dot toronto dot edu)<br>
by the Posters &amp; Demos submission deadline.  Please begin the subject<br>
line with "FM 2006 Demo" or "FM 2006 Poster".</p>
<p>Accepted Posters and Demonstrations</p>
<p>Accepted posters and demonstrations will be published as short papers<br>
in a special technical report, available to conference attendees.<br>
In addition, the authors should be available for answering questions<br>
or demonstrating their tools at scheduled times during the conference.</p>
<p>Important Dates<br>
Submission deadline:<br>
    May 26, 2006.<br>
Author notification:<br>
    June 12, 2006.<br>
Camera-ready papers:<br>
    June 22, 2006.</p>

the use of, and research on, formal methods for software development.<br>
The symposia have been notably successful in bringing together<br>
innovators and practitioners in precise mathematical methods for<br>
software development, industrial users as well as researchers.<br>
Attendance will include roughly 250 researchers and practitioners from<br>
industry and academia.  This is the first time FM is held in North America.</p>
<p>Exhibition and commercial tool demonstration space is available and<br>
will be accessible to attendees for the duration of the conference<br>
(August 21-27, 2006.).  One-day attendance is also available.</p>
<p>For a nominal cost, the conference will provide space for a booth and<br>
a demo, as well as an opportunity to present the tool at lunch time<br>
during the Industry Day (August 23, 2006), and once as a parallel<br>
track to the technical paper session.  Interested exhibitors should<br>
contact Marsha Chechik (chechik at cs dot toronto dot edu) for payment details<br>
and to request any special space or demonstration needs.</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
<p>Application due         May 26,  2006<br>
