While working my way through GouldBk.pdf with FormaI_Power_Series.thy I <br>
am at the Lagrange Inversion theorems and I am stuck.  At present the <br>
problem is with:</p>
<p>fps_inv g  -- when g is delta, i.e. g=0 + a_1<em>X+a_2</em>X^2 ...<br>
This is defined as fps=0.0.0...</p>
<p>Which I don't understand.  How is that justified?  That change is <br>
referred to in the 2016 news (more or less).  This seems to be a major <br>
roadblock; alternate  interpretations are that the "res" function of <br>
Laurent series are missing.<br>
Amine Chaieb referred to a Formal Power Series structure that included <br>
Laurent Series in 2009 talk,  but I can't seem to find the talk or any <br>
reference in Isabelle .  Does anybody have a pointer?<br>
I can implement Niven's Laurent extension in<br>

but that would delay any interesting work even further (:<br>
I tried another approach but the prematurely declaring zero and not <br>
waiting for cancellation possibilities has struck at me again.  The <br>
whole term does have a cancellation if the term is multiplied by X and <br>
yields fps $0 =1; at least from an outside algebra point of view.<br>
A particularly simple Lagrange rendering is at:<br>

Or I can try the Umbral calculus version but that also seems as hard as <br>
Niven.</p>

Yes, but "confusion" isn't the right word; why do it?   If I am told <br>
that division by zero is illegal then doing it should error out.  If <br>
there is a reason that Formal...thy returns the absolute zero fps?  Can <br>
I get a reference/reason/Axiom?  I am not even sure that decision is <br>
consistent; as evidenced by the fact that cancellations are not <br>
considered first (maybe).  These concerns are only _motivated_ by <br>
Lagrange inversion, the real concern is consistency with normal mathematics.<br>
  In fact it looks like a contradiction: take X*(fps_inv X).<br>
If I cancel first then I get =1<br>
If I evaluate (fps_inv X) first I get =0<br>
How can I trust a system where 0=1, depending upon order evaluation?  I <br>
mentally tried alternate structures controlling order but  rapidly got <br>
bogged down because of  the thought of things occurring deeper inside of <br>
other uses/lemma, and having no underlying consistent guidelines.  I <br>
list two instances of complex reasoning/manipulation from GouldBk.pdf <br>
below.  I can supply references to many... other papers using similar <br>
conventions.  In addition the forms of the "Lagrange Inversion" are many <br>
and varied; more like distant cousins of one another than close kin.</p>

<p>Yes and the following:<br>

"inverse 0 = 0". Given up separate classes division_ring_inverse_zero,<br>
field_inverse_zero and linordered_field_inverse_zero. INCOMPATIBILITY.<br>
Even if I accept the logic for rings and fields (which as of now I don't <br>
really see why I should)<br>
we have the fact that the fps theory is setting a _non_zero_ item to <br>
zero during inversion.  Rephrasing: this is setting an additional <br>
equivalence class operation in place.  I haven't seen this in my studies <br>
and classes; but it's been some time and this particular case didn't get <br>
mentioned as I recall.</p>

there is a strong dependency upon one or more of the various forms.  So <br>

inverses; which is basically what Lagrange inversion is.  I can't <br>

At least so far.  I can try to replace X* with explicit shifts though.  (?)</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
First of all: There are no non-total functions in HOL. If you take the <br>
first element of the empty list, if you divide by zero, if you evaluate <br>
0^0, you always get /some/ result; there is just no other way in that <br>
logic. The question is: What result do you get?</p>
<p>One approach is to leave it unspecified (e.g. using HOL's "undefined" or <br>
something like that), then you simply don't know or care (logically) <br>
what that element is. But it still /is/ an element (i.e. 1/0 is a real <br>
number, you just don't know which number), and it's always the same <br>
number, so e.g. "1/0 - 1/0 = 0" holds.</p>
<p>In my experience, it is usually a lot less painful to adopt conventions <br>
like "x / 0 = 0 for all x". This diverges from mathematical convention, <br>
but as I said, you simply cannot have ‘completely undefined’ expressions <br>
in HOL, and if you must return some value, you might as well choose a <br>
convenient one. Choosing "x / 0 = 0" has the advantage that a number of <br>
nice properties of division still hold without additional conditions, <br>
which makes rewriting arithmetic terms less painful. Of course, as an <br>
Isabelle user, you have to /know/ what this means.</p>
<p>A similar issue is the sum over an infinite set, which is always 0 in <br>
Isabelle. One may naïvely expect that "(∑n∈{1..}. 1/n^2) = π²/6", but it <br>
is in fact zero by definition, and if one wants an actual infinite sum, <br>
one has to use another concept of "sum", e.g. "suminf"/"sums" or the <br>
measure-theoretic one.</p>
<p>Therefore, the justification of choosing fps_inv as 0 for inputs that <br>
don't have an inverse is simply that it you can't return a "proper" <br>
result, so you might as well return a "convenient" dummy result.</p>
<p>Second, I think you may be confused by what fps_inv actually is. fps_inv <br>
is the /compositional/ inverse of formal power series. Therefore, <br>
cancelling "X * fps_inv X" to "1" makes no sense to me at all. In fact, <br>
"fps_inv X = X", and "X" plugged into "X" yields "X", which is the <br>
compositional identity, as expected.</p>
<p>Perhaps you mean the /multiplicative/ inverse? This is simply "inverse <br>
X", which is defined like this:</p>
<p>fun natfun_inverse:: "'a fps ⇒ nat ⇒ 'a"<br>
where<br>
   "natfun_inverse f 0 = inverse (f$0)"<br>
| "natfun_inverse f n = - inverse (f$0) * sum (λi. f$i * natfun_inverse <br>
f (n - i)) {1..n}"</p>
<p>definition fps_inverse_def: "inverse f = (if f $ 0 = 0 then 0 else <br>
Abs_fps (natfun_inverse f))"</p>
<p>Thus, "inverse X" is indeed 0 in Isabelle. This is because X simply does <br>
not have an inverse in the ring of formal power series and we have to <br>
return something.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>take X*(fps_inv X).<br>
If I cancel first then I get =1<br>
If I evaluate (fps_inv X) first I get =0 <br>
Okay, so you probably again mean "X * inverse X" here. You are correct <br>
that you can evaluate "inverse X" to "0", and then you get "X * 0 = 0". <br>
However, you can /not/ cancel "X * inverse X" to get "1". The law "f * <br>
inverse f = 1" only holds if "f $ 0 ≠ 0", as you can see in this theorem:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>lemma inverse_mult_eq_1':<br>
   assumes f0: "f$0 ≠ (0::'a::field)"<br>
   shows "f * inverse f = 1"</p>
<p>You can't do any better than this if you want to stay in the type "'a <br>
fps". If you want multiplicative inverses for all non-zero formal power <br>
series, you have to go to the ring of formal Laurent series, do your <br>
stuff there, and then go back to the ring of formal power series once <br>
you're done. This is perhaps a bit odd for a mathematician, but I'm <br>
afraid that's how things are in a typed logic like HOL.</p>
<p>However, note that you can write things like "X^2 / X" in the ring of <br>
formal power series (as long as the coefficients are a field), which <br>
evaluates to "X" as expected. For "'a :: field fps", a power series <br>
divides another iff the subdegree of the former is smaller than that of <br>
the latter, and we have a full Euclidean ring structure on FPSs, i.e. we <br>
have well-behaved division and remainder operations "div" and "mod" just <br>
like on integers or polynomials. I think this is probably enough and <br>
probably less painful than going to formal Laurent series.</p>
<p>Note that, due to somewhat unfortunate notation, "f / g" on formal power <br>
series is not the same as "f * inverse g". It is the same if g is a <br>
unit, but otherwise, "f / g" is essentially what you get when you <br>
compute "f / g" in the ring of formal Laurent series and then cut off <br>
all the terms with negative exponents, and "f mod g" is the remainder, <br>
i.e. "f - (f / g) * g".</p>
<p>If you only want to divide by powers of X, you can also use fps_shift.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can I trust a system where 0=1, depending upon order evaluation?<br>
Well, you can't. Luckily, Isabelle is (hopefully) not such a system. It <br>
is a core principle of Isabelle that definitions should never be able to <br>
introduce inconsistencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Could you send me a copy?<br>
It's currently broken in ways that I don't understand, but I'll attempt <br>
to fix it and then I can send it to you. I'm not sure if it will be very <br>
helpful; it was never more than a small experiment.</p>

I know Amine's article and it really doesn't say very much about Laurent <br>
series. It essentially describes that one can define them as "'a fps <br>
fract" in the way I did in my experiment and nothing more. I don't think <br>
Amine ever actually had the time to build a library of facts about <br>
Laurent series.</p>

So it would seem that res(f/g) i.e. (f/g) $ -1<br>
would be ((X*f)/g) $ 0<br>
?<br>
I'll run some tests.<br>

And we have a measure of success!</p>
<p>lemma Ias_Lag_880_ii:<br>
fixes f g::"real fps"<br>
assumes "f$0 \&lt;noteq&gt;0"<br>
assumes "g = X*f"<br>
shows "((( (fps_deriv  g)*X)/g)$ 0)  = 1"<br>
using assms(1) assms(2) by auto</p>
<p>and --shows "((( (fps_deriv  g)*X)/g)$ 0)  = 0<br>
fails!</p>
<p>Forgive any inelegance in my syntax.<br>
Now all we need is to rearrange the above as a function:<br>
fps-&gt;fps-&gt;element of field<br>
res f g -&gt;(X*f)/g %0</p>
<p>This seems to match the requirements of most combinatorial theorems; <br>
although it _looks_ like we could generalize a little.</p>
<p>A bit happier!<br>
