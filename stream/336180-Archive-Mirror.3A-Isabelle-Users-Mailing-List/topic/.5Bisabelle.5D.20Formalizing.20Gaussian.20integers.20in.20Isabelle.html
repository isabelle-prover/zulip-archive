<p>From: Christian Weinz &lt;<a href="mailto:christian.weinz@stud.uni-goettingen.de">christian.weinz@stud.uni-goettingen.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>For a project in my university I'm working on a formalization of the<br>
Gaussian integers in Isabelle. Eventually, I want to use that for<br>
number theoretic proofs within Isabelle.</p>
<p>My first approach was to look how the complex numbers were introduced<br>
in Isabelle and to copy that for the Gaussian integers, basically just<br>
replacing real for int. That worked fine, and I went on to show class<br>
instantiations for my Gaussian integers.</p>
<p>The Gaussian integers form a euclidean domain. For now, I'd be happy to<br>
show that the Gaussian integers allow unique factorizations into prime<br>
factors up to a unit factor, i.e. that they are a factorial ring, so I<br>
aimed for the class "factorial_ring_gcd" in<br>
"/HOL/Computational_Algebra/Factorial_Ring.thy".</p>
<p>However, that did not work out because the path "factorial_ring_gcd -&gt;<br>
factorial_semiring_gcd -&gt; factorial_semiring -&gt; normalization_semidom<br>
-&gt; semidom_divide_unit_factor" in the class hierarchy forces me to<br>
define the functions "unit_factor" and "normalize" for the Gaussian<br>
integers satisfying the class definition of<br>
"semidom_divide_unit_factor" in "/HOL/Rings.thy". I see no way to<br>
normalize the Gaussian integers that way.</p>
<p>My next approach would be to define the Gaussian integer as a<br>
ring_scheme and use "/HOL/Algebra/Ring_Divisibility.thy". From that I<br>
would get the "factorization_property" from the same file, but that<br>
formalization looks less intuitive and less practical for my purposes.</p>
<p>That is why I'm writing here. Is the class hierarchy not suitable for<br>
formalizing what I need to achieve? Am I just overlooking something? It<br>
might be possible that I have a mistake in my understand of the<br>
Gaussian Integers. I'm thankful for any ideas.</p>
<p>Thanks and happy new year,<br>
Christian</p>

about "duplicate fact declarations".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is the theorem "comm_monoid.is_monoid" in<br>
HOL-Algebra.Multiplicative_Group. This theorem is completely unnecessary<br>
and it leads to a name clash when interpreting the locale. No idea why<br>
nobody noticed this before. We should really remove this before the next<br>
release.</p>
<p>Since you will want to use Euclidean domains, there really is no way<br>
past this, since the theory in which they are defined in HOL-Algebra<br>
depends on Multiplicative_Group. The only workaround I can offer is to<br>
locally remove the theorem "is_monoid" on lines 649-650 of<br>
Multiplicative_Group.thy in your local Isabelle installation /or/ to<br>
wait until I removed it from the development version (will probably do<br>
that later today) and work with the development version<br>
(<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle</a>).</p>
<p>Sorry about this – HOL-Algebra is not used very much and is /really/ messy.</p>
<p>I think I'll have a shot at cleaning up the type classes enough to be<br>
usable in your case during the next few weeks. I can't say yet if it<br>
will work out though, but hopefully this will be done by the next<br>
release (which I guess will be some time around April or May).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>There are quite a few things that I think should be done differently:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Locale interpretations are typically done with the "unfold_locales"<br>
command. That makes things much easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would advise against calling your constructors "Re" and "Im",<br>
because they will then clash with the "Re" and "Im" from the complex<br>
numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is good to keep names short, especially ones you will use a lot.<br>
Perhaps "gauss_int" instead of "gaussian_integer" etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it will be much more pleasant for you to go as far as<br>
possible using the typeclass, i.e. instantiate all the appropriate<br>
typeclasses (at least up "idom") for your Gaussian integers. Then you<br>
can still easily move into the HOL-Algebra setting by defining something<br>
like</p>
<p>definition Gauss_Ints :: "gauss_int ring"<br>
  where "gaussian_integer_ring ≡ ⦇carrier = UNIV,<br>
           mult = (*), one = 1, zero = 0, add = (+)⦈"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then you can get the properties you need (unique factorisation etc) from<br>
HOL-Algebra and pull them out to the type-class-based setting again.<br>
Ideally, you should also first define a Euclidean norm on the Gaussian<br>
integers with all its properties. This will allow you to easily switch<br>
to the type class-based Euclidean rings later on.</p>

integers satisfying the class definition of<br>
"semidom_divide_unit_factor" in "/HOL/Rings.thy". I see no way to<br>
normalize the Gaussian integers that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, sorry, that's my fault.</p>
<p>The purpose of normalize/unit_factor is to have a canonical<br>
representative for each association class in a ring. The obvious choice<br>
for Gaussian integers is to define "normalize (a + i * b) = abs a + i *
abs b". Unfortunately, this doesn't work because the typeclass<br>
(semidom_divide_unit_factor) requires "unit_factor" (and thereby<br>
"normalize") to be multiplicative. This requirement simple developed<br>
from the fact that "normalize" is multiplicative for all the examples we<br>
had back when we introduced these classes, and it makes many theorems<br>
(e.g. about GCDs) much nicer to state.</p>
<p>It is always possible to define a multiplicative "normalize" for a ring<br>
with unique factorisation (simply pick whatever canonical representative<br>
you want for any prime element and then lift it up to general ring<br>
elements by multiplicativity), but of course that is not something one<br>
really wants to do. Especially because one often wants to show that<br>
something is a Euclidean domain in order to get unique factorisation for<br>
free.</p>
<p>The proper solution would be to remove the multiplicativity condition<br>
from semidom_divide_unit_factor. I tried that once but it turned out to<br>
be quite a bit of work, so I gave up again. Perhaps it would be worth<br>
giving it another shot now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My next approach would be to define the Gaussian integer as a<br>
ring_scheme and use "/HOL/Algebra/Ring_Divisibility.thy". From that I<br>
would get the "factorization_property" from the same file, but that<br>
formalization looks less intuitive and less practical for my purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using HOL-Algebra is definititely also possible. You have to jump<br>
through a few more hoops. You would have to interpret the<br>
euclidean_domain locale for your Gaussian integer type and an<br>
appropriate Euclidean measure function, and then you get the theorem<br>
"factorization_property", which you can polish a bit to get it into a<br>
more readable form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is why I'm writing here. Is the class hierarchy not suitable for<br>
formalizing what I need to achieve?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You want to use the typeclass-based stuff whenever you can. However, the<br>
typeclass-based approach to algebra in Isabelle<br>
("HOL-Computational_Algebra") is very much geared towards pragmaticism:<br>
It was designed to work well for the use concrete cases that we had<br>
(naturals, integers, polynomials, formal power series), and it does that<br>
fairly well. But for Gaussian integers, it does not work in the current<br>
form, and for others (p-adic numbers) will probably never work without a<br>
considerable amount of effort.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to prove unique factorisation using HOL-Algebra<br>
for now, and if I get around to removing multiplicativity from that type<br>
class at some point (hopefully before the next release), you should be<br>
able to switch over to that without much effort.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask if you need help with any more concrete questions about<br>
how to use HOL-Algebra.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Good news, as of isabelle-dev/e0237f2eb49d, normalization_semidom does<br>
not require "unit_factor" (or alternatively "normalize") to be<br>
multiplicative anymore. The property was replaced with</p>
<p>"is_unit u ==&gt; unit_factor (u * a) = u * unit_factor a"</p>
<p>This is a much weaker property that is equivalent to the following: Two<br>
elements that are associated will normalize to the same canonical<br>
representative, i.e.</p>
<p>"a dvd b ==&gt; b dvd a ==&gt; normalize a = normalize b"</p>
<p>With this, it is now possible to prove that the Gaussian integers are a<br>
Euclidean ring.</p>
<p>There are also a few other related classes that slap on the<br>
multiplicativity assumption to restore the previous behaviour (the most<br>
important examples of normalization_semidoms all fulfil it!). Some<br>
things (most notably polynomial GCD and related concepts) still require<br>
multiplicative normalization. It would probably be possible to remove<br>
that in the future as well, but let's take this one step at a time.</p>
<p>While I was at it, I also introduced a class "field_gcd" that subsumes a<br>
number of previous classes that all essentially meant "a field that also<br>
has the trivial GCD defined on it".</p>
<p>NEWS entry will follow.</p>

integers; You first recursively divide by 1+i whenever the number is<br>

<p>What would be a good approach to encapsulate the the relation between<br>
the complex numbers and the Gaussian integers in Isabelle?<br>
Specifically, that the Gaussian integers are a subset and should be<br>

Hm, okay. I have no intuition for what this means. Not sure if this is the best way to go; it seems to me that it makes more sense to have an intuitively clear concept of what a normalised Gaussian integer is (e.g. either 0 or real part &gt; 0, imaginary part ≥ 0).</p>

I would advise against modifying type classes. Even small changes lead to a huge amount of merge work. Much of the Isabelle distribution and the AFP is affected by such changes, so I would only make them if absolutely necessary.</p>

Similarly to nat and real, I would say: Just define an injective homomorphism "complex_of_gauss_int :: gauss_int ⇒ complex" (or something like that). Using "Re", "Im", and "i" with both complex numbers and Gaussian integers is not that easy. There are a few possible options:</p>

  – Simply declare "Re" as additional notation. This will lead to syntax ambiguity warnings due to multiple parse trees.<br>
  – Use ad-hoc overloading. That might, however, require some changes to the existing syntax, and I don't think Gaussian integers are important enough to justify going to such lengths.</p>
<p>Personally, I would recommend going for the first option, and then /perhaps/ switching on some optional extra syntax for these things to make them nicer to look at.</p>
<p>As I said to you privately, I do have a proof-of-concept implementation of Gaussian integers from years ago that does pretty much exactly that.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
