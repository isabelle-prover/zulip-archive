Hi,</p>
<p>I'd like to formalize the definition of Turing machine. If possible,<br>
I'd like to do it without relying on ZFC. That is, I don't use sets,<br>
integers and so on.</p>
<p>Yes, in the definition of Turing machine we see sets, such as the set<br>
of states, but I think the use of set is convenient but not necessary.<br>
(Am I wrong?) So if you agree with me and think it's possible to go<br>
without sets, could you please outline how to define Turing machine?<br>
If you think this is impossible, can you give a proof?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Zirui Wang</p>

<p>Well, HOL is what people are typically using, and if you are new to <br>
Isabelle and are trying to use anything else, you are going to have a <br>
hard time, because other logics are much less developed in terms of tool <br>
support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately HOL is at least as strong as ZFC because it has the idea<br>
of a set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HOL's notion of a set is much weaker, as sets are just identified with <br>
predicates over the respective type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My teacher Jain suggests that it might be possible to define<br>
Turing machine based on Peano Arithmetic, which is weaker than ZFC.<br>
And I'm going to try that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can certainly try, and I think there should not be fundamental <br>
problems, but you will certainly suffer from the lack of tool support in <br>
your custom-made logic, as opposed to using something well-established.</p>
<p>If these foundational issues of taking the weakest logic possible are <br>
really the core of your interest, then you can try and go for Peano <br>
Arithmetic, but if your main interest is formalizing Turing Machines <br>
after all, then using anything but HOL is like cutting your left leg off <br>
before climbing a mountain.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The formalization is based on HOL. If you have big trouble reading the <br>
formalization, this is probably an indication that you should learn some <br>
Isabelle basics first, e.g. by working through the Tutorial <br>

Hi,</p>
<p>Yes, you can define Turing machines in a very<br>
simple base theory. For example, you can use lists<br>
instead of sets because everything in a TM description<br>
has to be finite. So at least the preliminary theory<br>
of TMs can be done without higher order things like<br>
sets and functions. But going even a little bit into the<br>
theory, you will need to define computable functions etc.<br>
On the face of it, even the undecidability of the Halting<br>
Problem seems to need sets to state (i.e. the <em>set</em> of all<br>
halting TMs is undecidable).</p>
<p>I did some work on formalizing TMs in HOL-4 and the<br>
following definitions of the machines should be<br>
completely straightforward to turn into Isabelle/HOL syntax.<br>
Of course there is more to define, like machine configurations,<br>
executions, languages, etc. but I will omit those.</p>
<p>Also, doesn't the AFP include some computability theory<br>
already?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Konrad.</p>

Hi Zirui,</p>
<p>TMs can be represented by bitstrings (or numbers).<br>
No sets. A TM evaluator can be written that takes<br>
in a bitstring, decodes it into a TM and an input,<br>
and simulates the execution of the TM on the input.<br>
That evaluator can itself be written out as a bitstring<br>
representing a TM. Any decent undergrad theory<br>
textbook will go into this in some amount of detail.<br>
So there is a certain portion of computability theory<br>
that is basic programming and can be formalized in<br>
a simple logic that doesn't formalize set theory.</p>
<p>On the other hand, much of computability is about<br>
infinite sets (not lists), some of which can be<br>
implemented by TMs and some which can't. Again,<br>
any undergrad theory text (or wikipedia) has<br>
plenty of detail.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Konrad.</p>

Turing machines are finite objects.  They can be encoded as numbers (via<br>
some Gödel numbering, cf.<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_number">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_number</a>).</p>
<p>So depending on what you want to prove exactly, and provided that you<br>
don't want to speak about (infinite) sets of Turing machines, you may<br>
indeed be able to avoid set theory entirely, and merely work in (some<br>
fragment of) a theory of arithmetic (cf.<br>
<a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/handbookII/">http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/handbookII/</a>,<br>

suggested this in the first place, why not ask him to explain the<br>
details?</p>
<p>Note that finite lists (of numbers) can be encoded as numbers (again,<br>
via some Gödel numbering), so they are not "as high level as sets".</p>
<p>Also note that Alex was perfectly right when he wrote:<br>

<p>Based on ZFC you can define and derive much of mathematics, so I<br>
imagine that it's easy to define Turing machine from ZFC. The problem<br>
with this is that it's harder to do proofs in a strong theory.<br>
Therefore I want to define Turing machine in a weaker theory (with<br>
fewer axioms). Basically it would good to have the theory as weak as<br>
possible (because it facilitates proofs). But when the theory gets<br>
weaker, it also becomes less expressive. So I want the theory to be<br>
just strong enough to define Turing machines. I think that would be<br>
the ideal theory, because it can express the definition of Turing<br>
machine and it is weak enough to do certain proofs.</p>

You are quite right to be concerned about difficulty of proofs, but  <br>
there are many factors involved in this difficulty, and some weak  <br>
theories are much more difficult to use than stronger theories. If you  <br>
want to accomplish your project with the minimum of effort, you should  <br>
undoubtedly choose Isabelle/HOL. Not only is the logic easy-to-use;  <br>
the implementation provides lots of automation.</p>

OK, maybe it's a bad choice to start with formalizing Turing machine,<br>
which is a definition not a theorem. How about formalizing Cook's<br>
theorem, the Probabilistically Checkable Proof (PCP) theorem and the<br>
natural proof theorem? Yes, I'm very interested in formalizing<br>
theorems in computational complexity theory. Has anyone done this?</p>

Churchs' thesis says, that all computability can be expressed  by Turing <br>
machines. So you probably cannot bypass sets when defining a such a <br>
formalism. Mathematically spoken do groups, rings, (closed)  fields rely <br>
on sets in their definition. Also alphabets are sets. What do you have <br>
on mind?<br>

There is no need to talk about the "set of all halting TMs" to state<br>
undecidability of the halting problem.  Simply put, undecidability of<br>
the halting problem asserts that there is no Turing machine that decides<br>
whether an arbitrary Turing machine halts.  Stating this requires<br>
quantification over all Turing machines, but no set comprehension.  (Of<br>
course, you chose a deliberately careful wording in the first place, so<br>
I guess this was obvious to you.)</p>
<p>Maybe someone else can point out the precise theory required to prove<br>
undecidability of the halting problem?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

But think about lambda calculus. It is computationally as powerful as<br>
Turing machine. Following your line of reasoning, it should also rely<br>
on set in its definition. But I think it's simple enough to avoid the<br>
use of set.</p>

I'm sorry, but I'd like to repeat again that I'm not talking about<br>
programming tricks. So lists are as high level as sets, because you<br>
can implement sets by lists. Actually I don't mean sets in particular<br>
but rather <em>set theory</em>. I want to avoid the use of sets because I<br>
want to have nothing to do with the axioms of set theory. So lists<br>
probably also rely on the axioms of set theory, unless you can define<br>
it without the axioms of set theory. So let repeat my question: Can we<br>
define Turing machine without relying on the axioms of set theory? I<br>
think part of the misconception is because I'm posting this topic<br>
under Isabelle. Actually my question has nothing to do with Isabelle<br>
or HOL; I just imagined that people here might be good at formalizing<br>
concepts and proofs using rudimentary logic theory. Sorry for the<br>
misunderstanding.</p>
