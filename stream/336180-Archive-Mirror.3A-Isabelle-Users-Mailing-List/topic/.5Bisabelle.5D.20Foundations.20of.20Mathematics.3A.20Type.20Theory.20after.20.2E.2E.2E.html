<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Members of the Research Community,</p>
<p>In an attempt to create a genealogy of the foundations of mathematics,<br>
the main approaches based upon Church's Simple Theory of Types (1940),</p>
<ul>
<li>Gordon's HOL (including origins like Huet's and Paulson's LCF and the descendants by Konrad Slind, John Harrison, and Larry Paulson) as well as</li>
<li>Andrews' Q0 (including Tom Melham's extension of HOL drawing on the work of Andrews)<br>
are compared online at<p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4444/100.111">http://dx.doi.org/10.4444/100.111</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose is to make design decisions transparent in order to systematically characterize and compare logistic systems,<br>
which either explicitly or implicitly try to express most or all of formal logic and mathematics.</p>
<p>Hints, comments, corrections and critique are welcome.</p>
<p>Other systems (e.g., Coq) shall be considered at a later time.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure concerning the history of Cambridge LCF, as its descriptions slightly differ.<br>
In one version, Paulson further develops the (finished) result by Huet, in another they directly collaborate.<br>
("Huet’s Franz Lisp version of LCF was further developed at Cambridge by Larry Paulson, and became known as ‘Cambridge LCF’.",<br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-description.pdf">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-description.pdf</a>, p. 4,<br>
vs. "Paulson and Huet then established a collaboration and did a lot of joint development of LCF by sending each other magnetic tapes in the post.",<br>
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mjcg/papers/HolHistory.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mjcg/papers/HolHistory.pdf</a>, p. 3.)<br>
In the overview, it is summarized as "Cambridge LCF by Larry Paulson and Gérard Huet (around 1985)",<br>
as it seems important that both contributed, and Paulson's name later appears in the context of Isabelle, and Huet's in the context of Coq.</p>
<p>Due to limited space, unfortunately not all people contributing to existing projects could be mentioned.<br>
For example, I am well aware that Michael Norrish maintains and contributes to HOL4.<br>
I apologize for having to restrict the presentation, mentioning only the initiators or project leaders.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Ken Kubota</p>
