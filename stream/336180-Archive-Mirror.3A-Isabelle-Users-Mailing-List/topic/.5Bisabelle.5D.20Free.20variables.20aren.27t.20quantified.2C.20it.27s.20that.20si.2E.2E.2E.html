   "(!C.!D.(C | D --&gt; C)) --&gt; (A | B --&gt; A)"<br>

<p>This could be material for my book, "How to Learn Basic Logic with <br>
Isabelle", or with the type of title I always hate, "Logic for Dummies <br>
with Isabelle2012".<br>

<p>It still appears that free variables aren't quantified, although my <br>
reasoning might be warped. It may not be warped. If I just know what's <br>
true, then I can sometimes straighten out my reasoning.</p>
<p>This is my first use of Isabelle as a tool to confirm some basic logic. <br>
No one else is going to take any substantial time to clarify and remind <br>
me of the basics that I mostly understand. There's nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>Hi Gottfried,</p>

<p>I was more than convinced by the following answer from Paulson, stated in a<br>
previous e-mail (assuming<br>
my simpler question subsumes the one you posed):</p>
<p>The formula (?x + ?y) + ?z = ?x + (?y + ?z) expresses a property about</p>
<blockquote>
<p>three quantities denoted by ?x, ?y and ?z. It is a convention in logic that<br>
any theorem involving free variables denotes the "universal closure" of<br>
that formula, here<br>
"all x. all y. all y. (x+y)+z =  x + (y+z)".<br>
Isabelle is designed to work best a minimum of logical symbols, hence the<br>
preference for stating theorems like<br>
        P1 ==&gt; … Pn ==&gt; Q.<br>
Hardly any mathematics paper states such theorems as<br>
        !x1 … xm. P1 &amp; … &amp; Pn —&gt; Q.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, they do not get quantified, but they have the same "denotation" (that<br>
is to say, they are equivalent<br>
under all interpretations.)</p>
<p>All the Best!<br>

<p>Alfio,</p>
<p>You say, "assuming my simpler question subsumes the one you posed".</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Please notice that I never use the schematic <br>

<p>(On that email, it was to you, but I replied to Larry as if it was to <br>
me, which I thought it was, but I apologize for that.)</p>
<p>I've been asking about the relationship between free variables and <br>
quantified variables in a formula prior to the formula being proved <br>
(although some of my tangents involved proofs). I think you and Larry <br>
are talking about formulas that have been proved.</p>
<p>It might be so obvious to people that free variables don't get <br>
quantified that everyone thought I was talking about post-proof free <br>
variables in a proved theorem.</p>
<p>First-order logic polluted my mind. I had the idea that any free <br>
variable in P gets implicitly bound by the prover engine when I put P in <br>
the statement  <code>theorem "P"</code>. It makes sense now that it wouldn't. <br>
Propositions are more general than closed formulas.</p>
<p>According to the tutorial, free variables get converted to schematic <br>
variables after a proof (page 7 tutorial.pdf). There is "free variable" <br>
pre-proof, and "free/schematic variable" post-proof.</p>
<p>I was talking about free variables in the mere statement of a theorem, like,</p>
<p>theorem --"(3)"<br>
   "(A | B --&gt;  A)&lt;-&gt;  (!C.!D.(C | D --&gt;  C))"<br>
oops</p>
<p>For (3), I now call the left-hand side a proposition, and I think of it <br>
in terms of propositional logic. I call the right-hand side a closed <br>
formula, and I think of it terms of first-order logic. A proposition <br>
does not necessarily have a definite truth value, whereas a closed <br>
formula does. That's what I showed below with my 5 examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, they do not get quantified, but they have the same "denotation" (that<br>
is to say, they are equivalent under all interpretations.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you would appreciate Larry's explanation more than me because I don't <br>
know anything about interpretations. My interpretation is that <br>
everything resolves to a boolean value of either true or false, based on <br>
my basic understanding of logical connectives and quantifiers.</p>

Alfio,</p>
<p>To try and summarize it, for you "they" are the formulas with free <br>
variables that get proved. I'm going to label these propositions that <br>
you're talking about as tautologies. They have the same denotation as <br>
some quantified formula.</p>
<p>For me, "they" are the formulas with free variables which have no <br>
definite truth value, like the (3) that I gave as an example. For these <br>
formulas, there is not an equivalent quantified formula.</p>
<p>You're focusing on the free variable formulas that can be proved, and <br>
their equivalency to a quantified formula.</p>
<p>I'm focusing on the free variable formulas that can't be proved, and <br>

Hi Gottfried,</p>
<p>You say, "assuming my simpler question subsumes the one you posed".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Please notice that I never use the schematic<br>
variable notation, whereas you and Larry do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are right, I missed that.</p>
<p>For (3), I now call the left-hand side a proposition, and I think of it in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>terms of propositional logic. I call the right-hand side a closed formula,<br>
and I think of it terms of first-order logic. A proposition does not<br>
necessarily have a definite truth value, whereas a closed formula does</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand  that a proposition is the same thing as sentence, as it is<br>
often called and thus has<br>
to have a definite logical truth-value. In this way, I always comeback to<br>
the definition of interpretation. In first-order logic<br>
an interpretation assigns meanings only to the syntactic entities [of the<br>
signature or basis].<br>
Meaning of free variables are fixed by the notion of a state, i.e., a<br>
function from variables to values.</p>
<p>So, in first-order logic, any formula that contains [for instance] a<br>
free-variable<br>
"x" it is not [be called] a proposition, and it is actually a function(al)<br>
on that free-variable. It can be seen as having the<br>
type State=&gt;Bool, where State is a function Vars=&gt;D,  Vars is the set of<br>
variables used to build the set<br>
of well-formed formulas and D is the domain in question. In this sense, the<br>
truth-value of this formula<br>
is open. It depends on the value of this free variable. It does not assert<br>
anything.</p>
<p>Now, propositional logic is just a sublogic of first-order logic, with no<br>
function symbols and where all predicate symbols<br>
have arity zero. The "variables" here are just predicates. Thus, it is<br>
enough to fix an interpretation for these predicates in<br>
order  to have the definite truth-value of the expression. So, from<br>
this point of view, every well-formed expression in propositional logic is<br>
a assertion, i.e., a sentence. That is why,<br>
I think, it can be called propositional or sentential logic.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this view (as written above) is shared by other people,<br>
though.</p>
<p>All the Best!</p>

<p>You say, "assuming my simpler question subsumes the one you posed".</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Please notice that I never use the schematic<br>

<p>(On that email, it was to you, but I replied to Larry as if it was to me,<br>

<p>I've been asking about the relationship between free variables and<br>
quantified variables in a formula prior to the formula being proved<br>
(although some of my tangents involved proofs). I think you and Larry are<br>
talking about formulas that have been proved.</p>
<p>It might be so obvious to people that free variables don't get quantified<br>
that everyone thought I was talking about post-proof free variables in a<br>
proved theorem.</p>
<p>First-order logic polluted my mind. I had the idea that any free variable<br>
in P gets implicitly bound by the prover engine when I put P in the<br>
statement  <code>theorem "P"</code>. It makes sense now that it wouldn't. Propositions<br>
are more general than closed formulas.</p>
<p>According to the tutorial, free variables get converted to schematic<br>
variables after a proof (page 7 tutorial.pdf). There is "free variable"<br>
pre-proof, and "free/schematic variable" post-proof.</p>
<p>I was talking about free variables in the mere statement of a theorem,<br>
like,</p>
<p>theorem --"(3)"</p>
<p>"(A | B --&gt;  A)&lt;-&gt;  (!C.!D.(C | D --&gt;  C))"<br>
oops</p>
<p>For (3), I now call the left-hand side a proposition, and I think of it in<br>
terms of propositional logic. I call the right-hand side a closed formula,<br>
and I think of it terms of first-order logic. A proposition does not<br>
necessarily have a definite truth value, whereas a closed formula does.<br>
That's what I showed below with my 5 examples.</p>
<p>So, they do not get quantified, but they have the same "denotation" (that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is to say, they are equivalent under all interpretations.)<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you would appreciate Larry's explanation more than me because I don't<br>
know anything about interpretations. My interpretation is that everything<br>
resolves to a boolean value of either true or false, based on my basic<br>
understanding of logical connectives and quantifiers.</p>

<p>Dear Alfio,</p>
<p>(Another long email, so I put this here at the top. I work out ideas <br>
with these type of emails, but I also consider "involved technical <br>
discussions by text" as acts in frustration. You can have the last word, <br>
if you want the last word. My reply here is long enough to where I don't <br>
even want to read it to proof it one final time.)</p>
<p>First, my logic vocabulary is messed up in a lot of ways, but I also <br>
think we're running into some legitimate vocabulary problems.</p>
<p>(I'd be happy to sit under you in Brasil to help straighten me out, but <br>
Brasil sounds expensive, and I'm not a programmer, I already see my name <br>
too much, so I don't reply to emails like "Re: [isabelle] Eliminating <br>
two quantifiers in structural proof", and say, "Alfio, very useful <br>
examples. Thanks".)</p>
<p>Isabelle/HOL "subsumes", naively or formally, many different formalized <br>
logics. These logics all have a different, though similar, vocabulary, <br>
and two of these logics are propositional logic and first-order logic.</p>
<p>I was taking "sentence" from first-order logic, which is formally <br>
defined to be a formula with no free variables.</p>
<p>For "definite truth value", I meant that no matter what the assignment <br>
of truth values to a sentence's FOL atomic formulas, a FOL sentence has <br>
only one truth value. For a proposition, the truth value of the <br>
proposition may vary depending on the assignment of truth values to its <br>
atomic formulas. You cover those ideas below.</p>
<p>My standard text for propositional and first-order logic is Bilaniuk's <br>
"A Problem Course in Mathematical Logic", from which I have and will <br>
continue to get my vocabulary, one reason is the book is free and <br>
online, and another is that I like his choice of words; below, I refer <br>
to it as "Bilaniuk":</p>
<p><a href="http://euclid.trentu.ca/math/sb/pcml/pcml.html">http://euclid.trentu.ca/math/sb/pcml/pcml.html</a></p>
<p>For this email, I supplement it with this article:</p>
<p><a href="http://logic.stanford.edu/classes/cs157/2011/notes/chap02.html">http://logic.stanford.edu/classes/cs157/2011/notes/chap02.html</a></p>
<p>Continuing with your comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In first-order logic an interpretation assigns meanings only to the syntactic entities [of the<br>
signature or basis]. Meaning of free variables are fixed by the notion of a state, i.e., a function from variables to values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Alfio, now you're at a level of formalism that's not workable for <br>
people with a formal education in mathematics at the undergraduate <br>
level, where I would have an undergraduate_plus level of education. I'm <br>
learning something here, and my use of "interpretation" might be <br>
necessary, but formalism that I can't pass on to lots of other people is <br>
of limited use to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, in first-order logic, any formula that contains [for instance] a<br>
free-variable"x" it is not [be called] a proposition, and it is actually a function(al)<br>
on that free-variable. It can be seen as having the type State=&gt;Bool, where State is a function Vars=&gt;D,  Vars is the set of variables used to build the set of well-formed formulas and D is the domain in question. In this sense, the truth-value of this formula is open. It depends on the value of this free variable. It does not assert anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand what you're saying, but in the context of Isabelle/HOL, <br>
below I argue about "it is not to be called a proposition". (Below, I <br>
see I didn't exactly address that "I can consider open FOL formulas as <br>
propositions".)</p>
<p>I guess we're still talking about this formula, and you're saying it's open:</p>
<p>theorem --"(3)"<br>
   "(A | B --&gt;   A)&lt;-&gt;  (!C.!D.(C | D --&gt;   C))"<br>
oops</p>
<p>I understand that it's open in FOL, but ultimately we're not in FOL, <br>
we're in Isabelle/HOL, and because of this thread and the related <br>
thread, I now consider that I'm mixing propositional logic with <br>
first-order logic. Actually, I now consider that any FOL closed formula <br>
can be considered an atomic formula in propositional logic.</p>
<p>Am I right or wrong? I'm think I'm right enough, and I explain a little <br>
below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, propositional logic is just a sublogic of first-order logic, with no<br>
function symbols and where all predicate symbols have arity zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the traditional view.</p>
<p>But Isabelle/HOL is not traditional mathematics. It's not propositional <br>
logic and it's not first-order logic.</p>
<p>I now depart from the traditional view, and I now consider, as I <br>
mentioned, that FOL sentences (closed formulas, formulas with no free <br>
variables), qualify as propositional atomic formulas (atomic sentences).</p>
<p>(At this point, it is entirely possible that I'm completely confused, <br>
and that I'm repeating what you're already saying.)</p>
<p>You're generalizing so that propositional logic is also first-order <br>
logic.<br>
 On the other hand, I'm generalizing a certain class of FOL <br>
formulas, the closed formulas, so that they are also atomic sentences in <br>
propositional logic.</p>
<p>Atomic sentences merely need be a string of symbols in which I can <br>
definitely say the sentences are either true or false. In Isabelle/HOL, <br>
every FOL closed formula is either true or false (can I be wrong on such <br>
a basic idea?).</p>
<p>Bilaniuk says on page 3,</p>
<p>"Definition 1.1 item (3): Atomic formulas: A_0,..."</p>
<p>"Definition 1.2 item (1): Every atomic formula is a formula."</p>
<p>"The atomic formulas, A_0, A_1, ..., are meant to represent <br>
statements that<br>
       cannot be broken down any further using our connectives, ...'".</p>
<p>Unlike with first-order atomic formulas, I am free to say what my <br>
proposition atomic formulas are, as long as they can be interpreted as <br>
either true or false (wrong again? considering FOL 0-ary predicates?).</p>
<p>The formal development of propositional logic, per Bilaniuk's Definition <br>
1.1 and Definition 1.2, page 3, is completely independent of the formal <br>
development of first-order logic, per Definitions 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, <br>
pages 24, 26, and 27.</p>
<p>I don't even try to figure out how Bilaniuk's first-order logic <br>
definition could be rephrased to use Definitions 1.1 and 1.2, because <br>
that's not what I want.</p>
<p>(Here, I go back and study your last sentence above, rather than just <br>
blow by it.</p>
<p>Definition 5.1 item (5) of  Bilaniuk requires that any FOL language <br>
include the "=" primitive, not to mention the quantifier symbol. <br>
Definition 1.1 doesn't require that a language of propositional logic <br>
have these symbols, so not every language of propositional logic <br>
qualifies as a first-order language.</p>
<p>However, suppose we ignore "=" and "forall" when they're not used. This <br>
gets into my pet peeve about people making the FOL specification <br>
synonymous with a "locked in, defined" language of first-order logic per <br>
the requirement of the FOL specification.</p>
<p>I now extend my pet peeve to the "propositional logic specification" not <br>
being synonymous with a "locked in, defined" language of propositional <br>
logic, where the differences between two languages would be their <br>
specific atomic formulas of Definition 1.1 item (3).</p>
<p>So, how can we assume anything if we haven't stated specifically both <br>
our language of propositional logic and our language of first-order logic?</p>
<p>Okay, I look at the FOL specification again, and it might allow for an <br>
infinite number of predicate symbols, so possibly we could define a FOL <br>
language which contains every other FOL language, and likewise for a <br>
"most generalized" language of propositional logic. That's not my <br>
application, and, by text, I can't thoroughly interrogate you on these <br>
kind of things.</p>
<p>I stop here on this. Writing what I write won't likely get read, so <br>
writing two times the amount is even less likely to get read.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "variables" here are just predicates. Thus, it is<br>
enough to fix an interpretation for these predicates in<br>
order  to have the definite truth-value of the expression. So, from<br>
this point of view, every well-formed expression in propositional logic is<br>
a assertion, i.e., a sentence. That is why,<br>
I think, it can be called propositional or sentential logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we ended up at the same point; but possibly not. I decided that <br>
the complete formula of my (3) above qualified as propositional logic, <br>
but not as first-order logic.</p>
<p>But it comes back to emphasis. I think you're analyzing the formula of <br>
(3) independent of "theorem", and I was analyzing as part of the Isar <br>
command <code>theorem "(A | B --&gt; A) &lt;-&gt; (!C.!D.(C | D --&gt; C))"</code>. So using <br>
your terminology, the formula of (3) doesn't have single truth value <br>
under all interpretations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not sure if this view (as written above) is shared by other people,<br>
though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure that most everyone would have a view, but most everyone won't <br>
have read this far, because involved technical discussions by text <br>
aren't "workable".</p>
<p>You could straighten me out where I'm wrong, but getting completely <br>
straightened out can never happen on an electronic forum. There is no <br>
substitute for locally sitting under the masters, although I've had <br>
plenty of local masters who didn't give me any time.</p>
<p>One more point for anyone listening. Any straightening out must be a <br>
solution that's applicable to the masses, where the masses would be <br>
people with a understanding of 1st and 2nd year university logic along <br>
the lines of Rosen's Discrete Mathematics.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mhhe.com/math/advmath/rosenindex.mhtml">http://www.mhhe.com/math/advmath/rosenindex.mhtml</a></p>
<p>Isabelle requires a more sophisticated understanding of logic than that <br>
level, but requiring too much beyond that will get Isabelle rejected by <br>
the masses, or, better said, books about Isabelle beyond that will be <br>
rejected by the masses.</p>
