<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Christian,</p>
<p>I reply to the easy part first, though important. The other part of your <br>
reply is the important technical part, and I'm still thinking about that <br>
part.</p>
<p>First, I'll make two general statements: (1) There's no good solution. <br>
(2) With Isabelle, I'm out to cater to the market, however I need to do <br>
that.</p>
<p>I have, at times, put a lot of thought into how I should ask code <br>
related questions here. My short answer is usually, "Use ASCII".</p>
<p>Part of the problem is there are two main markets for proof assistants: <br>
the world of mathematics and the world of computer science.</p>
<p>Those in the world of computer science are, by default, programmers. <br>
Those in the world of mathematics, by and large, aren't programmers at <br>
all, or only have basic programming skills; consequently, they can <br>
sometimes be hostile to unsugarcoated things of a programming nature.</p>
<p>Trying to keep this short, I think part of my solution to catering to <br>
the two markets is to create at least two different THYs, along with the <br>
PDFs. But then, I can't attach 4 files to every email sent to this list. <br>
So maybe I'll put them up somewhere on the web and provide links in the <br>
email. I'd have to refine my scripts to create an ASCII version which <br>
isn't completely non-verbose.</p>
<p>In the future, if have more suggestions about how I should give you my <br>
code, please make those suggestions.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>
