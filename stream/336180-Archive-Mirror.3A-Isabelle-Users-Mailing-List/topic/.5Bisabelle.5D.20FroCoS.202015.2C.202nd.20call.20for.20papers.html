<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br>
 The 10th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems<br>
 (FroCoS 2015) will be held in Wroclow, Poland, from September 21 to<br>
 September 24, 2015. Its main goal is to disseminate and promote<br>
 progress in research areas related to the development of techniques<br>
 for the integration, combination, and modularization of formal<br>
 systems together with their analysis.</p>
<p>FroCos 2015 will be co-located with the 23rd International<br>
 Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related<br>
 Methods (TABLEAUX 2015) to be held also on September 21-24, 2015.<br>
 The local organization of both events is handled by Hans de Nivelle.  </p>
<p>SCOPE OF CONFERENCE <br>
 In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation,<br>
 program development and verification, artificial intelligence,<br>
 knowledge representation, and automated reasoning, there is an<br>
 obvious need for using specialized formalisms and inference systems<br>
 for selected tasks. To be usable in practice, these specialized<br>
 systems must be combined with each other and integrated into general<br>
 purpose systems. This has led---in many research areas---to the<br>
 development of techniques and methods for the combination and<br>
 integration of dedicated formal systems, as well as for their<br>
 modularization and analysis.</p>
<p>The International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems<br>
 (FroCoS) traditionally focusses on these types of research questions<br>
 and activities. Like its predecessors, FroCoS 2015 seeks to offer a<br>
 common forum for research in the general area of combination,<br>
 modularization, and integration of systems, with emphasis on<br>
 logic-based ones, and of their practical use.</p>
<p>Typical topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>* combinations of logics (such as higher-order, first-order,<br>
     temporal, modal, description or other non-classical logics);</p>
<p>* combination and integration methods in SAT and SMT solving;<br>
   * combination of decision procedures, satisfiability<br>
     procedures, constraint solving techniques, or logical <br>
     frameworks;</p>
<p>* combinations and modularity in ontologies;<br>
   * integration of equational and other theories into deductive<br>
     systems;</p>
<p>* hybrid methods for deduction, resolution and constraint<br>
     propagation;</p>
<p>* hybrid systems in knowledge representation and natural<br>
     language semantics;</p>
<p>* combined logics for distributed and multi-agent systems;<br>
   * logical aspects of combining and modularizing programs and<br>
     specifications;</p>
<p>* integration of data structures into constraint logic<br>
     programming and deduction;</p>
<p>* combinations and modularity in term rewriting;<br>
   * applications of methods and techniques to the verification and<br>
     analysis of information systems.</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>
 [TO BE ANNOUNCED]</p>
<p>PUBLICATION DETAILS<br>
 The proceedings of the symposium will be published in the<br>
 Springer LNAI/LNCS series.</p>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS<br>
 The program committee seeks high-quality submissions describing<br>
 original work, written in English, not overlapping with published or<br>
 simultaneously submitted work to a journal or conference with<br>
 archival proceedings. Selection criteria include accuracy and<br>
 originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and<br>
 quality of presentation. The page limit in Springer LNCS style is 16<br>
 pages.</p>
<p>Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be<br>
 submitted electronically as PDF files via the EasyChair system at<br>
 the following address:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=frocos2015">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=frocos2015</a>.</p>
<p>For each accepted paper, at least one of the authors is required to<br>
 attend the symposium and present the work. Prospective authors must<br>
 register a title and an abstract ten days before the paper<br>
 submission deadline. Further information about paper submissions is<br>
 available at the conference website that can be found at the<br>
 beginning of this call for papers.</p>
