<p>Call for Papers</p>
<p>7th International Symposium on<br>
            FRONTIERS OF COMBINING SYSTEMS (FroCoS’09)</p>
<p>Trento, Italy, September 16-18th, 2009 <br>
<a href="http://frocos09.disi.unitn.it/">http://frocos09.disi.unitn.it/</a></p>
<p>MOTIVATIONS <br>
In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation,<br>
program development and verification, artificial intelligence, knowledge<br>
representation, and automated reasoning, there is an obvious need for<br>
using specialized formalisms and inference mechanisms for special<br>
tasks. In order to be usable in practice, these specialized systems<br>
must be combined with each other, and they must be integrated into<br>
general purpose systems. The development of general techniques and<br>
methods for the combination and integration of special formally defined<br>
systems, as well as for the analysis and modularization of complex<br>
systems has been initiated in many areas. The International Symposium<br>
on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FROCOS) traditionally focuses on<br>
this type of research questions and activities and aims at promoting<br>
progress in the field. <br>
Like its predecessors, FROCOS’09 wants to offer a common forum for<br>
research activities in the general area of combination, modularization<br>
and integration of systems (with emphasis on logic-based ones), and of<br>
their practical use.  </p>
<p>RELEVANT TOPICS <br>
Typical topics of interest include (but are not limited to): </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>combinations of logics such as combined predicate, temporal, modal,<br>
  or epistemic logics;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>combinations and modularity in ontologies; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>combination of decision procedures, of satisfiability procedures,<br>
  and of CS techniques;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>combinations and modularity in term rewriting; </p>
</li>
<li>integration of equational and other theories into deductive systems; </li>
<li>combination of deduction systems and computer algebra; </li>
<li>integration of data structures into CLP formalisms and deduction processes; </li>
<li>hybrid methods for deduction, resolution and constraint propagation; </li>
<li>hybrid systems in knowledge representation and natural language semantics; </li>
<li>combined logics for distributed and multi-agent systems; </li>
<li>logical aspects of combining and modularizing programs and specifications. </li>
</ul>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSION <br>
Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in<br>
English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been<br>
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a<br>
conference with refereed proceedings. Selection criteria include<br>
accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and significance of<br>
results, and quality of presentation. All submissions will be subject<br>
to academic peer review by at least three members of the program<br>
committee. For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to<br>
attend the conference to present the paper. <br>
Papers must be edited in LTEX and be submitted electronically as PDF<br>
files via the EasyChair system:<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=frocos09">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=frocos09</a>. <br>
Prospective authors are required to register a title and an abstract a<br>
week before the paper submission deadline (see below). <br>
Further information about paper submission will be made available at<br>
FROCOS’09 web page. </p>
<p>PROCEEDINGS <br>
The proceedings of FroCoS’09 will be published by Springer-Verlag in<br>
the LNAI/LNCS series. </p>
