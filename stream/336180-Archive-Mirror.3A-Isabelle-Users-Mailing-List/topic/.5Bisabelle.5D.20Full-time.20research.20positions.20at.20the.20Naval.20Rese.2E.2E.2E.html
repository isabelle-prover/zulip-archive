Full-Time Computer Scientist Positions<br>
(US Citizens only)<br>
Naval Research Laboratory<br>
Center for High Assurance Computer Systems<br>
Washington, DC 20375</p>
<p>The Software Engineering Section of NRL’s Center for High Assurance <br>
Computer Systems is looking to hire full-time, permanent members for its <br>
research staff. Persons hired will initially support ongoing funded <br>
efforts in the section, but will eventually be expected to develop, and <br>
obtain funding for, their own research programs.</p>
<p>The objective of the section’s research program is to develop formal, <br>
mathematically based methods, models, algorithms, theories, and tools <br>
supporting both the construction and analysis of software at different <br>
levels of abstraction, from requirements through code. Such methods and <br>
tools provide vital support for the development of high assurance <br>
software for systems, such as autonomous systems, security systems and <br>
devices, and control software, that must satisfy critical system <br>
properties such as safety, timing, fault tolerance, and security. Many <br>
of the formal-methods-based techniques and tools produced in the <br>
Section’s past research have been applied to real Navy systems.</p>
<p>Current research in the section includes:</p>
<p>Application-Specific Security of Source Code: This project is developing <br>
theory, methods, and tools for analyzing source code for <br>
application-specific security properties such as data separation, <br>
absence of undesirable information flows, nonbypassability of critical <br>
code, and proper memory sanitization. The research combines <br>
template-based specification of security properties with automatic <br>
generation and checking of assertions to verify that code satisfies the <br>
specified properties and to detect violations of those properties.</p>
<p>High Assurance Cyber-Physical Systems:This project is developing new <br>
theory, methods, and tools for model-based development of cyber-physical <br>
systems.All methods and tools developed in the project will be <br>
demonstrated on real systems, which may include unmanned vehicles and <br>
robots.</p>
<p>Applications of Formal Methods in Developing Real Critical Systems:</p>
<p>(1) Robotics: Formal-methods-based modeling and analysis techniques and <br>
tools are being applied to critical software components of a robot <br>
designed to service satellites in space. In addition to applying <br>
well-established formal analysis methods and tools, new analysis <br>
techniques and tools are being developed to provide assurance that the <br>
robot behaves safely and functions correctly.</p>
<p>(2) Secure Systems: Formal analysis methods and tools are being <br>
developed and applied to critical aspects of a framework for <br>
self-securing systems.</p>

<p>Interested candidates should send a CV and cover letter to Dr. Elizabeth <br>
Leonard (<a href="mailto:elizabeth.leonard@nrl.navy.mil">elizabeth.leonard@nrl.navy.mil</a>). Please indicate in your email <br>
that you are applying for a fulltime, permanent position.</p>
