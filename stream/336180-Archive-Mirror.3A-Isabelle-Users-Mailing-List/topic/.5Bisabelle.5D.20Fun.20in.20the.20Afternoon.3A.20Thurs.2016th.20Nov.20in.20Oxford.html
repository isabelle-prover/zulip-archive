<p>From: <a href="mailto:Jeremy.Gibbons@comlab.ox.ac.uk">Jeremy.Gibbons@comlab.ox.ac.uk</a><br>
Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>Graham Hutton and Conor McBride at Nottingham and I are organizing a termly<br>
seminar "Fun in the Afternoon" on functional programming and related<br>
topics. The idea is to have a small number of talks as an antidote to<br>
mid-term blues, three afternoons a year. The hope is that talks will be<br>
informal and fun, and that there will be plenty of scope for discussion and<br>
chat as well. </p>
<p>Fun in the Afternoon will be peripatetic. The first meeting will be in<br>
Oxford University Computing Laboratory on Thursday 16th November, and Phil<br>
Wadler of the University of Edinburgh will be opening proceedings. All are<br>
welcome, but if you'd like to come, could you please drop me (Jeremy<br>
Gibbons) a line so that I have an idea of numbers?</p>
<p>If you'd like to give a talk, please also propose a title and a duration.</p>
<p>We haven't yet fixed the timetable, because it depends in part on what<br>
offers of talks we get. But our current plan is to have talks 14:00-14:45<br>
and 15:30-17:00. Brings sandwiches to eat together beforehand, and join us<br>
for drinks in a pub afterwards.</p>

<p>This page also explains how to subscribe to the mailing list, to which all<br>
further announcements will be sent. Directions to OUCL are at</p>
