Two Funded PhD Positions at University of Edinburgh<br>
     Formal Verification of Security Properties for ARM Microcontrollers</p>
<p>We invite applications for two fully-funded PhD studentships to study the <br>
formal specification and verification of security features for systems built <br>
using ARM microcontrollers.</p>
<p>Deadline:    31st July 2017 or until posts filled<br>
Starting date:   Flexible (usual entry Sept 2017/Jan 2018)<br>
Studentship:     Full tuition fees for UK/EU students, 3.5 years<br>
                  Stipend of approximately £14,000 per year<br>
                  Additional £3,500 per year and ARM internship<br>
Requirements:    Good degree, BSC in Computer Science or similar (2.1 minimum)<br>
                  Aptitude for subject area (logic, semantics, theorem proving)</p>
<p>For non UK/EU students, additional fees apply.  Scholarships to cover the <br>
additional fees are not generally available.</p>
<p>The positions are held in the Centre for Doctoral Training in Pervasive <br>
Parallelism at the University of Edinburgh and as part of the Security and <br>
Privacy group in Informatics.</p>
<p>See below for descriptions of the projects.  Details of the research are <br>
flexible depending on the candidate's interests and background, and ARM's <br>
progress and priorities at the time of starting.</p>

Privacy group go to:</p>

<p>Formal Specification and Proofs for TrustZone in ARMv8-M</p>
<hr>
<p>The increasing complexity and connectivity in microcontroller devices has <br>
prompted the development of protection mechanisms to improve reliability and <br>
security. ARM's TrustZone for ARMv8-M provides a separate "secure world" <br>
execution mode to enable features such as secure firmware updates, safe <br>
integration of code from multiple suppliers and controlled access to <br>
privileged peripherals. It is designed in a different way to TrustZone on <br>
other ARM architectures, with greater hardware support for resource-light <br>
microcontrollers.</p>
<p>This project will study the low-level instruction set design of TrustZone for <br>
ARMv8-M, creating formal specifications to describe the security properties <br>
that hold at the instruction level and proofs that these provide the intended <br>
protection against low-level attacks. The specifications will also aim to <br>
provide a basis for higher-level proofs about the security properties of <br>
software that runs in the secure world.</p>
<p>Formal Verification of Security Properties of the mbed OS uVisor</p>
<hr>
<p>The mbed OS uVisor is a core security component for ARM's mbed IoT platform. <br>
It creates isolated security domains on Cortex M3, M4 and M7 microcontrollers <br>
with a Memory Protection Unit (MPU). The MPU provides a small number of memory <br>
regions of limited size. On top of these the uVisor provides a more flexible <br>
compartmentalisation using separate security domains ("Secure Boxes"), <br>
configured with suitable Access Control Lists.</p>
<p>This project will apply machine-assisted theorem-proving to help define and <br>
then verify correctness and security properties of the uVisor implementation. <br>
This will build on previous work that has constructed instruction set models <br>
and decompilation techniques, and extend it with formal modelling of exception <br>
handling and memory protection. Example verification goals include correctness <br>
aspects, such as ensuring that MPU regions get correctly reallocated on demand <br>
(ensuring progress/availability), or higher-level properties such as <br>
control-flow integrity (ensuring certain attacks are not possible in client <br>
code).</p>
<p>About the University of Edinburgh</p>
<hr>
<p>The University of Edinburgh School of Informatics brings together world-class <br>
research groups in computer science, artificial intelligence and cognitive <br>
science.  It is the largest Informatics or Computer Science department in <br>
Europe.  It houses a number of specialised centres and subgroups, including <br>
the ARM Centre of Excellence working on a number of collaborations.  The <br>
Security and Privacy group is forms the core of the University's Academic <br>
Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research, which one recognition in <br>
2017.</p>
<p>We welcome applications from members of groups traditionally under-represented <br>
in the field.  In 2013 (renewed 2016), the School of Informatics received an <br>
Athena Swan Silver Award, in recognition of its commitment to advancing the <br>
careers of women in science, technology, engineering, maths and medicine <br>
(STEMM) employment in higher education and research.</p>
