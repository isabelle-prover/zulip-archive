Funding is available for the following PhD studentships within<br>
the TCS group at the University of Kent. Applicants should contact the<br>
project supervisor directly for further details.</p>
<p>Project Supervisor: Dr Olaf Chitil (<a href="mailto:O.Chitil@kent.ac.uk">O.Chitil@kent.ac.uk</a>)<br>
Project Title: Tracing Functional Programs with Hat</p>
<p>Hat (<a href="http://www.haskell.org/hat">www.haskell.org/hat</a>) is a sophisticated tool for locating faults in<br>
Haskell programs. Hat consists of a trace generation system plus various<br>
tools for viewing a trace. The aim of the research project is to improve<br>
Hat by both extending it and easing its application in practise: (1)<br>
Apply several theoretical results of a recent EPSRC project on tracing<br>
in Hat (e.g. algorithmic debugging with functions as finite maps). (2)<br>
Integrate the trace generator of Hat into the byte code interpreter<br>
of the Glasgow Haskell system (GHC). (3) Enable traced code to call<br>
and be called from unmodified non-tracing code, such that Hat can use<br>
pre-compiled libraries of GHC.</p>
<p>Project Title: The Essence of Transfinite Reductions<br>
Project Supervisor: Dr Stefan Kahrs (<a href="mailto:S.M.Kahrs@kent.ac.uk">S.M.Kahrs@kent.ac.uk</a>)</p>
<p>Infinitary Rewriting is an area of Term Rewriting in which research has<br>
studied infinitary terms and infinitary reductions. While the notion of<br>
infinitary terms is fairly settled, the existing notions of infinitary<br>
reduction leave a lot to be desired - the definitions are suspiciously<br>
complicated, the established results less than impressive. Thus, there<br>
appears to be a lot of room for improvement. There are different angles<br>
that are worth exploring. Firstly, there are several alternative ways<br>
to define transfinite reductions. Secondly, one would hope that some of<br>
these alternative ways lead to good properties of transfinite reduction.<br>
Thirdly, it is not even a priori clear what would constitute such a<br>
good property.</p>
<p>Project Title: Refactoring Proofs<br>
Project Supervisor: Prof Simon Thompson (<a href="mailto:S.J.Thompson@kent.ac.uk">S.J.Thompson@kent.ac.uk</a>)</p>
<p>Refactoring allows the programmer to modify the design or structure of<br>
a program without changing its behaviour. Recent work in the Functional<br>
Programming group at Kent has developed refactoring systems for Haskell 98<br>
(HaRe) and Erlang (Wrangler). Programming and proof have much in common,<br>
and indeed under the "propositions as types" analogy, they are different<br>
views of the same objects. The aim of this project is to explore how<br>
refactoring can be incorporated into proof development systems, and will<br>
combine theoretical work, implementation and usability analysis to ensure<br>
that the results will be of value to users of proof assistants. The aim<br>
of this project is to investigate refactoring for proofs.</p>
