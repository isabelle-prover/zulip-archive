<p>From: Jeremy Avigad &lt;<a href="mailto:avigad@cmu.edu">avigad@cmu.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle users,</p>
<p>Harvey Friedman asked me to post the announcement below.</p>
<p>Jeremy</p>

<p>Subject: Grant Opportunity: Foundational Questions in the Mathematical<br>
Sciences</p>
<p>There is a grant opportunity in (A) foundations of: mathematics,<br>
mathematical sciences, computer science; (B) artificial intelligence;<br>
(C) and related fields. The John Templeton Foundation accepts research<br>
proposals that directly or indirectly address the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) What are the limits of mathematics in advancing human knowledge?</p>
<p>(2) What have the difficulties of AI taught us about the nature of<br>
mind and intelligence?</p>
<p>Deadline for the initial inquiry is April 15, 2010. Please feel free<br>
to pass the information on to others who might be interested in the<br>
grant opportunity.</p>
<p>For more information, please view the PDF announcement <br>

<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Grant Program is co-chaired by Barry Cooper and myself, with Barry<br>
focused on the AI component, and myself focused on the LIMITS OF<br>
MATHEMATICS component.</p>
<p>I have chosen to add some additional information that may be of some<br>
use in your decision to make an initial inquiry by April 15, 2010.</p>
<p>With regard to question (1): we are interested in funding selected<br>
research projects that address (1) directly or indirectly. Here is a<br>
sample of some research thrusts that are of interest. But feel free to<br>
propose your own ideas that genuinely address (1) directly or<br>
indirectly, in ways not included in A-E below. Proposals will be<br>
judged according to their relevance to (1), their conceptual and<br>
technical soundness, and their feasibility.</p>
<p>A. Limits of mathematics within mathematics. This includes exploring<br>
the boundary of algorithmic decidability/undecidability of basic<br>
mathematical problems. This also includes explorations into the<br>
boundary of provability and unprovability of basic mathematical<br>
problems within fundamental formal systems. These are well explored<br>
areas, so we will emphasis the development of novel ideas.</p>
<p>B. Limits of mathematics within biology and physics. This includes<br>
investigations as in A above, but related to the behavior of idealized<br>
biological and physical systems. The level of biological and physical<br>
realism is of particular interest.</p>
<p>C. Limits of mathematics within probability and statistics. This<br>
includes investigations into the logical foundations of probability<br>
and statistics of the kind that can be used to address limits of<br>
mathematics.</p>
<p>D. Limits of computation in mathematical modeling. This includes<br>
investigations into the limits of computational methods in<br>
approximating physical reality due to round off, instability, and so<br>
forth.</p>
<p>E. Limits of mathematics within mathematical economics. This includes<br>
investigations into limits of computational methods and decidability/<br>
provability in the realm of game theory and models of economic behavior.</p>
<p>F. Limits of certainty in mathematics. This includes practical and<br>
theoretical investigations into just how certain we are or can be<br>
about mathematical assertions.</p>
<p>G. Limits of certainty in software. This includes practical and<br>
theoretical investigations into how certain we are or can be that<br>
software meets mathematical requirements.</p>
