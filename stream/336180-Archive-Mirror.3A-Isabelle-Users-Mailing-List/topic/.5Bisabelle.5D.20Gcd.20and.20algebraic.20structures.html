<p>From: Jose Divasón &lt;<a href="mailto:jose.divasonm@unirioja.es">jose.divasonm@unirioja.es</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>I would like to formalise some linear algebra structures, such as principal<br>
ideal rings, principal ideal domains, unique factorization domains and so<br>
on.</p>
<p>As part of those structures, there exist some basic operations over rings<br>
such as gcd and div, which are already implemented in the Isabelle library.<br>
For instance, there is a class gcd in the library which has been<br>
instantiated by int and nat:</p>
<p>class gcd = zero + one + dvd +<br>
  fixes gcd :: "'a =&gt; 'a =&gt; 'a"<br>
    and lcm :: "'a =&gt; 'a =&gt; 'a"</p>
<p>begin</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this class seems to me somehow strange, because it doesn’t<br>
fix any property about gcd and lcm, so it could be instantiated by almost<br>
anything.</p>
<p>Moreover, the notion of greatest common divisor can be properly defined in<br>
commutative rings, and also in principal ideal rings, although in general<br>
there need not exist just one for every pair of elements.</p>
<p>My doubt is how to include that concept in the principal ideal ring class<br>
that I’m formalising.</p>
<p>I think that there are (at least) three options:</p>
<p>1.- “Forget” the gcd class that exists in the library and define gcd inside<br>
my class:</p>
<p>class pir = comm_ring_1 + assumes all_ideal_is_principal: "∀I. ideal I ⟶<br>
principal_ideal I"</p>
<p>begin</p>
<p>definition "gcd_pir a b = ....."</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>2.- Define a class called “pir_gcd”, extending gcd and assuming what gcd<br>
must satisfy.</p>
<p>class pir_gcd = comm_ring_1 + gcd + assumes all_ideal_is_principal: "∀I.<br>
ideal I ⟶ principal_ideal I"  and "∀a b. gcd a b = ..." and "∀a b. lcm a b<br>
= ..."</p>
<p>3.- Option 1 + interpretations/sublocales.</p>
<p>class pir = comm_ring_1 + assumes all_ideal_is_principal: "∀I. ideal I ⟶<br>
principal_ideal I"</p>
<p>begin</p>
<p>definition "gcd_pir a b = ....."</p>
<p>definition "lcm_pir a b = ....."</p>
<p>interpretation gcd "0::'a" 1 "times::'a=&gt;'a=&gt;'a" "gcd_pir" "lcm_pir" .</p>
<p>sublocale gcd "0::'a" 1 "times::'a=&gt;'a=&gt;'a" "gcd_pir" "lcm_pir" .</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>By the way, what is the difference between interpretation and sublocale in<br>
this context?</p>
<p>Which is the recommended option? At first I though that it was the last<br>
one, but then I wondered why the second one has been used in the library<br>
(there are two classes: semiring and semiring_div in the library instead of<br>
only one of them).</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Jose</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hallo,</p>
<p>syntactic type classes such as this are not unusual. They allow<br>
overloading of constants (such as 0, +, *, gcd, …) without restricting<br>
the way in which these constants can be used. In case of gcd, I think<br>
one could make a good argument for assuming basic facts about GCDs in<br>
the type class.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to generalise the GCD, I would recommend you<br>
completely ignore the current GCD theory and the gcd type class, because<br>
it already defines a gcd on e.g. the natural numbers and the integers,<br>
and your more general formalisation will probably also yield some GCD<br>
implementation on the natural numbers and integers – resulting in a<br>
clash of these two definitions.</p>
<p>GCDs are only unique (modulo association) in integral domains, and only<br>
guaranteed to exist in factorial rings (UIDs). Therefore, I would<br>
recommend that you introduce a predicate is_gcd a b :: 'a =&gt; 'a =&gt; 'a =&gt;<br>
bool for commutative rings in order to handle the situation of multiple<br>
(or no) GCDs. Then you can introduce a function gcd :: 'a =&gt; 'a =&gt; 'a<br>
for integral domains, yielding a normalised GCD if it exists and<br>
undefined (or 0 or 1 or whatever) otherwise, and for factorial rings,<br>
you can then actually prove that this gcd function is “total”, i.e. it<br>
always returns a GCD.</p>
<p>For normalisation, the approach that I took in my formalisation of<br>
Euclidean rings was to define a function called normalisation_factor ::<br>
'a =&gt; 'a, which returns a unit such that dividing any element of the<br>
ring by that unit yields the same result for all elements in the same<br>
association class, effectively normalising the element. E.g. for<br>
integers, the normalisation factor is the sign of the number; for<br>
polynomials, it is the leading coefficient.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Manuel</p>

<p>From: Florian Haftmann &lt;<a href="mailto:florian.haftmann@informatik.tu-muenchen.de">florian.haftmann@informatik.tu-muenchen.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Jose,</p>
<p>your are actually stumbling over the issue that HOL so far does not<br>
really provide a hierarchy of type classes for divisibility in rings<br>
(say, factorial ring, euclidean ring etc.)</p>
<p>Here my thoughts of what can be done with reasonable effort at the moment</p>
<p>1) The syntactic gcd type class.</p>
<p>Cf. also Manuel's mail.  Syntactic type classes can also be seen as an<br>
instance of the traditional »worse is better« philosophy of UNIX: if you<br>
do not know how to provide the right policy, restrict yourself to<br>
provide a mechanisms while leaving the user to provide its own policy on<br>
his own.</p>
<p>2) A fundamental algebraic type class for GCD.</p>
<p>IMHO this could look like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>class semiring_gcd = semiring + gcd +<br>
  assumes "gcd a b dvd a"<br>
  assumes "gcd a b dvd b"<br>
  assumes "c dvd a ⟹ c dvd b ⟹ c dvd gcd a b"</p>
<p>class ring_gcd = ring + semiring_gcd</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remarks:</p>
<p>a) I strongly believe the assumptions capture the essence of gcd,<br>
whatever the underlying structure is.</p>
<p>b) Whenever you develop type class hierarchies for ring structures, you<br>
always have a semiring (the additive structure is a monoid, not a group)<br>
and a ring.  The semiring part of the hierarchy is to accommodate the<br>
natural numbers (which, in algebra, appear not be that natural after all).</p>
<p>c) Here I have chosen »semiring«/»ring« as a base point.  Maybe gcd<br>
itself suggests are more specific entry point to start with already, but<br>
I have found no argument to do so (maybe you would do after some rounds<br>
of experimenting and thinking).</p>
<p>d) The specification implicitly states<br>
  I. the a gcd exists<br>
  II. that is is functional, i.e. normalising wrt. to units<br>
But it does not assume anything how this normalisation actually looks<br>
like, i.e. concrete instances are free to normalise in a specific way.</p>
<p>3) Specific instances for GCD in more specific algebraic structures</p>
<p>a) e.g. for euclidean rings</p>
<p>class euclidean_(semi)ring = …<br>
begin</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>definition gcd_eucl where … -- ‹definition via euclidean algorithm›</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>class euclidean_(semi)ring_gcd = euclidean_(semi)ring + gcd<br>
  assumes "gcd = gcd_eucl"<br>
begin</p>
<p>subclass (semi)ring_gcd<br>
  …</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Note that this work has already been done by Manuel, but is not yet part<br>
of Isabelle2014.  If you want to build on that, we will find a suitable<br>
way without need to participate in the ongoing Isabelle development.</p>
<p>b) e.g. for factorial rings</p>
<p>class factorial_(semi)ring = …<br>
begin</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>definition factorization :: "'a =&gt; 'a mulitset" where …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>class factorial_(semi)ring_gcd = factorial_(semi)ring + gcd<br>
  assumes "gcd a b = msetprod (factorization a + factorization b)"<br>
begin</p>
<p>subclass (semi)ring_gcd<br>
  …</p>
<p>end</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the way, what is the difference between interpretation and sublocale in<br>
this context?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>»interpretation« pulls in facts into the current target context, which<br>
is closed at the final »end« – »confined interpretation«.</p>
<p>»sublocale« establishes a permanent connection.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Maybe any (semi)ring_gcd is also a factorial_(semi)ring?</p>
<p>The direction &lt;-- is obvious.  For --&gt; I am uncertain.<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor</a> (section »The gcd<br>
in commutative rings«) suggests that it does not hold in general.  It<br>
also suggests that the base structure should be (sem)idom (integral<br>
domain) rather than plain (semi)ring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GCDs are only unique (modulo association) in integral domains, and only<br>

you can then actually prove that this gcd function is “total”, i.e. it<br>
always returns a GCD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would not recommend to follow this approach from my current<br>
perspective.  Generally, it is best practice that algebraic type classes<br>
are not a device to speculate about (unique) existence of certain<br>
operations etc, but simply have such operations as parameters and<br>
postulate certain properties of them.  For everything more general, it<br>
is usually more suitable to follow HOL-Algebra with its locale hierarchy<br>
with explicit carrier etc. which allows to develop real meta-theory.<br>
This fundamental best practice distinction is a regularly re-occurring<br>
issue on this mailing list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For normalisation, the approach that I took in my formalisation of<br>
Euclidean rings was to define a function called normalisation_factor ::<br>
'a =&gt; 'a, which returns a unit such that dividing any element of the<br>

association class, effectively normalising the element. E.g. for<br>
integers, the normalisation factor is the sign of the number; for<br>
polynomials, it is the leading coefficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deeper reason why we have to burden ourselves with normalisation at<br>
all is the matter of equality vs. equivalence.</p>
<p>Ideally, gcd is only determined up to equivalence wrt. divisibility,<br>
e.g. (n.b. for suggestiveness I am using infix syntax here):</p>
<p>a gcd b ≈ b gcd a</p>
<p>where (a ≈ b ⟷ a dvd b ∧ b dvd a)</p>
<p>Automation support for equivalence reasoning in Isabelle however is<br>
poor.  Hence we prefer proper equality</p>
<p>a gcd b = b gcd a</p>
<p>This requires a normalisation.  There are different ways to express this<br>
idea, here I will use</p>
<p>norm :: α ⇒ α<br>
  norm_unit :: α ⇒ α</p>
<p>such that a = norm a * norm_unit a<br>
with norm (norm_unit a) = 1<br>
and norm_unit (norm a) = 1<br>
and norm_unit a dvd 1<br>
(maybe further properties are required also).</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>a gcd b = (norm a * norm_unit a) gcd (norm b * norm_unit b) =<br>
    u * (norm a gcd norm b)</p>
<p>where (norm a gcd norm b) is the essential gcd on normalised values and<br>
u is a unit factor.  How to choose u?  Manuel's suggestion is to choose<br>
u = 1.  What I consider unsatisfying then is that</p>
<p>a gcd a = norm a<br>
  – but not necessarily a gcd a = a</p>
<p>Hence we cannot establish that gcd forms a lattice.</p>
<p>Can we choose a better u?  I am not sure.  But what I am thinking of is<br>
to provide an explicit »micro lattice« (_ inf _) for the units in the<br>
underlying ring structure.  Hence,</p>
<p>a gcd b = (norm a * norm_unit a) gcd (norm b * norm_unit b) =<br>
    (norm_unit a inf norm_unit b) * (norm a gcd norm b)</p>
<p>which would maintain the lattice property.</p>
<p>How to choose (_ inf _) then?  Maybe there is no general principle, but<br>
here some examples:</p>
<p>for nat:<br>
    _ inf _ = 1 (trivially)<br>
  for int:<br>
    every unit is (-1) ^ n for n in {1, 2}<br>
    (-1) ^ m inf (-1) ^ n = (-1) ^ (m max n) (prefer positive values)<br>
  for ℤ + iℤ (gauss numbers):<br>
    every unit is i ^ n for n in {1, 2, 3, 4}<br>
    i ^ m inf i ^ n = i ^ (m max n) (prefer positive values)<br>
  for K[x] (polynomials over a field):<br>
    every unit is in K<br>
    here we must assume a lattice on K<br>
    uncertain how this would look like in the general case;<br>
    for reals, we can use the canonical ordering;<br>
    what about gauss numbers?  maybe polar coordinates?</p>
<p>Looks a little bit artificial.  But maybe it is the »Isabelle overhead«<br>
to get a practically usable system.</p>
<p>Just a few thoughs,<br>

<p>1) A characterisation of a factorial ring.</p>
<p>May sth. like this:</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe any (semi)ring_gcd is also a factorial_(semi)ring?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Maybe --&gt; holds since the given specification for (semi)ring_gcd demands<br>
that every two elements have a gcd.  From this it might follow that<br>
unique factors can be carved out using iterative gcd computations (I<br>
have once seen such a proof for the natural numbers, but I don't know<br>
whether this generalizes).</p>

Hi José,</p>
<p>after studying your answers I would recommend that you should follow the<br>
approach in HOL-Algebra, i.e. use locales with explicit carriers.</p>
<p>Using type classes has a somehow inherent bias toward totality, e.g.<br>
class idom assumes that the whole type (except 0, of course) forms an<br>
integral domain.  What you want is the real algebraic notion where an<br>
integral domain is a subset of a bigger domain (aka type).  Here it is<br>
where the explicit carriers come in.  Similar for gcd also.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>

Thanks for all answers,</p>

<a href="mailto:florian.haftmann@informatik.tu-muenchen.de">florian.haftmann@informatik.tu-muenchen.de</a>&gt;:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we would prefer to avoid HOL-Algebra: our final goal is to<br>
formalise some well-known algorithms to obtain canonical forms of matrices<br>
over principal ideal rings (echelon forms, Hermite) and generate code of<br>
them*. To do that, we have already developed some infrastructure in the<br>
HOL-Multivariate Analysis library (and its representation of matrices) that<br>
we would like to reuse.</p>
<p>Defining a gcd in an arbitrary ring could be cumbersome working with<br>
structures represented by type classes. Nevertheless, we are mainly<br>
interested in working on principal ideal rings, where any two elements have<br>
a gcd. Hence, gcd would be a total function, and appropriate for a type<br>
class representation. We just wanted to take the chance to implement some<br>
additional Abstract Algebra (commutative rings, integral domains) in a<br>
proper way (including operations such as gcd), but maybe we will have to<br>
reshape this goal.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as far as we know in GCD Domain, Principal Ideal Ring,<br>
Principal Ideal Domain, Factorial Domain and Euclidean Domain, which are<br>
the structures where we plan to work, gcd is a total function.</p>
<p>I will go on thinking about it,</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Jose</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of these algorithms need to compute gcds or Bézout’s identity. As<br>
far as I know, these algorithms could be defined and formalized over a<br>
principal ideal ring, but they wouldn’t be executable if we don’t provide<br>
an executable gcd function. Nevertheless, they would be executable on<br>
matrices whose coefficients belong to an euclidean domain (by means of a<br>
computable euclidean algorithm).</li>

Hi Jose,</p>
<p>ok, this sounds indeed that you should go for type classes.  In case,<br>
others can then use work and generalize it.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

Thank you both,</p>

<p>I knew this kind of classes are not unusual for elements and operations<br>
which characterise the structure, such as 0, 1, + and *. But, from my point<br>
of view, gcd is not part of the definition of the structure ring.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You are completely right. As you say, GCDs can exist in a commutative ring<br>
(but not for every two elements). They are unique (modulo association) when<br>
they exist in integral domains and any two elements of a UFD have a gcd.</p>

<p>integers, the normalisation factor is the sign of the number; for</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>polynomials, it is the leading coefficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, in your formalization I have seen you fix the euclidean size in<br>
the euclidean_semiring class. However, a Euclidean domain will admit many<br>
different euclidean size functions (in<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_domain">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_domain</a> it is suggested that a<br>
particular Euclidean function f is not part of the structure of a Euclidean<br>
domain). Would it be possible to define that class this way? Could there be<br>
any potential drawbacks?</p>
<p>class euclidean_semiring = … +</p>
<p>assumes exists_euclidean_size: "∃f::'a =&gt; nat. ∀a b. b≠0 ⟶ (∃q r. a = b*q +<br>
r ∧ (r=0 ∨ f r &lt; f b))"</p>
<p>But if one uses this way of defining the euclidean_semiring class, then it<br>
would not be possible to get direct executability (because the<br>
euclidean_size would not be instantiated). Anyway, with your definition it<br>
would be possible to work with different euclidean sizes of the same<br>
structure if the instantiations are done in independent files. I don’t know<br>
which option is more suitable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) A fundamental algebraic type class for GCD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMHO this could look like:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>class semiring_gcd = semiring + gcd +</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>assumes "gcd a b dvd a"</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>class ring_gcd = ring + semiring_gcd</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this class defines semirings where every two elements have a gcd,<br>
isn’t it? GCD Domain (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCD_domain">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCD_domain</a>) is the most<br>
similar structure that I have seen in the literature. I would like to deal<br>
with the case of gcd in commutative rings (where gcd exists, but not for<br>
every pair of elements).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) I strongly believe the assumptions capture the essence of gcd,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>whatever the underlying structure is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your assumptions seem good to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>b) Whenever you develop type class hierarchies for ring structures, you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>always have a semiring (the additive structure is a monoid, not a group)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and a ring.  The semiring part of the hierarchy is to accommodate the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>natural numbers (which, in algebra, appear not be that natural after all).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good point because I was going to work above all with principal<br>
ideal rings (and natural numbers aren’t), thank you for remarking it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>c) Here I have chosen »semiring«/»ring« as a base point.  Maybe gcd</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>itself suggests a more specific entry point to start with already, but</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have found no argument to do so (maybe you would do after some rounds</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of experimenting and thinking).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion it is a good base point, although as you say it can change<br>
when developing. Anyway, GCD Domain is the structure that usually appears<br>
in the literature to refer a ring where every two elements have a gcd.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>d) The specification implicitly states</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I. the a gcd exists</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then such a class formalises a structure where any two elements have a<br>
gcd, which is not true for arbitrary rings. So, if we want to work with<br>
structures (such as commutative rings) where two elements could not have<br>
always a gcd, should we define a gcd inside the class instead of fixing it<br>
in the class? Maybe should gcd have type “ ‘a =&gt; ‘a =&gt; ‘a option ”?</p>
<p>But in the case we are working with structures where every two elements<br>
have a gcd, then fixing a gcd in the class seems to be the best option.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this work has already been done by Manuel, but is not yet part</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>of Isabelle2014.  If you want to build on that, we will find a suitable</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>way without need to participate in the ongoing Isabelle development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was talking with Manuel and I already have the file of his development<br>
(Euclidean_Algorithm.thy in the repository version of Isabelle).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe any (semi)ring_gcd is also a factorial_(semi)ring?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The direction &lt;-- is obvious.  For --&gt; I am uncertain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor</a> (section »The gcd</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in commutative rings«) suggests that it does not hold in general.  It</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>also suggests that the base structure should be (sem)idom (integral</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>domain) rather than plain (semi)ring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if the base structure is an integral domain, then we could not deal<br>
with gcd in the natural numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even more thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) A characterisation of a factorial ring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May sth. like this:<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>class factorial_(semi)ring = (sem)idom +</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fixes is_prime :: "α ⇒ bool"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>assumes "(⋀a. a dvd p ⟹ a dvd 1 ∨ p dvd a) ⟹ is_prime p</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>assumes "is_prime p ⟹ a dvd p ⟹ a dvd 1 ∨ p dvd a"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>assumes "(⋀a b. p dvd a * b ⟹ p dvd a ∨ p dvd b) ⟹ is_prime p</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>assumes "is_prime p ⟹ p dvd a * b ⟹ p dvd a ∨ p dvd b"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why should is_prime be fixed in the structure? Prime elements (and<br>
irreducible elements) exist in a commutative ring. I have seen that in<br>
Isabelle2013-2 there was a class called “prime” similar to the gcd one:</p>
<p>class prime = one +</p>
<p>fixes prime :: "'a ⇒ bool"</p>
<p>But it has disappeared in Isabelle2014.</p>
<p>That is why at first I thought that defining gcd inside the class semiring<br>
was the best option, instead of creating a new class semiring_gcd (even if<br>
semiring_gcd would implicitly assume that every two elements have a gcd).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe --&gt; holds since the given specification for (semi)ring_gcd demands</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that every two elements have a gcd.  From this it might follow that</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>unique factors can be carved out using iterative gcd computations (I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>have once seen such a proof for the natural numbers, but I don't know</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>whether this generalizes).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe --&gt; doesn’t hold because it would be necessary the “ascending chain<br>
condition on principal ideals”. At least, for domains it is that way (see<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCD_domain">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCD_domain</a>, where it is said that “an integral<br>
domain is a UFD if and only if it is a GCD domain satisfying the<br>
&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_chain_condition_on_principal_ideals&gt;ascending">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_chain_condition_on_principal_ideals&gt;ascending</a><br>
chain condition on principal ideals”).</p>
<p>Still the problem of how to define normalisation properly is not addressed,<br>
but it could be similar to the ones of gcd and prime.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Jose</p>
