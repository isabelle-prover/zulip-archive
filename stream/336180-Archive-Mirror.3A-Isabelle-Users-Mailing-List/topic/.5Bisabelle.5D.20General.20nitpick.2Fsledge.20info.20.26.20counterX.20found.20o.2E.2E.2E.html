<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
First, I ask a straightforward question.</p>
<p>If I declare a type, such as</p>
<p>typedecl sT,</p>
<p>am I effectively creating a non-empty set, which has a power set <br>
associated with it? I've read several times that a type can be <br>
interpreted as a non-empty set.</p>
<p>Second, I try to bump up the value of this email with some setup <br>
information for Nitpick and Sledgehammer. I'm in the "learn how to setup <br>
and use Nitpick and Sledgehammer" mode. I'm almost out of it, but I try <br>
to explore it in depth so that when I get back to the drudgery of <br>
working through tutorials and exercises, I know how to use these <br>
automated tools for my own tangents. And, certain logics can never be <br>
used to prove their own consistency, so I might as well run Nitpick on <br>
everything, and to check the more likely scenario that I've introduced <br>
inconsistency.</p>
<p>Third, if you want to read that far, I have a type, a constant, a <br>
predicate, one axiom, and one theory, and I get a counterexample from <br>
Nitpick. The answers to my questions on that may be obvious, but I ask <br>
them anyway. Not understanding subtleties can cause me to have a too <br>
simple view of the universe, which might take me months to find out.</p>
<p>NITPICK STUFF</p>
<p>If you run "nitpick [verbose]" under a theorem, you'll get this message <br>
(at least for Cygwin):</p>
<p>The following solvers are configured: "MiniSat_JNI", <br>
"CryptoMiniSat_JNI", "Lingeling_JNI", "SAT4J", "SAT4J_Light".</p>
<p>Jasmine Blanchette rates these SAT solvers like this:</p>
<p>"SAT4J is very slow, but the others are roughly equivalent, with <br>
Lingeling slightly better than CryptoMiniSat, and CryptoMiniSat slightly <br>
better than vanilla MiniSat."</p>
<p>Though CryptoMiniSat_JNI and Lingeling_JNI show up, to use them you need <br>
Kodkodi 1.5.2, from Blanchette's site:</p>
<p><a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~blanchet/#software">http://www4.in.tum.de/~blanchet/#software</a> <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/%7Eblanchet/#software">http://www4.in.tum.de/%7Eblanchet/#software</a>&gt;</p>
<p>The install instructions for a Kodkodi upgrade are on page 3 of <br>
nitpick.pdf.</p>
<p>If you want to be compulsive, after setting some options with something <br>
like "nitpick_params [verbose,timeout=120,user_axioms=true]", which will <br>
also lists how all the options are set in the output window, you can run <br>
all the SATs under a theorem with something like:</p>
<p>nitpick[verbose,user_axioms,sat_solver=MiniSat_JNI]<br>
   nitpick[verbose,user_axioms,sat_solver=CryptoMiniSat_JNI]<br>
   nitpick[verbose,user_axioms,sat_solver=Lingeling_JNI]<br>
   nitpick[verbose,user_axioms,sat_solver=SAT4J]<br>
   nitpick[verbose,user_axioms,sat_solver=SAT4J_Light]</p>
<p>SLEDGEHAMMER STUFF</p>
<p>On Jasmin's site are also the upgrades to the Sledgehammer solvers CVC3, <br>
E, SPASS, and Z3. So far, I haven't been big on wanting to change the <br>
default Isabelle2012 distribution, but I'll work on doing this, which <br>
will keep me in the "learn the auto-tools mode" for another day.</p>
<p>In the folder Isabelle2012/contrib, you can see the versions of Kodkodi, <br>
CVC3, E, SPASS, and Z3 to see what versions you have.</p>
<p>SLEDGEHAMMER YICES</p>
<p>Working hard to do more than ask questions, I am the official liaison of <br>
important, breaking news on [isabelle-dev], which is a joke, of course.</p>
<p>Put YICES_INSTALLED="yes" in your "~/Isabelle2012/etc/settings" file, <br>
and yices will be one of the available solvers when you use the command <br>
"sledgehammer supported_provers" under a theorem. The pertinent thread <br>
is "sledgehammer / yices":</p>

<p>NITPICK'S COUNTERX: PENCIL &amp; PAPER LOGIC vs. ISABELLE'S LOGIC</p>
<p>The foundation of the traditional "pencil &amp; paper" logic can never be <br>
exactly the same as Isabelle's logic foundation. Our brain maps formulas <br>
to a value of either true or false. Isabelle uses typed lambda calculus <br>
to map formulas to true or false. I understand that the two lowest-level <br>
foundations for the two logics aren't exactly the same.</p>
<p>Suppose I have an "extreme minimalist ZF sets logic". I've been given <br>
the same logical symbols, the same non-logical symbols, and the same <br>
rules for using them as ZF sets.</p>
<p>I write one formula as an axiom, "(1) there exists a set which contains <br>
no elements", (? x. ! y. ~(y IN x)).</p>
<p>I write one formula as a theorem, "(2) the set described by (1) is <br>
unique", (! u. ((! x. ~(x IN u)) --&gt; u = emptyS)).</p>
<p>Setting aside that I'm taking liberties with (2) by using a constant <br>
name, though I can't prove (2) because I haven't defined "=" with an <br>
axiom, I would be very surprised if someone told me that a <br>
counterexample could be found for (2) using the single formula of (1), <br>
which is all that's available to be used. Well, not quite. The FOL <br>
specification requires that "=" is given as a logical symbol, but I do <br>
need some sets available for a counterexample.</p>
<p>Alright, but with Isabelle, I can never be so minimalist. My minimalist <br>
logic on top of HOL needs a declared type, and the "=" is given as the <br>
FOL logical symbol which is (partly or fully) axiomatized by four axioms <br>
starting at line 196 of src/HOL/HOL.thy. I understand the first 2 <br>
axioms, but not the second 2.</p>
<p>My logic needs a declared type, "typedecl sT", and I assume I <br>
effectively introduce a non-empty set by doing that, which means there <br>
are sets available for a counterexample.</p>
<p>I show my minimalist world below and I attache it as a file. The theorem <br>
"emS_is_unique1" fails Nitpick. After "=" is defined for sets, <br>
"emS_is_unique2" doesn't fail Nitpick, and is proved by metis.</p>
<p>Some responses, whether sent or thought, might be:</p>
<p>"There's not a problem, don't make a mountain out of a molehill. Define <br>
equality like you have to do anyway."</p>
<p>Or, "If a consistency results because your setup is too simplistic, <br>
you'll probably find out. If it takes you 6 months to find it out, well, <br>
that's the cost of doing business in the world of proof assistants."</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Here is my conclusion/lesson, which is merely stating the obvious: If I <br>
don't axiomatize things right, I get inconsistencies.</p>
<p>axiomatization where<br>
   eeA:"!x. ¬(x IN emS)"</p>
<p>theorem emS_is_unique1:<br>
   "!u. (!x. ~(x IN u)) --&gt; u = emS"<br>
   nitpick[verbose,user_axioms] oops</p>
<p>theorem emS_is_unique1_negation:<br>
   "~(!u. (!x. ~(x IN u)) --&gt; u = emS)"<br>
   nitpick[verbose,user_axioms] oops</p>
<p>So nitpick finds counterexamples for both.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't understand types, lambda calculus, and the "=" <br>
function well enough to know why.</p>
<p>So, I add the standard axioms, without completely understanding the <br>
underlying engine, and hope for the best. There's always the possibility <br>
that it's something embarrassingly simple.</p>
<p>Still, metis is pretty impressive, even though it's being applied to a <br>
simple problem. I negated emS_is_unique1 so that it started with an <br>
\&lt;exists&gt;, and then negated the whole thing with "~", and after defining <br>
set equality, metis proved it by the non-negated version of the theorem <br>
right above it. These things don't happen by accident, and sledgehammer <br>
is there to help make things happen.</p>
<p>Well, I go ahead and try to think this out. If emS_is_unique1 is false, <br>
then:</p>
<p>? u. (! x. ~(x IN u)) &amp; (u ~= emS).</p>
<p>If types allow an infininite number of  "u::sT" to be lurking out there, <br>
then there's a "u" distinct from emS for which I've never said that "u = <br>
emS", therefore "u ~= emS", and for which I've never used on the RHS of <br>
an "IN", therefore (!x. ~(x IN u)) .</p>
<p>What blows my analysis apart is that Nitpick finds a counterexample for <br>
emS_is_unique1_negation. I want to say that Nitpick shows that the <br>
negation of the theorem is true, but that would require me to ask an <br>
embarrassing question, like, "Uh, can I ask a simple question? If <br>
Nitpick finds a counterexample to a theorem, does that mean that the <br>
negation of the theorem is true?"</p>
<p>Things being both true and false don't make a lot of sense.<br>
Regards,<br>
GB</p>

Just to clarify: YICES_INSTALLED="yes" alone won't work if the yices <br>
binary is not installed and set up correctly (as described in <code>isabelle 
doc sledgehammer</code>), since the standard Isabelle bundle does not include <br>
this binary due to licensing issues.</p>

<p>PS: Z3_NON_COMMERCIAL="yes" (in your etc/settings) is also a way to add <br>
an additional prover and works out of the box.</p>

That's good info because I would have missed that. The auto-provers <br>
return lots of errors, and it wasn't apparent to me that yices wasn't <br>
installed. I searched the web based on provers that showed up for <br>
"sledgehammer supported_provers", but I did my web search before doing <br>
my YICES_INSTALLED="yes".</p>
<p>Here's the downloads that I found on the web:</p>
<p>Yices: <a href="http://yices.csl.sri.com/download.shtml">http://yices.csl.sri.com/download.shtml</a></p>
<p>Vampire: <a href="http://www.vprover.org/">http://www.vprover.org/</a></p>

<p>leo2: <a href="http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~leo/">http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~leo/</a></p>
<p>satallax: <a href="http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~cebrown/satallax/">http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~cebrown/satallax/</a></p>
<p>Yices has a Cygwin binary, and it works if I correctly use Cygwin's path <br>
naming like /cygdrive/e/.../yices-1.0.35/bin/yices. I wouldn't be able <br>
to use it without the binary, since there's no remote yices.</p>
<p>I couldn't get Vampire working on Cygwin last year, and I don't expect <br>
better results this year, plus I can't get the file off of their web <br>
site. But there's remote_vampire.</p>
<p>The alt_ergo installer got deleted by Norton, plus Why3 has to be <br>
installed to use it, so I forget about that one for now.</p>
<p>Leo2 and Satallax don't come with a Cygwin binary, so I forget about <br>
them, since I don't try to make anything with Cygwin. But there are <br>
remote versions for both of these.</p>
<p>I have them all in now. I count twenty-one of them. I wonder about that <br>
dummy_thf. It doesn't ever solve anything. That "dummy" sounds a little <br>
suspicious.</p>
<p>I wonder if I really need all three of spass, spass_new, and spass_old, <br>
but I leave them all in.</p>

<p>I briefly thought about how to use definitions, just to try and use good <br>
discipline. Suppose I have 7 standard axioms that I have to use. Then I <br>
guess I could define an object, function, or property with a big <br>
conjunction using the 7 axioms.</p>
<p>If I see the right example, it'll become clear. Using axioms lets me <br>
start working on a real application right now as a diversion, instead of <br>
waiting until I've become thoroughly educated, which could be a long <br>
process. Trying to apply what I know at any point in time helps drive it <br>
into long term memory, and usually requires me to learn something in <br>
addition to the knowledge I'm trying to apply.</p>

<p>Thanks for the summary. Not understanding subtleties can kill me, but I <br>
also need to understand the big picture.</p>
<p>Quantifying over functions has me a little worried. I see the need to <br>
quantify over types of something like "sT =&gt; bool", rather than over <br>
just a primitive type variable. If I'm doing that in what would normally <br>
be a FOL system of logic, then I've entered the realm of higher order <br>
logic. I don't care about that. I only care that I get busted for doing it.</p>
<p>I head down the road semi-blind, and find out where it leads.</p>

Why?  Semantically a function is just a set, and in mathematics you <br>
qantify over collections of sets all the time.</p>
<p>You can take HOL is a simplified version of FOL + set theory, but with an <br>
explicit type system.  Paradoxically HOL is weaker that FOL + ZF set <br>
theory, despite arbitrary abstraction and quantification in HOL.</p>
<p>Anyway, in practice you don't need to worry about the foundations and <br>
their relative logical strenth.  You just do your applications with <br>
high-level specification mechanims in Isabelle (datatype, function, <br>
inductive, locale etc.), better not axiomatization.</p>

<p>Until recently, I made my money as a technician working in telecom. I've <br>
seen it over and over again. The best educated and hardest working <br>
engineers don't typically make fundamental mistakes, because they <br>
understand the fundamentals. Those with an inferior education, even if <br>
they work hard, make fundamental mistakes that doom their designs.</p>
<p>You understand foundations all the way to the bottom. I try to <br>
understand what I don't understand to not be the guy who makes the most <br>
fundamental of mistakes. A healthy amount of worry keeps me on my toes.</p>

<p>Immediately, I ask the question, "How can what each logic proves be <br>

<p>I answer my question and say, "Ah, those logicians, they must have <br>
formalized the study of translating statements from one logic into another."</p>

<p>Well, I think you're projecting your understanding of foundations onto <br>
me. You see clearly to the bottom. I see through a glass darkly.</p>

<p>And so I'll make the switch as soon as possible, and either redo <br>
everything based on some sort of definition, or I'll maintain two <br>
different versions. I'm jumping to conclusions here about me being able <br>
to achieve overall success with my current idea.</p>

<p>Depends you how completeness is formalized.  The book by Peter B. Andrews <br>
"An Introduction to Mathematical Logic and Type Theory: To Truth Through <br>
Proof" contains the standard canon of correctness and completeness 3 <br>
times: (1) propositional logic, (2) first-order logic, (3) higher-order <br>
logic.  The latter goes back to Henkin 1950, who was discussing the Church <br>
1940 version of HOL, which was not called HOL back then.</p>
<p>For using Isabelle/HOL, all of this is of little practical relevance. <br>
You just do mathematical modelling with the definitional mechanisms that <br>
the system gives you, and trust that the internal foundations <br>
(implementation wrt. the core logic) work out.  It is like getting on a <br>
high-speed train: you merely need to buy a ticket to participate, not <br>
study all the technical manuals first.</p>

<p>Yes.  HOL can live semantically in a small subspace of FOL+ZF.  So you can <br>
do most of classic mathematics with some restrictions.  It will take a <br>
long time until you get to the foundational limits, though.</p>
