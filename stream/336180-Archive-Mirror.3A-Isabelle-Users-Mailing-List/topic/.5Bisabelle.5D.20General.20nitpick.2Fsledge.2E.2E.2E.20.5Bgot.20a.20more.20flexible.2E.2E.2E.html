<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
By asking questions here, it makes me think harder and work harder, to <br>
try and keep from saying something that's wrong.</p>
<p>First, one of the biggest things I got out of this is the idea of <br>
running Nitpick on both a theorem and it's negation. I'm thinking that <br>
if both a "theorem" and its negation are both false, then that's a <br>
problem. I'd still like to ask that question, "Uh, if Nitpick finds a <br>
counterexample, does that mean..." Negative logic can mess me up. <br>
"Inconsistent" isn't part of the vocabulary of a typical math education. <br>
I have to deprogram myself.</p>
<p>I have just now had a revelation. If I can run Nitpick on a theorem and <br>
its negation, then I can run Sledgehammer on a theorem and its negation. <br>
I'll need to write some macros so I don't spend my life cutting, <br>
pasting, and typing, and eventually get that quad core notebook. I see <br>
that dummy_thf prover again. It never proves a thing.</p>
<p>My more-flexible solution is to not use the HOL "=", but use my own <br>
undefined "EQ", like this:</p>
<p>consts eqS::"[sT,sT] =&gt; bool" (infixl "EQ" 51)</p>
<p>Of course, I still want to make it easy to experiment, and switch in and <br>
out the HOL "=", so I comment out eqS, and use:</p>
<p>abbreviation eqS::"[sT,sT] =&gt; bool" (infixl "EQ" 51) where "x EQ y == x = y"</p>
<p>My constant eqS is more conceptually satisfying because it doesn't make <br>
any sense to use it if it hasn't been defined in any way. If I use it <br>
without defining it, I end up with that same inconsistency that I get <br>
when I use the HOL "=", but the HOL "=" is defined, though it still <br>
might not make sense to use it the way I was using it.</p>
<p>I also get an &lt;-&gt; that's not identical to my equal operator. As to how <br>
easy or hard it makes things to prove, I don't anything about that yet.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>
