Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm curious whether it is (easily) possible to apply elimination rules <br>
in Isabelle that<br>
eliminate more than one premise.</p>
<p>There is a consumes-flag for cases rules, however, simply doing:</p>
<p>lemma AB_elim[consumes 2]: "[| A; B; Foo =&gt; thesis |] ==&gt; thesis"</p>
<p>lemma  "[| A; B; C |] ==&gt; Foo"<br>
  apply (cases rule: AB_elim)</p>
<p>does not work, and leaves me with three subgoals, the last one being:<br>
  [|A; B; C; Foo |] ==&gt;  Foo</p>
<p>apply (erule (1) AB_elim) leaves me with one subgoal being:<br>
     [| B; C; Foo |] ==&gt;  Foo</p>
<p>However, I want something that yields the subgoal:<br>
     [| C; Foo |] ==&gt;  Foo</p>
<p>and that also works if the A and B are not in order, i.e. for<br>
  [| ...; B; ...; A; ... |] ==&gt; Foo<br>
apply (?? AB_elim) shall yield:<br>
  [| ...; ...; ...; Foo |] ==&gt; Foo<br>
i.e. removing the matching A and B from the premises.</p>
<p>(I need this for termination and proper behavior of a set of elimination <br>
rules that I apply exhaustively with apply (...)+ ):</p>
<p>Regards and thanks for any hints,<br>
  Peter</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>The "consumes" attribute only has an effect when you are in an<br>
Isar-style proof with chained facts. Here's a situation where it works<br>
as you expect:</p>
<p>lemma "[|A; B; C|] ==&gt; Foo"<br>
proof -<br>
  assume "A" and "B" and "C"<br>
  then show "Foo"<br>
   (* there are now 3 chained facts: "A", "B", "C" *)<br>
  apply (cases rule: AB_elim)</p>
<p>Now the first 2 chained facts are matched with rule AB_elim and<br>
disappear. The remaining fact "C" stays in the remaining subgoal,<br>
leaving "[| C; Foo |] ==&gt;  Foo".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and that also works if the A and B are not in order, i.e. for<br>
 [| ...; B; ...; A; ... |] ==&gt; Foo<br>
apply (?? AB_elim) shall yield:<br>
 [| ...; ...; ...; Foo |] ==&gt; Foo<br>
i.e. removing the matching A and B from the premises.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, chained facts can only be matched in the given order<br>
(for efficiency reasons, I believe), so this doesn't really do what<br>
you want.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I don't think there is any easy way to accomplish what you want to<br>
do---at least, I don't know of any already-implemented tactic in<br>
Isabelle that does this. I do think such a tactic would be useful,<br>
though; I've wished for it a few times myself.</p>
<p>It might be possible to implement such a tactic in ML. The obvious<br>
approach of trying to generalize eresolve_tac probably won't work,<br>
because eresolve_tac is implemented in terms of Thm.biresolution,<br>
which is part of Isabelle's trusted kernel.</p>
<p>You could probably define this tactic on top of eresolve_tac:<br>
Basically you would do "erule (n)" (which is basically "erule" then<br>
"assumption" n times) followed by n calls to "thin_tac" to eliminate<br>
the extra assumptions from the final proof state. The tricky bit would<br>
be to figure out how to record which assumptions were matched by<br>
"assumption", so you can tell "thin_tac" which ones to get rid of<br>
later.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the development effort now is focused on<br>
Isar-style proofs with chained facts, and not so much on tactics for<br>
apply-style proofs. So I'd say it is unlikely that this feature will<br>
be implemented by the main Isabelle development team. But be sure to<br>
report back if you try to implement this yourself; I'm sure plenty of<br>
people would find it useful.</p>

<p>My solution of this "tricky bit" depends on an idea presented by Konrad <br>
Slind<br>
for HOL at TPHOLs 2002, which was to annotate selected goals (or, more <br>
generally, subterms) _within_ the logic.</p>
<p>Thus for a long time I have used<br>
  forget        :: "'a =&gt; 'a"<br>
  forget_def : "forget f == f"<br>
to stop a particular hypothesis being used in asm_simp_tac and <br>
asm_full_simp_tac</p>
<p>For this problem I defined</p>
<p>keep_def : "keep b f == f"<br>
  keep          :: "bool =&gt; 'a =&gt; 'a"</p>
<p>val _ = <a href="http://ListPair.app">ListPair.app</a> bind_thm (["keepD", "keepI"], [keep_def] RL defDs) ;<br>
val _ = bind_thm ("keepTD", read_instantiate [("b", "True")] keepD) ;<br>
val _ = bind_thm ("keepFD", read_instantiate [("b", "False")] keepD) ;<br>
val _ = bind_thm ("keepF_thin", keepFD RS thin_rl) ;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>keepTD ;<br>
val it = "keep True ?P ==&gt; ?P" : Thm.thm</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>keepFD ;<br>
val it = "keep False ?P ==&gt; ?P" : Thm.thm</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>keepF_thin ;<br>
val it = "[| keep False ?P; PROP ?W |] ==&gt; PROP ?W" : Thm.thm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(You should change the uses of bind_thm if you're using Isar).</p>
<p>Then the tactic is as follows - it is no doubt rather inefficient, but <br>
seems to work OK.<br>
I've done the analogue of fatac which deletes all matched premises from <br>
remaining subgoals because it's simpler to follow (datac already deleted <br>
the first matched premise, and eatac also matches the conclusion, which <br>
I think is here an additional irrelevant complication).</p>
<p>(* fetac : thm -&gt; int -&gt; int -&gt; tactic<br>
  like fatac n but also deletes hypotheses matched *)<br>
fun fetac th n sg st =<br>
  let val fth = thin_rl RS (replicate n keepFD MRS th) : thm ;<br>
    val subgoal = List.nth (prems_of st, sg - 1) : term ;<br>
    (* turn all subgoal hypotheses H into keep ?b H *)<br>
    val nhyps = length (Logic.strip_assums_hyp subgoal) ;<br>
    val ktac = EVERY' (replicate nhyps (dtac keepI)) : int -&gt; tactic ;<br>
    (* then apply ftac fth - see later *)<br>
    (* then apply atac n times,<br>
      which marks the hypotheses to be deleted with keep False *)<br>
    val atacs = EVERY' (replicate n atac) ;<br>
    (* treat other instances of keep ?b as keep True, and erase them *)<br>
    val ekttac = REPEAT o dtac keepTD : int -&gt; tactic ;<br>
    (* delete hypotheses which are (keep False ...) *)<br>
    val ekftac = REPEAT o etac keepF_thin : int -&gt; tactic ;<br>
    (* combine all the above *)<br>
    val ctac = EVERY' [ktac, ftac fth, atacs] THEN_ALL_NEW    <br>
      (ekttac THEN' ekftac) : int -&gt; tactic ;<br>
  in ctac sg st end ;</p>

<p>I hope so.  Incidentally, on a related topic  - sometimes using etac I <br>
_don't_ want the matched premise deleted from the resulting subgoals <br>
(which is why all_dupE is given as an alternative to allE). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To achieve this for any elimination rule, I have</p>
<p>fun mk_dupE thE = zero_var_indexes (rotate_prems ~1<br>
  (tacsthm [PRIMITIVE (fn th =&gt; th RS cut_rl), atac 1] thE)) ;</p>
<p>thus mk_dupE allE is approximately all_dupE</p>

<p>From: Stephan Merz &lt;<a href="mailto:Stephan.Merz@loria.fr">Stephan.Merz@loria.fr</a>&gt;<br>
I second this request. More precisely, I'd like to be able to annotate a rule such that it is applied by the automatic proof methods only if the first n hypotheses are present in the current proof state. As a simple example, consider bspec, which would make a perfect elimination rule when its two assumptions can be proved by assumption. As others have pointed out, it is not hard to write a tactic that applies a rule only if the first n hypotheses can be proved by assumption, however, I don't know how to make such a tactic work inside auto and friends.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Stephan</p>

Hi Brian,</p>
<p>Many thanks you for your answer.</p>
<p>I adopted your proposal for my needs. However, I ran into a problem that <br>
should also be imminent in your proposal (?).<br>
If there are premises of the form !!x. _==&gt;_, they are counted in nhyps, <br>
however dtac keepI will not unify against them, thus<br>
   val ktac = EVERY' (replicate nhyps (dtac keepI)) : int -&gt; tactic ;<br>
produces premises that are doubly-wrapped into keep.</p>
<p>What's the best way around?<br>
  Only counting "plain" premises? (How?)<br>
  Can keepI be defined to also wrap higher-order premises?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
  Peter</p>
