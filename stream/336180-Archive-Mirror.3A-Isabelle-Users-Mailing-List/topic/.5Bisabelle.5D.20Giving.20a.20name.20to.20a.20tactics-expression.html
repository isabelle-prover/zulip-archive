It's true that saying "this is used for blah blah" is one of the three <br>
aspects to documenting a function, and it is certainly true that it is a <br>
moot point as to where it should go.  I've not come across the <br>
suggestion that as a consequence it should be omitted completely.  In <br>
any case, the other two aspects of documenting a function are equally <br>

As far as I can see, method_setup and Method.setup are relevant only <br>
when you already have the method you want to use.  If I'm wrong it may <br>
be because I haven't spent any longer examining the sources.  But <br>
examining (undocumented) sources is not the normal way to find out what <br>

You don't, but go down to the basic tactics behind meth1, meth2, meth3. <br>
(All tools are supposed to export this ML view, apart from defining <br>
end-user method syntax.)</p>
<p>Isar methods are a more stylized way of refining structured goals than <br>
tactics, and things like fine-grained goal addressing is missing.  This <br>
makes user space method expressions more digestible than old tactical ones <br>
-- you certainly know how proof scripts looked 10 years ago -- but on the <br>
other hand it is harder to define meaningful method combinations.</p>
<p>So just compose things as a tactic and then link it up with Isar via <br>
method_setup.  There are plenty of examples in the sources -- most of them <br>
quite clean, because I've reworked these interfaces for Isabelle2009.</p>

<p>Is there a way to give a short name to a complex tactic-expression. I <br>
have, e.g., the following pattern that I frequently use.<br>

  and later:<br>
    apply (my_method)</p>
<p>However, the only way I know is something like:<br>
method_setup my_method = {* &lt;Some scary ML-code, much more boilerplate <br>

<p>Not really.  Isar was introduced to overcome adhoc "scripting" of proofs, <br>
and there is a carefully chosen terminology to emphasize this ("proof <br>
text" and "proof method", instead of the more primitive "proof script" and <br>
"tactic"). This was just one further step to less operational detail <br>
compared to old-style ML tactics of classic Isabelle/HOL, which was <br>
already much more stylized in 1998 than original HOL with its huge numbers <br>
of small tactics and tacticals.</p>
<p>Comparing formalizations from these different eras, my general impression <br>
is that people now achieve more with the more abstract means of Isar, and <br>
the results are checked faster and easier to maintain. Nonetheless, there <br>
is still a lack of serious interactive proof development support, say some <br>
kind of "prover IDE" that deserves this name.</p>

<p>Designing (and implementing) Isar proof methods needs some care, this is <br>
not for quick scripting.</p>
<p>First of all, in many situations, the intended goal refinement can be <br>
achieve more declaratively, e.g. by deriving suitable compound rules, or <br>
feeding certain rules to simp/fast/blast/auto etc. with intro/elim/iff <br>
declarations.</p>
<p>If you really need to define a goal refinement macro, you can actually<br>
give a name to a tactic (not a complex method expression as in the example <br>
above).  E.g. like this:</p>
<p>ML {* val my_tac = REPEAT o (rtac @{thm foo} THEN' (TRY o atac)) *}</p>
<p>and use it later via the "tactic" method, e.g. like this:</p>
<p>lemma True<br>
   apply (tactic {* my_tac 1 *})</p>
<p>This still looks a bit scary, but the overhead for argument parsing is <br>
avoided.</p>
<p>If you explain your application more specifically, it is easier to say <br>
what is really needed.</p>

The numbers merely specify additional assumption steps -- which used to be <br>
a very common idiom in old-style tactic scripts.  (In Isar, reasoning by <br>
assumption is usually implicit in the proof structure, e.g. after closing <br>
a 'by'.)</p>
<p>The low-level tactic is called assume_tac.</p>

<p>If you can use a compound tactic, it would be much easier.<br>
Method.erule is based on Tactic.eresolve_tac, plus some other stuff, <br>
