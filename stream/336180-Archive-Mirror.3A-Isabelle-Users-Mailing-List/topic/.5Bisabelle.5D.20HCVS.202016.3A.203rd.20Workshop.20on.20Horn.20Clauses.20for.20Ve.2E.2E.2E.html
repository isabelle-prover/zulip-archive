<p>3rd Workshop on Horn Clauses for Verification and Synthesis (HCVS)<br>
Affiliated with ETAPS 2016</p>
<p>April 3, 2016. Eindhoven, The Netherlands</p>
<p><a href="http://hcvs2016.it.uu.se/">http://hcvs2016.it.uu.se/</a></p>
<p>Submission deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>abstract submission: January 25, 2016</li>
<li>paper submission: February 1, 2016</li>
<li>paper notification: February 27, 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>Many Program Verification and Synthesis problems of interest can be<br>
modeled directly using Horn clauses, and many recent advances in the<br>
CLP and CAV communities have centered around efficiently solving<br>
problems presented as Horn clauses.</p>
<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers working in the two<br>
communities of Constraint/Logic Programming (e.g. ICLP and CP) and<br>
Program Verification community (e.g. CAV, TACAS, and VMCAI) on the<br>
topic of Horn clause based analysis, verification and synthesis.</p>
<p>Horn clauses for verification and synthesis have been advocated by<br>
these two communities in different times and from different<br>
perspectives, and this workshop is organized to stimulate interaction<br>
and a fruitful exchange and integration of experiences.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the use of Horn<br>
clauses, constraints, and related formalisms in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Analysis and verification of programs and systems of various kinds<br>
  (e.g., imperative, object-oriented, functional, logic, higher-order,<br>
  concurrent)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Program synthesis</p>
</li>
<li>Program testing</li>
<li>Program transformation</li>
<li>Constraint solving</li>
<li>Type systems</li>
<li>Case studies and tools</li>
<li>Challenging problems</li>
</ul>
<p>We solicit regular papers describing theory and implementation of<br>
Horn-clause based analysis and tool descriptions. We also solicit<br>
extended abstracts describing work-in-progress, as well as<br>
presentations covering previously published results that are of<br>
interest to the workshop.</p>

<p>Submission has to be done in one of the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular papers (up to 12 pages plus bibliography, typeset in EPTCS<br>
  format), which should present previously unpublished work (completed<br>
  or in progress), including descriptions of research, tools, and<br>
  applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended abstracts (up to 3 pages in EPTCS format), which describe<br>
  work in progress or aim to initiate discussions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presentation-only papers, i.e., papers already submitted or<br>
  presented at a conference or another workshop. Such papers can be<br>
  submitted in any format, and will not be included in the workshop<br>
  post-proceedings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All submitted papers will be refereed by the program committee and<br>
will be selected for inclusion in accordance with the referee<br>
reports. Accepted regular papers and extended abstracts will be<br>
published electronically as a volume in the Electronic Proceedings in<br>
Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) series, see <a href="http://www.eptcs.org/">http://www.eptcs.org/</a></p>
<p>Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of<br>
them will be present at the workshop. Papers must be submitted<br>
through the EasyChair system using the web page:<br>
