<p><em>CALL FOR PAPERS: DEADLINE EXTENDED</em></p>
<p><strong>HOFM 2016: 3rd Human-Oriented Formal Methods Workshop </strong><br>
<a href="http://hofm2016.wordpress.com">http://hofm2016.wordpress.com</a><br>
(Vienna, Austria)</p>
<p>*co-located to Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations (STAF),<br>
a federation of leading conferences on software technologies.*<br>
<a href="http://staf2016.conf.tuwien.ac.at/">http://staf2016.conf.tuwien.ac.at/</a></p>
<p><strong>Important Dates</strong></p>
<p><em>Deadline for paper submission: May 10, 2016 (AoE) -- extended</em><br>
Notification: May 25, 2016 (AoE)<br>
Workshop will take place on July 4, 2016.</p>
<p><em>Aims:</em></p>
<p>While designing and applying formal methods (FMs), computer scientists have<br>
dominantly focused on two factors, only: firstly, the method must be<br>
precise and sound and secondly, it must be mathematically concise and<br>
aesthetic. Other important characteristics such as simplicity,<br>
learnability, readability, memorability, ease of use and communication or,<br>
even support for integrating tools into larger development tool chains are<br>
ignored too often. These nonfunctional properties, however, are key<br>
attributes of usability and user satisfaction. If usability is compromised,<br>
methods are not fit for the purpose of documenting, reproducing and<br>
communicating key design and realization decisions, or analysis results,<br>
especially when these need to communicate or mediate between expertise in<br>
different disciplines, different tool chains or across technological or<br>
organizational boundaries. For these reasons, many engineers and<br>
practitioners largely reject formal methods and formal specification<br>
languages as “too hard to understand and use in practice” while admitting<br>
that they are powerful and precise.</p>
<p>With increasing computing power and its consequent automation capabilities,<br>
the research and development community however is slowly but definitely<br>
focusing on usability in combination with automation. Moreover<br>
practitioners across numerous domains are increasingly interested in formal<br>
domain-specific modelling, simulation and validation, whether in<br>
application areas of energy, robotics, health, biology, climate and<br>
sustainable development, or, for specific technologies of importance such<br>
as data analytics and user interface specification for an exponentially<br>
growing number of hand-held or wearable devices.</p>
<p>While there are many applications of formal methods to analyze<br>
human-machine interaction and to construct user interfaces, the field of<br>
application of human factors to the analysis and to the optimization of<br>
formal methods area is almost unexplored.</p>
<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers, engineers and<br>
practitioners from academia and industry to baseline the state of the art<br>
in this increasingly important domain. It also aims to develop a future<br>
vision and roadmap of usability and automation, focusing especially on<br>
readability and ease of use.</p>
<p><em>Areas of interest include but are not limited to:</em></p>
<p>• Integration of formal methods in the industrial development life cycle,<br>
application of FMs to real-world problems especially in domains listed below<br>
• Optimization of the development tools based on FMs<br>
• Readability and usability of specification/modeling notations and tools<br>
• Human factors of/for FMs<br>
• Visualization of/in FMs<br>
• Human error and human factors in software engineering<br>
• Cross-disciplinary automation and hybrid FMs<br>
• Usability and scalability of FMs and the corresponding tools<br>
• Usability evaluation in automated verification and testing<br>
• Crowd-enabling and gamification for human-centered software development,<br>
verification and testing, especially based on formal specification and<br>
methods<br>
• Teaching of FMs as a software engineering discipline</p>
<p><em>Formatting and Submission Guidelines:</em></p>
<p>All accepted papers will be published as part of the Lecture Notes in<br>
Computer Science (LNCS) proceedings volume organized by STAF 2016.<br>
PDF versions of papers should be submitted trough EasyChair submission<br>
system.<br>
The maximum size is 15 pages using the LNCS Formatting Guidelines.<br>
If you submit a paper and it gets accepted, at least one of the<br>
(co)author(s) is expected to be present at the workshop to present the<br>
paper.<br>
All papers submitted to the workshop must be unpublished original work and<br>
should not be under review or submitted elsewhere while being under<br>
consideration.</p>
<p>We invite submissions in three categories:<br>
• Research papers reporting innovative and original research in the field.<br>
• Work-in-Progress/vision describing ongoing research, emerging results and<br>
future ideas&amp;trends.<br>
• Tool papers describing operational tool and its contributions.</p>
<p>Submitted papers will be reviewed by 3 members of Program/Organizing<br>
Committee (or their sub-reviewers) and selection of accepted papers will<br>
based on relevance, quality and originality of the submitted papers.</p>
