<p>There is some freedom of choice here. In principle you can do everything<br>

other contexts as illustrated in the included Scratch.thy</p>
<p>In practice it might be better to chose a default standing point, e.g.<br>
Main HOL, and cherry-pick things from the ZF-derived context. This also<br>
allows to use regular Isar statements and proofs from HOL.</p>

and if I back up to the beginning and replace imports ZF by imports Main<br>
then it has forgotten the ML values which were declared.<br>
So how does one transfer ML values from a ZF proof to a proof in Main?</p>

<p>ML values are not forgotten, but stored in the enclosing theory context.<br>
It is possible to move values between such theory contexts, e.g. via a<br>
global Synchronized.var but then you need to take the physics of<br>
Isabelle theory versions and PIDE processing into account.</p>
<p>It is probably easier to pick plain values from a clearly defined theory<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You work always in an implicit HOL context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You occasionally use operations like Syntax.read_prop to produce ZF<br>
terms within an explicit ZF context, and transform them to be usable in<br>
the HOL context.</p>

Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>but what is "the" enclosing theory context?</p>
<p>Your example theory file shows how to parse, in ZF, a term that has been <br>
typed in, and use an ML function to prove a goal (which could, in <br>
general, be a HOL term computed from the ZF term).</p>
<p>But I want to grab a subgoal which arises in the course of proving a <br>
lemma in ZF, calculate a HOL term, and postulate that term as a goal in <br>
HOL, for proving in HOL (in Isar, not in ML)</p>
<p>That is,</p>
<p>theory Z imports ZF begin<br>
lemma ..... (ie set out to prove something in ZF)<br>
   assorted proof steps<br>
   grab subgoal n as a ML value of type term<br>
   do things with it to create a term suitable for proving in HOL<br>
   call this term hol_term<br>
oops or sorry or whatever</p>
<p>switch context to HOL<br>
now set out to prove the goal, which is the term calculated previously,<br>
eg, as someone suggested,<br>
schematic goal "?P"<br>
resolve_tac (Thm.trivial hol_term)<br>
now continue the HOL proof</p>
<p>Now as far as I can tell,<br>
lemma ... (following theory Z imports ZF begin)<br>
works in the ZF context,<br>
and I want the<br>
schematic goal "?P" to work in the HOL context.</p>
<p>Now you have shown me how to get a HOL context and a ZF context present <br>
together, but I still don't see how to get<br>
lemma (in the ZF context) and<br>
schematic goal (in the HOL context) together<br>
(ie, without ML values created during the first proof being lost before <br>
you start the second proof).</p>
<p>Re the suggestion to use Synchronized.var - if I do that wouldn't I just <br>
have to somehow stop the Synchronized.var value getting lost, just as I <br>
now have to stop the term value getting lost.</p>
<p>To sum up, the issue is to do<br>
(1) grab a subgoal out of a proof in ZF<br>
(2) massage it to create a term<br>
(3) start up a proof in HOL with that term as the goal (and that proof <br>
will be using Isar, not using Goal.prove and ML code)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jeremy Dawson</p>

<p>It is the context of the 'ML' or 'ML_file' command (or any other command<br>
than invokes the ML compiler). Everything in Isabelle has a formal<br>
context; the ML environment is a part of that, and ML compilation is a<br>
function to update that formal context.</p>
<p>In addition, Isabelle2018 will also provide 'ML_export' to write through<br>
to the bootstrap ML environment, what you might remember as "the ML<br>
toplevel" from 1998. That new feature needs to be used with great care,<br>
though, and with an understanding how normal Isabelle/ML works within a<br>
formal context.</p>

<p>I also don't see that on the spot, which is why I did not answer this so<br>
far. I guess it could work as a special Isar command like 'subgoal', but<br>
it needs to switch the background theory context, which is normally not<br>
supported in Isar proofs.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From what we've had so far on this thread, you should manage (1), (2),<br>
and a variant of (3) that uses Goal.prove with a context derived from an<br>
alien theory (HOL).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can later look again to figure out how to turn this approximation of<br>
(3) into an Isar goal command.</p>
<p>Note that in the coming days I will be on travel: FLoC at Oxford (UK)<br>
until 15-Jul-2018.</p>
