<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:c-sterna@jaist.ac.jp">c-sterna@jaist.ac.jp</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Brian,</p>
<p>I'm currently experimenting with HOLCF (and reading your thesis in <br>
parallel), and I have to say, really nice work!</p>
<p>Some tiny things I noticed:</p>
<hr>
<p>Domain Package:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>syntax annotations are allowed for constructors but do not work if <br>
given separately with "notation", e.g.,</p>
<p>domain 'a list = Nil | Cons (lazy 'a) (lazy "'a list") (infixr ":" 65)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>works, but</p>
<p>notation Cons (infixr ":" 65)</p>
<p>doesn't (due to being a continuous function)</p>
<p>Fixrec Package:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>does not allow mixfix annotations (due to continuous function type), e.g.,</p>
<p>fixrec append :: "'a list -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list" (infixr "++" 65) where<br>
   "Nil ++ ys = ys" |<br>
   "(Cons$x$xs) ++ ys = Cons$x$(xs ++ ys)"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>does not work. We have to introduce an intermediate abbreviation:</p>
<p>abbreviation append_syn :: "'a list =&gt; 'a list =&gt; 'a list" (infixr <br>
"++" 65) where<br>
     "xs ++ ys = append$xs$ys"</p>
<p>General:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>definitions do not allow "natural" equations like "f$x$y = P x y", we <br>
have to use "f = Lambda x y. P x y" instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a space after the unicode symbol for "Lambda" is mandatory, otherwise <br>
we get an inner syntax error</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Shouldn't it be possible to reuse the same machinery that allows to give <br>
mixfix annotations for domain constructors at all other locations that <br>
allow for mixfix annotations?</p>
<p>Concerning usage of HOLCF in jEdit (I guess, this is for Makarius): <br>
could a translation from $ to the unicode cdot be added to the default <br>
"translation table", since typing "&lt;space&gt; c d o t" and then moving back <br>
in order to remove the space is slightly odd.</p>
<p>The more I read about HOLCF and its intended use to verify functional <br>
programs, the more I feel that it is a pity that code generation does <br>
not work for it. Currently if we want to verify Haskell code, we have to <br>
take the sources, translate them (manually?) into Isabelle, and verify <br>
the desired properties. However the original sources are still used for <br>
compilation and if those change, we might not even notice. It would be <br>
much more reliable to generate Haskell code (e.g., the Standard Prelude) <br>
from its Isabelle/HOLCF formalization automatically.</p>
<p>cheers</p>

There is Haskabelle for translating Haskelle to HOL. But data types become eager<br>
in the process. One would need a similar translation to HOLCF.</p>
<p>Of course I agree that code generation for HOLCF would be very nice to have. We<br>
had this on the agenda at some point - maybe we should get back to it.</p>

<p>From: Till Mossakowski &lt;<a href="mailto:till@informatik.uni-bremen.de">till@informatik.uni-bremen.de</a>&gt;<br>
we have implemented a translation of Haskell into Isabelle HOLCF as part <br>
of the Heterogeneous Tool Set, see <a href="http://www.dfki.de/cps/hets">www.dfki.de/cps/hets</a>. This has been <br>
done some years ago and probably would need to be adapted to the latest <br>

<p>Yes, you would need to define this syntax using an abbreviation, like<br>
you do below for your fixrec functions.</p>
<p>Way back when we used to define functions with separate "consts",<br>
"syntax", and "defs" commands, HOLCF used to provide a replacement<br>
"syntax" command that knew about the continuous function type.<br>
Unfortunately things are less consistent now, when each command is<br>
responsible for handling its own syntax declarations.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Like most other function definition commands in Isabelle now, Fixrec<br>
uses a standard Isar specification parser (Specification.read_spec) to<br>
process its input; it handles both parsing and type inference. This<br>
parser of course expects infix functions to have ordinary function<br>
types. Adding support for infix with continuous function types would<br>
probably require a complete reimplementation of specification.ML.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General:</p>
<ul>
<li>definitions do not allow "natural" equations like "f$x$y = P x y", we have<br>
to use "f = Lambda x y. P x y" instead.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This shouldn't be surprising, since definitions like "f$x$y = P x y"<br>
are not sound in general; continuity checks are required.</p>
<p>Equations like this work fine with Fixrec. (Although you might want to<br>
declare the equation with [simp del] if you don't want it unfolded<br>
automatically.)</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a space after the unicode symbol for "Lambda" is mandatory, otherwise we<br>
get an inner syntax error</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You also need spaces after alphanumeric quantifiers like "ALL",  "EX",<br>
"THE", and "SOME", right? The same reasoning applies here, because<br>
Isabelle's lexer considers \&lt;Lambda&gt; to be a letter; \&lt;lambda&gt; is an<br>
oddball in that the lexer considers it to be a non-letter.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Not easily. (See above about specification parser.) It used to be<br>
easier in the old days with a single "syntax" command.</p>
<blockquote>

translation from $ to the unicode cdot be added to the default "translation<br>

remove the space is slightly odd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't expect that all Isabelle users will want "$" to be replaced by<br>
"\&lt;cdot&gt;", and anyway, shouldn't the input translations for jEdit be<br>
customizable? It seems ridiculous to have to ask a developer to change<br>
the distribution every time somebody wants to add a new input<br>
translation.</p>
<p>In ProofGeneral, I have it set up to replace ",." with "\&lt;cdot&gt;"; this<br>
shortcut works very well for me.</p>

<p>John Matthews and I have occasionally discussed an old idea that could<br>
help with all of the problems that you mentioned: Have HOLCF use<br>
ordinary function types ("=&gt;" instead of "-&gt;") in many more places,<br>
e.g. constructor functions for domains, and user-defined fixrec<br>
functions. (The continuous function type would still be needed for<br>
some higher-order constructions.) At the same time, the various HOLCF<br>
packages would need to generate continuity theorems for each new<br>
constant. With ordinary function types, code generation would work,<br>
infix declarations would work, and you wouldn't even need to type all<br>
those \&lt;cdot&gt;s.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Sorry, this does not make any sense.  Things are <em>more</em> consistent now, <br>
because the full responsibility is to the packages, which fulfill that <br>
easily by handing over to standard Isabelle operations to introduce terms <br>
with mixfix syntax and specifications in the standard way.  So it all <br>
works out uniformly in the post-Isabelle2005 era.</p>
<p>In contrast, the old scheme where 'consts' where separate had several <br>
conceptual problems.  The one that might still be remembered is the "unify <br>
consts" problem: since an earlier 'consts' declaration would already be <br>
polymorphic, a subsequent 'defs' (or derived form) would often get an <br>
unexpected type, or different types for different equations. <br>
Historically, this has led to some packages trying to "repair" <br>
type-inference in different ways.  So old 'primrec', 'recdef', 'inductive' <br>
could give the user different versions of type-inference.</p>
<p>As already observed, abbreviations handle alternative syntax views better, <br>
but users need to write them down themselves.</p>
<p>Some packages like 'inductive_set' allow the user to include such <br>
abbreviations simultaneously into the specification -- they are recognized <br>
by the Pure == form.  Thus old idioms like pretending that "(x, y) : R" is <br>
actually a judgement "x -R-&gt; y" could be supported with reasonable add-on <br>
functionality to that particular package.  This is not exceedingly <br>
elegant, but better than the old scheme based on 'translations', which <br>
does not quite fit into the local theory specification concept.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
In principle the 'definition' package has a filter to convert between the <br>
specification given by the user, and the actual definition of the strict <br>
form "f == RHS".  It is rather simplistic, though, so it can probably not <br>
be stretched that far.</p>
<p>How about non-recursive 'fixrec'?  That would be analogous to using 'fun' <br>
in HOL to get pattern matching, instead of trying to add this <br>
functionality to the basic 'definition' package.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This is a consequence of the way greek letters were added to the <br>
identifier syntax in 2003.  \&lt;lambda&gt; was treated as a special case, and <br>
you loose in all other situations, such as \&lt;Lambda&gt; here, or \&lt;mu&gt;, <br>
\&lt;iota&gt; etc. that occurr occasionally in applications.</p>
<p>I have some ideas in the pipeline to address this problem and some others <br>
wrt. sub/superscripts within identifiers, but I did not manage to try that <br>
out yet, to see how it impacts existing theories.  There is some renewed <br>
motivation to do it soon, because I don't want to imitate slightly odd <br>
identifier treatment of Proof General in Isabelle/jEdit.</p>

This is specific to HOLCF.  Any global modification of the input method is <br>
apt to cause annoyances in other situations, where $ or \&lt;cdot&gt; are used <br>
differently / independently.</p>
<p>Until some better configuration for Isabelle/jEdit input methods becomes <br>
available, you can add the following line to your <br>
$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/symbols file:</p>
<p>\&lt;cdot&gt;                 code: 0x0022c5  abbrev: $</p>
<p>Note that etc/symbols allows to change the "code" assignment as well, but <br>
this should be done with great care, or not at all, to avoid chaos in the <br>
communication with other users.</p>
