<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Makarius,</p>
<p>thank you for the explanation. I was not aware the Variable.variant_fixes<br>
and friends are also for type variables, this is useful to know. (Perhaps<br>
the implementation manual should mention this more explicitly.)</p>
<p>Concerning my original confusion: I was wondering how it can be that fixing<br>
the variable "a" influences the behavior of the (invalid) type variable<br>
"a". I think the answer is that, while type and regular variables are<br>
separate, the table that remembers what variables are fixed is shared by<br>
type and regular variables. Thus fixing the regular variable <em>a</em> also fixes<br>
the (invalid) type variable <em>a</em>. Is that correct?</p>
<p>I will try to follow your programming guidelines. But one thing is unclear<br>
to me in that context: Goal.prove has an argument xs (instantiated with<br>
["l"] in my example). I thought I can use xs with a hardcoded name because<br>
Goal.prove will locally fix that variable. Is that incorrect? If it's<br>
incorrect, I don't understand how the argument xs can be used, because if I<br>
get a fresh name via Variable.variant_fixes and supply this name in the<br>
argument xs, then I get an error that the variable is already fixed. So, I<br>
see no way how to use the xs argument. (Of course, I can always avoid using<br>
that argument by using Variable.export after creating a theorem using<br>
Goal.prove, but then what is xs for?)</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

<p>The aspect of the context that is relevant here is Name.context /<br>
Variable.names_of. That sub-context throws type and term variables into<br>
one pot, and implicitly relies on other policies that ensure that they<br>
are normally not in conflict.</p>
<p>As you can see in the Variable module, there are further intermediate<br>
states of variables, corresponding to declare_names,<br>
declare_constraints, declare_term etc. -- the "implementation" manual<br>
explains some of this.</p>
<p>It is particularly important to develop an intuition how implicitly<br>
declared type variables vs. explicitly fixed term variables give you<br>
Hindley-Milner polymorphism in the end. That is the main purpose of the<br>
whole affair of managing names formally.</p>

<p>Goal.prove provides a programming interface that corresponds to Isar<br>
"have props if asms for xs", but Goal.prove uses<br>
Variable.add_fixes_direct without any implicit name invention. The names<br>
that you provide need to be "free" in the sense that they can be fixed<br>
in the current context, e.g. because they were invented properly beforehand.</p>
<p>Apart from these explicit term variables, you need to take care about<br>
type variables occurring in the propositions: Variable.declare_term does<br>
that, it ensures that the term is syntactically known to the context.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>I am not sure the following situation should be considered a bug or not,<br>
since it occurs only when using Isabelle incorrectly. But I feel that it<br>
probably indicates that invalid input is not detected in time, and it may<br>
lead to very hard to understand problems (starting from a typo). So I just<br>
explain the problem and leave it to the Isabelle-experts to decide whether<br>
it indicates a real problem or not.</p>
<p>The problem is exhibited by the theory below. But in a nutshell, we have<br>
the following situation:</p>
<p>- It is possible to prove a theorem with a type variable called <em>a</em> (not<br>
<em>'a</em>). I understand that I should not do that, of course. But there is<br>
   no error when proving the theorem.</p>
<p>- Then, if we try to use OF with that theorem, we get unexpected<br>
   failures. But only if <em>a</em> is the name of a fixed variable (not type<br>
   variable).</p>
<p>I guess that type variable <em>a</em> should probably just be rejected when trying<br>
to prove the theorem. But even if not, it is surprising that the existence<br>
of a fixed variable <em>a</em> makes a difference since I would have assumed that<br>
free variables and free type variables have completely independent name<br>
spaces.</p>

<p>There are many different notions of names, variables, contexts etc. and<br>
a lot of system infrastructure to help getting Isabelle/ML tool<br>
implementations right. The "implementation" manual explains some of this<br>
-- beyond that it is important to find good examples and study them<br>
carefully.</p>
<p>In general, the programming interfaces are much less typed than one<br>
might expect. As a start you should think of Isabelle/ML is a variant of<br>
LISP with a few static types to avoid utter nonsense. It is important to<br>
observe certain disciplines and high-level ideas -- the system often<br>
does not check or cannot check for that.</p>
<p>For type and term variables, it is usually already an error if literal<br>
names appear in the ML text. There are operations to invent fresh<br>
variables relative to a certain context -- and using them is mandatory<br>
to make things work in arbitrary contexts. So it is unlikely to make a<br>
typo of "a" vs. "'a" in ML, because both are already wrong as literal<br>
variable names in the source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>val ctx = @{context}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First note that there are hard and fast naming conventions for certain<br>
basic Isabelle/ML types (see chapter 0 in the "implementation" manual),<br>
in particular the value above needs to be called "ctxt". Otherwise there<br>
is no chance to understand the source in more complex situations, when<br>
there is a serious problem with contexts (the present example is not<br>
serious yet). The Highlighter of Isabelle/jEdit can be helpful here,<br>
when sources are written in a standard form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fun tac {context=ctx, ...} = ALLGOALS (simp_tac ctx)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this spot you are binding the same name "ctx" again: this shadowing<br>
makes it difficult to understand and change the sources later. Anyway,<br>
the forward definition of "tac" is better inlined into the Goal.prove<br>
invocation, it makes the source more readable and robust.</p>
<p>Here is that snippet in standard form, optimized for readability:</p>
<p>ML ‹<br>
val ctxt = @{context}<br>
val T = TFree ("a", @{sort type})<br>
val l = Free ("l", T)<br>
val thm =<br>
  Goal.prove ctxt ["l"] [] (HOLogic.mk_Trueprop (HOLogic.mk_eq (l, l)))<br>
    (fn {context = ctxt', ...} =&gt; ALLGOALS (simp_tac ctxt'))<br>
›</p>
<p>Now the development of the local ctxt into ctxt' becomes clear: the<br>
latter is the "eigen-context" of the goal statement.</p>
<p>After inspecting contexts, I routinely look at variables and terms vs.<br>
these contexts. Above Goal.prove is applied to some proposition that is<br>
not declared in the context (e.g. with Variable.declare_term). Omitting<br>
that in real applications can lead to really confusing situations with<br>
the implicit Hindley-Milner polymorphism and other corner cases.</p>
<p>See also section "6.1 Variables" in the "implementation" manual,<br>
including its minimal examples. With that you might produce fresh<br>
type/term variables robustly, such that the whole question from the<br>
start disappears.</p>
