Dear Isabelle Users,</p>
<p>Thank you all for helping me with the considerable amount of questions I<br>
posted in the list<br>
throughout this year. After some reluctance<br>
over the last couple of years I have finally decided to tackle my<br>
experiments in Isabelle a  bit more<br>
seriously.</p>
<p>Anyway, I finish this e-mail by posting the link from a post by Andrej<br>
Bauer on the role<br>
of free and bound variables. This topic seems to be the one which was<br>
amongst the<br>
topics most discussed in the list during this year.</p>
<p>"Free variables are not "implicitly universally quantified"!</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Alfio,</p>
<p>So last year I went over my allotted quota for talking about free <br>
variables and whether they're really implicitly quantified in Isabelle. <br>
However, this is now the year 2013.</p>
<p>(Here, after writing everything below, it has occurred to me that I <br>
might have taken all this way too serious, but as I say below, I have <br>
some time on my hands.)</p>
<p>Really, many arguments just reflect the limitations of natural language, <br>
that because communication with natural language tends to be a single <br>
pipelined activity, the complete context influencing one human mind is <br>
not transmitted very well to another human mind, and we all know, or <br>
should know, that context is everything.</p>
<p>With "free variables are not implicitly universally quantified", I could <br>
go on lots of tangents, but I'll limit myself to two, and a conclusion <br>
or two.</p>
<p>One is that sometimes, if I'm given a precise, definitive, useful answer <br>
on a subject I've been arguing about, I lose interest in the argument <br>
because I become much more interested in the answer, which sometimes is <br>
simply because the answer is so definitive, there's nothing to argue <br>
about anymore, and what I could find to argue about is no longer that <br>
interesting in light of the new answer.</p>
<p>(Not having slipped this in anywhere else in the past, I got a <br>
definitive, precise answer on the HOL4 list from Josef Urban by means of <br>
this wiki article and his short example of how to use the algorithm <br>
given in the article:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_by_definitions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_by_definitions</a></p>
<p>Why would I want to have continued to argue about what I was arguing <br>
about after I was given an algorithm I could use? Getting the algorithm <br>
was a major discovery. That I didn't learn about it from those other <br>
group of people is a bad mark against them. Other senior members on that <br>
list also helped me out too, but that wiki article and how to use it <br>
will potentially be very important in the future for me.)</p>
<p>Another tangent is that there is abstract language, language used to <br>
"get theoretical" as they say, and there is language which is <br>
extraordinarily precise and concrete, such as ML and the machine <br>
language it is ultimately reduced to.</p>
<p>So Andrej Bauer is at a major disadvantage in discussing whether free <br>
variables are implicitly universally quantified, because in his <br>
discussion, the phrase "free variables are implicitly universally <br>
quantified" is important, even if it is used informally to get to a <br>
formal end of things.</p>
<p>With a proof assistant such as Isabelle, the phrase "free variables are <br>
implicitly universally quantified" is an attempt to describe what the <br>
software is doing, but ultimately, the meaning of the phrase has no <br>
bearing on what the software does once the developer hits the compile <br>
button. To describe some things that the Isabelle code does, "free <br>
variables are implicitly universally quantified" is probably the best <br>
phrase to use, but if the phrase isn't used, it changes nothing. The <br>
code is compiled in stone, until it's compiled again. Decisions have <br>
been made to make concrete what has been theoretical and abstract.</p>
<p>With my limited knowledge, I take a shot at critiquing Andrej's post.</p>
<p>I think his reasoning for "Reason 6" could be a little faulty, that is, his</p>
<p>Perhaps we can just forbid free variables altogether and stipulate <br>
that all variables must always<br>
     be quantified. But how are you then going to prove (\forall x \in <br>
R. phi). The usual way</p>
<p>'Consider any x \in R. Then bla bla bla, therefore phi.'</p>
<p>is now forbidden because the first sentence introduces x as a free <br>
variable.</p>
<p>But the statement (\forall x \in R) as a standalone statement doesn't <br>
even make sense, so x couldn't be used as anything other than a free <br>
variable and have it make sense, in the traditional context of free and <br>
bound variables.</p>
<p>How about if we say, "All variables must be quantified except for <br>
variables in atomic formulas"? Kind of like how you start out in <br>
first-order logic. If x and y are variables, and if f is an binary <br>
relation, then f(x,y) is a formula. It wouldn't make any sense to be <br>
quantifying the variables in an atomic formula.</p>
<p>So, possibly, there wouldn't a problem with all variables being <br>
implicitly quantified, except for variables in atomic formulas, at least <br>
to deal with his simple example.</p>
<p>Okay, here I can ask the question, "In Isabelle, are all free variables <br>
implicitly universally quantified?".</p>
<p>To tie back into Andrej's example, in Isabelle, in certain contexts, it <br>
appears that free variables are implicitly universally quantified, but <br>
yet in Isabelle, there's an equivalent to Andrej's "Consider any (x \in <br>
R)", so it appears in Isabelle, there's no conflict between free <br>
variables being implicitly universally quantified and having free <br>
variables available to say "Let x be a real number."</p>
<p>But I wouldn't know. I haven't seen that in Isabelle it's been <br>
established that "all free variables are implicitly universally <br>
quantified". Some implications were shown, but exactly what's happening <br>
at the meta-logic level wasn't shown in detail.</p>
<p>But I would say that Andrej's discussion is a different discussion than <br>
any discussion about free variables in Isabelle. Take his "Consider any <br>
x \in R". What is its exact meaning? It doesn't have an exact meaning.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Isabelle's equivalent of saying "Let x be a real <br>
number" has an exact meaning, along with the rules in which "free <br>
variables get implicitly universally quantified", under whatever <br>
contexts those rules hold. The point is that the game changes when the <br>
abstract has been made precise and concrete.</p>
<p>Anyway, I put his blog in my RSS reader, and I'm backing up about 240 <br>
Gbytes of data to 8 Gbyte DVDs, so I have some time on my hands.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>You are right. In the way I put it, the relationship between Andrej´s<br>
article and the actual discussion carried in<br>
the list sounds (quite?) a bit misleading.</p>
<p>However, it was a kind of provocative attempt to bring the topic again. The<br>
answers were all there, spread through<br>
a number of different posts (and flames). Maybe I secretly wanted to begin<br>
this new year with a nice summary<br>
of that discussion.</p>
<p>what is the exact meaning if I write something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma "P x"<br>
where "P" is some formula with the free variable "x". In this context, a<br>
helpful answer is that free variables are implicitly universally<br>
quantified. A more cautious answer would be something like:<br>

meta-level for almost all purposes ;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One could hardly have done better than that.</p>
<p>In fact, in my humble opinion, a  more appropriate title for Andrej´s<br>
article would be along the lines of</p>
<p>"When free variables can be considered as universally quantified?" or even<br>
"On the role of [free, bound and quantified] variables in Computing and<br>
Mathematics"</p>
<p>So, it depends on the context, as you rightly put it above. In the same<br>
way, here in the list, everything we were discussing<br>
in these several [related] threads was essentially tied to the question</p>
<p>"When free variables are treated [interpreted] as universally quantified<br>
[in Isabelle]?"</p>
<p>Now  I can finally move on.</p>
<p>All the Best!</p>

<p>If I wouldn't have wrote the last email, that wouldn't have been a bad <br>
thing.</p>
<p>Anything I say more can be interpreted overall as me saying, "Hey, <br>
thanks all you developers for a great product. It's like the World Wide <br>
Web and the Internet, and technology in general. The newness can wear <br>
off, but I sometimes I still get that feeling again of 'this is awesome'".</p>
<p>HOW DO I RELATE IT TO...? (PART 1)</p>
<p>The article, as part of an answer by Josef, is related to my tangent in <br>
my last email. There is "trying to prove your point logically", and then <br>
there are "facts". Facts, once I'm aware of them, can change a whole lot <br>
of things, motivation being one of them.</p>
<p>You and Josef gave me facts. Prior to your example showing conclusively <br>
that implicit quantification is happening in Isabelle for free <br>
variables, Andrej's blog post might have put me in the "Hmmm, this has <br>
me worried. I need to think about this a whole lot to understand all of <br>
this."</p>
<p>But now, knowing the fact that implicit quantification is happening in <br>
Isabelle, I say, "Well, Andrej, you say it's bad for people to say 'a <br>
free variable is implicitly universally quantified', but with Isabelle, <br>
they don't just say it, they go a step further and, for all practical <br>
purposes, hardwire that concept in the code, at least for the logic that <br>
would apply to the examples in your post, which would be first-order <br>
logic. As to there being any problems and limitations with doing that, I <br>
don't know what those would be. Others can fight those battles if there <br>
are battles that need to be fought."</p>
<p>In the last email, I said his discussion is a different discussion, but <br>
surely it's still related. In his "Reason 6", he's making a big deal <br>
about us needing to be able to do a "Universal Generalization" proof, <br>
that is, by starting out with a arbitrary but fixed element of the real <br>
numbers, which, according to him, must be free, as represented by his <br>
"Consider any x /in R".</p>
<p>(Here, I may sound like I know that I know what I'm talking about, but <br>
what I actually know is that I occasionally make a good point, but, <br>
otherwise, am very wrong much of the time. I also attached a pertinent <br>
image from Bloch's "Proofs and Fundamentals". I love even basic books <br>
like that, but I wish my formal education would have started me out at a <br>
lower level, so I wouldn't have wasted so much time on discovery.)</p>
<p>So the facts you and Josef have given me have changed the nature of <br>
certain debates.</p>
<p>That Andrej is making a valid point, I assume he is. That I can learn <br>
something from him, well, I have learned something from his Epilogue, <br>
which basically tells me what Bloch's book tells me, that Universal <br>
Instantiation is equivalent to Universal Generalization, but by him <br>
saying it, it drives home a point that otherwise wouldn't have gotten <br>
driven home, especially because of our recent Isabelle "implicit <br>
quantification" discussion.</p>
<p>But back to facts and their value.</p>
<p>Adrej is getting dogmatic, which might have made me want to get dogmatic <br>
with him, but now I know certain facts, and I say, "Andrej, your <br>
discussion is ill-defined anyway. The Isabelle proof assistant has exact <br>
meaning in every statement we can make, and it could be that Isabelle's <br>
'Consider any x \in R' just becomes part of a big conjunction, which <br>
means we aren't truly doing a Universal Generalization proof. If we <br>
can't, then we can't. I'm not worried about it. Whatever the case, with <br>
Isabelle, there's something there rock solid to crtitique and attack if <br>
there's a problem."</p>
<p>The last sentence was part of my "Hey, developers. Is Isabelle a great <br>
product, or what?" That the complement might come at some other people's <br>
expense, that can happen, and I touch on that below.</p>
<p>HOW DO I RELATE IT TO...? (PART 2)</p>
<p>Mentioning the wiki article was a way to say something good about the <br>
people that contribute to the HOL4 mailing list, rather than to wait for <br>
some unlikely future date in which my complement would be completely on <br>
topic.</p>
<p>AN ANSWER TO WHAT QUESTION?</p>
<p>Here, if I didn't give you this link, that wouldn't be a bad thing, but <br>
there is some good information in the thread, in particular, the <br>
culmination of it all for me in which Josef gives me the Wiki link, and <br>
enough of an explanation that I was able to figure out the rest on my own.</p>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?set=custom&amp;viewmonth=201209&amp;viewday=&amp;forum_name=hol-info&amp;style=ultimate&amp;max_rows=100&amp;submit=Change+View">http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?set=custom&amp;viewmonth=201209&amp;viewday=&amp;forum_name=hol-info&amp;style=ultimate&amp;max_rows=100&amp;submit=Change+View</a></p>
<p>The eventual, precise question was, "Can you give me a first-order <br>
formula which uses no constants for the formula 'the empty set is in the <br>
empty set'".</p>
<p>The very precise answer was given by Josef here:</p>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=CAFP4q17T2pEZhzXc5L5t9-kWuOLkVVbxNPEQt-WZGp%3DHG_gCsw%40mail.gmail.com&amp;forum_name=hol-info">http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=CAFP4q17T2pEZhzXc5L5t9-kWuOLkVVbxNPEQt-WZGp%3DHG_gCsw%40mail.gmail.com&amp;forum_name=hol-info</a></p>
<p>WHAT ALGORITHM DO YOU MEAN?</p>
<p>The algorithm that Josef demonstrates when he converts "0 \in 0" to a <br>
FOL formula which only uses variables.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That I didn't learn about it from those other<br>
group of people is a bad mark against them.<br>
What is that supposed to mean?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if I didn't explain the meaning of that statement, it wouldn't be a <br>
bad thing. After all, to bash this other group of people on this mailing <br>
list is in bad taste.</p>
<p>However, this other group of people is the group of people from which I <br>
got my formal education and looked to for answers after getting my <br>
degree, where my formal education is a B. S. in math. "Group" would mean <br>
mathematicians as a whole. I don't actually have any substantial <br>
complaints about those mathematicians who were my professors.</p>
<p>My particular comment is related to the fact that in set theory books, <br>
I've repeatedly read that "in principle" we could do all set theory <br>
using first-order formulas, but we don't because it's way too <br>
impractical to actually do any of that, even just a little.</p>
<p>I accepted that at face value, until I learned just enough first-order <br>
logic to start getting serious about learning axiomatic set theory. At <br>
that point, I started to challenge their "in principle" statement <br>
because I started to see that first-order logic needs to immediately be <br>
supplemented as a language to be used.</p>
<p>I thought that there had to be symbols in the first-order logic <br>
specification to allow us to define constant symbols. Josef showed me I <br>
was wrong.</p>
<p>Why didn't I learn that from that other group of people? At the bedrock <br>
of ZF sets is the requirement that zero constants are given to us. <br>
That's not little. That's huge. The FOL specification allows constants <br>
to be given in a FOL language, but none are given to us, and <br>
immediately, after the first ZF axiom, set theorists start introducing <br>
constants. Now, after knowing what I'm looking for, I can see that a few <br>
mention it, but what's in the Wiki article doesn't appear to be the <br>
common knowledge that it should be.</p>
<p>I stop here, but I have a certain amount of cynicism about that other <br>
group. I can find ways to thank them later, but what have they done to <br>
help me be independent and get proof review? Nothing.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This thread is again in danger of getting long, so here are just some <br>
quick jokes from the Isabelle repertoire:</p>
<p>* Free variables are "fixed" (in a local context).</p>
<p>This terminology is stemming from Mizar and used in Isar as well, but<br>
     is actually an oxymoron.  Such variables are not variable at all.</p>
<p>* Schematic variables are "arbitrary" (after having left the context).<br>
     This is a useful formal device to make the variability of variables<br>
     formally clear.</p>
<p>So a properly fixed local variable acts like a local context that becomes <br>
arbitrary after leaving it.  In Isar this reads like this:</p>
<p>{<br>
     fix x :: 'a<br>
     have "B x" sorry<br>
   }<br>
   note <code>B a</code><br>
   note <code>B b</code><br>
   note <code>B c</code></p>
<p>In fact we can make this arbitrariness stronger within the logical <br>
framework:</p>
<p>{<br>
     fix x :: 'a<br>
     have "B x" sorry<br>
   }<br>
   note <code>⋀x. B x</code></p>
<p>Here it now looks as if the system would insert that postulated implicit <br>
quantifier, but it is actually not there, and bypassed in the internal <br>
reasoning.  These are just two ways to specify the same result: inspecting <br>
the machine state in the Output window, you will see schematic variables, <br>
not quantifiers.</p>
<p>Next joke: What about a free variable that is not properly "fixed"? <br>
Answer: it is an illegal immigrant into the logical context, without legal <br>
papers.  Practically it acts like an unspecified global constant, and can <br>
usually not be used productively in a proof.</p>
<p>This is the reason why Isar merely prints undeclared free variables with <br>
certain markup, but does not reject them: they are useful in <br>
pseudo-proofs, i.e. proof patterns like above.  The variables B, a, b, c <br>
are all been illegal immigrants, without anybody getting confused.</p>
<p>Here is one of the rare proofs where a totally undeclared formal entity <br>
can be used in a productively:</p>
<p>theorem Drinker's_Principle: "∃x. drunk x ⟶ (∀x. drunk x)"<br>
proof cases<br>
   assume "∀x. drunk x"<br>
   then have "drunk alien ⟶ (∀x. drunk x)" ..<br>
   then show ?thesis ..<br>
next<br>
   assume "¬ (∀x. drunk x)"<br>
   then obtain a where a: "¬ drunk a" by blast<br>
   have "drunk a ⟶ (∀x. drunk x)"<br>
   proof<br>
     assume "drunk a"<br>
     with a show "∀x. drunk x" by contradiction<br>
   qed<br>
   then show ?thesis ..<br>
qed</p>
<p>The alien does not need formal declaration at the custom's office, but I <br>
usually prefer to put a 'fix' in the proper spot nonetheless.</p>

I am not yet fully satisfied.</p>
<p>My preferred example is:</p>
<p>lemma "x = x"</p>
<p>When you write that in a context with undeclared x and (and its implicitly <br>
inferred most general type 'a with undeclared 'a), the system will <br>
implicitly augment the proof context by fix x :: 'a (and fix type 'a <br>
beforehand as well).</p>
<p>['a::TYPE, x::'a] is the so-called "Eigen-context" of the statement. <br>
There are two sides of this valuable coin:</p>
<p>(1) The proof context has its elements are fixed.</p>
<p>(2) The result (after export from the context) has makes them arbitrary.</p>
<p>The example above includes the situation for types as well, since it hints <br>
at the important principle of implicit polymorphism in the manner of <br>
Hindley-Milner.  The type language does not even have quantifiers, so <br>
there is no danger of claiming that they are introduced and eliminated <br>
somewhere in the belly of the logic -- they are simply not there.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is a slight difference in free term variables and free <br>
type variables: terms need to be fixed explicitly if meant to be universal <br>
in the end, but types are fixed implicitly according to the possibilities <br>
of the syntactic context.</p>
<p>Instead, when you write</p>
<p>lemma "!!x :: 'a. x = x"</p>
<p>you will have to fix the element in the proof before getting to the same <br>
proof context as before:</p>
<p>proof -<br>
     fix x :: 'a<br>
     ...<br>
   qed</p>
<p>This is called "formal noise" in Isar terminology.  Here is the well-known<br>
explicit way to avoid it:</p>
<p>lemma<br>
     fixes x :: 'a<br>
     shows "x = x"<br>
   proof -<br>
     ...<br>
   qed</p>
<p>So you build up a context with fixed x, then you state "x = x", in the end <br>
you get arbitrary "?x::?'a = ?x".</p>
