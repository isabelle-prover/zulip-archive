<p>From: Martin Ellis &lt;<a href="mailto:m.a.ellis@ncl.ac.uk">m.a.ellis@ncl.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I've been trying to model sequential hardware based on <br>
Tom Melham's "Higher Order Logic and Hardware Verification":<br>
<a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~tfm/Papers/HVbook.html">http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~tfm/Papers/HVbook.html</a></p>
<p>The idea is that there is:</p>
<ul>
<li>abstract time, maybe the duration of a clock cycle</li>
<li>
<p>concrete time, could represent a gate delay, or a femto-second,<br>
  or whatever, it doesn't really matter as long as its units are longer<br>
   than abstract time units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a predicate P t, which is true for every concrete time t for<br>
  which there is a corresponding abstract time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a relation Istimeof P n t, which is true iff P is true for the n'th time<br>
   at t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a function Time of P n, which I think is either defined<br>
   Timeof P n == (SOME t. Istimeof P n t); or<br>
   Timeof P n == (THE t. Istimeof P n t)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inf P is true iff P is True infinitely often:  ALL t.EX t'. t' &gt; t /\ P t'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>0    1           &lt; --- Abstract time</p>
<hr>
<p>|      \</p>
<hr>
<p>0 1 2 3 4    &lt;--- Concrete time<br>
T F F T F      &lt;--- P</p>
<p>I've been trying to show Theorem 6.1 in the book<br>
   Inf P --&gt; (EX! t. Istimeof P n t)<br>
which Melham suggests is proved by showing existence ("by induction on n") and <br>
uniqueness (also by induction on n) separately, but have two big problems.</p>
<p>Firstly, I don't seem to be able to do the induction step of the existence <br>
part.  I've attached my attempt...<br>
Looking at the definitions, I thought complete induction (using <br>
nat_less_induct) might be more appropriate  -  however I didn't get anywhere <br>
at all using that...</p>
<p>Secondly, I can't figure out how to do the uniqueness part.<br>
The file I've attached contains a simpler uniqueness proof, and I can't find <br>
any examples that suggest how I might approach it.<br>
(Actually, I read the "Advanced Induction Techniques" section in the tutorial, <br>
but still can't quite get there)</p>
<p>You'll understand that this rather scuppers all proof attempts I've made.</p>
<p>(The other thing I don't understand is that, although I can't prove lemmas of <br>
the form (Inf P) --&gt; Q, and hence (ALL t. EX t'. t &lt; t'  /\ P t) --&gt; Q,<br>
I do seem to be able to prove those of the form<br>
ALL t. EX t'. t &lt; t'  /\ P t --&gt; Q, i.e. where the quantifiers scope over the <br>
entire expression, including Q, rather than just the anticedent.  The reason <br>
I find this strange is because none of the quantified variables occur in Q.)</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest how to proceed?  I've spent the best part of a fortnight <br>
going around in circles.  :o(     Surely somebody has done this before, no?<br>
Perhaps there are more appropriate constructs in Isabelle/HOL to model this?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Martin<br>
