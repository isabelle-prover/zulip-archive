<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:christian.sternagel@uibk.ac.at">christian.sternagel@uibk.ac.at</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>recently I tried to embed some generated code more deeply into the <br>
Haskell standard library (by using Prelude functions whenever possible). <br>
The initial problem (which many of you may know) is that whenever in <br>
Isabelle you are using "nat" the corresponding Haskell function would <br>
use either Int or Integer... since many Prelude functions are using Int, <br>
lets just assume that Int should replace "nat" (ignoring the fact that <br>
nat's may get arbitrarily large but Int's don't).</p>
<p>First HOL/Library/Efficient_Nat.thy seemed exactly to be what I needed, <br>
but unfortunately it doesn't seem to hold what is claimed in the header: <br>
"The efficiency of the generated code can be improved<br>
drastically by implementing natural numbers by target-language<br>
integers.  To do this, just include this theory."</p>
<p>I did just import Efficient_Nat.thy, is there anything else to do <br>
afterwards (maybe for Haskell Integers are used instead of Int's?).</p>
<p>Does anybody have experience with using Efficient_Nat for Haskell <br>
code-generation?</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>chris</p>
<p>A minor comment: the code-generator setup for Haskell (in HOL.thy) <br>
declares "&amp;&amp;" and "||" as infixl, whereas in Haskell's Prelude they are <br>
declared infixr.</p>

Dear Christian,</p>
<p>Efficient_Nat does implement nat in terms of Haskell Integer, so the comment is <br>
not wrong - provided you import Efficient_Nat as the <em>last</em> theory in your <br>
import list in the theory where you invoke the Haskell code generator. Even if <br>
you have imported Efficient_Nat in some ancestor theory, reimport it.</p>
<p>However, nat is not literally translated to Integer, but wraps Integer in a type <br>
Nat (cf. the generated Nat.hs). This seems necessary to do because otherwise <br>
type class instantiations could not be Isabelle-specific, e.g., division by 0 is <br>
defined in Isabelle whereas not on Haskell integers. See also the comment in <br>
Efficient_Nat on this.</p>
<p>The easiest way to use the Haskell standard library is probably to unpack Nat to <br>
Integer via toInteger and to wrap it back via fromInteger whenever this is <br>
needed in your custom translations.</p>
<p>If you wish to replace Integer by Int, you will have to rewrite Efficent_Nat.thy <br>
to use Int in all Haskell translations.</p>
<p>Possibly, Florian can tell you more on that topic.</p>
<p>Andreas</p>

<p>thanks for pointing that out, this seems to have been wrong from the<br>
very beginning.  Fixed in the hg repository (rev b992c8e6394b).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Well, for Haskell indeed Integers are used for consistency.  But if your<br>
code involves massive computation on considerably large nats,<br>
Efficient_Nat should bring a considerable speedup.  Maybe the bottleneck<br>
is somewhere else?  A clear statement requires an inspection of the<br>
corresponding code.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>

Hello Christian,</p>
<p>we also provide the type code_numeral for Integers (Haskell Integer) for <br>
code generation, cf. src/HOL/Code_Numeral.thy</p>
<p>Currently, in development, I added a type code_int that I map to bounded <br>
Integers (Haskell int), cf. src/HOL/Library/Quickcheck_Narrowing.thy<br>
But I developed the necessary theory about code_int only as far as I <br>
needed it for my purpose.<br>
I am aware that the code generation setup for code_int could be <br>
potentially unsound, if you exploit overflows in some tricky way.</p>
<p>By this replacement, I have measured an overall 50% speed-up by <br>
replacing Integer by Int in my setting, the speed-up in the replaced <br>
parts must be even larger.</p>
<p>But from my experience, foreseeing or estimating possible performance <br>
increases in Isabelle's generated code is a difficult task.<br>
E.g., it is still unclear to me, if the resulting non-overlapping code <br>
equations from overlapping sequential function definitions make a <br>
measurable performance difference in the runtime of the generated code.</p>
<p>Of course, these dedicated types code_numeral and code_int are for some <br>
very special purposes,  evaluation by code generation, with ML, nbe and <br>
quickcheck, in the system.<br>
They do not provide much theorems to reason about them, and should be <br>
chosen with care.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:christian.sternagel@uibk.ac.at">christian.sternagel@uibk.ac.at</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks for all your fast answers,</p>
<p>just for clarification, I want to use Haskell's Int in order to be able <br>
to map many functions to Prelude functions (like mapping List.length :: <br>
'a list =&gt; nat to length :: [a] -&gt; Int). I'm aware that this might lead <br>
to inconsistencies (as Lukas already pointed out) -- not only because of <br>
potential overflows but also since you cannot be sure that the Prelude <br>
implementation is correct -- but for the time being I just wanted to be <br>
able to do it anyway :)</p>
<p>In the end I'm thinking of a "safe" version of the generated code and a <br>
"fast" version (using Int's and Prelude functions wherever possible).</p>
<p>It seems as if what Lukas has developed is exactly what I was searching <br>
for. But first I will thoroughly read through the code-generation manual <br>
(again) ;)</p>
<p>cheers</p>
