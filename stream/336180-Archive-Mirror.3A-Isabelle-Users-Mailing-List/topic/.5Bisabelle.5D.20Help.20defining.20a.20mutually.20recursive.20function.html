<p>From: Corey Richardson &lt;<a href="mailto:corey@octayn.net">corey@octayn.net</a>&gt;<br>
Greetings,</p>
<p>In a theory I'm working on, I'm having challenges defining a mutually<br>
recursive function.</p>
<p>Here's the repository and the particular function:</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/cmr/rust-semantics/blob/unsigned/MIR_SimpleEvals.thy#L38">https://gitlab.com/cmr/rust-semantics/blob/unsigned/MIR_SimpleEvals.thy#L38</a></p>
<p>I think I need to prove that read_array does not make a larger "t" for<br>
the higher-order function passed in. I'm not sure how to do this either.</p>
<p>pat_completeness auto also doesn't show completeness of the pattern<br>
matches, which I do not understand. They seem complete to me at least!</p>
<p>I also suspect I'll need some congruence rule for read_array, but even<br>
after studying examples of congruence rules from the functions.pdf and<br>
the Isabelle libraries, I'm not sure what it should be.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.<br>

Hi Corey,</p>
<p>let's start with the simple question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pat_completeness auto also doesn't show completeness of the pattern<br>
matches, which I do not understand. They seem complete to me at least!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are overlapping as you have written them down. As opposed to "fun",<br>
"function" by default does not consider pattern matches to be<br>
sequential. That is, your sixth equation matches everything the others<br>
matched, too. The fix is easy: use "function (sequential)" instead, and<br>
"pat_completeness auto" will solve it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I need to prove that read_array does not make a larger "t" for<br>
the higher-order function passed in. I'm not sure how to do this either.</p>
<p>I also suspect I'll need some congruence rule for read_array, but even<br>
after studying examples of congruence rules from the functions.pdf and<br>
the Isabelle libraries, I'm not sure what it should be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"read_array" looks complicated, because the calls of the callback<br>
function look quite irregular. Have you tried inlining the definition of<br>
"read_array", i.e. remove the callback and define it as part of the<br>
mutual bundle?</p>
<p>(In my personal experience, while this complicates some proofs because<br>
of the now three-way-mutual definition, it greatly simplifies some others.)</p>
<p>Also, the "Option.bind ... (Some o ValArray)" looks suspicious. Why are<br>
you "bind"ing if you're always feeding in a "Some"?</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>

<p>Ah, that's simple. Thanks!</p>

<p>I was avoiding it for the complication you mention. Adding it as another<br>
mutually recursive function indeed makes all my problems go away (for now).</p>

<p>I was using it as a poor-man's map_option, before I noticed that<br>
map_option existed! I was looking for <a href="http://Option.map">Option.map</a> and my search for<br>
constants used "'a option =&gt; ('a =&gt; 'b) =&gt; 'b option" instead of the<br>
other way around for the arguments.</p>
<p>Thanks Lars!<br>
