<p>From: <a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a><br>
While experimenting, I saw that Linux Proof General provides certain <br>
things that jEdit doesn't. Two being that the external provers work, and <br>
that Linux PG can do searches on the Isabelle source code.</p>
<p>I don't need either of those, but it would be nice to get all the <br>
information features that PG provides through the menus, such as "show <br>
types". This is because I would like to exclusively work in Cygwin jEdit.</p>
<p>Below, I reference a mailing list thread, and I give my input, but I'll <br>
make my request first.</p>
<p>REQUEST: It would be nice to have a help file that gives a short <br>
description of what the commands do that correspond with the many Proof <br>
General menu commands, such as "show types". Additionally, in the help <br>
file, it would be nice to have a screenshot which shows me what <br>
additional information I'm supposed to be looking for when I perform the <br>
command.</p>
<p>All that would take time, so I expect that I'll be firing up Proof <br>
General, looking for menu commands that give me useful information, and <br>
asking the mailing list what command I use to get that information in <br>
the source file.</p>
<p>Now, some details from a thread:</p>
<p>Tobias asked, "How can I see the possible cases in an induction, i.e. <br>
Show me cases in PG?"<br>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg02677.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg02677.html</a></p>
<p>Consequently, Larry asked for menus in jEdit that provides such things:<br>

<p>Markarius says it's non-trivial to implement diagnostic functions in the <br>
Isabelle/jEdit engine:<br>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg02683.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg02683.html</a></p>
<p>Brian Huffman says <br>
@@http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg02678.html@@:</p>
<p>You can type the command "print_cases" into your theory file (this<br>
    also works in PG).</p>
<p>But then the real question is, how do we expect new users to discover<br>
    this feature?</p>
<p>Brian's comment described and describes my situation. I knew I wanted to <br>
see types, and that PG would show types, and that "show_types" was being <br>
talked about in the tutorial, but I didn't know how to get jEdit to show <br>
me types.</p>
<p>I eventually figured out how to do it.</p>
<p>To show types in jEdit, I insert this command:<br>
       declare [[show_types]], or<br>
       ML{* Config.put show_types true;*}</p>
<p>However, I don't know where I found how to do those commands. I've done <br>
a grep on the Isablle distribution folder, and though I find <br>
"show_types" in certain PDFs, I don't find anything that explicitly <br>
tells me how to use it. This kind of thing is a problem for a newbie: <br>
I'm on page 3 of the tutorial, I want to see types, I know that Proof <br>
General's menus can activate showing types, but I don't want to use <br>
Proof General, I want to use jEdit.</p>
<p>Having a description of all the commands like "show_types" would be <br>
useful even if the Isabelle/jEdit engine had a menu system like Proof <br>
General. Inserting a series of commands like "declare [[show_types]]" <br>
into the source code would be useful when creating templates. It would <br>
also be useful to be able to put those commands into a source file <br>
that's imported by other source files.</p>
<p>As to menus that would insert these commands into the source code, <br>
that's very simple to create in jEdit. Any folder and macro files I put <br>
in my USER_HOME "Isabelle2012\jedit\macros" will show up under the <br>
jEdit/Macros dropdown menu.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of my jedit/macros folder. I've created a macro for <br>
"declare [[show_types]]":</p>
<p>jEdit allows you to record macros, but all I did was copy a line of <br>
macro code from another macro file. Inside "declare [[show_types]].bsh" <br>
is this line of code:</p>
<p>textArea.setSelectedText("declare [[show_types]]");</p>
<p>Through jEdit Options/jEdit/Shortcuts, I assigned a shortcut to this <br>
macro. I can delete and insert the command to my heart's content. After <br>
I get past page 3 of the tutorial, and I create a foundational theory <br>
that everything else imports, I might put these kind of commands in my <br>
foundational theory.</p>
<p>To summarize, it would be nice to have a list of commands like <br>
"show_types" with a description of what they do, and a screenshot <br>
showing the info they provide, if someone has the time to do that.</p>

<p>It is the most authentic and most up-to-date of Isabelle/Isar manuals.</p>
<p>You can see what Proof General emits on the <em>isabelle</em> process buffer, and <br>
then look up the command in the manual.  This does not really work for the <br>
stateful things, though.  For "show_types" you should read the general <br>
explanations about "configuration options" in the isar-ref manual, and <br>
maybe use 'print_configs' to get an idea what is available.  The isar-ref <br>
manual also has a formally generated index with hyperlinks.</p>
<p>Note that PDF files produced by Latex cannot be searched reliably for <br>
anything outside A-Za-z0-9.  So "show types" might work, but "show_types" <br>
not.  Complain to Don Knuth and Leslie Lamport about not using proper <br>
ASCII by default.</p>

<p>I was talking about Cygwin Proof General and jEdit for Isabelle2011. In <br>
either one, the provers either never came back with a message, or they <br>
came back with a timed-out message. Occasionally, they would return the <br>
results of what they could or couldn't prove. In Linux Proof General, <br>
the provers would start to return the results after a few seconds. I <br>
haven't tried any external provers in Isabelle2012. I'm interested in <br>
Isabelle as a theorem assistant.</p>

<p>I was talking about Proof General's feature to search the Isabelle logic <br>
theories for a keyword in the lemma names, theorem names, definition <br>
names, etc.. (Would that be the "Find Theorem" menu command?) I haven't <br>
seen that I can do that in jEdit. I use PowerGREP and a regular <br>
expression to search on the complete src/HOL folder. One like this:</p>
<p>(?x)<br>
     (class|definition|lemma|lemmas|name|theorem)[\s]+.*<br>
     (<br>
     (?&lt;![a-z])multiply<br>

<p>Ah, so "reliably" explains everything. In Acrobat, searching on <br>
"show_types" works in this isar-ref.pdf, <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/isar-ref.pdf">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/isar-ref.pdf</a>, which was created in <br>
January, 2011, and which I found now using Google to search on <br>
"show_types" and "isar-ref.pdf", but it doesn't work for Acrobat when <br>
searching in the latest 2012 isar-ref.pdf.</p>
<p>LaTeX is too amazing and generous as a product for me to complain to the <br>
primary authors. Complaining about that would be like me complaining to <br>
you about Isbelle when there's a decent workaround for some deficiency <br>
it has.</p>
<p>But in my pursuit for the best proof assistant, I did a little research <br>
on Lamport's TLA+2 <br>
(<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla2.html">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla2.html</a>).</p>
<p>Somewhere in my research, I read that it was using Isabelle as one of <br>
the provers, but to do the proving automatically. That's nice, I <br>
suppose, if you want automatic proving. For me, at this point, automatic <br>
proving is not what I want. The great thing about Isabelle is that it <br>
can do automatic proving, but it's also a proof assistant.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info,<br>

Thanks, Lars. I didn't find "find_theorems" in any of the docs, but I <br>
found some examples here:<br>
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs4161/10s2/Demo12.thy">http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs4161/10s2/Demo12.thy</a></p>
<p>I also found "src/Pure/Tools/find_theorems.ML". I'm trying to study some <br>
ML, so maybe I'll figure out completely how to use it from that file.</p>
<p>And there's also a short note in "Isabelle Primer for Mathematicians",<br>
<a href="http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/isabelle/Isabelle_Primer.pdf">http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/isabelle/Isabelle_Primer.pdf</a></p>
<p>The command is better than the Proof General menu command anyway.</p>

I didn't know yet that Acrobat Reader could cause such extra problems. <br>
Which version is it?</p>
<p>The tiny Sumatra PDF browser that is now bundled with Isabelle2012 seems <br>
to be able to find and copy paste "find theorems" (without underscore) in <br>
isar-ref.pdf without problems.  You get that by default when you invoke <br>
"isabelle doc isar-ref" in the Cygwin-Terminal. See also <br>

<p>Just on the day of the Isabelle2012 announcement Sumatra PDF was updated, <br>
which now causes some odd invitation to update when starting up the first <br>
time.  The positive aspect is that this project seems to be quite active, <br>
so that the Windows platform now gets a PDF rendering engine of equal or <br>
better quality than Poppler on Linux.</p>

I use Adobe Acrobat Pro X, which is the version that lets you edit the <br>
PDFs. When I do a search on "find" in isar-ref.pdf, only "Find" on page <br>
221 is found. I get the same results with Adobe Reader X.</p>
<p>I did searches with two other PDF readers: STDU Viewer <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.stdutility.com/stduviewer.html">http://www.stdutility.com/stduviewer.html</a>&gt;, and PDF-XChange Viewer <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-viewer">http://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-viewer</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>The STDU Viewer search returns the same results as Adobe. The <br>
PDF-XChange Viewer search finds lots of "find", including "find <br>
theorems" for the command "find_theorems".</p>
<p>On page 30, I selected "finding" in the 3 PDF viewers and the 1 PDF <br>
editor mentioned above. I copied the text into a text file. Here's what <br>
I get:</p>
<p>?nding (PDF-XChange)<br>
?nding (STDU Viewer)</p>
<p>nding (Adobe Reader X)</p>
<p>nding (Adobe Acrobat Pro X)</p>
<p>Which is not what I really got in the text editor. There were two <br>
non-"f" or non-"i" characters preceding "nding" for Adobe.</p>
<p>It appears it's as Lars says about the "fi", and PDF-XChange does some <br>
extra work to find the "fi" in a word, and Acrobat doesn't.</p>

I've done investigations occasionally over the years -- it is an old and <br>
well-known problem, and still waiting for really good solutions.</p>
<p>My last attempt was stopped in winter 2011, see <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/annotate/Isabelle2012/doc-src/pdfsetup.sty">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/annotate/Isabelle2012/doc-src/pdfsetup.sty</a> <br>
with the critical \iffalse to disable the "experimental treatment of <br>
replacement text".</p>
<p>I had first started with cmap as recommended on the above stackexchange. <br>
One of the aspects mentioned in that thread is old OT1 vs. T1.  I had <br>
other motivations than "fi" ligatures to use T1, but it did not work out <br>
for two reasons, IIRC: (1) conflict with the rail package for syntax <br>
diagrams, (2) lack of scalable cm fonts for T1.</p>
<p>Point (1) no longer applies, since @{rail} is now an Isabelle <br>
antiquotation (see the isar-ref manual for its documentation).</p>
<p>Point (2) -- status unknown.  Maybe some improvements have emerged in the <br>
meantime.</p>
<p>in 2010/2011 I ended up trying something completely different, using <br>
"ActualText" markup for PDF.  It essentially allows to define a plain text <br>
model for the rendered text.  This is a nice idea, but most browsers still <br>
have problems with it.  Trying it again just now with the above <br>
pdfsetup.sty and \ifpdf instead of \iffalse to activate the markup, it <br>
produces the following result for isar-ref.pdf of Isabelle2012: <br>
<a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/test/isar-ref.pdf">http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/test/isar-ref.pdf</a></p>
<p>Using latest Acrobat Reader 10.1.3 in Windows 7 on the Isar proof on page <br>
10/11 and copy/pasting into Isabelle/jEdit works <em>almost</em>:</p>
<p>+ Isabelle symbols fine, but need to be decoded on target<br>
   + hidden quotes around inner syntax fine, but sometimes odd extra spaces<br>
   - indentation is lost<br>
   - page header gets in the way<br>
   - fi ligatures don't work, e.g. "finally"</p>
<p>Sumatra PDF 2.1 just ignores the ActualText markup, but is able to copy <br>
the "finally" correctly :-)</p>
<p>Over all these years there has been a tension of HTML vs. PDF.  I <br>
originally preferred proof documents with proper typesetting and <br>
pagination, but this now gets in the way for fully formal online text.</p>
<p>My hope is that someone who really understands HTML4/CSS2 or HTML5/CSS3 <br>
could give some hints how to make high-quality rendering of formal <br>
documents like the Isabelle manuals, or any other Isabelle document<br>
from applications.</p>
