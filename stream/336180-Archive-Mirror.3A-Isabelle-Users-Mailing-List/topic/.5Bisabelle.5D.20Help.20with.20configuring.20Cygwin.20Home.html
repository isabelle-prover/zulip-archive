Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying (but failing) to use Isabelle in conjunction with another tool, Symphony. My system runs Windows 7 OS. Let me just add that I could run Isabelle from the jEdit interface, on the ToyList example from the tutorial.<br>
In order to do the above, I need to have write permissions to my Isabelle heaps directory, which is a subdirectory of the following location.</p>
<p>$USER_HOME/.isabelle</p>
<p>The directory $USER_HOME is nothing but the home directory as per Cygwin installation (that is what I gather, I could be wrong).<br>
But this directory seems to be picked up from a network location, as the machine is part of a domain at the university.<br>
I do not have write permissions to that directory, and would like to change it to a directory on my local drive.</p>
<p>Does anybody know how to do this? Thanks in anticipation.</p>

<p>Can you say what Symphony is, and how it needs to be connected to <br>
Isabelle?  A quick web search gives the following <br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_%28software%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_%28software%29</a></p>

<p>That is a bit odd.  The separate $USER_HOME (instead of better known <br>
$HOME) was introduced specifically for the purpose of Windows and Cygwin, <br>
to refer to the normal Windows user home directory, not the one within the <br>
Cygwin root.</p>
<p>We need to figure out where that $USER_HOME comes from.  The default is <br>
determined like this:</p>
<p>if [ -z "$USER_HOME" ]; then<br>
     USER_HOME="$(cygpath -u "$HOMEDRIVE\\$HOMEPATH")"<br>
   fi</p>
<p>This assumes that there is no other source for a different $USER_HOME and <br>
that "$HOMEDRIVE\\$HOMEPATH" refer to the correct location.</p>

<p>Does that mean Isabelle is installed centrally on a network drive?  That <br>
is basically OK -- it used to be done like that often in the past -- but <br>
in recent years it came out of use since people usually have their private <br>
machines.</p>
