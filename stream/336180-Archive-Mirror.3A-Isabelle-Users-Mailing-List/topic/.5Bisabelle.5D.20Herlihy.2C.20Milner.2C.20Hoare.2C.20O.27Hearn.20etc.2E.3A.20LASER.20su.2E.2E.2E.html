LASER Summer School on Software Engineering</p>
<p>Concurrency and Correctness<br>
September 7 - 13, 2008<br>
Elba Island, Italy</p>
<p>Registration is open until June 30th</p>
<p>The LASER summer school this year (7-13 September 2008), held in a magnificent setting on Elba Island, is devoted to concurrency, with a particularly exciting slate of speakers: Tryggve Fossum (Intel), Maurice Herlihy, Tony Hoare (as guest lecturer), Robin Milner, Peter O'Hearn, Daniel Reed. Please see the details at</p>
<p><a href="http://se.ethz.ch/laser">http://se.ethz.ch/laser</a></p>
<p>Goals</p>
<hr>
<p>The LASER school is intended both for researchers (including PhD students) and for professional software engineers and managers who want to benefit from the best in software <br>
technology advances. The focus of LASER is resolutely practical, although theory is welcome to establish solid foundations. The format of the school favors extensive interaction <br>
between participants and speakers.</p>
<p>Topics and speakers</p>
<hr>
<p>The IT industry, and with it the software research community, are at a crossroads: the end of Moore's law as we know it. The only way to continue delivering needed advances <br>
in computational power is to rely on concurrent techniques, such as multicore architectures. But while extensive research has been conducted on concurrent programming <br>
for decades, it remains extremely hard to guarantee the correctness of realistic concurrent computations. The 2008 LASER summer school examines issues and solutions in depth.</p>
<p>The speakers are among the most respected experts in the field: </p>
<ul>
<li>Tryggve Fossum, Director of Microarchitecture Development at Intel</li>
<li>Maurice Herlihy, Brown University</li>
<li>Robin Milner, Cambridge University</li>
<li>Peter O'Hearn, Queen Mary University of London</li>
<li>Daniel A. Reed, Microsoft Research and UNC Chapel Hill</li>
</ul>
<p>with Tony Hoare for a special guest lecture.</p>
<p>How to apply?</p>
<hr>
<p>Use the on-line registration form available on the LASER website <a href="http://laser.inf.ethz.ch">http://laser.inf.ethz.ch</a>.<br>
Registration is open until June 30th. The number of participants is strictly limited to ensure quality interaction with the lecturers and the rest of <br>
the audience. For more information, visit our website or contact the organizers at <a href="mailto:laser@se.inf.ethz.ch">laser@se.inf.ethz.ch</a>.</p>
<p>Venue</p>
<hr>
<p>As in previous years, LASER is held in the magnificent setting of the Elba island off the coast of Tuscany, easily reachable by plane (Pisa) and train. </p>
