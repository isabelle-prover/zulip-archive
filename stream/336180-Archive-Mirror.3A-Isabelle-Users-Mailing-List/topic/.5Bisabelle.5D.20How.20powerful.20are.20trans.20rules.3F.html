<p>From: Joachim Breitner &lt;<a href="mailto:breitner@kit.edu">breitner@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I’m quite fond of "also ... also ... finally" chains, as they tend to<br>
remove a lot of distracting technicalities from a proof.</p>
<p>When working with HOLCF proofs, I would like to do proofs like this:</p>
<p>notepad<br>
        begin<br>
          fix a b c d f g<br>
          have "a ⊑ f ⋅ b" sorry<br>
          also have "b ⊑ g ⋅ c" sorry<br>
          also have "c ⊑ d" sorry<br>
          finally<br>
          have "a ⊑ f ⋅ (g ⋅ d)".<br>
        end</p>
<p>I currently do that by hard-coding all the variants of the trans rule<br>
that I need:</p>
<p>lemma [trans]:  "a ⊑ f ⋅ b ⟹ b ⊑ c ⟹ a ⊑ f ⋅ c"<br>
          by (erule below_trans) (intro monofun_cfun_fun monofun_cfun_arg)<br>
        lemma [trans]:  "a ⊑ f ⋅ b ⟹ f ⊑ g ⟹ a ⊑ g ⋅ b"<br>
          by (erule below_trans) (intro monofun_cfun_fun monofun_cfun_arg)<br>
        lemma [trans]:  "a ⊑ f ⋅ (g ⋅ b) ⟹ b ⊑ c ⟹ a ⊑ f ⋅ (g ⋅ c)"<br>
          by (erule below_trans) (intro monofun_cfun_fun monofun_cfun_arg)<br>
        lemma [trans]: "a ⊑ f ⋅ b ⋅ c ⋅ d ⟹ b ⊑ b' ⟹ a ⊑ f ⋅ b' ⋅ c ⋅ d"<br>
          by (erule below_trans) (intro monofun_cfun_fun monofun_cfun_arg)<br>
        lemma [trans]:  "a ⊑ f ⋅ b ⋅ c ⋅ d ⟹ c ⊑ c' ⟹ a ⊑ f ⋅ b ⋅ c' ⋅ d"<br>
          by (erule below_trans) (intro monofun_cfun_fun monofun_cfun_arg)<br>
        lemma [trans]:  "a ⊑ f ⋅ (g ⋅ b) ⋅ c ⋅ d ⟹ g ⊑ g' ⟹ a ⊑ f ⋅ (g' ⋅ b) ⋅ c ⋅ d"<br>
          by (erule below_trans) (intro monofun_cfun_fun monofun_cfun_arg)<br>
        lemma [trans]:  "a ⊑ f ⋅ b ⋅ (g ⋅ c ⋅ d) ⋅ e ⟹ d ⊑ d' ⟹ a ⊑ f ⋅ b ⋅ (g ⋅ c ⋅ d') ⋅ e"<br>
          by (erule below_trans) (intro monofun_cfun_fun monofun_cfun_arg)</p>
<p>This works, but is rather inflexible and does not scale. And note that<br>
all those trans rules are solved by the same set of rules.</p>
<p>How can I improve that?</p>
<p>One thing I tried was to use</p>
<p>lemma strong_trans[trans]:<br>
          "a ⊑ f x ⟹ x ⊑ y ⟹ cont f ⟹ a ⊑ f y " sorry</p>
<p>This way, the calculation above become</p>
<p>cont (Rep_cfun f) ⟹ cont (λa. f⋅(g⋅a)) ⟹ a ⊑ f⋅(g⋅d)</p>
<p>so using "by simp" instead of "." finishes this. But I find this<br>
annoying (I really like to finish with "finally ?something.").</p>
<p>Is there a way to have the side-condition already checked by "trans" (by<br>
solving it with "intro cont2cont", for example), so that that they never<br>
show up to the user?</p>
<p>That rule also breaks antisymmetry proofs like</p>
<p>notepad<br>
        begin<br>
          fix a b c :: "'a ::cpo"<br>
          have "a ⊑ b" sorry<br>
          also have "b ⊑ c" sorry<br>
          also have "c ⊑ a" sorry<br>
          finally<br>
          have "a = c".<br>
        end</p>
<p>as the calculation at the end will be the unhelpful theorem</p>
<p>cont (λa. a) ⟹ cont (λa. a) ⟹ a ⊑ a.</p>
<p>can I avoid that?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>

<p>That is just the standard question about all structure proof elements: Is <br>
it sufficient to have some fixed scheme of rule application that is <br>
parameterized by facts from the library?  Or is there a need to allow <br>
arbitrary tool implementations in that slot (in Isabelle/ML).  15 years <br>
ago the question was on the table, and the answer was that plain rules for <br>
'also' are usually sufficient.</p>

<p>I’m not sure. Last time I tried it I was not satisfied for some reason,<br>
although that reason did not show up when preparing the small example<br>

<p>I think my annoyance is purely aesthetically, and – picky as I get – the<br>
aesthetics of the intermediate calculations. To me, the "cont" side<br>
conditions above feel out of place, as they hold already by the types<br>
and simple rule of composition.</p>
<p>Also, to the reader, a "by simp" at the end could potentially do many<br>
things, where a "finally show ?thesis." tells the reader that nothing<br>
fancy is happening at the end.</p>
<p>But as I said, its mostly code aesthetics: worth asking if there is a<br>
nicer way – not worth worrying about if there is not.</p>

<p>Thanks, I didn’t know that before (and I must have overread that part in<br>
the docs). I think I’ll play around with that.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
In some sense the side conditions are deferred to the very end, and thus <br>
displaced.  The final "by simp" can make this feel a bit wobbly, since it <br>
dilutes the application of the last fact, with the solving of the side <br>
conditions.</p>
<p>This can be refined: a "." merely abbreviates "by this", and the latter <br>
can have a terminal method for the solving of the remainder:</p>
<p>...<br>
   finally show ?thesis by this simp_all</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>...<br>
   finally show ?thesis by this auto</p>
<p>The proof method "this" does not appear very often under its proper name <br>
in Isar proofs, but it is a perfectly normal structured method like <br>
"rule".</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>that’s a good suggestion. I now use</p>
<p>finally show ?thesis by this (intro cont2cont)+</p>
<p>everywhere, and (at least to the adept reader), this signals „The<br>
conclusion of the calculation is used unmodified, while the accumulated<br>
side conditions are all of the form "cont something" and solved using<br>
the usual cont2cont rules.</p>
<p>This even composes well with the few cases where I had<br>
        finally show ?thesis by (rule foobar)<br>
which now simply become<br>
        finally show ?thesis by (rule foobar) (intro cont2cont)+</p>
<p>(I am a big fan of "intro"; I find it the most predictable method beyond<br>
single-stepping with rule and subst).</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
