<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Lee,</p>
<p>I assume you're working in Isabelle/HOL, with an entry point of<br>
importing Complex_Main, and not extending HOL with any axioms of your own.</p>
<p>SHORT ANSWER PART 1: HOL is a logic, with a defined set of axioms (all<br>
of which are not clearly made known to users in the Isabelle<br>
literature), and as with mathematics in general, you are free to define<br>
algebraic operations, but what you can or cannot prove is dependent on<br>
your definitions, and on the HOL axioms.</p>
<p>SHORT ANSWER PART 2 (the global law of spheres of mathematical influence) :</p>
<p>a) In general, our proofs about math that are of interest to us, are of<br>
no interest to others, and</p>
<p>b) if the math we're interested in is of no great, practical value, not<br>
only are others not interested in any proofs about such math, they're<br>
most likely not interested in the math.</p>
<p>SHORT ANSWER PART 3: Back to part 1, and with part 2 in mind, it's up to<br>
you to show what can or cannot be done in Isabelle/HOL, for what hasn't<br>
been done in Isabelle/HOL, for what you're interested in.</p>
<p>SHORT ANSWER PART 4: The above explains my approach, based on my past<br>
observations of the culture of mathematics. But even big time players,<br>
in all cultures, have a hard time getting people interested in what<br>
they're doing. Google, with millions of dollars in funding, couldn't get<br>
people very much interested in Google+, and as people got bored with<br>
Myspace, they will most likely get bored with Facebook.</p>
<p>That's the short answer.</p>
<p>I'll leave off the long answer, involving my opinions about marketing,<br>
and how marketing is generally necessary to draw people into what we are<br>
doing, and what we are interested in.</p>
<p>Personally, what I have in mind is dance, trance, and disco, where the<br>
disco will hopefully be kept to a minimum, especially the display of<br>
gold chains, by means of leaving unbuttoned the top three buttons of a<br>
yellow, polyester shirt.</p>
<p>But even trance can be risky. It's not that my professional reputation<br>
can be tarnished, since I have no professional reputation. It's that if<br>
one has heard 4 measures of trance, one has heard 4 hours of trance,<br>
which we could rephrase as the Law of Trance, "If one has heard 4<br>
measures of trance, one has heard 4 hours of trance."</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>
