Dear All,</p>
<p>Today, I found myself struggling to resolve a, seemingly, very trivial<br>
issue. I am trying to obtain a list of all type variables that are declared<br>
in a proof context. It does not seem that the relevant data is exposed to<br>
the public interface. However, most likely, I am missing something.</p>
<p>Here is a minimal example:</p>
<p>val ctxt = @{context};<br>
val T = TVar (("'a", 0), ["Groups.plus"]);<br>
val ctxt = Variable.declare_typ T ctxt;<br>
(* val declTs = obtain_declared_types ctxt ? *)</p>
<p>Please note that I am aware of the function Variable.is_declared. However,<br>
seemingly, this function merely performs a check based on the name context<br>
and, therefore, does not include the schematic (type) variables.</p>
<p>The use case is the generation of fresh schematic type variables.<br>
Therefore, if a solution to this problem can already be found somewhere in<br>
the source code, it may be a suitable alternative to the answer to the<br>
original question. Nevertheless, I would still highly prefer to understand<br>
how to obtain all declared type variables.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Yes, I think this is not exposed. As I understand it, it is more of an<br>
implementation detail, and the "invent fresh names" operations are what<br>
you are supposed to use.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In this case, I would probably generate fixed type variables first (cf.<br>
Variable.invent_types) and then generalize the final results (terms,<br>
theorems) (cf. Variable.export_*)</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

Dear Alexander Krauss/All,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. It is very useful to know that the functionality<br>
that I was looking for is not available.</p>
<p>Indeed, my problem is slightly superficial and, generally, can be resolved<br>
by following one of the more traditional approaches, like the one that you<br>
suggested at the end of your email. Nevertheless, it seems that using such<br>
traditional approaches would result in redundant computations, given the<br>
problem at hand. Perhaps, there is another way to proceed. I would like to<br>
know if there is a way to reduce all indexnames in a theorem to zero in a<br>
context-aware fashion (please note that I am aware of the function<br>
Drule.zero_var_indexes, but it ignores the local context). Such a function<br>
could provide an efficient alternative to the solution of the problem that<br>
I am dealing with.</p>
<p>As a side note, it seems that making a functionality that shows all<br>
entities declared in a context or, better yet, a context difference<br>
function would be very useful for the purposes of<br>
inspection/testing/verification/debugging. For example, I would like to<br>
ensure that my modules do not leave any redundant entities in the context.<br>
Given the information in your previous email, it seems that this is<br>
something that one cannot do at the moment.</p>
<p>I would also like to make another remark that has some connection to the<br>
problem that I was trying to solve. I encountered a behaviour which I find<br>
difficult to understand. Somehow, given a locale context with declared<br>
(type) variables, it is still possible to register theorems in the locale<br>
context that, seemingly, ignore the sorts/types associated with the<br>
previously declared variables (see the code listing after my signature).<br>
Somehow, I was under the (seemingly, erroneous) impression that, unlike<br>
constants, variables are only allowed to have one type/sort in the same<br>
context... does there exist any documentation that explains this behaviour?<br>
The only references that I could find on this matter were in the<br>
implementation manual (p. 65 and p. 69):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>"The core logic handles the type variables with the same name but<br>
different sorts as different, although the type-inference layer (which is<br>
outside the core) rejects anything like that."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Type-inference rejects variables of the same name, but different types.<br>
In contrast, mixed instances of polymorphic constants occur routinely."<br>
However, these references do not explicitly state that it is, indeed, legal<br>
and appropriate to use the same variable with different type/sort in the<br>
same context. Why are the users allowed to forego a type inference before<br>
registering a theorem in a context or creating a proveable goal? Are there<br>
any practical use cases for this allowance? Most certainly, it enables the<br>
construction of slightly peculiar theorems. For example, I was able to<br>
produce the following theorem (see the code listing below):<br>
"(B::'b::plus) = B ⟹ B::'b::type ≡ B"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>declare [[show_sorts]]</p>
<p>locale myloc =<br>
  fixes B :: "'b::plus"<br>
  assumes "B ≡ B"<br>

<p>lemma tt: "True ≡ True" by auto</p>

<p>(*<br>
It seems that it is possible to produce theorems in the locale<br>
context that use the default sort 'type' both for the schematic type<br>
variable<br>
with the indexname ("'a", 0) and the fixed type variable with the name 'b,<br>
as well as the type "'b::type" for the fixed variable B.<br>
Nevertheless, the sorts of the declared types are still '<a href="http://Groups.plus">Groups.plus</a>'. This<br>
can be observed by trying to state the lemmas from the previous example:</p>
<p>schematic_goal "(?A::?'a::type) = ?A"<br>
lemma "(Q::'b::type) = (Q::'b::type)"</p>
<p>which results in the same error as before.</p>
