<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>There's the meta-and, &amp;&amp;&amp;, but I need a meta-or, so I don't have to <br>
define two meta-or operators to keep from using PROP. After giving a <br>
summary, I show what I found in pure_thy.ML, but I don't know how to <br>
make it work.</p>
<p>As it is, I have to define two meta-or operators to not have to use PROP:</p>
<p>definition orbb :: "bool ⇒ bool ⇒ prop" (infixr "||" 15) where<br>
"orbb P Q == (!!R. (P ==&gt; R) ==&gt; (Q ==&gt; R) ==&gt; R)"</p>
<p>definition orbp :: "bool ⇒ prop ⇒ prop" (infixr "|||" 15) where<br>
"orbp P Q == (!!R. (P ==&gt; R) ==&gt; (PROP Q ==&gt; R) ==&gt; R)"</p>
<p>(<em>Life is messy with two operators.</em>)<br>
theorem<br>
"(A ||| (B || C)) ==&gt; (A | (B | C))"<br>
apply(simp add: orbb_def orbp_def)<br>
by(smt)</p>
<p>(<em>Life is clean with &amp;&amp;&amp;.</em>)<br>
theorem<br>
"(A &amp;&amp;&amp; (B &amp;&amp;&amp; C)) ==&gt; (A &amp; (B &amp; C))"<br>
by(linarith)</p>
<p>If there's a &amp;&amp;&amp;, then it seems there should be the complete suite of <br>
basic meta operators, along the lines of lines 175 to 183 in HOL.thy.</p>
<p>In pure_thy.ML, I found these lines for &amp;&amp;&amp;:</p>
<p>val typ = Simple_Syntax.read_typ;<br>
val prop = Simple_Syntax.read_prop;<br>
val const = Lexicon.mark_const;</p>
<p>Sign.add_syntax_i [(const "Pure.conjunction", typ "prop =&gt; prop =&gt; <br>
prop", Infixr ("&amp;&amp;&amp;", 2))];<br>
Sign.add_consts_i [(<a href="http://Binding.name">Binding.name</a> "conjunction", typ "prop =&gt; prop =&gt; <br>
prop", NoSyn)];<br>
(Global_Theory.add_defs false o map Thm.no_attributes)<br>
[(<a href="http://Binding.name">Binding.name</a> "conjunction_def", prop "(A &amp;&amp;&amp; B) == (!!C::prop. (A ==&gt; <br>
B ==&gt; C) ==&gt; C)")];<br>
Sign.hide_const false "Pure.conjunction";</p>
<p>I tried to modify them like this to get my meta-or, but I can't make it <br>
work:</p>
<p>ML{*<br>
val typ = Simple_Syntax.read_typ;<br>
val prop = Simple_Syntax.read_prop;<br>
val const = Lexicon.mark_const;</p>
<p>Sign.add_syntax_i [(const "MFZ.meta_or", typ "prop =&gt; prop =&gt; prop", <br>
Infixr ("|||", 2))];<br>
Sign.add_consts_i [(<a href="http://Binding.name">Binding.name</a> "meta_or", typ "prop =&gt; prop =&gt; prop", <br>
NoSyn)];<br>
(Global_Theory.add_defs false o map Thm.no_attributes)<br>
[(<a href="http://Binding.name">Binding.name</a> "meta_or_def", prop "(A ||| B) == (!!R::prop. (P ==&gt; R) <br>
==&gt; (Q ==&gt; R) ==&gt; R)")];<br>
Sign.hide_const false "MFZ.meta_or";<br>
*}</p>
<p>If anyone can do a quick edit to make that work, I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I found a faster solution, so I don't know if I need what I asked for. <br>
However, it shows that a person might want to define a function using <br>
type prop, and not have to annotate everything with PROP, and need not <br>
to have to fight the automatic Trueprop coercion.</p>
<p>But I'm trying to duplicate the functionality of the right-hand side of <br>
a sequent without resorting to the object-logic operators.</p>
<p>According to pg.203 of isar-ref.pdf, if you have a sequent "A |- E, B, <br>
C, D", then you can negate all the right-hand side members except for <br>
one of them, and make a big implication out of it, with the non-negated <br>
member put to the far right, like "A ==&gt; ~E ==&gt; ~C ==&gt; ~D ==&gt; B".</p>
<p>So rather than implement the right-hand side as a meta-disjunction, I <br>
stay closer to what's in isar-ref.pdf. It's faster and acceptably meta. <br>
I have to use variables of type bool, along with False, which equals <br>
(!P. P), but the rest is ==&gt;.</p>
<p>The simplifier seems to like working directly with True and False, <br>
rather than lower-level definitions.</p>
<p>I still have to use two operators:</p>
<p>notation ==&gt; (infixr "|-" 4)</p>
<p>definition seqr :: "bool =&gt; bool =&gt; prop" (infixr "||" 15) where<br>
   "seqr P Q == ((P ==&gt; False) ==&gt; Q)"<br>
thm seqr_def</p>
<p>definition seql :: "bool =&gt; prop =&gt; prop" (infixr "|||" 15) where<br>
   "seql P Q == ((P ==&gt; False) ==&gt; PROP Q)"<br>
thm seql_def</p>
<p>theorem<br>
   "   (A |- (~E ==&gt; ~C ==&gt; ~D ==&gt; B))<br>
   ==&gt; (A |- (E ||| B ||| C || D))"<br>
apply(auto simp only: seqr_def seql_def)<br>
done</p>
<p>theorem<br>
   "   (A |- (E ||| B ||| C || D))<br>
   ==&gt; (A |- (~E ==&gt; ~C ==&gt; ~D ==&gt; B))"<br>
apply(auto simp only: seqr_def seql_def)<br>
done</p>
<p>It seems right.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

In principle you could define all the standard connectives of Isabelle/HOL <br>
in Isabelle/Pure as well, but what is the point?</p>
<p>The purpose of Isabelle/Pure is to provide a framework for higher-order <br>
natural deduction, with declarative rule structure indicated by the <br>
connectives !! and ==&gt; (i.e. Minimal Higher-order Logic).  Anything beyond <br>
that is not really pure.</p>
<p>Note that &amp;&amp;&amp; is merely used internally as auxilary device -- it should <br>
hardly ever occur in applications of Isabelle/Pure (or HOL).  You just use <br>
multiple propositions directly in Isar like this:</p>
<p>lemma A and B and C<br>
   proof -<br>
     show A sorry<br>
     show B sorry<br>
     show C sorry<br>
   qed</p>
<p>You better chose to ignore that the internal system state somewhere <br>
involves "A &amp;&amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp;&amp; C" -- it is never encountered in a regular proof.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Makarius,</p>
<p>For myself, the point has become more general. Having meta-connectives <br>
would now be a result of being able to define functions using "prop", <br>
such as "prop =&gt; prop", "prop =&gt; prop =&gt; prop", etc., and have the <br>
functions coexist nicely with Trueprop coercion just like <br>
meta-implication does, that is, not having to annotate the variables <br>
with PROP, and Trueprop not trying to coerce when it's not supposed to.</p>
<p>For me, the general point is to do formalizations about other logics <br>
within HOL, and be able to keep those formalizations respectably <br>
separate from the object-logic functions, definitions, axioms, etc., <br>
until I intentionally want to mix the (mostly) meta-logic with the <br>
object-logic.</p>
<p>I don't know that it has to be about formalizing other logics. If you <br>
had an Isar definition and Isar abbreviation command that allowed a <br>
person to define functions using prop, and the functions behaved nicely <br>
like ==&gt;, then people would find a use for those commands.</p>
<p>I now have the perfect function to make my point, which is not the <br>
meta-or I asked for at first. The meta-or I initially wanted sort of <br>
fell under the "what is the point" category. Meta-or is "(!!R. (P ==&gt; R) <br>
==&gt; (Q ==&gt; R) ==&gt; R)", so to make it practical to use, you would have to <br>
start defining a bunch of simp rules, and then you'd end up asking, "And <br>
why exactly am I duplicating all the simp rules that have been created <br>
for \&lt;or&gt;?"</p>
<p>My function now is, "((P ==&gt; False) ==&gt; Q)", which requires absolutely <br>
nothing additional to use. If I want to go total meta (other than bool <br>
variables), then I can replace False with "(!!P Q. P == Q::bool)", which <br>
would only require a simp rule to convert the meta-False back to False, <br>
since meta-False by itself can make simplification slower.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You're the authority, but my inclination is to say that a logic is <br>
defined by its axioms, so I'm inclined to say that any logic that is <br>
derived using only Pure is Pure. Even with a little bit of corruption, <br>
like having to use bool variables, I'd say it can be considered Pure, <br>
practically speaking. I'm just a novice here speaking.</p>
<p>You talk about Isabelle/Pure as a framework, but I don't see the problem <br>
with taking the framework to its limits, though there would have to be <br>
Isar commands to facilitate that, or ML templates that can be used to <br>
define "prop" based functions that behave like ==&gt;.</p>
<p>My interest in this evolved due to sequents. The LHS of a sequent is a <br>
conjunction, which matches the use of ==&gt; perfectly. The RHS of a <br>
sequent is a disjunction, so for the RHS, ==&gt; by itself ceases to work.</p>
<p>I created some notation to sync up the turnstile with ==&gt;, and I used <br>
\&lt;or&gt; to duplicate the RHS properties of the sequent.</p>
<p>I then plugged in a sequent derivation proof from Wikipedia with my <br>
notation. It happened to be that the second line of the proof and the <br>
conclusion of the proof were the same, because of the \&lt;or&gt;. Very <br>
uninspiring. A "what's the point" moment.</p>
<p>If there's a mistake, it's that you make it too easy to use ==&gt;. If I <br>
know that ==&gt; is of type (prop =&gt; prop =&gt; prop), and I can do:</p>
<p>theorem "A ==&gt; (B ==&gt; C)"</p>
<p>It's only natural that I think I should be able to do:</p>
<p>abbreviation imp2 :: "prop =&gt; prop =&gt; prop" (infixr "=+&gt;" 15) where<br>
       "imp2 P Q == (P ==&gt; Q)"</p>
<p>theorem "A =+&gt; (B =+&gt; C)"</p>
<p>But it doesn't work. I can finagle things to make it work, but it'll <br>
never work like that.</p>
<p>The good news is that my finagling led to something that's acceptable <br>
(with Lars' prior help).</p>
<p>I think there are lots of tangents to go off on for why a person might <br>
want to intentionally stay within the meta-logic. Part of it is catching <br>
the "meta-logic spirit". What other proof assistant has a meta-logic <br>
that a person can use?</p>
<p>Part of it is trying to figure out what in Isabelle/HOL is optimized for <br>
the meta-logic, and what's optimized for the object-logic. Overusing the <br>
meta-logic should at least teach me how to use the meta-logic, and <br>
formalizing something differently can sometimes help a person do old <br>
things better.</p>
<p>I do this:</p>
<p>theorem "(A ==&gt; False) ==&gt; (~A)"<br>
    using[[simp_trace]]<br>
    apply(auto simp only:)<br>
    done</p>
<p>The simp trace shows this:</p>
<p>[1]SIMPLIFIER INVOKED ON THE FOLLOWING TERM:<br>
    (A ==&gt; False) ==&gt; ~A<br>
    [1]Adding rewrite rule "??.unknown":<br>
    A == True</p>
<p>I didn't give it any simp rules about True and False, but it knows how <br>
to use them. That tells me the simplifier is optimized for the <br>
object-logic, that and 15ms more for a proof if I use meta-False.</p>
<p>Consequently, I decide I should use "((P ==&gt; False) ==&gt; Q)" instead of <br>
"((P ==&gt; (!!P Q. P == Q::bool)) ==&gt; Q)", because in this case, the <br>
performance price for staying pure is probably too high, and False is <br>
not too much to accept. It's some lambda calculus and the HOL refl axiom.</p>
<p>I know that the logic engine really likes statements like "P ==&gt; Q", so <br>
I'm trying to go through the exercise of seeing to what extent I can <br>
stay in the "==&gt;" world. I don't think the logic engine is fond of <br>
things like "(!!R. (P ==&gt; R) ==&gt; (Q ==&gt; R) ==&gt; R)", but I'm pretty sure <br>
that it doesn't consider "((P ==&gt; False) ==&gt; Q)" to be much more of a <br>
burden than "P ==&gt; Q". In fact, I think the logic engine loves "((P ==&gt; <br>
False) ==&gt; Q)", because it's easy, and different.</p>
<p>In a more perfect world, my function "((P ==&gt; False) ==&gt; Q)" would be of <br>
type "prop =&gt; prop =&gt; prop". It's okay that it's not. I'm happy to have <br>
found something that's simple, and that fits in the "==&gt;" paradigm.</p>
<p>After your email I put a little more effort into creating the <br>
meta-versions of the standard connectives. I was trying to cut and paste <br>
from the HOL versions, but the HOL versions use lambda calculus, which <br>
wasn't working for me. Then I came up with the version for meta-False, <br>
which gave me meta-not, and then I cut and pasted for the meta-exists.</p>
<p>If the performance cost is too high to stay pure, then I don't want to <br>
use the meta-connectives. But my perfect example, "((P ==&gt; False) ==&gt; <br>
Q)", which I've used to make my point, is not a standard connective. <br>
It's also fast, and I need it, and I want it. I have it, too. Just not <br>
in a one-operator form.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
It's a syntax priority problem.</p>
<p>Trueprop priority is 5, so dealing with the syntax of functions of type <br>
"prop =&gt; prop" and "prop =&gt; prop =&gt; prop" is tricky:</p>
<p>Trueprop :: "bool =&gt; prop"   ("(_)" 5)</p>
<p>I haven't figured out the rules completely, but it seems I have what I need.</p>
<p>However, the rules don't make complete sense. For this meta_not_abbr, <br>
the function form "meta_not_abbr P" gets a coercion error, but notation <br>
with a priority of 40 works, or even 4:</p>
<p>abbreviation (input) meta_not_abbr :: "prop =&gt; prop"  where<br>
       "meta_not_abbr P == (PROP P ==&gt; False)"</p>
<p>notation meta_not_abbr ("~~~ _" 40)</p>
<p>theorem<br>
       "meta_not_abbr P" (* coercion error *)</p>
<p>theorem<br>
       "(~~~ (~~~ P)) == Trueprop (P)"<br>
    by(rule equal_intr_rule, auto simp only:)</p>
<p>I then have my meta_or_abbr. The function form "meta_or_abbr P Q" also <br>
gets a coercion error, but infixr notation with priority less than 5 <br>
works, and notation ("mOr _ _") also works:</p>
<p>abbreviation (input) meta_or_abbr :: "prop =&gt; prop =&gt; prop"  where<br>
       "meta_or_abbr P Q == ((PROP P ==&gt; False) ==&gt; PROP Q)"</p>
<p>notation<br>
       meta_or_abbr (infixr "+++" 4) and<br>
       meta_or_abbr ("mOr _ _")</p>
<p>theorem<br>
       "(P +++ Q +++ R) == Trueprop (P | Q | R)"<br>
    by(rule equal_intr_rule, auto simp only:)</p>
<p>theorem<br>
       "(mOr P Q) == Trueprop (P | Q)"<br>
    by(rule equal_intr_rule, auto simp only:)</p>
<p>theorem<br>
       "meta_or_abbr P Q" (* coercion error *)</p>
<p>Here are the four connective hybrids. I know why I need one of them:</p>
<p>theorem meta_not:<br>
   "(P ==&gt; False) == Trueprop (~P)"<br>
by(rule equal_intr_rule, auto simp only:)</p>
<p>theorem meta_or:<br>
   "((P ==&gt; False) ==&gt; Q) == Trueprop (P | Q)"<br>
by(rule equal_intr_rule, auto simp only:)</p>
<p>theorem meta_and:<br>
   "((P ==&gt; (Q ==&gt; False)) ==&gt; False) == Trueprop (P &amp; Q)"<br>
by(rule equal_intr_rule, auto simp only:)</p>
<p>theorem meta_exists:<br>
   "((!!x. P x ==&gt; False) ==&gt; False) == Trueprop (? x. P x)"<br>

If you want to play with syntax, you can always use 'notation' and <br>
'no_notation' to specify things in any way you like, but don't ask me <br>
about suitable priorities -- this is a black art and better not changed <br>
fundamentally.</p>
<p>Generally, Isabelle/Pure is not really a meta-logic, i.e. a logic to <br>
reason about other logics.  It is just a logical framework, for <br>
higher-order natural deduction based on !! and ==&gt;.</p>
<p>If you really want to reason about some other logic, better do it in <br>
Isabelle/HOL, and define you syntax as datatype, semantics as function, <br>
inference system as inductive predicate in the usual way.  AFP has <br>
examples for that.</p>

<p>Reminder to self. Add the following to the official GB list of HOL <br>
cardinal rules: "Never change the default settings of Trueprop priority. <br>
Live within the limits of Trueprop priority being at 5, lest you cause <br>
yourself or others great logical harm in the future."</p>

<p>In these technical matters, I'm a practical purist. I'm only interested <br>
in logics other than HOL to the extent they help me understand <br>
isar-ref.pdf, and other Isabelle documentation. I also want there to be <br>
the possibility that I can use anything I do as part of HOL. I'm just a <br>
user who delves into foundations because I never found the book "Set <br>
Theory, Real Analysis, Algebra, Combinatorics, and Number Theory for <br>
Maple, Mathematica, and Even Isabelle2013".</p>
<p>I decided to take a step back and finally study natural deduction. <br>
However, natural deduction inevitably leads to sequents, so I have <br>
wanted to create a psuedo-sequent to use with exercises and, in some <br>
manner, really be using a metalanguage.</p>
<p>With the pseudo-sequent I have now, there is the possibility that it <br>
will all end up being academic, where I end up only using the standard <br>
natural deduction rules. There is also the possibility that I will <br>
eventually find a use for the pseudo-sequent, or at least for the notation.</p>
<p>I have no idea at this point why the RHS of a sequent needs to behave as <br>
a disjunction, or why a person needs more than what the natural <br>
deduction rules provide. But, it could be that I find a practical use <br>
for stating a theorem using a meta-or along with !! and ==&gt;. Sometimes, <br>
we do that kind of thing as a preliminary step, because it helps us sort <br>
out foggy concepts.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help, and thanks to Lars for the info about PROP.</p>
<p>I got my meta-False down to "(!!P. P::bool)". If I could roam the halls <br>
of CMU, I'd stop by Avigad's office, make sure I called him professor, <br>
and ask him if I can get a meta-False without using !!.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Wanting to be a helpful, altruistic individual, I give you now a way to <br>
create some priority space, for that day when selfish indiviuals <br>
complain, moan, and groan about there not being enough space between the <br>
priorities of =&gt;, !!, ==&gt;, ==, and Trueprop, which are at 0, 0, 1, 2, <br>
and 5, you being well aware of such things.</p>
<p>For priorities 5 and above, you add 95 to them. This puts Trueprop at a <br>
nice 100. For priorities 0 to 4, you put them at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. <br>
That would be one way to do it, unless there's something I'm not <br>
considering.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>
