<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I describe what I need, and then I get more verbose about ML and the <br>
PIDE, and recent NEWS.</p>
<p>The export_code command in a THY will create a file in the directory of <br>
the THY. For example, a command like this:</p>
<p>export_code id in SML file "sml_test_output.ML</p>
<p>What ML command do I use to obtain the path and filename of the THY in <br>
which I have ML{<em>...</em>} commands? I did some searches in the src folder <br>
looking for how export_code does that, but all I saw was noise.</p>
<p>This would be part of my very recent attempt to switch to Isabelle/ML as <br>
my primary general purpose programming language. Further, it's part of <br>
my occasional attempt to eliminate some complexity and pursue the goal <br>
of working in "one document, in one language, in one development <br>
environment".</p>
<p>It's not completely achievable, but because ML is a subset of the <br>
languages that can be used with Isar commands, then it does partially <br>
fit the one language goal, and it fits even more the working in only one <br>
IDE.</p>
<p>The availability of ML libraries is quite thin,  but there are no <br>
problems, there are only workarounds. In pursuit of regular expressions, <br>
a decent or even better solution might be awk, which I can call from ML, <br>
like this:</p>
<p>ML{*<br>
fun gawkfprint str file = OS.Process.system (<br>
   "gawk \"BEGIN { print \\\"" ^ str ^ "\\\" }\" &gt; " ^ file);<br>
gawkfprint "this is a tester4" "test.txt"<br>
*}</p>
<p>Workarounds abound. ML{* OS.Process.system "ls -l" *} only prints the <br>
return code in the output panel. Maybe that's all it's supposed to do.</p>
<p>I include some links.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>I'll simplify it. I need the path to the folder that the "sml_test_output.ML" <br>
file is in, which will be the path of my THY, though it would be nice to get <br>
the THY file name also.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The file-system location of a theory is called "master directory": all of <br>
its file-references should be relative to that (although some very old <br>
tools sometimes do it differently).</p>
<p>This is how to access the master directory in an ad-hoc example:</p>
<p>ML {* Thy_Load.master_directory @{theory} *}</p>
<p>This is how to get the formal name of the theory, which is conceptually <br>
different from the file name, but you can reconstruct it yourself:</p>
<p>ML {* Context.theory_name @{theory} *}</p>
<p>Note that @{theory} refers to the compile-time theory context of each ML <br>
snipped.  In regular Isabelle/ML programming you pass this around as some <br>
value thy: theory, and feed-in some compile-time constant only where you <br>
invoke it in the end.</p>
<p>Generally, the master directory is still being used, but somewhat <br>
old-fashioned and about to be discontinued: the Prover IDE will eventually <br>
take care of all external resources, and the prover will be devoid of <br>
file-system access.</p>
<p>You have surely noticed already that export_code does not fit 100% into <br>
the picture of continuous theory and proof checking while you type: it <br>
leaves a dirty trace of file-name prefixes in your directory.  At some <br>
point in the future, export_code would write into an "abstract file-space" <br>
of the document model, which is committed only when the IDE says so, e.g. <br>
on shutdown.</p>
<p>This probably also means, it is a bad idea to try writing one file here <br>
and reading the same file elsewhere -- that simulates stateful programming <br>
via files, but statefulness is out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic idea is to export code, and right below it, use the exported <br>
code to do some calculations in a ML{<em>...</em>} command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can probably avoid all these complications with files, of you use the <br>
generated ML code directly, e.g. via the @{code} antiquotation of <br>
Isabelle/ML.</p>
<p>It is also possible to pass around ML sources as strings or tokens in <br>
Isabelle/ML, and invoke the compiler on it.  That is a normal benefit of <br>
incremental compilation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing that, and using ML as a tool for Isabelle in general, and <br>
processing a THY to get some LaTeX are my only programming needs. It's <br>
either learn ML and Perl (not awk), or learn Scala.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isabelle/ML is for hardcore logic-based tools.  Isabelle/Scala is for <br>
higher-order functional-object-oriented systems programming.  In that <br>
respect Scala is closer to Perl, e.g. it also supports nice pattern <br>
matching with regexps.</p>

<p>OS.Process.system is one of these SML Basis Library functions that should <br>
not be used inside Isabelle, because they don't comply to the Isabelle <br>
system programming model.</p>
<p>Use Isabelle_System.bash or Isabelle_System.bash_output instead. <br>
(Isabelle/Scala provides similar operations.)</p>

<p>Thanks for the heads up, a casual comment that belies the real message, <br>
"WARNING! YOU MAY DESTROY YOUR FILE SYSTEM, FOOL!"</p>

<p>The point here is that the Isar 'bash' command was declared as "diag", so <br>
it runs asynchronously and in parallel as far as possible.  If you <br>
combine this with mutations on the file-system or other global system <br>
state, you can easily get some fireworks.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why some insiders of parallel programming say <br>
"mutable state is the root of all evil".  In the multicore era you are <br>
either stateless and fast, or stateful and slow.  Some decades ago that <br>
was the opposite.</p>
<p>Maybe for your continued experiments, it is better to make 'bash' a <br>
"thy_decl" command, to force it into sequential mode (for the current <br>
theory file).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I ran the ideas through this filter: "Does any of this give me something <br>
over and above what I already have, like Windows Explorer for file <br>
management?"</p>

<p>No.  One would have to make more substantial reforms of stateless <br>
operating systems to fit it into the PIDE model and get real benefits from <br>
it.  (Apple's Time Machine and the ZFS file-system are actually moving a <br>
bit in that direction.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I attach a THY, along with the one you sent me, to be complete. I make <br>
my requests in the THY, and there are 8 comment headings which give an <br>
overview of what each section does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've looked through this briefly.  Note that the double-quoted strings of <br>
<a href="http://Parse.name">Parse.name</a> can be avoided by using Parse.text: that category also allows <br>
"verbatim" tokens of form {* ... *}.</p>
<p>That brings us back to the pending reform to allow nestable text <br>
cartouches in that spot ...</p>

<p>I don't know what the end result will be, but here is my contribution to <br>
the game: Bash.thy with CD, PWD, and bash commands inside the theory <br>
context.  Note that I could not use the names "cd" and "pwd", since these <br>
are left-over commands from ancient times.</p>
<p>The global working directory of a process (e.g. <a href="http://File.cd">File.cd</a>) is incompatible <br>
with the idea of stateless execution.  By putting the cd value into the <br>
formal context, you can feed that to each shell process individually, and <br>
they can run in parallel unencumbered.  This is done by the PIDE <br>
automatically, since the 'bash' command is diagnostic and thus mean to be <br>
without any effects.</p>
<p>Of course, unpredictable or really bad things will happen, when you modify <br>
the file system in any of these bash commands.</p>
