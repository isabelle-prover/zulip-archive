<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I have a function:</p>
<p>axiomatization--"Set membership predicate."<br>
   in\&lt;^isub&gt;\&lt;sigma&gt;::"\&lt;sigma&gt;\&lt;^isub&gt;t \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; <br>
\&lt;sigma&gt;\&lt;^isub&gt;t \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; \&lt;sigma&gt;\&lt;^isub&gt;t\&lt;^isub&gt;b" ("_ <br>
\&lt;in&gt;\&lt;^isub&gt;\&lt;sigma&gt; _" 55)</p>
<p>I then state multiple axioms about it, one of them being:</p>
<p>axiomatization--"Axiom schema of comprehension: schema set." where<br>
   \&lt;Sigma&gt;\&lt;^isub&gt;s\&lt;^isub&gt;c\&lt;^isub&gt;A: "\&lt;forall&gt;u. \&lt;forall&gt;P. <br>
\&lt;exists&gt;a. \&lt;forall&gt;x.(x \&lt;in&gt;\&lt;^isub&gt;\&lt;sigma&gt; a \&lt;longleftrightarrow&gt; <br>
(x \&lt;in&gt;\&lt;^isub&gt;\&lt;sigma&gt; u \&lt;and&gt; P x))"</p>
<p>I want to look at how Isabelle decided to type variables in my <br>
axiomatization, but I can't find any print or find commands that will do <br>
that for me. I also want to see if explicit parentheses will be added as <br>
I expect, and see if there are any operator priority surprises.</p>
<p>Is there such a command that will do this for me?</p>
<p>The above is the basic question. Here's what led me to want to know this:</p>
<p>1) I used "\&lt;in&gt;" as notation for my set membership.<br>
2) I got lots of warnings like: "Ambiguous input produces 4 parse <br>
trees... Fortunately, only one parse tree is type correct..."<br>
3) I change my notation to " \&lt;in&gt;\&lt;^isub&gt;\&lt;sigma&gt;", and it gets rid of <br>
some of the warnings.<br>
4) For the axiom above, I still get "ambiguous" warnings, with some of <br>
the variables explicitly typed.<br>
5) So, I explicitly type every variable in the formula, and I still get <br>
"ambiguous" warnings.<br>
6) So, I remove all the typing, and it seems to work. Explicit or <br>
non-explicit typing doesn't affect the warnings.<br>
7) I then conclude that Isabelle gets all of the typing information in <br>
the formula from my one uniquely named function, "in\&lt;^isub&gt;\&lt;sigma&gt;". <br>
Consequently, I ask myself, "Is that too good to be true?"</p>
<p>Okay, if I knew how to prove anything, maybe I would know how to get the <br>
information I want. However, even if I was an expert, I would want to be <br>
able to get immediate feedback to check my typing, see if I'm correctly <br>
using parentheses, and see if I understand correctly the priority of the <br>
operators.</p>
<p>I attach a screen shot of my code. I don't think attaching images and <br>
PDFs is the best way to give people code information. On the other hand, <br>
the above low-level Isar shows that nice looking things in jEdit cease <br>
to be good for reading in a text file. Also, "\&lt;^isub&gt;" doesn't result <br>
in subscripted, unicode characters when copying and pasting.</p>
<p>jEdit Stuff: I edited the etc/symbols file and jEdit gave me an <br>
exception error when loading. Afterwards, jEdit wouldn't translate <br>
commands like "\&lt;in&gt;" in the one file. About an hour later, or two, I <br>
deleted "jEdit/recent.xml" and it started working again.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

This message indicates that your syntax is ambiguous. The way to eliminate such a message is by disambiguating your syntax, which in most cases means tightening up the precedences of operators. And indeed, your operator “in" gives no precedence information for its operands. I wonder why you don't use something akin to (ignoring fancy symbols)</p>
<p>(infixl "IN" 55)</p>
<p>where you have</p>
<p>("_ IN_ " 55) .</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Larry,</p>
<p>Thanks for fix. It makes sense now that a binary operator needs an <br>
associativity rule. I was trying to finish making my table of HOL <br>
operator priorities, so I would have lots of examples, and then try to <br>
dig through section "7.2 Mixfix annotations" of isar-ref.pdf. But now, I <br>
can put off looking at the mixfix documentation.</p>
<p>(For anyone interested, I've attached iS.thy. Load it into jEdit, have <br>
sidekick open to see the section tree, and in section 1 there's all the <br>
symbols from etc/symbols. In section 2 there's a table showing the <br>
mixfix operator priorites from HOL.thy, and in section 3 there's the <br>
source from src/Pure/pure_thy.ML, which contains the mixfix operator <br>
priorities for the Pure logic.)</p>
<p>If I had print commands, like thm, find_theorems, find_consts, etc., but <br>
for axiomatizations and defs, I might could figure out some of your <br>
logic in HOL.thy. Makarius showed me how to print explicit use of <br>
Trueprop and prop, so with explicit types, explicit parentheses, <br>
explicit names, explicit Trueprop, and explicit prop, I might could <br>
eventually figure out the reasoning behind your defs in HOL.thy, like <br>
for these:</p>
<p>LINE: 178 of src/HOL/HOL.thy<br>
defs<br>
   True_def:     "True      == ((%x::bool. x) = (%x. x))"<br>
   All_def:      "All(P)    == (P = (%x. True))"<br>
   Ex_def:       "Ex(P)     == !Q. (!x. P x --&gt; Q) --&gt; Q"<br>
   False_def:    "False     == (!P. P)"<br>
   not_def:      "~ P       == P--&gt;False"<br>
   and_def:      "P &amp; Q     == !R. (P--&gt;Q--&gt;R) --&gt; R"<br>
   or_def:       "P | Q     == !R. (P--&gt;R) --&gt; (Q--&gt;R) --&gt; R"<br>
   Ex1_def:      "Ex1(P)    == ? x. P(x) &amp; (! y. P(y) --&gt; y=x)"</p>
<p>I'm thinking that parts of your "Interactive Proof with Cambridge LCF" <br>
and your "The Foundation of a Generic Theorem Prover" will eventually <br>
help me out, that you directly implement into HOL.thy some of the logic <br>
definitions in your LCF book. It'll take time for me to find that out.</p>
<p>But, with the right print info for definitions and axiomatizations, it <br>
would help me when I occasionally look at definitions such as the above.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

I imagine that the following paper (Church, 1940) has all the information you need:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2007/spring/32001-1/papers/church-1940.pdf">http://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2007/spring/32001-1/papers/church-1940.pdf</a></p>
<p>However, Isabelle's formalism includes a much richer variety of types, including type variables and type constructors. As I recall, essentially the same system of axioms is used in HOL.</p>

Larry,</p>
<p>Thanks for link to the document. I added Church's journal article to my <br>
library of HOL documents.</p>
<p>I kind of figured out that in the definitions below, I should start <br>
doing some substitutions, like</p>
<p>P &amp; Q == !R. ((P--&gt; Q--&gt;R) --&gt;  R)<br>
       == (R = (%x.True)). ((P--&gt; Q--&gt;R) --&gt;  R)<br>
       == (R = (%x.((%y::bool. y) = (%y. y))). ((P--&gt; Q--&gt;R) --&gt;  R)</p>
<p>Using trial and error, I finally decided I don't know what the notation <br>
means enough to continue to make substitutions.</p>
<p>If I was formally enrolled in a course, I would go and impose myself on <br>
my professor, and take up his or her time. But I'm not, so it'll have to <br>
be delayed gratification.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>I've gone on too long here, but I've already written what's below, so I <br>
leave it. For me, truth table logic vs. constructive and natural <br>
deduction logic causes me some confusion, on how to interpret a simple <br>
statement like "!P. P", or maybe, as I say below, it's because I'm not <br>
used to quantifying over propositions, but only over elements of a set, <br>
such as in "!x P(x)". I'll get straightened out with the right books.</p>
<p>If you don't read what's below, it'll be no loss, but it represents <br>
certain aspects of life, as experienced by me.<br>
)</p>
<p>But, though I haven't went through my natural deduction textbook much, I <br>
assume that it's saying "for every R that is asserted to be true...".</p>
<p>If that's the case, then the engine is somehow implementing and_def as <br>
conjunction, which, of course, I know to begin with.</p>
<p>It could be that I've said something dumb, so I write it with a little <br>
typing,</p>
<p>!R::('a =&gt; bool). ((P /\ Q) \/ (R::('a =&gt; bool))),</p>
<p>to try and figure out if I have said something dumb. I know that R can <br>
be viewed as a proposition, but I'm not used to quantifying over <br>
propositions; I'm used to quantifying over elements of a set, like</p>
<p>!x P(x).</p>
<p>I've gone on like this to demonstrate (even more) that I have some <br>
weaknesses in logic. I assume that your B.S. in Math at CalTech (not to <br>
mention your PhD) gave you a lot better education than my B.S. in Math <br>
at Podunk University, but I also know from experience and observation <br>
that most undergrad and graduate degrees in math don't give people much <br>
more than a basic education in logic.</p>
<p>Anyway, you're paying the price for giving people access to the details <br>
of the engine, unlike Mizar.</p>
<p>Can I work without understanding all the logic details? I suppose I have <br>
to. But if I get access to information, many times I think I'm supposed <br>
to understand it. Actually, I do need to set aside some of this <br>
low-level stuff. I'm progressing at a snail's pace.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,<br>

No need even to do that. The reasoning is very simple. let P and Q be two given formulas, and suppose that you have !R. ((P --&gt; Q --&gt; R) --&gt; R). And suppose that you want to prove some formula, R say (just to keep things very simple). Then it is enough to prove P --&gt; Q --&gt; R. Which means, you may as well assume that P and Q are actually true while you are proving R. And that is what it means to know P&amp;Q.</p>
<p>Disjunction can be defined similarly. If I'm not mistaken, this discovery is due to Frege.</p>

<p>Okay, that's good to know. I'm still transitioning from truth tables, <br>
where writing a formula doesn't assert anything, at least that's how <br>
I've always viewed it for the connectives /\, \/, --&gt;, and ~.</p>
<p>I did decide previously that I should interpret "!P. P" as asserting <br>
that P is always true, which helps me with it being the definition of <br>
False, but it doesn't help me understand</p>
<p>!R. ((P /\ Q) \/ R), or even<br>
   !R. (~(P /\ Q) \/ R).</p>
<p>The "P" and "Q" part of the "conj" (infixed as "&amp;", and "/\") definition <br>
makes sense to me because when I use the function</p>
<p>conj P Q,</p>
<p>in my mind, I go through the truth table and make assignments to "P" and <br>
"Q" and decide what result I should get based on how the function was <br>
being used in a statement.</p>
<p>With</p>
<p>!R. ((P /\ Q) \/ R),</p>
<p>I try to use the same trick and say, "it's asserting that for every R, R <br>
is always true", but that doesn't work. If R is always true, then the <br>
statement is always true. But if it's always false, then the statement <br>
operates as a conjunction.</p>
<p>Well, okay, the above sentence shows I still have trouble interpreting <br>
things.</p>
<p>What I know is that saying "every proposition R is true" is a false <br>
statement, so if that's what makes R always false in the statement "((P <br>
/\ Q) \/ R)", then the statement as a whole works.</p>
<p>Ah, maybe I have it. The statement "!R. ((P /\ Q) \/ R)" could be <br>
asserting this:</p>
<p>"For every proposition R, (P /\ Q) is true or R is true."</p>
<p>A more friendlier statement would be this, using your statement above:</p>
<p>"Every proposition is true or (P /\ Q) is true".</p>
<p>I guess that's it. Simple stuff, unless it's not.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>No need even to do that. The reasoning is very simple. let P and Q<br>
be two given formulas, and suppose that you have !R. ((P --&gt;  Q --&gt; <br>
R) --&gt;  R).<br>
And suppose that you want to prove some formula, R say (just to keep <br>
things<br>
very simple). Then it is enough to prove P --&gt;  Q --&gt;  R. Which <br>
means, you<br>
may as well assume that P and Q are actually true while you are <br>
proving R.<br>
And that is what it means to know P&amp;Q.</p>
<p>Disjunction can be defined similarly. If I'm not mistaken, this discovery is due to Frege.</p>

<p>I'll do the easy part and show HOL's definition of disjunction to <br>
complete the discussion.</p>

<p>Larry, thanks for the explanation of the not-so-straightforward logic.</p>

<p>Sure, but you should remember that from the perspective of defining the<br>

<p>I kind of understood that I'm getting circular, which is why I wasn't so <br>

<p>Larry's explanation was able to explain the logic and still only use "--&gt;".</p>

<p>Can you see why this is a good definition for 'and'?</p>

<p>It's a good definition if you only have "!" and "--&gt;" at your disposal. <br>
It's doesn't sync up well with simplistic lessons in logic as given in <br>
"Discrete Mathematics" by Rosen, or many other mathematical logic <br>
textbooks. But yea, it looks good.</p>

<p>Surely when R is false but P and Q are true the result is true...?<br>
Truth tables still work for propositional logic embedded in HOL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're asking about what I said there? That was messed up. I left it in <br>
to show how I was messed up, but it leaving it in and not working to <br>
redo the email right was probably messed up too.</p>
<p>The result with truth tables is the same, but there are subtle or <br>
not-so-subtle differences in the logic notation and the use of logic <br>
formulas as specifically used in a proof assistant. Or maybe there's <br>
not. It could just be information overload that throws me off, which <br>
results in me not being able to process simple statements.</p>

<p>...causes me some confusion, on how to interpret a simple<br>

such as in "!x P(x)". I'll get straightened out with the right books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't get confused by its being a capital letter. Look at the type. P is<br>
a plain old boolean proposition. It doesn't take any arguments. The<br>
definition of false basically says both boolean values are true, that<br>
is, there is an inconsistency.</p>

<p>Sometimes a formula can be so simple that a newbie doesn't know how to <br>
get information out of it. It helps for people to tell me exactly how to <br>
phrase the meaning of a formula in informal English, until I get good at <br>
creating my own interpretive phrases.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>!R::('a =&gt; bool). ((P /\ Q) \/ (R::('a =&gt; bool))),<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely that did not typecheck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some pertinent lines from ~/HOL/HOL.thy:</p>
<p>074: consts<br>
082:   All::"('a =&gt; bool) =&gt; bool" (binder "ALL " 10)</p>
<p>153: notation (HOL)<br>
154:   All  (binder "! " 10)</p>
<p>178: defs<br>
180:   All_def:      "All(P)    == (P = (%x. True))"</p>
<p>I put this in jEdit, and it shows R::bool:</p>
<p>lemma "!R. (P--&gt;Q--&gt;R) --&gt; R"</p>
<p>So, you're right, though I thought you had to be wrong, until the goal <br>
for the proof step told me you're right. This is where things like <br>
declare[[show_types=true]] save us a bunch of time.</p>
<p>It appeared to me, by line 82, that "All" takes a "('a =&gt; bool)" and <br>
returns a bool. It could be that "All(P)" is not the same thing as "All P".</p>

If you resolve the binder syntax,</p>
<p>!R. (P --&gt; Q --&gt; R) --&gt; R</p>
<p>is the same as</p>
