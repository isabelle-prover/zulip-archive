<p>From: Frédéric Blanqui &lt;<a href="mailto:frederic.blanqui@inria.fr">frederic.blanqui@inria.fr</a>&gt;<br>
==================================<br>
ICALP-LICS 2020 Call for Workshops<br>
==================================</p>
<p>ICALP 2020 (<a href="http://econcs.pku.edu.cn/icalp2020/">http://econcs.pku.edu.cn/icalp2020/</a>) and LICS 2020 <br>
(<a href="https://lics.siglog.org/lics20/">https://lics.siglog.org/lics20/</a>) will take place in co-location from <br>
8th till 12th of July 2020 in Beijing, China. The conferences will be <br>
preceded by two days of joint workshops, held on July 6th and 7th. We <br>
invite proposals of workshops affiliated with ICALP-LICS 2020 on all <br>
topics covered by ICALP and LICS, as well as other areas of theoretical <br>
computer science.</p>
<p>Proposals should be submitted no later than</p>
<p><strong>*  November 30th, 2019 </strong>*</p>
<p>by sending an email to <a href="mailto:frederic.blanqui@inria.fr">frederic.blanqui@inria.fr</a>. Due to limited space <br>
of the venue we might not be able to accommodate all the proposed <br>
workshops. You should expect notification on the acceptance of your <br>
proposal by mid December 2019.</p>
<p>A workshop proposal submission should consist of:</p>
<p>- workshop's name and URL (if already available)</p>
<p>- workshop's organizers together with their email addresses and web <br>
pages;</p>
<p>- short description of the area covered by the workshop and the <br>
motivation behind it;</p>
<p>- expected number of participants (if available, please include the <br>
data of previous years);</p>
<p>- planned format of the event;</p>
<p>- date preference (July 6th or 7th).</p>
<p>As for the format, a standard option is a one-day workshop consisting of <br>
invited talks by leading experts and of shorter contributed talks, <br>
either directly invited by the organizers or selected among submissions. <br>
Deviations from this standard are also warmly welcome, including a <br>
shorter or a longer time span than a full day, or other elements of the <br>
schedule like open problem sessions, discussion panels, or working <br>
sessions.</p>
<p>If you plan to have invited speakers, please specify their expected <br>
number and, if possible, tentative names. If you plan a call for papers <br>
or for contributed talks followed by a selection procedure, the <br>
submission date should be scheduled after ICALP 2020 and LICS 2020 <br>
notification, while the notification should take place considerably <br>
before the early registration deadline. In your submission please <br>
include details, in particular the time schedule, of the planned <br>
procedure of selecting papers and/or contributed talks. If you plan to <br>
have published proceedings of your workshop, please provide the name of <br>
the publisher. Please be advised that ICALP-LICS 2020 is not able to <br>
provide any financial support for publishing workshop proceedings.</p>
<p>We expect the workshops to be financially independent. The expenses <br>
related to the participation of invited speakers, production of workshop <br>
materials, etc. should be covered from independent sources. On top of <br>
standard ICALP/LICS registration fee there will be a moderate <br>
registration fee for the workshops that will cover coffee breaks. This <br>
workshop fee will be waived for maximum two invited speakers for each <br>
workshop.</p>
<p>Workshop selection committee:<br>
     Frédéric Blanqui<br>
     Naoki Kobayashi<br>
     Yuqin Kong<br>
     Michał Pilipczuk<br>
     Zhilin Wu<br>
     Lijun Zhang</p>
