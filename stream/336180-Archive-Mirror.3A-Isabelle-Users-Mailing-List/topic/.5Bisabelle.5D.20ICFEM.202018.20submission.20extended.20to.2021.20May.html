<p>ICFEM2018: 20th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM 2018) Gold Coast, Australia, November 12-16, 2018</p>

Submission due: May 21, 2018 (extended)</p>
<p>Since 1997, ICFEM provides a forum for both researchers and practitioners who are interested in developing practical formal methods for software engineering or applying existing formal techniques to improve software development process in practice systems. Formal methods for the development of computer systems have been extensively researched and studied. We now have good theoretical understandings of how to describe what programs do, how they do it, and why they work. A range of semantic theories, specification languages, design techniques, verification methods, and supporting tools have been developed and applied to the construction of programs of moderate size that are used in critical applications. The remaining challenge now is how to deal with problems in developing and maintaining large scale and complex computer systems.</p>
<p>The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial, academic, and government experts, from a variety of user domains and software disciplines, to help advance the state of the art. Researchers, practitioners, tool developers and users, and technology transfer experts are all welcome. We are interested in work that has been incorporated into real production systems, and in theoretical work that promises to bring practical, tangible engineering benefits.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sir Tony Hoare (C. A. R. Hoare):</li>
</ul>
<p>Sir Tony Hoare is a British computer scientist. He developed the sorting algorithm quicksort in 1959/1960. He also developed Hoare logic for verifying program correctness in 1969, and the formal language communicating sequential processes (CSP) to specify the interactions of concurrent processes in 1985. He received the Turing Prize and the Kyoto Prize for his fundamental contributions to the definition and design of programming languages in 1980 and 2000 respectively. Tony Hoare became a professor at Oxford University in 1977 where he is now an Emeritus Professor. Hoare was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society as well as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. A recent personal research goal has been the unification of a diverse range of theories applying to different programming languages, paradigms, and implementation technologies. Tony has been and continue to be an inspiration to many researchers.</p>
