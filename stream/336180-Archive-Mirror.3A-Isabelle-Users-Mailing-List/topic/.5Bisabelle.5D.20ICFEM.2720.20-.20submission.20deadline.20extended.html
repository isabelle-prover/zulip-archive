Due to the requests from authors, the submission deadline of ICFEM 2020 <br>
has been extended to 24 May 2020 (AOE).</p>
<p>Here is the revised CFP</p>
<hr>
<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<hr>
<p>22nd International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM <br>
2020), 2-6 November 2020, Singapore (subject to changes, including <br>
backup options such as postponing the conference or hosting it online).</p>
<p><a href="http://formal-analysis.com/icfem/2020/">http://formal-analysis.com/icfem/2020/</a></p>
<p>Extended deadlines:<br>
Full Paper Submissions Due: 24 May 2020 (AoE)<br>
Workshop/Tutorial Proposals Due: 20 March 2020<br>
Acceptance/Rejection Notification: 5 July 2020<br>
Camera-ready Due: 17 July 2020</p>
<p>Since 1997, ICFEM provides a forum for both researchers and <br>
practitioners who are interested in developing practical formal methods <br>
for software engineering or applying existing formal techniques to <br>
improve software development process in practice systems. Formal Methods <br>
for the development of computer systems have been extensively researched <br>
and studied. We now have good theoretical understandings of how to <br>
describe what programs do, how they do it, and why they work. A range of <br>
semantic theories, specification languages, design techniques, <br>
verification methods, and supporting tools have been developed and <br>
applied to the construction of programs of moderate size that are used <br>
in critical applications. The remaining challenge now is how to deal <br>
with problems in developing and maintaining large scale and complex <br>
computer systems.</p>
<p>The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial, academic, <br>
and government experts, from a variety of user domains and software <br>
disciplines, to help advance state of the art. Researchers, <br>
practitioners, tool developers and users, and technology transfer <br>
experts are all welcome. We are interested in work that has been <br>
incorporated into real production systems, and in theoretical work that <br>
promises to bring practical, tangible engineering benefits.</p>
<p>Scope and Topics:<br>
Submissions related to the following principal themes are encouraged, <br>
but any topics relevant to the field of formal engineering methods and <br>
their practical applications will also be considered:</p>
<p>• Abstraction, refinement and evolution<br>
• Formal specification and modelling<br>
• Formal verification and analysis<br>
• Model checking<br>
• Formal approaches to software testing and inspection<br>
• Formal methods for self-adaptive systems<br>
• Formal methods for object-oriented systems<br>
• Formal methods for component-based systems<br>
• Formal methods for concurrent and real-time systems<br>
• Formal methods for cloud computing<br>
• Formal methods for cyber-physical systems<br>
• Formal methods for software safety and security<br>
• Formal methods for software reliability and dependability<br>
• Development, integration and experiments involving verified systems<br>
• Formal certification of products under international standards<br>
• Formal model-based development and code generation</p>
<p>Submission and Publication:<br>
Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be <br>
concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will <br>
be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field, <br>
technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference. The <br>
proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer <br>
Science series.</p>
<p>Papers should be written in English and should not exceed 16 pages in <br>
LNCS format. Submissions should be made through the ICFEM 2020 <br>
submission page, handled by the EasyChair conference management system.</p>

Chair via email. Each proposal should include (1) title, scope, and <br>
aims, (2) brief bio of the organizer or lecturer, and (3) postal and <br>
email addresses.</p>
