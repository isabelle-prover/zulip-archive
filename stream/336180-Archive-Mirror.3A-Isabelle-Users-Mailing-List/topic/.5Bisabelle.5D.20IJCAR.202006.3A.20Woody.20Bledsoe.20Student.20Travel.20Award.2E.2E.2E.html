Woody Bledsoe Student Travel Award: Call for Nominations</p>
<p>IJCAR'06       <a href="http://ijcar06.uni-koblenz.de/">http://ijcar06.uni-koblenz.de/</a></p>
<p>Peter Baumgartner<br>
(On behalf of the CADE Inc. Board of Trustees)</p>
<p>The Woody Bledsoe Student Travel Award was created to honor the memory<br>
of Woody Bledsoe, for his contributions to mathematics, artificial<br>
intelligence, and automated theorem proving, and for his dedication to<br>
students.</p>
<p>The award is intended to enable selected students to attend the<br>
International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE) or the<br>
International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR),<br>
whichever is scheduled for the year, by covering much of their<br>
expenses.</p>
<p>In 2006, IJCAR will take place from August 17 through 20, in Seattle,<br>
USA, as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC). <br>
For further information see <a href="http://ijcar06.uni-koblenz.de/">http://ijcar06.uni-koblenz.de/</a> .</p>
<p>The winners will be reimbursed (up to some maximum amount to be<br>
determined, usually around US$ 500 - US$ 750) for their conference<br>
registration, transportation, and accomodation expenses. Preference<br>
will be given to students who will play an active role in the<br>
conference, including satellite workshops, and do not have alternative<br>
funding. However, also students in other situations are very much<br>
encouraged to apply.  A nomination consists of a recommendation letter<br>
of up to 300 words from the student's supervisor. Nominations for<br>
IJCAR 2006 should be sent by e-mail to Peter Baumgartner<br>
(<a href="mailto:Peter.Baumgartner@nicta.com.au">Peter.Baumgartner@nicta.com.au</a>).<br>
Nominations must arrive no later than</p>
<p>June 15, 2006</p>
<p>and the winners will be notified by June 30 (the early registration<br>
deadline for FLoC'06 is July 10). The awards will be presented at<br>
IJCAR; in case a winner does not attend, the chairs and trustees may<br>
transfer the award to another nominee or give no award.</p>
