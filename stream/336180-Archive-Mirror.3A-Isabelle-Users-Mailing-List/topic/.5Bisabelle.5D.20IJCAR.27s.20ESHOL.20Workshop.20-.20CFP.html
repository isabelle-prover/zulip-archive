<p>Call for papers: ESHOL'08</p>
<p>The workshop</p>
<p><em>Evaluation of Systems for Higher Order Logic</em></p>
<p>will be held as part of the 4th International Joint Conference on Automated<br>
Reasoning (IJCAR'08) in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>Workshop website:     <a href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~geoff/Conferences/ESHOL/">http://www.cs.miami.edu/~geoff/Conferences/ESHOL/</a><br>
Workshop dates:       10/11 August 2008<br>
Subsmission deadline: 19 May 2008 (abstract) / 26 May 2008 (full paper)</p>

<p>This workshop brings together practitioners and researchers who are involved<br>
in the development of reasoning systems based on higher-order logic. The<br>
workshop will stimulate and foster the build-up of an infrastructure that<br>
supports research, development, and deployment of higher-order reasoning<br>
systems. A particular focus is on means to evaluate higher-order reasoning<br>
systems.  Advances in these aspects of reasoning in higher-order logic will<br>
make higher-order reasoning system easier to use in applications, e.g.,<br>
hardware and software verification, knowledge based reasoning, and computer<br>
aided mathematics. The workshop's notion of higher-order includes, but is not<br>
limited to, ramified type theory, simple type theory, intuitionistic and<br>
constructive type theory, and logical frameworks. The workshop's notion of<br>
reasoning systems includes automated and semi-automated provers, model<br>
generators, as well as proof and model checkers. The workshop will have three<br>
parts:</p>
<p><em>Evaluation of Higher-Order Reasoning Systems</em><br>
          o Frameworks and tools for evaluation<br>
          o Collections of test problems<br>
          o Problem representation languages<br>
          o Evaluation of automated higher-order reasoning systems, in<br>
            particular, higher-order theorem provers<br>
          o Evaluation of interactive higher-order reasoning systems<br>
          o Evaluation of systems working for different higher-order<br>
            logics and varying semantics</p>
<p><em>Descriptions of Successful Higher-Order Reasoning Systems</em><br>
          o Logical frameworks<br>
          o Higher-order automated theorem provers<br>
          o Interactive proof assistants supporting the partial<br>
            automation of higher-order logic<br>
          o Higher-order model checkers and higher-order model generators<br>
          o Systems that automate natural fragments of higher-order<br>
            logic, such as monadic second-order logic<br>
      Due to the evaluative character of the workshop, descriptions of both<br>
      existing and novel systems are welcomed. Descriptions of existing<br>
      systems should stress successful applications and evaluations.</p>
<p><em>System Demonstration and System Competition</em><br>
      The systems described in the second part will be demonstrated. Moreover,<br>
      a first competition "happening" for automated theorem provers for simple<br>
      type theory is planned. This competition will be similar to the CASC<br>
      competition for first-order reasoning systems. It will exploit and test<br>
      the TPTP problem representation language for simple type theory, which<br>
      was recently developed by the organizers.</p>
<p>We envision attendees that are interested in fostering the development and<br>
visibility of reasoning systems for higher-order logics, and the connection<br>
between research on the various flavors of higher-order logic. We are<br>
particularly interested in comparisons of the practical strengths of higher-<br>
order reasoning systems and in a discusssion on the development of a higher-<br>
order version of the TPTP. Due to the intricate nature of higher-order logic,<br>
we are also interested in a discussion on what practical strength means in<br>
the context of higher-order logic and how it can be measured.</p>
