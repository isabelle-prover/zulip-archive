<p>From: Stephan Merz &lt;<a href="mailto:Stephan.Merz@loria.fr">Stephan.Merz@loria.fr</a>&gt;<br>
As part of INRIA's 2009 campaign for recruiting post-doctoral <br>
researchers, the Mosel team in Nancy is looking to hire somebody on the <br>
topic:</p>
<p>Efficient proof synthesis, compression and reconstruction of proofs from <br>
SMT solvers</p>
<p>The objective of our work is the construction of a verification <br>
environment that integrates specialized automated reasoners within an <br>
interactive reasoning framework. We intend to demonstrate that one can <br>
in this way significantly raise the degree of automation for the <br>
verification of complex systems and thus contribute to make deductive <br>
verification techniques economically viable. In order to ensure the <br>
overall correctness of a proof, we are interested in a skeptical <br>
approach to combining reasoners. We rely on automated reasoning tools <br>
that produce justifications which can be certified by the interactive <br>
proof assistant. In this way, both the result of the external reasoner <br>
and the translations between the different syntactic representations are <br>
verified. Contrary to proof search, proof checking is of low polynomial <br>
complexity. We have gained some initial experience with this approach <br>
when we combined Isabelle/HOL with SAT solvers and with the SMT solver <br>
haRVey (the ancestor of our solver, veriT) for fragments of first-order <br>
logic, including equality reasoning. However, many research questions <br>
remain open in order to make that idea scale to industrially relevant <br>
verification problems. The goal of the post-doctoral research proposed <br>
here is to address some of the scientific and technological issues in <br>
order to make the approach more robust, efficient, and scalable.</p>
<p>Proof generation and certification need to be extended beyond the <br>
fragments of first-order logic that we can currently handle. In <br>
particular, proofs of Skolemization, quantified theories, and arithmetic <br>
(over the integers, reals, and potentially bit vectors) must be <br>
included; extensions to fragments of higher-order logic are also of <br>
interest. We are aiming at the definition of a generic and extensible <br>
proof format that is independent of a specific automatic prover and <br>
interactive proof assistant.</p>
<p>The issue of scalability is of concern because proof obligations that <br>
arise from verification problems are often large formulas, usually in <br>
restricted first-order theories; correspondingly, they generate long <br>
proofs. Modern automatic provers are optimized for handling such <br>
formulas, but interactive proof assistants focus primarily on <br>
expressive, higher-order logical languages, for which elementary <br>
problems such as unification or matching are computationally expensive. <br>
A promising approach may be to explore reflection techniques in order to <br>
produce a verified and efficient proof certifier. On a more theoretical <br>
level it will be interesting to investigate the trade-off between <br>
generating a fully detailed proof, which is easy to check but large, and <br>
a more compact proof certificate that guides certification but requires <br>
the certifier to regenerate parts of the proof. For example, decision <br>
procedures for certain fragments of arithmetic are so efficient that it <br>
will certainly be preferable to let the certifier recreate a proof of <br>
sub-formulas falling into such fragments. Little is known about the <br>
proof sizes for first-order theories in general, and reconstruction of <br>
such proofs from compact certificates.</p>
<p>The research on proof representation and certification should be <br>
validated by an implementation for combining veriT, and possibly Spass, <br>
with Isabelle and Coq. In this way, the added value of using an <br>
integrated verification tool can be measured, and practical experiences <br>
with the proposed proof format can be performed. Our main interest is in <br>
the verification of distributed algorithms, including TLA+ <br>
specifications of concurrent algorithms.</p>
<p>The research directions mentioned above are indicative of our interests <br>
in this field; the precise subjects of research will be determined <br>
jointly with the candidate. Part of this work will be carried out in <br>
contact with the Isabelle group in Munich, with our partners of the ANR <br>
project DECERT, the TLA+ prover project at the INRIA-MSR joint lab, and <br>
with other international research teams.</p>
<p>The candidate must have experience in interactive and/or automatic <br>
theorem proving. He or she should be interested in combining <br>
foundational research on calculi and logics with hands-on <br>
implementation. The main languages of implementation are C and ML.</p>
<p>Further details:</p>
<p>Duration: 12 months<br>
Starting date: Between 1 Oct 2009 and 31 Dec 2009<br>
Working place: INRIA Nancy &amp; LORIA, equipe Mosel</p>
<p>The position is an INRIA-postdoc position and candidate must fulfill<br>
the formal requirements found at<br>

In particular, the candidate should have defended a doctorate or Ph.D. <br>
in May 2008 or later. If the Ph.D. is not defended at the application <br>
date, you should clearly point out the defense date and the composition <br>
of thesis jury.</p>
