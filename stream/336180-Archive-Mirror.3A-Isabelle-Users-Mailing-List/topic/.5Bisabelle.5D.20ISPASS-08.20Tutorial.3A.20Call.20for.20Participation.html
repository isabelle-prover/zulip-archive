<p>Abstract</p>
<hr>
<p>Nowadays, computer simulation is one of the most widely used performance<br>
analysis technique. However, simulation based analysis usually provides<br>
approximate results due to its inherent nature and it cannot handle<br>
large-scale problems due to its enormous CPU time requirements. The<br>
unreliability of the results poses a serious problem in safety critical<br>
applications, such as those in space travel, military, and medicine, where<br>
a mismatch between the predicted and the actual system performance may<br>
result in either inefficient usage of the available resources or by<br>
unnecessarily paying higher costs to meet some performance or reliability<br>
criteria. A possible solution for overcoming these limitations is to<br>
conduct performance analysis within the environment of a<br>
higher-order-logic theorem prover. Higher-order logic is a system of<br>
deduction with a precise semantics and can be used for the development of<br>
almost all classical mathematical theories. Whereas, interactive theorem<br>
proving is the field of computer science and mathematical logic concerned<br>
with computer based formal proof tools that require some sort of human<br>
assistance. Due to the high expressiveness of the higher-order logic and<br>
the inherent soundness of interactive theorem proving, this approach can<br>
be used to conduct error free performance analysis at the cost of<br>
significant user interaction.</p>
<p>There has been some fruitful developments in this emerging area and a<br>
preliminary infrastructure has been proposed that allows the formalization<br>
of random variables in higherorder-logic and the formal verification their<br>
useful probabilistic and statistical properties within the theorem prover.<br>
The main focus of the tutorial is to introduce this new area of research<br>
and present its practical effectiveness for conducting precise performance<br>
analysis of real world system and software examples.</p>
<p>The tutorial begins by presenting a comprehensive introduction to formal<br>
methods and their usefulness in the system design process. It is followed<br>
by an overview of the HOL theorem prover, which is the higher-order-logic<br>
theorem prover that we have used in this project. Next, we present the<br>
process of formalizing (or modeling) random variables and verifying their<br>
correctness by proving the corresponding probabilistic and statistical<br>
properties, such as mean and variance, in HOL. These formalized random<br>
variables can be used to model the uncertainties and random elements found<br>
in a system and thus allow us to reason about its performance issues in<br>
HOL. For illustration purposes, we present the performance analysis of two<br>
examples. Firstly, we verify the average number of trials required for the<br>
Coupon Collectors problem, which is a well known commercially used<br>
algorithm. Next, we verify the average message delay relation for the<br>
Stop-and-Wait protocol, which is a commonly used Automated Repeat Request<br>
(ARQ) protocol.</p>
