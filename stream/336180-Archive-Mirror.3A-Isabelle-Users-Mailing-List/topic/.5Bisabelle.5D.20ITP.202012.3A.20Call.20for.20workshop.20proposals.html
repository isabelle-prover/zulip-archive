ITP 2012: Third Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving</p>
<p>Princeton, NJ, August 13 - 16, 2012</p>
<p>Conference home page: <a href="http://itp2012.cs.princeton.edu">itp2012.cs.princeton.edu</a></p>
<p>Call for workshop proposals</p>
<p>The ITP conference series</p>
<hr>
<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all topics related to<br>
Interactive Theorem Proving, ranging from theoretical foundations to<br>
implementation aspects and applications in program verification,<br>
security, and formalization of mathematics.</p>
<p>The third ITP conference, ITP 2012, will be held at Princeton<br>
University, between August 13th and August 16th, 2012.</p>
<p>Scope and organization of workshops</p>
<hr>
<p>Similar to previous iterations of the conference, researchers and<br>
practitioners are invited to submit proposals for colocated workshops<br>
on topics relating to interactive theorem proving. Workshops can<br>
target the ITP community in general, focus on a particular ITP system,<br>
or highlight more specific issues or recent developments. Proposals<br>
for in-depth tutorials or tool introductions are also welcome.</p>
<p>All colocated events will precede the main conference, and will be<br>
held on university premises. Conference facilities (meeting rooms,<br>
standard technical equipment) are offered free of charge to the<br>
organizers; workshop-only attendees will enjoy a significantly reduced<br>
registration fee. Participants will be able to choose between hotel<br>
accommodation or accommodation in university dormitories, both in<br>
walking distance to the conference venue.</p>
<p>Detailed organizational matters such as paper submission and review<br>
process, or publication of proceedings, are up to the organizers of<br>
individual workshops. All accepted workshops will be expected to have<br>
the programme ready by July 1st 2012.</p>
<p>Format of proposals</p>
<hr>
<p>Proposals for workshops should contain at least the following pieces<br>
of information.</p>
<ul>
<li>name and contact details of the main organizer(s)</li>
<li>names of additional organizers (optional)</li>
<li>
<p>title and organizational style of workshop (tutorial, public<br>
   workshop, project workshop, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>preferred length of workshop (half day, full day etc)</p>
</li>
<li>estimated number of attendees</li>
<li>short (up to 1 page) description of topic</li>
<li>(if applicable) pointers to previous editions of the workshop, or<br>
   to similar events</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission and notification details</p>
<hr>
<p>Proposals are invited to be submitted by email to<br>
<a href="mailto:itp2012@easychair.org">itp2012@easychair.org</a>, no later than December 5th, 2011. </p>
<p>The workshop selection committee consists of the ITP chairs</p>
<p>Andrew Appel, Princeton University<br>
    Lennart Beringer, Princeton University<br>
    Amy Felty, University of Ottawa. </p>
<p>Selected workshops will be notified by January 9th, 2012.</p>
