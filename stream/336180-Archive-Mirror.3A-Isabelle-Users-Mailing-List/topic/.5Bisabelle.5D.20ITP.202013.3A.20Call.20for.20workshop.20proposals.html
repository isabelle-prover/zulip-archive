<p>Rennes, France, July 23 - 26, 2013<br>
<a href="http://itp2013.inria.fr">http://itp2013.inria.fr</a></p>
<p>THE ITP CONFERENCE SERIES</p>
<p>SCOPE AND ORGANIZATION OF WORKSHOPS</p>
<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all topics related to <br>
Interactive Theorem Proving, ranging from theoretical foundations <br>
to implementation aspects and applications in program verification, <br>
security, and formalization of mathematics.</p>
<p>The fourth ITP conference, ITP 2013, will be held in Rennes, France,<br>
between July 23th and July 26th, 2013.  </p>
<p>Similar to previous iterations of the conference, researchers and <br>
practitioners are invited to submit proposals for colocated <br>
workshops on topics relating to interactive theorem proving. Workshops <br>
can target the ITP community in general, focus on a <br>
particular ITP system, or highlight more specific issues or recent <br>
developments.Proposals for in-depth tutorials or tool introductions are<br>
also welcome.<br>
All colocated events will precede the main conference, and will be<br>
held in the Inria Rennes research center. Conference facilities <br>
(meeting rooms, standard technical equipment) are offered free of<br>
charge to the organizers; workshop-only attendees will enjoy a <br>
significantly reduced registration fee. Detailed organizational <br>
matters such as paper submission and review process, or publication <br>
of proceedings, are up to the organizers of individual workshops.<br>
All accepted workshops will be expected to have the program ready by<br>
May 1st 2013.</p>
