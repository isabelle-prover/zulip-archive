ITP 2013: 4th International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving</p>
<p>23-26 July 2013, Rennes, France<br>
<a href="http://itp2013.inria.fr">http://itp2013.inria.fr</a></p>
<p>ITP is the premier international conference for researchers from all<br>
areas of interactive theorem proving and its applications. The<br>
inaugural meeting of ITP was held in July 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland,<br>
as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC), the second<br>
meeting took place in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, in August 2011 and<br>
the third meeting was held in Princeton, New Jersey, in  August 2012. <br>
ITP 2013 will take place in Rennes, France on 23-26 July<br>
2013 with workshops preceding the main conference.  ITP is the<br>
evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to the broad field of<br>
interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year<br>
from 1988 until 2009.</p>
<p>The program committee welcomes submissions on all aspects of<br>
interactive theorem proving and its applications.  Examples of typical<br>
topics include formal aspects of hardware or software (specification,<br>
verification, semantics, synthesis, refinement, compilation, etc.);<br>
formalization of significant bodies of mathematics; advances in<br>
theorem prover technology (automation, decision procedures, induction,<br>
combinations of systems and tools, etc.); other topics including those<br>
relating to user interfaces, education, comparisons of systems, and<br>
mechanizable logics; and concise and elegant worked examples ("Proof<br>
Pearls").</p>
<p>Submission details:</p>
<p>All papers must be submitted electronically, via EasyChair:<br>
<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2013">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2013</a></p>
<p>Papers may be no longer than 16 pages and are to be submitted in PDF<br>
using the Springer "llncs" format.  Instructions may be found at<br>
ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/instruct/authors/typeinst.pdf<br>
with Latex source file typeinst.tex in the same directory.<br>
Submissions must describe original unpublished work not submitted for<br>
publication elsewhere, presented in a way that users of other systems<br>
can understand.  The proceedings will be published as a volume in the<br>
Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series and will be<br>
available to participants at the conference.</p>
<p>In addition to regular submissions, described above, there will be a<br>
"rough diamonds" section.  Rough diamond submissions are limited to<br>
six pages and may consist of an extended abstract.  They will be<br>
refereed: they will be expected to present innovative and promising<br>
ideas, possibly in an early form and without supporting evidence.<br>
Accepted diamonds will be published in the main proceedings, and will<br>
be presented as short talks.</p>
<p>Both regular and rough diamond submissions require an abstract of 70<br>
to 150 words to be submitted electronically at the above address one<br>
week before the full submission.  All submissions must be written in<br>
English. Submissions are expected to be accompanied by verifiable<br>
evidence of a suitable implementation, such as the source files of a<br>
formalization for the proof assistant used. This material can be <br>
uploaded via easychair or made available online if a suitable URL <br>
is provided in the submitted paper. This material will not be <br>
accessed until February 11th (10 days after the paper submission <br>
deadline). Authors who have strong reasons (e.g. of commercial/legal <br>
nature) for violating this policy should contact the PC chairs in <br>
advance. At the time of abstract submission, proof assistants and <br>
other tools necessary for evaluating the submission should be <br>
indicated using the Keywords section of the web interface.</p>
<p>Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers at the<br>
conference, and will be required to sign copyright release forms. <br>
All submissions must be written in English.</p>
<p>Important dates:</p>
<p>Abstract submission deadline:           28 January 2013<br>
Paper submission deadline:              1st February 2013<br>
Notification of paper decisions:        28 March 2013<br>
Final versions due from authors:        22 April 2013<br>
Conference dates:                       23-26 July 2013</p>
