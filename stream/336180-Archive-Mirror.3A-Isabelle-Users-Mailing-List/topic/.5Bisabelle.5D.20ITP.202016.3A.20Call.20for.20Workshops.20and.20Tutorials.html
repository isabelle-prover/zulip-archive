ITP 2016: CALL FOR WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS</p>
<p>The Seventh International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving<br>
22 to 26 August 2016, Nancy, France<br>
<a href="http://itp2016.inria.fr/">http://itp2016.inria.fr/</a></p>
<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all topics related to interactive<br>
theorem proving, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation<br>
aspects and applications in program verification, security, and formalization<br>
of mathematics. The seventh ITP conference, ITP 2016, will be held at Inria<br>
Nancy - Grand-Est and LORIA between 22 and 26 August 2016.</p>
<p>Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for co-located<br>
workshops on topics relating to interactive theorem proving. Workshops can<br>
target the ITP community in general, focus on a particular ITP system, or<br>
highlight more specific issues or recent developments. Proposals for in-depth<br>
tutorials or tool introductions are also welcome.</p>
<p>Co-located events will take place on 26 (and possibly 27) August and will be<br>
held on the same premises as the main conference. Conference facilities are<br>
offered free of charge to the organizers. Workshop-only attendees will enjoy a<br>
significantly reduced registration fee.</p>
<p>Detailed organizational matters such as paper submission and review process,<br>
or publication of proceedings, are up to the organizers of individual<br>
workshops. All accepted workshops will be expected to have their program ready<br>
by 10 July 2016.</p>
<p>Proposals for workshops should contain at least the following pieces of<br>
information:</p>
<p>+ name and contact details of the main organizer(s)<br>
  + (if applicable:) names of additional organizers<br>
  + title and organizational style of workshop (tutorial, public workshop,<br>
    project workshop, etc.)</p>
<p>+ preferred length of workshop (between half day and two days)<br>
  + estimated number of attendees<br>
  + short (up to one page) description of topic<br>
  + (if applicable:) pointers to previous editions of the workshop, or to<br>
    similar events</p>
<p>Proposals are invited to be submitted by email to <a href="mailto:itp2016nancy@easychair.org">itp2016nancy@easychair.org</a>,<br>
no later than 12 December 2015. Selected workshops will be notified by 23<br>
December 2015. The workshop selection committee consists of the ITP program<br>
chairs and organizers:</p>
<p>Jasmin Christian Blanchette  (Inria Nancy &amp; LORIA, MPII Saarbrücken)<br>
    Stephan Merz  (Inria Nancy &amp; LORIA)</p>
