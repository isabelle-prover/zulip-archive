                4th International Workshop on Confluence</p>
<p>2 August 2015, Berlin, Germany<br>
                       collocated with CADE-25</p>

=====================================================================</p>
<p>Confluence provides a general notion of determinism and has been<br>
conceived as one of the central properties of rewriting<br>
systems. Confluence relates to many topics of rewriting (completion,<br>
modularity, termination, commutation, etc.) and had been investigated<br>
in many formalisms of rewriting such as first-order rewriting,<br>
lambda-calculi, higher-order rewriting, constraint rewriting,<br>
conditional rewriting, etc. Recently there is a renewed interest in<br>
confluence research, resulting in new techniques, tool support,<br>
confluence competition, and certification as well as in new<br>
applications. The scope of the workshop is all these aspects of<br>
confluence and related topics.  The goal of the workshop is to provide<br>
a forum for researchers interested in the topic of confluence to<br>
exchange and share new developments in the field. The workshop will<br>
enable discussion on theoretical results, new problems, applications,<br>
implementations and benchmarks, and share the current state-of-the-art<br>
on the development of confluence tools.  The workshop is collocated<br>
with CADE-25. Previous editions of the workshop were held in Nagoya<br>
(2012), Eindhoven (2013) and Vienna (2014).  During the workshop the<br>
4th Confluence Competition (CoCo 2015) takes place.</p>

                      4th Confluence Competition</p>

<p>Confluence provides a general notion of determinism and has been<br>
conceived as one of the central properties of rewriting. Confluence<br>
had been investigated in many formalisms of rewriting such as<br>
first-order rewriting, lambda-calculi, higher-order rewriting,<br>
constrained rewriting, conditional rewriting, etc.  Recently, several<br>
new implementations of confluence tools are reported and interest for<br>
proving/disproving confluence "automatically" has been grown. The<br>
confluence competition aims to foster the development of techniques<br>
for proving/disproving confluence automatically by a dedicated<br>
competition among such tools.</p>
<p>The 4th Confluence Competition (CoCo 2015) will run <strong><em>live</em></strong> during<br>
the 4th International Workshop on Confluence (IWC 2015), collocated<br>
with CADE-25 in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>The following categories will be run:</p>
<p>* TRS:  confluence of first-order term rewrite systems<br>
  * CTRS: confluence of conditional term rewrite systems<br>
  * CPF:  certification<br>
  * HRS:  confluence of higher-order term rewrite systems  (new!)<br>
Besides these categories, new demonstration categories<br>
will be considered if there are tools and problems dedicated to those<br>
categories. These categories are for demonstrating new<br>
attempts and/or merits of particular tools.  Submissions of new<br>
confluence problems are also welcome. For more information including<br>
examples of new categories to be considered, platforms, competition<br>
rules and problems, see the webpage of CoCo 2015 indicated above.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>* request for demonstration categories  May 31, 2015<br>
  * tool registration                     July 19, 2015<br>
  * tool submission                       July 26, 2015<br>
  * problem submission                    July 28, 2015<br>
  * competition                           August 2, 2015</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR NEW CATEGORIES:<br>
Request for new categories is via the contact email address. Please send<br>
the following information at your earliest convenience:</p>
<p>* category type (demonstration category only)<br>
  * description of problems and semantics (rewrite steps, confluence, etc.)<br>
    together with adequate references</p>
<p>* a proposal of the input format (if necessary)<br>
Requests for new categories may be rejected for technical reasons.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION OF NEW PROBLEMS:<br>
Submissions of new confluence problems are welcome. Please use the web<br>
interface of Cops (Confluence Problems) database linked from the<br>
webpage of CoCo 2015. The HRS extension of Cops is also available.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION/SUBMISSION:<br>
