<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Members of the Research Community,</p>
<p>For the purpose of implementing Peter B. Andrews' logic Q0 as presented in his <br>
standard work on higher-order logic titled "An Introduction to Mathematical <br>
Logic and Type Theory: To Truth Through Proof" within the Isabelle proof <br>
assistant software, I am looking for experts who are familiar with Isabelle and <br>
who would be interested in this project.</p>
<p>The higher-order logic Q0 has an extremely high level of <br>
formalization/mechanization (the rules applied in each single step are <br>
explicitly specified [cf. Andrews, 2002, pp. 215 ff.]), and virtually all of <br>
mathematics is reduced to formal logic according to Russell's and Whitehead's <br>
idea of logicism. The universality of Q0 as a foundation of mathematics is <br>
preserved by its independence of philosophical assumptions such as the semantic <br>
approach of model theory, as the single rule of inference (substitution, from <br>
which the rule of modus ponens is derived) is a purely syntactical rule. <br>
Technically, Q0 is typed lambda calculus in the form of a simple type theory <br>
(i.e., without type variables) and an axiomatic (Hilbert-style) deductive <br>
system with identity (equality) as the main notion, hence an improved <br>
formulation of Church's type theory [Church, 1940; cf. Andrews, 2006], which is <br>
known for its "precise formulation of the syntax" [Paulson, 1989, p. 5]. <br>
Featuring lambda calculus with the single variable binder lambda and "only four <br>
separate kinds of primitive terms: variables, constants, function applications <br>
and [lambda]-abstractions" [Gordon, 2000, p. 179], Q0 requires only two basic <br>
types (individuals and truth values) and only two basic constants <br>
(identity/equality and its counterpart, description) in order to obtain <br>
definability of all of the propositional connectives, as well as all of the <br>
quantifiers (universal, existential and uniqueness quantifier) and provability <br>
of elementary logic on the basis of only five logical axioms, and formalized <br>
number theory (with a non-logical axiom of infinity), thus reducing the <br>
language of formal logic and mathematics to a minimal set of basic notions.</p>
<p>The general intent is to obtain a system with the highest level of <br>
formalization and accuracy and with the expressiveness required for <br>
formalization (of most or all) of mathematics such that the mathematician, <br>
logician or philosopher can easily work with it whilst avoiding the burden of <br>
technical details (i.e., software configuration or programming languages) <br>
without compromising logical necessity or otherwise weakening logical rigor.</p>
<p>The implementation of Q0 should be exactly as specified in [Andrews, 2002, pp. <br>
210-215] (as a Hilbert-style system). A short description is available online <br>
at [Andrews, 2006]:<br>
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-church/#ForBasEqu">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-church/#ForBasEqu</a></p>
<p>According to a recent e-mail by Lawrence C. Paulson, an implementation of Q0 as <br>
a Hilbert-style system (as a special case within natural deduction) in Isabelle <br>
should be possible.</p>
<p>The paper "A Formulation of the Simple Theory of Types (for Isabelle)" by <br>
Paulson, in which Q0 is mentioned ("Andrews [1] presents a formulation based on <br>
equality." [Paulson, 1989, p. 14]) and in which simple type theory is <br>
implemented, but as a natural deduction system, may serve as a basis.</p>

<p>From: Ramana Kumar &lt;<a href="mailto:rk436@cam.ac.uk">rk436@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Please forgive me because I have not fully understood the motivations<br>
behind this project, and I do not want to criticise it unfairly. But I do<br>
want to make an observation.</p>
<p>As I understand it, Q0 is in some sense equivalent to the "HOL" that is<br>
already formalised in Isabelle (i.e., Isabelle/HOL), and almost all of the<br>
virtues of Q0 mentioned in your email apply also to that formalisation.<br>
Indeed there already exists substantial formalisations of mathematics and<br>
computer science in Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are already several variations of theorem provers<br>
implementing a roughly equivalent logic. The ones I can name off the top of<br>
my head include: Isabelle/HOL, HOL4, HOL Light, ProofPower/HOL, HOL Zero,<br>
and Mosquito. The OpenTheory project could be considered another variation,<br>
or as a step towards unification: it defines a standard library and an<br>
interface format aimed at sharing formal developments between all these<br>
variations of HOL.</p>
<p>There may be very good reasons to implement Q0 following Andrews's<br>
original, historical and elegant, approach. But if there happen not to be<br>
any motivations beyond increasing the proliferation of implementations of<br>
HOL, I would be wary of doing it.</p>
