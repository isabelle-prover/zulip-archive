<p>From: xanonec xyz &lt;<a href="mailto:xanonec@gmail.com">xanonec@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>Approximately a week ago I posted a question on stack overflow with regard<br>
to a possibility to import Isabelle classes into a locale. However, the<br>
question has not been answered yet. Furthermore, the question received no<br>
comments from the users of stack overflow. The question can be accessed via<br>
the following link:<br>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50085849/importing-classes-into-a-locale-in-isabelle-and-other-related-questions">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50085849/importing-classes-into-a-locale-in-isabelle-and-other-related-questions</a><br>
.</p>
<p>Please find a copy of the statement of the question below:<br>
<em>Question</em></p>
<p>- I would like to understand if there exists a simple method for<br>
   importing classes into locales.</p>
<p>- Alternatively, I would like to understand if there is a simple method<br>
   that would enable me to use multiple types within the assumptions in<br>
   classes.</p>
<p>I would like to reuse theorems that are associated with certain pre-defined<br>
classes in the library HOL for the development of my own locales. However,<br>
it seems to me that, at the moment, there are no standard methods that<br>
would allow me to achieve this (e.g. see this question<br>
&lt;<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2014-August/msg00237.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2014-August/msg00237.html</a>&gt;<br>
-<br>
clause 5).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my problem will require the definition of structures (i.e.<br>
locales or classes) with the assumptions that use multiple types. Thus, I<br>
would prefer to use locales. However, I would also like to avoid code<br>
duplication and reuse the structures that already exist in the library HOL<br>
as much as I can.</p>
<p>theory my_theory<br>
imports Complex_Main<br>
begin</p>
<p>(*It is possible to import other classes, establish a subclass relationship and<br>
use theorems from the super classes. However, if I understand correctly, it<br>
is not trivial to ensure that multiple types can be used in the assumptions<br>
that are associated with the subclass.*)<br>
class my_class = order +<br>
  fixes f :: "'a ⇒ real"<br>
begin<br>
subclass order<br>
proof<br>
qed<br>
end</p>
<p>lemma (in my_class) property_class: "⟦ x ≤ y; y ≤ z ⟧ ⟹ x ≤ z"<br>
  by auto</p>
<p>(*Multiple types can be used with ease. However, I am not sure how (if<br>
it is possible) to ensure that the lemmas that are associated with the<br>
imported class can be reused in the locale.*)<br>
locale my_locale =<br>
  less_eq: order less_eq<br>
  for less_eq :: "'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ bool" +<br>
  fixes f :: "'a ⇒ 'b"<br>
begin<br>
sublocale order<br>
proof<br>
qed<br>
end</p>
<p>sublocale my_locale ⊆ order<br>
proof<br>
qed</p>
<p>(*nitpick finds a counterexample, because, for example, less_eq is treated<br>
as a free variable.*)<br>
lemma (in my_locale) property_locale: "⟦ x ≤ y; y ≤ z ⟧ ⟹ x ≤ z"<br>
  by nitpick</p>
<p>end</p>
<p><em>Proposed solution</em></p>
<p>At the moment I am thinking about redefining the minimal amount of axioms<br>
in my own locales that is sufficient to establish the equivalence between<br>
my locales and the corresponding classes in HOL. However, this approach<br>
results in a certain amount of code duplication:</p>
<p>theory my_plan<br>
imports Complex_Main<br>
begin</p>
<p>locale partial_order =<br>
  fixes less_eq :: "'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ bool" (infixl "≼" 50)<br>
    and less :: "'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ bool" (infixl "≺" 50)<br>
  assumes refl [intro, simp]: "x ≼ x"<br>
    and anti_sym [intro]: "⟦ x ≼ y; y ≼ x ⟧ ⟹ x = y"<br>
    and trans [trans]: "⟦ x ≼ y; y ≼ z ⟧ ⟹ x ≼ z"<br>
    and less_eq: "(x ≺ y) = (x ≼ y ∧ x ≠ y)"<br>
begin<br>
end</p>
<p>sublocale partial_order ⊆ order<br>
proof<br>
  fix x y z<br>
  show "x ≼ x" by simp<br>
  show "x ≼ y ⟹ y ≼ z ⟹ x ≼ z" using local.trans by blast<br>
  show "x ≼ y ⟹ y ≼ x ⟹ x = y" by blast<br>
  show "(x ≺ y) = (x ≼ y ∧ ¬ y ≼ x)" using less_eq by auto<br>
qed</p>
<p>sublocale order ⊆ partial_order<br>
proof<br>
  fix x y z<br>
  show "x ≤ x" by simp<br>
  show "x ≤ y ⟹ y ≤ x ⟹ x = y" by simp<br>
  show "x ≤ y ⟹ y ≤ z ⟹ x ≤ z" by simp<br>
  show "(x &lt; y) = (x ≤ y ∧ x ≠ y)" by auto<br>
qed</p>
<p>lemma (in partial_order) le_imp_less_or_eq: "x ≼ y ⟹ x ≺ y ∨ x = y"<br>
  by (simp add: le_imp_less_or_eq)</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Is the approach that I intend to follow considered to be an acceptable<br>
style for the development of a library in Isabelle? Unfortunately, I have<br>
not seen this approach being used within the context of the development of<br>
HOL. However, I am still not familiar with a large part of the library.</p>
<p>- Also, please let me know if any of the information that is stated in<br>
   the definition of the question is incorrect: I am new to Isabelle.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>General comments that are not directly related to the question</em></p>
<p>Lastly, as a side note, I have noticed that there may be a certain amount<br>
of partial code duplication in HOL. In particular, it seems to me that the<br>
theories in HOL/Lattice/, HOL/Algebra/Order-HOL/Algebra/Lattice and<br>
HOL/Library/Boolean_Algebra resemble the theory in HOL/Orderings-<br>
HOL/Lattices. However, I am not certain if the equivalence between these<br>
theories was established through the sublocale/subclass relationship (e.g.<br>
see class_deps) to a sufficient extent. Of course, I understand that the<br>
theories use distinct axiomatisation and the theories in HOL/Algebra/ and<br>
HOL/Library/Boolean_Algebra are based on locales. Furthermore, the theories<br>
in HOL/Algebra/ contain a certain amount of information that has not been<br>
formalised in other theories. However, I would still like to gain a better<br>
understanding why all four theories co-exist in HOL and the relationship<br>
between these theories is not always clearly indicated.</p>

Dear xanonec,</p>
<p>let me comment to your technical questions as I also tackled the same <br>
goal as you. I'll be happy if there's a better solution, though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma (in my_locale) property_locale: "⟦ x ≤ y; y ≤ z ⟧ ⟹ x ≤ z"<br>
  by nitpick</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interpreting a class as a locale doesn't seem to import notations, so <br>
here "≤" refers to the global one for "ord", which assumes nothing (you <br>
can check by ctrl+hover on x etc.).</p>
<p>My solution is to define a locale for syntax and interpret it (sublocale <br>
is somehow slow) whenever you want to use the syntax.</p>
<p>locale ord_syntax = ord<br>
begin</p>
<p>notation less_eq (infix "⊑" 50)<br>
notation less (infix "⊏" 50)<br>
abbreviation greater_eq_syntax (infix "⊒" 50) where "greater_eq_syntax ≡ <br>
ord.greater_eq less_eq"<br>
abbreviation greater_syntax (infix "⊐" 50) where "greater_syntax ≡ <br>
ord.greater less"</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>context my_locale begin<br>
interpretation ord_syntax.<br>
lemma property_locale: "⟦ x ⊑ y; y ⊑ z ⟧ ⟹ x ⊑ z" using less_eq.order_trans.<br>
end</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Akihisa</p>

Dear Dr Akihisa Yamada,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. It seems that the solution that you have proposed<br>
may be the best solution that is currently available because it was used in<br>
HOL on several occasions. Anecdotally, it is possible that someone else has<br>
struggled with the same problem - theory Dense_Linear_Order in the folder<br>
HOL/Decision_Procs/ contains the following code:</p>
<hr>
<p>locale <em>linorder_stupid_syntax</em> = linorder<br>
begin</p>
<p>notation<br>
  less_eq  ("op ⊑") and<br>
  less_eq  ("(_/ ⊑ _)" [51, 51] 50) and<br>
  less  ("op ⊏") and<br>
  less  ("(_/ ⊏ _)"  [51, 51] 50)</p>
<p>end</p>
<hr>
<p>I have to admit that I thought that the problem is likely to be related to<br>
notation before asking the question. However, I became slightly confused<br>
after reading clause 5 in the following question:<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2014-August/msg00237.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2014-August/msg00237.html</a>.<br>
After reading clause 5 in the aforementioned question I thought that the<br>
problem may not have a trivial solution and decided to postpone the<br>
independent investigation until I receive a reply from the community.</p>
<p>If possible, I would like to provide a copy of your reply on stack<br>
overflow. Please let me know if this is acceptable (of course, I will<br>
provide a link to your original answer). Alternatively, please let me know<br>
if you would prefer to provide an answer on stack overflow yourself or you<br>
would prefer your answer not to be copied to stack overflow.</p>

Dear xanonec,</p>
<p>to start with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lastly, as a side note, I have noticed that there may be a certain amount&gt; of partial code duplication in HOL. In particular, it seems to me that<br>
the&gt; theories in HOL/Lattice/, HOL/Algebra/Order-HOL/Algebra/Lattice<br>

theories co-exist in HOL and the relationship&gt; between these theories is<br>
not always clearly indicated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a re-occuring topic on this mailing list, so let me quote from<br>
an older post<br>
(<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fa.isabelle/kRHYNQ3uFCU/discussion">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fa.isabelle/kRHYNQ3uFCU/discussion</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as a rule of thumb, there are basically two algebraic hierarchy<br>
developments in HOL:</p>
<p>HOL-Main with type classes:
* implicit use due to type inference
* pragmatic and simple sharing between similar types
* explicit definitions
* directly executable</p>
<p>HOL-Algebra with locales:
* explicit carrier – possibility to develop proper meta theory (*)
* implicit definitions where possible
* suitable for mathematics </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(*) The meaning of »meta theory« in this context is roughly that you can<br>
reason <em>about</em> algebraic structures, not only on properties of their<br>
elements.  For example, the classification of all simple groups would be<br>
meta theory, whereas the statement »The integers form a group wrt. +, 0<br>
and -« is not.</p>
<p>HOL/Library/Boolean_Algebra is somewhat special as it seems to be used<br>
only in HOL-Word.</p>
<p>Concerning re-using classes in locales: classes carry only global<br>
syntax: i.e. &lt; always refers to the global constant less, but during<br>
input / output occurences on local type 'a are replaces by the local<br>
less (»user space type system«).  Hence, when building a local upon a<br>
class, syntax must be installed explicitly.</p>
<p>It might also be the case that you only want to take over some results<br>
from an existing class; then it is usually better to formulate the<br>
locale stand-alone and use a confined interpretation:</p>
<p>class c = …</p>
<p>locale l = … &lt;operations, syntax, assumptions…&gt;<br>
begin</p>
<p>interpretation c: c … &lt;proof&gt;</p>
<p>lemma result1 = c.result1</p>
<p>lemma result2 = c.result2</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>

Dear Dr Florian Haftmann,</p>
<p>Thank your comments.</p>
<p>The extracts from the post that is available on <a href="https://groups.google.com/">https://groups.google.com/</a><br>
forum/#!topic/fa.isabelle/kRHYNQ3uFCU/discussion were helpful and provide<br>
an explanation for the observation that I made in the concluding remarks of<br>
my question.</p>
<p>Also, with the help of the previous answer and your comments, I believe I<br>
have gained a certain level of understanding of the problem that is related<br>
to the propagation of the notation/syntax from classes to locales. However,<br>
I would also like to gain further understanding of the meaning and<br>
significance of clause 5 in the post that is available on<br>

comments on other clauses were made):</p>
