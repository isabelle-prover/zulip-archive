<p>From: Alexander Krauss &lt;<a href="mailto:krauss@in.tum.de">krauss@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Jeremy,</p>
<p>All the worries you describe are definitely serious problems, and most<br>
people on this list have probably experienced this in one or the other<br>
way. Different releases of Isabelle are hardly compatible on the ML<br>
level and even the theory level requires a fair amount of changes from<br>
one release to the next. This is especially true for the transition<br>
2005-&gt;2007, due to the many accumulated changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These issues seem to be capable of causing massive and unnecessary <br>
difficulties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I cannot agree that these difficulties were unnecessary. How<br>
could they be avoided? Not making any incompatible changes to Isabelle<br>
anymore would essentially stop history and carve the current state of<br>
the art into stone.</p>
<p>The alternative - maintaining various compatibility layers that<br>
implement all interfaces and functionality present in some old versions</p>
<ul>
<li>demands a large amount of resources which we surely don't have. And it<br>
scales badly: Legacy code accumulates over time and leads to a linear<br>
(or worse) increase in maintenance costs, but development resources are<br>
(probably) constant. Companies with lots of money may be able to support<br>
this, but even then the results are not always satisfactory (think of<br>
the compatibility problems between different versions of Microsoft<br>
Office files).</li>
</ul>
<p>So the only realistic chance is that users keep up with the development<br>
and update their theories. Sticking to some old version may seem<br>
convenient for some time but, as you describe, it locks you into a<br>
closed world, where you cannot use other people's work and do not profit<br>
from new developments. Updating your theories is an investment that pays<br>
off finally. I agree that the 2005-&gt;2007 transition is undesirably<br>
painful but we are trying to make releases frequent enough to avoid this<br>
in the future. 2007-&gt;2008 is in fact not such a big deal (even with the<br>
somewhat radical removal of sets as a separate type).</p>
<p>Embrace change!</p>
<p>Alex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PS.  Anyway, what aspects of the documentation are actually tested?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The (old) Isabelle Reference Manual and the various "Logics" <br>
descriptions are still plain latex documents and hence cannot be tested. <br>
Everything else is generated from theories.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This is also my experience.  Even though ML interfaces often change <br>
substantially, it is usually reasonable easy to port old code (thanks to <br>
static type-checking in ML).</p>
<p>Proofs are much more fragile, notably unstructured ones.  One way around <br>
this is to submit theory libraries and applications to <br>
<a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/">http://afp.sourceforge.net/</a> where they get updated to latest Isabelle <br>
automagically.</p>

Even in Isabelle2007 it clearly says that the old ML Goal command is a <br>
legacy feature -- few contemporary Isabelle users will remember that it <br>
existed.</p>
<p>Legacy features just disappear at some point.  In Isabelle2008 the ML <br>
function still happens to be around, but does not work without a proper <br>
context -- almost everything in Isabelle needs one.</p>
<p>In the forthcoming Isabelle release even plain ML bindings already require <br>
a context -- we will have a purely functional ML toplevel that works <br>
seamlessly with undo and multithreading.</p>
<p>There are two ways to issue ML stuff <em>with</em> a context:</p>
<p>* Either: use the 'ML' command within the Isar toplevel, usually within <br>
    Proof General.  This is the regular, preferred way.</p>
<p>* Or: startup a raw tty Isar loop, e.g. using "isatool tty", enter a <br>
    theory, exit, poke around in ML, re-enter Isar:</p>
<p>$ isatool tty -l HOL<br>
      &gt; theory A imports Maib begin<br>
      &gt; exit<br>
      ML&gt; ...<br>
      ML&gt; Isar.loop ()</p>
<p>This scheme is useful for debugging in rare situations, e.g. when <br>
    there are problems in conjunction with the Isar toplevel itself.</p>

<p>The "old" ML Goal command was introduced in October 1998!!  It was said <br>
to _improve_ upon the old "goal" command, which _did_ require a context. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the prove_goal command - which was purely functional, and <br>
the "goal" command, which required specifying the context, were left <br>
unchanged, even though the developers then thought that non purely <br>
functional code was preferable.  Those users who preferred purely <br>
functional ML code were given the option to continue using it.  They <br>
were not compelled to go to the inconvenience of changing all their code <br>
just because the developers then had a different preference. </p>
<p>If few contemporary Isabelle users will remember that the Goal command <br>
existed, that means that, of those who used Isabelle when the Goal <br>
command was in common use, most are no longer Isabelle users.  This may <br>
well be true, I wouldn't be surprised.  But if few people can survive <br>
using Isabelle for more than a few years, that is not a great <br>
recommendation for it.</p>
<p>And what of the proofs those users did using Isabelle?  Pen and paper <br>
proofs, once published, will still be in libraries for a hundred years.  <br>
An Isabelle proof, using "Goal", will, in approach reflected in your <br>
email and other, have had a useful life of only a few years.</p>

<p>Does this mean that all the functions involving an implicit context will <br>
disappear?<br>
eg, Simp_tac, simpset, etc ?  My code is full of these.</p>

<p>I notice that the_context() has disappeared from Isabelle2008.</p>

<p>Thanks.  Incidentally, I notice that the_context() has disappeared from <br>

Once one has created the context by entering Isar and exiting it again, <br>
how does one get hold of it?</p>

Simp_tac and simpset: unit -&gt; simpset are indeed legacy features, too, <br>
although not explicitly marked as such.  When embedding ML into Isar proof <br>
text, say via the method called "tactic", you can refer to the simpset <br>
from the context via the @{simpset} antiquotation.</p>

<p>Well, this is all very well, but I have dozens of emails showing that I <br>
tried to understand what these antiquotations do and why I should use <br>
them. </p>
<p>When I failed to achieve any such understanding, I tried using them <br>
anyway, because you and others in Munich were so adamant that I should, <br>

<p>The result of this was that introducing antiquotations into my code <br>
