Dear Isabelle Users,</p>
<p>I was playing with the exercise below, and I wanted to find the<br>
theory where the indexed sum operator is defined.</p>
<p>I tried  find_consts name: Sum, but this does not seem to<br>
be the way.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>
<p>theorem sum02: "∑{0..n::nat} = n * (n+1) div 2" (is "?P n")<br>
  proof (induction n)<br>
    show "?P 0"<br>
       proof -<br>
         have "∑{0..0::nat} = 0" by simp<br>
         also have "...= 0 * 0" by simp<br>
         also have "... = 0 * (0 + 1)" by simp<br>
         also have "... = (0 * (0 + 1)) div 2" by simp<br>
         finally show ?thesis by this<br>
       qed<br>
    next<br>
      fix x0::nat<br>
      assume IH: "?P x0"<br>
      show "?P (Suc x0)"<br>

            have "∑{0..(Suc x0)} = ∑{0..x0} + Suc x0" by simp<br>
            also have  "...= ∑{0..x0} + (x0 + 1)" by simp<br>
            also have  "...= (x0 * (x0 + 1) div 2) + (x0 + 1)" by (simp<br>

<p>From: Johannes Hölzl &lt;<a href="mailto:hoelzl@in.tum.de">hoelzl@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Alfio,</p>
<p>in this case the problem is that "∑ A" (named "Setsum") is a special<br>
syntax for "∑x∈A. x" (named "setsum", note that symbol names are<br>
case-sensitive). It is defined in src/HOL/Big_Operators.thy.</p>
<p>To find "Setsum" using find_consts or find_theorem is quiet hard as it<br>
is just a syntax abbreviation and its more general form "∑x∈A. f x" is<br>
not found when you just search "∑ A".</p>
<p>Luckily with the jEdit interface for Isabelle this gets much easier as<br>
you can Ctrl-click on the constant and jump to its definition.</p>
<p>-Johannes</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
That is indeed the way and it is not just by luck, because that is an <br>
important principle of the Prover IDE: what you see as formally checked <br>
source is annotated by aspects of the logical content from the prover. <br>
So you can explore it via tooltips or hyperlinks right in the text.</p>
<p>Sometimes these "aspects" are still missing or only approximative, but the <br>
coverage is increasing over time. So the need for separate diagnostic <br>
commands like find_consts is more and more diminished.</p>

<p>From: Alfio Martini &lt;<a href="mailto:alfio.martini@acm.org">alfio.martini@acm.org</a>&gt;<br>
Thank you Makarius, Johannes and Lars.</p>
<p>It works fine, although if by chance you click first on the symbol and then<br>
later<br>
press the Control key and then click on the symbol (as I have done many<br>
times)<br>
it won´t work. You must press Control, then hover the cursor over the symbol<br>
and THEN click on the symbol. It took me a while to get it right...:-)</p>
<p>Anyway, this functionality is already mentioned in Christian´s small (and<br>
nice) tutorial on jEdit.<br>
I finally read it.</p>
<p>As many others already mentioned here, jEdit is an awesome tool. It makes<br>
using Isabelle a completely different experience.</p>
<p>It would be great to have a more solid and complete tutorial for the next<br>
release.<br>
I know that you all work very hard, but I still think that could be a<br>
priority amongst<br>
the many things that has to be done.</p>
<p>Best!</p>

This is just a different category of application: search over a <br>
"mathematical" library, and really good solutions to that are still <br>
missing.  (I am occasionally attending the MKM conference, where people <br>
are discussing that.)</p>
<p>In contrast, the application sketched in this thread, you have your formal <br>
(con)text where you presently work already.</p>
<p>In the past query tools like find_theorems were often re-used to explore <br>
the local proof context, but this can be done more directly.  Similarly <br>
replacement of interactive diagnostics can be anticipated for print_cases, <br>
print_facts, "thm calculation", "thm this" etc.</p>
<p>"Big" IDEs for Java do such things routinely.  That is conceptually not <br>
such a big deal, and no need to go back to TTY-style commands.</p>

<p>I don't agree, that's not how find_theorems gets used most often. It can be, and you're right that that part is better expressed by other methods in an IDE, but there is no way to express a context sensitive term pattern query mixed with negative naming constraints and further refinements in a simple click or tool tip.</p>
<p>We really want both tools. Simple diagnostic information should be easily and directly accessible, and more complex searches for type or term patterns need to be just as well supported. Maybe they can be integrated better (dialogs or similar, although I'm not a fan of these), but that's a different aspect.</p>
<p>Since we're on the IDE topic: one thing that we could make more use of from IDEs is intelligent context sensitive name completion (for constants, types, rules, proof methods, etc). Also, it would help if suggestions were sorted by frequency of use, e.g. "sledgehammer" should be suggested before "sledgehammer_params". Good IDEs excel at that.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting to aim for any of this in the next release, but if we're looking to improve the user experience in the future, this might make a big difference.</p>

<p>I was not talking of the search facility itself (as Gerwin noted, we have a<br>
number of nifty tools beside find_const) but how to invoke it without having to<br>
type the command name. Command completion is already nice, but still crude.<br>
Because the name can be nondescriptive and the parameters unclear. An example of<br>
what I mean: Larry was not aware of the type-based search via find_consts.<br>
Contrast this with the nice box that cmd-f gives you in many tools, eg jedit.</p>

the job.  What you see already formally in your bit of theory or an <br>

to get them to the state of the art of potential possibilities of the <br>
