was sketchy at best. One of the books we use presents the basic <br>

factorial(n) &gt;= 2^(n-1), which, if I try to do it on type nat, makes <br>
no sense for n = 0. All of the examples I have been able to find in <br>
Isar manuals and tutorials are for induction starting from 0. How do <br>
I do induction starting from 1 in Isar?<br>
P. S. While I was still in graduate school I co-wrote a paper <br>
containing an inductive proof in which the inductive step, P(k-1) <br>
implies P(k), depended on the fact that k &gt;= 3. Therefore I needed <br>
two basis steps, one for k = 1, which was trivial, and one for k = 2, <br>
which my co-author supplied. How would you do something like that in <br>
Isar?</p>

    have ?case sorry<br>

  ultimately show ?case by arith<br>

<p>If you prefer, the 0 case can be the result of the assumption "n &gt; 0". </p>

There might be a better solution, but using nat_less_induction rule <br>
(instead of the default nat_induct) associated with case distinctions (k=0, <br>
k=1, k=2, k&gt;=3) like the above should work. If you need often such kind of <br>
induction, proving another induction principle that does the case <br>
distinction might be useful.</p>

Dear Douglas,</p>
<p>remember that inductions schemes are just regular lemmas, so you can<br>
always define precisely the induction rule that you need, and use that:</p>
<p>lemma ind_from_2[case_names 0 1 2 many]:<br>
  assumes "P 0"<br>
  assumes "P 1"<br>
  assumes "P 2"<br>
  assumes "⋀ k. k ≥ 2 ⟹ P k ⟹ P (Suc k)"<br>
  shows "P n"<br>
proof(induction n)<br>
  case 0 thus ?case by fact<br>
next<br>
  case (Suc k)<br>
  have "k = 0 ∨ k = 1 ∨ k ≥ 2" by auto<br>
  with Suc.IH assms<br>
  show ?case by (auto simp add: numeral_eq_Suc)<br>
qed  </p>
<p>And later</p>
<p>lemma "foo n"<br>
proof(induction n rule: ind_from_2)<br>
case 0 show ?case...<br>
next<br>
case 1 show ?case...<br>
next<br>
case 2 show ?case...<br>
next<br>
case many show ?case... <br>
qed</p>
<p>I find this separation of concerns makes your proofs much easier to read<br>
and understand.</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
Joachim<br>

<p>From: Michael Norrish &lt;<a href="mailto:michael.norrish@nicta.com.au">michael.norrish@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
Similarly, you might prove induction lemmas like</p>
<p>⊢ P 2 ∧ (∀n. 2 ≤ n ∧ P n ⇒ P (Suc n)) ⇒ (∀n. 2 ≤ n ⇒ P n)</p>
<p>where the 2 ≤ n part has been factored out of the P.  I don’t know how to best<br>
apply this theorem in Isabelle; perhaps it would not be as easy as a regular<br>
induction because of the more complicated pattern under the ∀ in the conclusion.<br>
 (Clearly it could be cast as an introduction rule.)</p>

<p>From: Johannes Hölzl &lt;<a href="mailto:hoelzl@in.tum.de">hoelzl@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
In Isabelle one would write:</p>
<p>lemma nat_induct2[consumes 1]:<br>
  "2 &lt;= n ==&gt; P 2 ==&gt; (!!n. 2 &lt;= n ==&gt; P n ==&gt; P (Suc n)) ==&gt; P n"</p>
<p>with the consumes attribute it's stated that 2 &lt;= n is not a induction<br>
step but an assumption for the induction itself.</p>

<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:c.sternagel@gmail.com">c.sternagel@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Maybe this is a good point to remind us all of the very nice <br>
"induction_schema" method that comes with the function package by Alex <br>
Krauss (and the automatic "termination" methods that also come with it, <br>
like "lexicographic_order").</p>
<p>lemma ind_from_2 [case_names 0 1 2 many]:<br>
   fixes P :: "nat ⇒ bool"<br>
   assumes "P 0"<br>
     and "P 1"<br>
     and "P 2"<br>
     and "⋀k. k ≥ 2 ⟹ P k ⟹ P (Suc k)"<br>
   shows "P n"<br>
   using assms<br>
   apply (induction_schema)<br>
   apply (case_tac n, force, force)<br>
   apply (lexicographic_order)<br>
done</p>
<p>the 2nd line of the proof script is a bit awkward in this case, but can <br>
often be replaced by "apply (pat_completeness)" (which raises an <br>
exception on this specific example).</p>
<p>cheers</p>
