<p>From: Christoph LANGE &lt;<a href="mailto:c.lange@cs.bham.ac.uk">c.lange@cs.bham.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle experts,</p>
<p>somewhere in a proof that involves real numbers from the theory "Real" I <br>
would like to infer "(x::real) &gt;= 0" from "x &gt; 0".</p>
<p>For now I solved the problem by introducing the following axiomatic "lemma":</p>
<p>lemma greater_zero_implies_greater_equal_zero [simp] :<br>
   fixes x::real<br>
   assumes "x &gt; 0"<br>
   shows "x ≥ 0"<br>
sorry</p>
<p>(Note that I am new to Isabelle, so there might be better ways of doing <br>
this.)</p>
<p>I would be interested in some built-in rule, or a theory in the library, <br>
that would simply do this inference for me.</p>
<p>I am less interested in writing my own proof of this in place of the <br>
"sorry" above, as my overall formalisation is a higher-level applied one.</p>
<p>Cheers, and thanks in advance for any help,</p>
<p>Christoph</p>

Scanning the <em>ML</em> sources is probably not very useful. If you want to<br>
familiarize yourself with the set of available theorems, it is better<br>
to browse the .thy files in src/HOL (most lemmas about &lt; and &lt;= are in<br>
Orderings.thy) or else browse the generated pdf documentation for<br>
Isabelle/HOL (follow "document" or "outline" link from<br>
<a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/index.html">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/index.html</a>).</p>
<p>If you are looking for a specific lemma, you should definitely learn<br>
the "find_theorems" command. See e.g. section 3.1.11 of the "Tutorial<br>
on Isabelle/HOL".</p>

<p>From: Lawrence Paulson &lt;<a href="mailto:lp15@cam.ac.uk">lp15@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
The real difficulty here is that you are using assumes/shows. Then the assumption "x &gt; 0" isn't explicitly part of the subgoal and isn't visible to Isabelle's automation. The one exception is sledgehammer, which sees everything, and instantly finds a proof.</p>
<p>It would be better to state your problem more simply as follows:</p>
<p>lemma greater_zero_implies_greater_equal_zero [simp] :<br>
 fixes x::real<br>
 shows  "x &gt; 0 \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; x \&lt;ge&gt; 0"</p>
<p>Or even more simply like this:</p>
<p>lemma greater_zero_implies_greater_equal_zero [simp] :<br>
  "(x::real) &gt; 0 \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; x \&lt;ge&gt; 0"</p>
<p>Then almost anything will solve it: auto, simp, arith, force. I suggest reserving assumes/shows for complicated theorems where there are many assumptions and they aren't all wanted at the same time.</p>
<p>Another remark: I'm not sure it's a good idea to declare something like this as a default simplification rule. It will be quite generally applicable, and could increase your simplification time or even (together with similarly general conditional rewrite rules) cause looping.</p>

<p>Thanks!  Grepping the *.thy source files has been very useful for me so <br>
far.  Actually the only reason why I ended up in the ML sources was that <br>
in the theory sources there was a lot of "noise" from this rule being <br>
_applied_, so I just overlooked the lemma.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot – very helpful.  As a newbie, obviously, I knew neither of <br>
them.</p>

                            ^<br>
                            I think here it expects a numeric argument <br>
as said below; didn't work without.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>BTW in the documentation find_theorems is only mentioned in <br>
prog-prove.pdf (just searched all files with pdfgrep), and there it says:</p>
<p>--- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; ---<br>
Command find_theorems searches for specific theorems in the current theory.<br>
Search criteria include pattern matching on terms and on names. For details<br>
see the Isabelle/Isar Reference Manual [4].<br>
--- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; --- %&lt; ---</p>
<p>… but the reference manual does't mention it.</p>
<p>Generally, I had no idea that one can apply _any_ theorem using (rule <br>
name_of_theorem).  This wasn't obvious to me, and instead I had thought <br>
that "rules" are something special that's built in at the level of "a <br>
calculus for a logic".</p>

Dear Larry, dear all (some more general-interest comments below; search <br>
for "objectives"),</p>
<p>2012-08-10 12:22 Lawrence Paulson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real difficulty here is that you are using assumes/shows. Then the assumption "x &gt; 0" isn't explicitly part of the subgoal and isn't visible to Isabelle's automation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, that's good to know.  I really had thought that "assumes/shows" <br>
is just syntactic sugar for certain more complex expressions within the <br>
logic.</p>
<p>(Note: Don't be too worried when I say "I thought" or "I didn't know" or <br>
"I had no idea" – I still need to learn a lot.  Whenever I think that <br>
something should really be presented in a more learnable way, I will <br>
make it explicit, as in a bug report :-))</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be better to state your problem more simply as follows:</p>
<p>lemma greater_zero_implies_greater_equal_zero [simp] :<br>
  fixes x::real<br>
  shows  "x &gt; 0 \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; x \&lt;ge&gt; 0"</p>
<p>Or even more simply like this:</p>
<p>lemma greater_zero_implies_greater_equal_zero [simp] :<br>
   "(x::real) &gt; 0 \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; x \&lt;ge&gt; 0"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice!  I had no idea that one can omit the universal quantification of <br>
x::real here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then almost anything will solve it: auto, simp, arith, force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So from x::real these provers will know that it is a real number and <br>
therefore an element of an ordered set?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suggest reserving assumes/shows for complicated theorems where there are many assumptions and they aren't all wanted at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, that's good to know.  One of the objectives of our project <br>
(<a href="http://cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/">http://cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/</a>) is to teach ATP/ITP to <br>
non-experts from application domains, economics in our case.</p>
<p>We are interested in formalising new theorems that haven't been <br>
formalised before, but also re-formalising things that have been <br>
formalised before, but in a way that doesn't "just get the proof done", <br>
but in a way that we think we could teach to economists.</p>
<p>Therefore we would like to keep as closely as possible to paper textbook <br>
style, and for this reason I thought "the more Isar syntactic sugar the <br>
better".</p>
<p>We just got started with Isabelle (have done some formalisation in <br>
Theorema before), but first public results can be expected soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another remark: I'm not sure it's a good idea to declare something like this as a default simplification rule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the heads-up – indeed that approach resulted from the <br>
misunderstanding; I didn't know that one can simply say (rule <br>
name_of_lemma).</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

find theorems on pages 163-165.</p>

<p>Indeed – but strangely this text is not searchable.  The underscore of, <br>
e.g., find_theorems, is not represented as a usual underscore.  You can <br>
try it by searching the PDF for "find_theorems". <br>
doc-src/IsarRef/Thy/Misc.thy doesn't contain anything suspicious, so I <br>
suspect a bug in the document preparation implementation.</p>
<p>Is this list the right way to report bugs, or is there any better way?</p>

<p>Thanks, that's good to know. One of the objectives of our project<br>
(<a href="http://cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/">http://cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/</a>) is to teach ATP/ITP to<br>
non-experts from application domains, economics in our case.</p>
<p>We are interested in formalising new theorems that haven't been<br>
formalised before, but also re-formalising things that have been<br>
formalised before, but in a way that doesn't "just get the proof done",<br>
but in a way that we think we could teach to economists.</p>
<p>Therefore we would like to keep as closely as possible to paper textbook<br>
style, and for this reason I thought "the more Isar syntactic sugar the<br>
better".</p>

<p>This is entirely a matter of preference. I usually prefer structured <br>

<p>Good point – I didn't realize, as I mainly use PDF viewers that support <br>
them.  But indeed I see that Adobe Reader doesn't.</p>
<p>This post might be helpful: <br>

<p>I'm not sure whether this solution is generally applicable, but maybe <br>
the LaTeX-to-PDF creation workflow of Isabelle could be adapted to take <br>
this fix into account.  (This won't fix the unterscore problem yet.)</p>

<p>That is one of the core ideas in Isabelle, going right back to 1986.</p>

<p>You can post whatever you want on this list, as long as it refers to the<br>
official Isabelle release -- normally the latest one, or one or two <br>
versions behind.</p>
<p>It also helps to search the mailing list archives.  See the links on the <br>
Isabelle website front page.</p>
<p>BTW, after more than 25 years certain things in Isabelle are just as they <br>
are to the good or to the confusion of new users.  "Bugs" are very rare -- <br>
often it is just a misunderstanding what to expect.</p>
<p>Of course it always helps if you report your observations and share the <br>
experience to get things the way you need them.</p>
