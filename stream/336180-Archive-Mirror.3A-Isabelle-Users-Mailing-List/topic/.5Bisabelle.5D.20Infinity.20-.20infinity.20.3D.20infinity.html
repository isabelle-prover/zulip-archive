Dear Jasmin,</p>
<p>Are you sure your definition works?</p>
<p>I don't think cancel_comm_monoid_add will ever hold for enat or ennreal<br>
for a reasonable definition of minus. "a + b - a = b" is independent of<br>
 the definition of minus: if a is ∞ then we always get "∞ - a = b"</p>
<p>I would love to have better support for minus on enat and ennreal.<br>
Andreas added a couple of years ago support for cancellation of<br>
additive and multiplicative terms. Maybe we can also add something like<br>
 this for minus?</p>
<p>When I added ennreal I also thought about adding additional type<br>
classes for enat and ennreal with a better support for non-cancellable<br>
monoids. I think we can factor out some theorems from existing type<br>
classes, like add_diff_assoc2. Or the second rule of<br>
cancel_comm_monoid_add.</p>

This really depends on what you want to use the extended numbers for. If you just want to <br>
compute the length of a coinductive list, then enat is better than the hypernats. For <br>
example, the equation</p>
<p>llength (lappend xs ys) = llength xs + llength ys</p>
<p>holds for enat, but not for hypernats, because lappend xs ys = xs if xs is infinite. Also, <br>
I am pretty sure that the Max-Flow-Min-Cut theorem for countable graphs (AFP entry <br>
MFMC_Countable) holds only on extended reals, but not on hyperreals.</p>

Another idea of mine was to embed the extended numbers into the non-standard numbers. The <br>
idea was to do this embedding in a simproc and run linarith on the embedded terms. The <br>
embedding only works if some case analyses are done (in particular for terms like \infty - <br>
\infty), but I guess that one can save some case analyses this way. But the details have <br>
not been worked out so far.</p>

Do correct me if I am wrong, but in my naïveté, I would have thought<br>
that one should always be able to accommodate a different definition of<br>
"∞ - ∞" in quantifier elimination, at worst by adding an extra case for<br>
"a = ∞ ∧ b = ∞".</p>

But this property is still too weak for your purposes. The properties you state in your original message (as necessary for the decision procedure) are first-order and will hold for the non-standard naturals.</p>
<p>Of course I understand that they don't suit all purposes, because they don't give a unique "infinity".</p>

<p>Not anymore. ;) Nitpick finds counterexamples for pretty much any property I hoped to have. Clearly, I could have spared myself some embarrassment by firing up this tool earlier.</p>
<p>What I'll take home from this is that subtraction on "enat" is necessarily a messy business.</p>

<p>AFAIU, »∞ - ∞« is similar to »1 / 0«: there is no definition for it that<br>
satisfied fundamental desired algebraic properties.</p>
