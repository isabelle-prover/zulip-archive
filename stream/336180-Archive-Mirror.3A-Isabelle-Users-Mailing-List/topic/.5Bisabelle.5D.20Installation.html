Hi,</p>
<p>I am having trouble with installation. My OS is Windows 10 (Creators update). When I try to run Isabelle 64 bit I get following message:</p>

This looks like one of these "rebase" problems of Cygwin. In principle<br>
the bundled Cygwin of Isabelle should be OK with its automatic<br>
invocation of rebaseall on first startup, but there might be corner<br>
cases that don't work.</p>
<p>Searching the web for Cygwin rebase issues on Windows 10, I get the<br>
impression that a proper reboot of the OS could be sufficient, although<br>
part of the problem is that Windows 10 uses suspend/resume by default.</p>
<p>So if a plain restart does not help, here are some hints to force a true<br>
shutdown<br>

and thus have a really clean restart afterwards.</p>
