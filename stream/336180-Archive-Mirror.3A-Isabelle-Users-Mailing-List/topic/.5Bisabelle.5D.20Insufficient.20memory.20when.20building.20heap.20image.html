<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hallo,</p>
<p>I tried to build a heap image with "isabelle usedir", and the programme<br>
completed - apparently successfully - but the heap image was nowhere to<br>
be found. I then looked at the log file in the ~/.isabelle/ directory<br>
and it turns out PolyML threw an "Insufficient Memory" exception and died.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to have Isabelle display an error message in these<br>
cases so that the user knows something went wrong?</p>
<p>Also, if I load all these theories by hand by importing them in a theory<br>
and loading that theory in Proof General, everything seems to work, but<br>
when I do "isabelle usedir" with an appropriate ROOT.ML file, I get this<br>
insufficient memory exception. The reason for that is that, apparently,<br>
"Isabelle usedir" uses up to 6.5 GiB of memory (tested on a 64 bit<br>
system), but the computer with which I normally work runs a 32 bit<br>
system, so I only have 4 GiB per process.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this huge memory usage compared to the more<br>
moderate requirements of loading the theories with Proof General? Is<br>
there some workaround to build this heap image on a 32 bit system?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Manuel</p>

the current interactive document model, the one that is used for <br>
Isabelle/jEdit.  So after a few more rounds of refinements, and when Proof <br>

<p>You need to find out where the resources are going, i.e. which part of <br>
your application burns them.  You may try this in plain "isabelle tty" <br>
which is a bit closer to batch mode than the Proof General interaction <br>
mode.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can ignore the problem and use current polyml-5.5.0 <br>
from here: <a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/components/polyml-5.5.0.tar.gz">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/components/polyml-5.5.0.tar.gz</a></p>
<p>This is the brand-new Poly/ML release, with greatly improved heap <br>
management (parallel garbage collection and online sharing of values).<br>
It is able to run much larger Isabelle applications even in 32bit mode.</p>
<p>To use the above polyml-5.5.0 component in Isabelle2012, add something <br>
like this to your $ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/settings:</p>
<p>ML_SYSTEM=polyml-5.5.0<br>
   ML_PLATFORM="$ISABELLE_PLATFORM"<br>
   ML_HOME="/some/where/polyml-5.5.0/$ML_PLATFORM"<br>
   ML_OPTIONS="-H 500"<br>
   ML_SOURCES="$ML_HOME/../src"</p>
<p>Then rebuild the required images as usual via Isabelle2012/build.</p>

Hallo,</p>
<p>thanks for the quick reply, I should probably give the new PolyML a try<br>
then.</p>
<p>However, I do not quite understand what you mean with this:</p>

I think Makarius just means that it's generally a bad idea to have two modes, because it's more likely that at least one of them will break.</p>
<p>I don't know for the other options, but "quick and dirty" is certainly not a good idea in general, as illustrated recently on this mailing list by Brian Huffman, who derived "False" by exploiting a bug in the "datatype" package. Then you're thankful that your command-line-based nightly tests have it disabled.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Having "modes", i.e. opportunities for slightly changed behaviour is <br>
indeed evil in its own right.  In the end the possibilities of every <br>
system component that might change its behaviour are multiplied, so you <br>
get an exponential number of oddities in the worst case.</p>
<p>The traditional "interactive mode" vs. "batch mode" has accumulated quite <br>
a few such oddities over time, and it will take a few more years to chop <br>
off most of the heads of the hydra.</p>
<p>Quick and dirty mode is a well-known special case of this principle, and <br>
Proof General has depended on it a lot, and will continue to do so, <br>
because it is not moving anymore.</p>
<p>These things need to be understood from their historic context and <br>
technical side-condutions. In the next Isabelle release, the regular <br>
Isabelle/jEdit interaction mode will already work smoothly without quick <br>
and dirty, because proofs are parallel by default, and not so expensive <br>
after all in the overall bilance.</p>
<p>At some later stage the competiting "skip_proofs" feature should be <br>
somehow integrated into the parallel interaction model, lets say as forked <br>
proofs that are deferred for much longer, or indefinitely.</p>
