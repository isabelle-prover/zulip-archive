<p>From: Scott West &lt;<a href="mailto:scott.west@inf.ethz.ch">scott.west@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Hello list!</p>
<p>Is there a standard, accepted, advised, or otherwise endorsed method of <br>
interfacing with the Isabelle system? Currently I have a small program <br>
which spawns a Isabelle TTY through the isatool, and communicates <br>
through the standard handles.</p>
<p>I feel this may not be the best way for automated-interaction (I'm <br>
trying to see if I can make a new interface). Is there some other way <br>
that is recommended? I also tried just invoking isabelle, at which point <br>
I became stymied by the documentation of the underlying ML (is there <br>
some disjointedness between the documentation and the current release?).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Scott West</p>
<p>(PS, sorry if this is the third message that is received of this sort, <br>
the list wasn't responding to my mails...)</p>

<p>Traditionally, the "standard" way to work with Isabelle under external <br>
program control is rather primitive, see the "isabelle-process" command in <br>
the system manual.  Here you get access to the raw ML toplevel, and you <br>
can pass ML expressions via the -e option.  In principle this allows you <br>
to do whatever you want, by invoking suitable ML things of your own <br>
making.  (Which is quite admittedly quite hard.)</p>
<p>A few such interaction wrappers have emerged in the past (notably for <br>
Proof General), and made it into the official distribution, adding funny <br>
options like -P -I -X to isabelle-process.</p>
<p>Starting with Isabelle2008 we have introduced one final wrapper <br>
(isabelle-process option -W), which is meant to interface to a proper API <br>
that lives in the JVM world.  That JVM library is part of the official <br>
Isabelle distribution, so user code does not need to fiddle with low-level <br>
interaction protocols anymore (that is the basic plan).</p>
<p>In Isabelle2008 this extra layer is still Java/JVM, but we have already <br>
left behind Java altogether in favour of Scala/JVM (which is the Next Big <br>
Thing in programming language design, see <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">http://www.scala-lang.org/</a>).</p>
<p>There are still many things missing here; we have only started to make <br>
actual use of Isabelle within the Scala/JVM world, using jEdit as editor <br>
framework.  Others have tried Netbeans with some success.</p>

<p>Can you be more specific what you are working on?  Interacting with <br>
interactive provers under program control is very hard to get right.  I <br>
have been involved in a couple of attempts so far, some succesful, many <br>
failed.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The manuals usually lag behind the real system a couple of years.  The <br>
newer manuals are at least formally checked against the system, meaning <br>
that any references to ML entities, Isar commands, methods etc. correct.</p>
<p>For the forthcoming release the main reference manuals (isar-ref, <br>
implementation, system) come in significantly updated and extended <br>
versions.  If your are interested, you may already peek at this version <br>
via the repository <br>

<p>It is usually easier to peek at (fully tested) snapshots via <br>

<p>Well, your ML function does not have to terminate immediately.  The setup <br>
for Proof General for example takes over the tty and then reacts to <br>
further input.  All of this is very delicate to get right, though.  <br>
Better try something based on the new process wrapper.</p>

I've found the grammar for the Isabelle input syntax, but I have yet to <br>
find one for the Isabelle output. Does one exist that you know of? It <br>
seems this would be crucial for the creation of higher levels of control <br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
(1) Command syntax.</p>
<p>The grammars for Isabelle/Isar commands, methods, attributes etc. in the <br>
manual are only for end-users.  When building a system that operates on <br>
input source systematically, you cannot count on that.  First of all, <br>
maintaining consistency with such a huge specification is practically <br>
impossible (the manual itself is probably not 100% correct).  Secondly <br>
such a specification can never be complete, because user applications may <br>
introduce new language elements at any time (Isabelle/HOL is just an <br>
"application" in that sense, albeit a large one).</p>
<p>What interfaces can rely on is the outer token syntax and the <br>
categorisation of "command keywords" as produced by a particular logic <br>
session.  The editor side can then chop up the source into "command spans" <br>
and rely on the system reacting in a certain way, e.g. do a theory update <br>
as in 'definition' or start a proof as in 'theorem'.  A very basic ML <br>
example of this rough syntactic analysis is parse_spans in <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/83c50c62cf23/src/Pure/Thy/thy_syntax.ML">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/83c50c62cf23/src/Pure/Thy/thy_syntax.ML</a></p>
<p>At some later stage we will provide this kind of functionality on the <br>
Scala level as well, but it will be more flexible, operating on some kind <br>
of editor buffer model instead of doing batch-mode parsing.</p>
<p>(2) Message syntax.</p>
<p>Messages are merely packets of text sent to certain "output channels", <br>
e.g. writeln, warning, error. There are hooks for each channel, so the <br>
interface ML wrapper can do whatever it needs to do.  E.g. see <br>
Output.warning_fn and its redifinition in the various wrappers (use "grep <br>
-r" or hypersearch in jEdit to find the places).</p>
<p>Thus you get messages plus some message type information.  Apart from that <br>
there is usually extra markup within the body, e.g. when printing a term <br>
you get information about bound, free, schematic variables etc.  Proof <br>
General turns this into the well-known colour scheme for variables.  You <br>
can also inspect the markup in semi-human-readable form like this in Proof <br>
General:</p>
<p>thm (test_markup) exE</p>
<p>The representation of markup in existing interfaces is quite adhoc -- no <br>
need to look into that.  The new Isabelle process wrapper (remember <br>
isabelle-process option -W) always uses (untyped) XML trees encoded in <br>
YXML transfer syntax (this format is explained in the Isabelle System <br>
manual).  When using the Scala wrapper around that, you do not have to <br>
care about the encoding, but get back the tree structure directly.</p>
<p>These trees are still uninterpreted.  We will probably add some kind of <br>
default rendering via CSS at some stage.</p>
<p>(3) Scala wrapper.</p>
<p>I have mentioned the Isabelle scala wrapper several times already.  Here <br>
is a simple example session (using the development snapshot of Isabelle, <br>
or a repository version after invoking "Admin/build jars"):</p>
<p>$ isabelle scala<br>
  scala&gt; val p = new isabelle.IsabelleProcess("HOL")<br>
  scala&gt; p.command(""" theory A imports Main begin """)</p>
<p>WRITELN [[theory A]]</p>
<p>scala&gt; p.command(""" theorem "A --&gt; A" """)</p>
<p>WRITELN [[proof (prove): step 0</p>
<p>goal (1 subgoal):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A --&gt; A]]</p>
<p>scala&gt; p.command(""" .. """)</p>
<p>WRITELN [[theorem ?A --&gt; ?A]]</p>
<p>scala&gt; p.command(""" end """)<br>
scala&gt; p.close</p>
<p>...</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the transscript I have suppressed some of the more chatty messages.  <br>
Here you have direct access to the most basic prover protocol: <br>
commands-in, messages-out.  But the protocol is not as simple as it seems, <br>
because commands can produces any number of messages in any order, <br>
potentially intermingled with messages from other commands that are <br>
running concurrently.  (Note that the prover "prompt" still used in Proof <br>
General no longer exists.)</p>
<p>Our next step is to wrap up the command/message protocol into a proper <br>
document model that maintains sources + command structure + message <br>
feedback as extra markup to the sources.</p>
