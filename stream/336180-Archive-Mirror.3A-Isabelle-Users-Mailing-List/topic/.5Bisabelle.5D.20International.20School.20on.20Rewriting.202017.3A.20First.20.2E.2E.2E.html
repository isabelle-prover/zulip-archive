First Call for Participation</p>
<p>9th INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL ON REWRITING (ISR 2017)<br>
July 3-7, 2017, Eindhoven, The Netherlands<br>
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~hzantema/isr.html">http://www.win.tue.nl/~hzantema/isr.html</a></p>
<p>Early registration deadline: May 15, 2017<br>
The 9th International School on Rewriting (ISR 2017) is aimed at master<br>
and PhD students, researchers, and practitioners interested in the study<br>
of rewriting concepts and their applications.</p>
<p>The school features lectures by renowned researchers in rewriting, and<br>
is organized in two parallel tracks: the Basic Track and the Advanced Track.</p>
<p>The BASIC TRACK is intended for students who enter the field. The basic<br>
track can, if desired, be round off with an examination of 3EC.<br>
The teachers of the Basic Track are</p>
<p>Aart Middeldorp (University of Innsbruck)<br>
   Sarah Winkler (University of Innsbruck)</p>
<p>The ADVANCED TRACK consists of eight shorter courses, showing different<br>
areas of rewriting research and applications. The teachers and courses<br>
of the Advanced Track are:</p>
<p>Beniamino Accatoli (INRIA)<br>
  The Complexity of Beta-Reduction</p>
<p>Carsten Fuhs (University of London)<br>
  Proving Program Termination via Term Rewriting</p>
<p>Thomas Genet (IRISA, France)<br>
  Tree Automata for Reachability in Rewriting</p>
<p>Philippe Malbos (University of Lyon) and<br>
  Samuel Mimram (Ecole Polytechnique)<br>
  Two-dimensional Rewriting Techniques and Applications</p>
<p>Temur Kutsia (University of Linz)<br>
  Solving Equational Problems: Matching and Unification</p>
<p>Julian Nagele (University of Innsbruck) and<br>
  Vincent van Oostrom (University of Innsbruck)<br>
  Commutation</p>
<p>Christian Sternagel (University of Innsbruck) and<br>
  René Thiemann (University of Innsbruck)<br>
  Formalizing Rewriting in Isabelle</p>
<p>Johannes Waldmann (RWTH Leipzig)<br>
  Weighted Automata and Rewriting</p>
<p>There will be the opportunity for participants to present their own<br>
research.</p>
<p>Registration:<br>
You can register for ISR 2017 by sending an email to <a href="mailto:h.zantema@tue.nl">h.zantema@tue.nl</a>.<br>
Please mention your full name, institution, and the track you wish to<br>
attend.<br>
It is appreciated if you mention the subjects you are particularly<br>
interested in.</p>
<p>Registration fee:<br>
The registration fee is 250 euro for early registrations (before May 15,<br>
2017), and 300 euro for late registrations (starting May 16, 2107).<br>
Registrations includes access to the lectures, printed copies of or<br>
electronic access to material provided by the lecturers, coffee breaks<br>
and lunches on Monday-Friday, and the excursion and dinner on Wednesday.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the organisers:</p>

<p>====================================================================<br>
International Schools on Rewriting are promoted<br>
by the IFIP Working Group 1.6 Term Rewriting.</p>
<p>Rewriting is a branch of computer science whose origins go back<br>
to the origins of computer science itself (with Thue, Church, Post,<br>
and many other prominent researchers). It has strong links with<br>
mathematics, algebra, and logic, and it is the basis of well-known<br>
programming paradigms like functional and equational programming.<br>
In these programming paradigms and corresponding languages, the notions<br>
of reduction, pattern matching, confluence, termination, strategy,<br>
etc., are essential. Rewriting provides a solid framework for<br>
understanding, using, and teaching all these notions. Rewriting<br>
techniques are also used in many other areas of software engineering<br>
(scripting, prototyping, automated transformation of legacy systems,<br>
refactoring, web services, etc.) Rewriting techniques play a relevant<br>
role in computing research, education, and industry.</p>
