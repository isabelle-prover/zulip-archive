Second Call for Participation</p>
<p>9th INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL ON REWRITING (ISR 2017) </p>
<p><strong>*  with a course on formalizing  rewriting in Isabelle </strong>*</p>
<p>July 3-7, 2017, Eindhoven, The Netherlands <br>
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~hzantema/isr.html">http://www.win.tue.nl/~hzantema/isr.html</a></p>
<p>Early registration deadline: May 15, 2017 </p>
<p>The 9th International School on Rewriting (ISR 2017) is aimed at master <br>
and PhD students, researchers, and practitioners interested in the study <br>
of rewriting concepts and their applications.</p>
<p>The school features lectures by renowned researchers in rewriting, and is <br>
organized in two parallel tracks: the Basic Track and the Advanced Track.</p>
<p>The BASIC TRACK is intended for students who enter the field. <br>
The basic track can, if desired, be round off with an examination of 3EC.<br>
The teachers of the Basic Track are</p>
<p>Aart Middeldorp (University of Innsbruck)<br>
   Sarah Winkler (University of Innsbruck)</p>
<p>The ADVANCED TRACK consists of eight shorter courses.<br>
The (preliminary) program of the Advanced Track is available via the website<br>
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~hzantema/isr.html">http://www.win.tue.nl/~hzantema/isr.html</a><br>
The teachers and courses of the Advanced Track are:</p>
<p>Beniamino Accatoli (INRIA)<br>
  The Complexity of Beta-Reduction</p>
<p>Carsten Fuhs (University of London)<br>
  Proving Program Termination via Term Rewriting</p>
<p>Thomas Genet (IRISA, France)<br>
  Tree Automata for Reachability in Rewriting</p>
<p>Philippe Malbos (University of Lyon), and <br>
  Samuel Mimram (Ecole Polytechnique)<br>
  Two-dimensional Rewriting Techniques and Applications</p>
<p>Temur Kutsia (University of Linz)<br>
  Solving Equational Problems: Matching and Unification</p>
<p>Julian Nagele (University of Innsbruck), and <br>

<p>Christian Sternagel (University of Innsbruck), and <br>
  René Thiemann (University of Innsbruck)<br>
  Formalizing Rewriting in Isabelle</p>
<p>Johannes Waldmann (RWTH Leipzig)<br>
  Weighted Automata and Rewriting</p>
<p>Poster Session:<br>
Every participant has the opportunity to participate in the Poster Session.<br>
The posters will be shown during the school, <br>
and can be presented in the Poster Session on Wednesday.</p>

<p>====================================================================<br>
International Schools on Rewriting are promoted<br>
by the IFIP Working Group 1.6 Term Rewriting.</p>
<p>Rewriting is a branch of computer science whose origins go back<br>
to the origins of computer science itself (with Thue, Church, Post,<br>
and many other prominent researchers). It has strong links with<br>
mathematics, algebra, and logic, and it is the basis of well-known<br>
programming paradigms like functional and equational programming.<br>
In these programming paradigms and corresponding languages, the notions<br>
of reduction, pattern matching, confluence, termination, strategy,<br>
etc., are essential. Rewriting provides a solid framework for<br>
understanding, using, and teaching all these notions. Rewriting<br>
techniques are also used in many other areas of software engineering<br>
(scripting, prototyping, automated transformation of legacy systems,<br>
refactoring, web services, etc.) Rewriting techniques play a relevant<br>
role in computing research, education, and industry.</p>
