Graduate and Undergraduate Internships<br>
(U.S. Citizens only)<br>
Naval Research Laboratory<br>
Center for High Assurance Computer Systems<br>
Washington, DC 20375</p>
<p>The Software Engineering Section of NRL’s Center for High Assurance <br>
Computer Systems is offering paid student internships for Summer 2018. <br>
Several ongoing projects within the section, all in the general area of <br>
formal methods for critical systems, have internships available for both <br>
graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>The objective of the section’s research program is to develop formal, <br>
mathematically based methods, models, algorithms, theories, and tools <br>
supporting both the construction and analysis of software at different <br>
levels of abstraction, from requirements through code. Such methods and <br>
tools provide vital support for the development of high assurance <br>
software for systems, such as autonomous systems, security systems and <br>
devices, and control software, that must satisfy critical system <br>
properties such as safety, timing, fault tolerance, and security. Many <br>
of the formal-methods-based techniques and tools produced in the <br>
Section’s past research have been applied to real Navy systems.</p>
<p>We are interested in applicants with expertise in any of the following:</p>
<p>·formal modeling/specification of software and systems</p>
<p>·verification techniques and tools: decision procedures, SMT solvers, <br>
model checkers, theorem provers</p>
<p>·integration of analysis tools</p>
<p>·simulation of physical dynamics, ROS, Gazebo, cosimulation of software <br>
and physical/mechanical processes</p>
<p>·compositional model-based techniques for software construction and analysis</p>
<p>·construction and analysis of continuous &amp; discrete timed models of <br>
cyber-physical systems</p>
<p>·automatic generation of code assertions and procedure contracts</p>
<p>·incremental parsing</p>
<p>·incremental/regression verification</p>
<p>·programming in: C, Java, Python</p>
<p>·parser generation using Antlr</p>
<p>·MySQL database development</p>
<p>Current research in the section includes:</p>
<p>Application-Specific Security of Source Code: This project is developing <br>
theory, methods, and tools for analyzing source code for <br>
application-specific security properties such as data separation, <br>
absence of undesirable information flows, nonbypassability of critical <br>
code, and proper memory sanitization. The research combines <br>
template-based specification of security properties with automatic <br>
generation and checking of assertions to verify that code satisfies the <br>
specified properties and to detect violations of those properties.</p>
<p>High Assurance Cyber-Physical Systems:This project is developing new <br>
theory, methods, and tools for model-based development of cyber-physical <br>
systems.All methods and tools developed in the project will be <br>
demonstrated on real systems, which may include unmanned vehicles and <br>
robots.</p>
<p>Applications of Formal Methods in Developing Real Critical Systems:</p>
<p>(1) Robotics: Formal-methods-based modeling and analysis techniques and <br>
tools are being applied to critical software components of a robot <br>
designed to service satellites in space. In addition to applying <br>
well-established formal analysis methods and tools, new analysis <br>
techniques and tools are being developed to provide assurance that the <br>
robot behaves safely and functions correctly.</p>
<p>(2) Secure Systems: Formal analysis methods and tools are being <br>
developed and applied to critical aspects of a framework for <br>
self-securing systems.</p>
