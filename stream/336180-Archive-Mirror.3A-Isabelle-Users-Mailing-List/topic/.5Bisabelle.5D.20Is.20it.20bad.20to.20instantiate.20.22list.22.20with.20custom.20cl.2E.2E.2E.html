<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I work with limited knowledge, so if I stumble onto something useful <br>
then I resort to it a lot.</p>
<p>I've resorted a lot to wrapping a type in a datatype to be able to <br>
instantiate the type with type classes.</p>
<p>This question is about "bool list" in particular, but it's also of <br>
interest to me in general.</p>
<p>What I have is "bool list" in a 1-1 relation with non-zero nat, but I <br>
don't use it directly. I put it in a datatype like this:</p>
<p>datatype_new boD = bo_C "bool list"</p>
<p>I did that in the past because:</p>
<p>1) I didn't know how to do what has now come to my mind,</p>
<p>2) but also, I thought that doing such a thing would be hijacking "list".</p>
<p>I have a type class, which I eventually will want to prove some things <br>
about:</p>
<p>class binc =<br>
     fixes binc :: "'a =&gt; 'a"</p>
<p>This is a binary increment function, which for "bool list" is in this <br>
instantiation, for the moment:</p>
<p>instantiation list :: ("{complete_boolean_algebra, linorder}") binc<br>
   begin<br>
   primrec binc_list :: "bool list =&gt; bool list" where<br>
     "binc_list []       = False # []"<br>
    |"binc_list (b # bl) = (if b = False then True # bl else False # <br>
(binc_list bl))"<br>
   instance ..<br>
   end</p>
<p>I got that idea from the increment function in Num.thy.</p>
<p>The part of instantiating "bool list" that was foggy for me was the idea <br>
that I needed to find a bunch of type classes which "bool" satisfies. <br>
The light bulb finally turned on.</p>
<p>For the above, I executed "print_classes" and found that "bool" had been <br>
instantiated for 42 type classes. I picked the two above with the idea <br>
that I need type classes that will give "bool list" enough properites of <br>
"nat" to prove what I need. Those looked like a good start.</p>
<p>Is instantiating "list" like this a bad thing in general?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>

This will not work the way you expect. To make the list type an instance of binc, you have <br>
to do this for lists of arbitrary elements of the assumed sort <br>
("{complete_boolean_algebra, linorder}" in this example), not for a specific type bool. As <br>
it is now, you define a function binc_list which is completely unrelated to binc. You will <br>
realise this at the latest when you introcude some assumptions about binc and are unable <br>
to prove them for your attempted instantiation.</p>

<p>Note that if you replace False by bot and True by top, then your definition should <br>
generalise to 'a :: {complete_boolean_algebra, linorder}.</p>

If you define your own type classes and instantiate them for list, that is all right. <br>

or other people, because this may restrict the interoperability with the formalisations of <br>

<p>Andreas,</p>
<p>Thanks. Abstract thinking, it can incapacitate a majority of neurons. In <br>
this case, among other reasons, because my goal wasn't to generalize <br>
anything for "list".</p>
<p>The syntax 'instantiation list :: ("{......}") binc ' required one or <br>
more type classes between the braces, so I was trying to make it <br>
concrete as possible for "bool", instead of abstract as possible for "'a <br>
list".</p>
<p>So now, using your tip, I've generalized it for "list" with the minimum <br>
requirements:</p>
<p>instantiation list :: ("{bot,top}") binc<br>
begin<br>
primrec binc_list :: "'a list ⇒ 'a list" where<br>
"binc_list [] = bot # []"<br>
|"binc_list (b # bl) = (if b = bot then top # bl else bot # (binc_list bl))"<br>
instance ..<br>
end</p>
<p>I make "binc" a syntactic type class, and I guess in future, if I build <br>
on that with "assumes" in type classes designed for my other concrete <br>
datatypes, I then should try to figure if my assumptions are applicable <br>
to "'a list".</p>

<p>Specifically, I wanted to decide if I could instantiate "list" for <br>
"numeral", to get the convenience of using standard number syntax with <br>
"bool list", since it's 1-to-1 with non-zero nat, but I had the right, <br>
foggy idea to begin with, that I shouldn't be hijacking "list" like that.</p>
<p>So, I think the answer is that I can instantiate "list" for my own <br>
syntactic type classes, but I should rarely, if ever, instantiate a <br>
general HOL type for any general HOL type class.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
