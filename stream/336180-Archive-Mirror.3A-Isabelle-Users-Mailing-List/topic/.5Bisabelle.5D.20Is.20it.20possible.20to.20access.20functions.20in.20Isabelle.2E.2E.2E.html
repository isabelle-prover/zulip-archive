<p>From: Wenda Li &lt;<a href="mailto:wl302@cam.ac.uk">wl302@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle/ML experts,</p>
<p>Suppose I have a function/constant in Isabelle/ML:</p>
<p>ML {*<br>
val f:term -&gt; term = (fn x =&gt; x);<br>
*}</p>
<p>I was wondering if I can somehow access it in the top level. That is, I <br>
wish I could define a function based on f:</p>
<p>definition "foo x=f x" (<em>not working yet</em>)</p>
<p>I know we can do similar things with theorem:</p>
<p>ML {*<br>
   ML_Thms.bind_thm("foo",@{thm exI});<br>
*}<br>
thm foo</p>
<p>In fact, this question is a follow-up question to my previous query:</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-April/msg00102.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-April/msg00102.html</a></p>
<p>where I want to use a piece of untrusted code (in Isabelle/ML probably) <br>
to compute some untrusted but verifiable results. In order to verify and <br>
use such results, I may need to extract them from the Isabelle/ML level <br>
to the top level.</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated,<br>
Wenda</p>

<p>From: Wenda Li &lt;<a href="mailto:wl302@cam.ac.uk">wl302@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Andreas,</p>
<p>Many thanks for referring me to Lars Hupel' wonderful SPLICE technique! <br>
It did seem quite relevant in my situation. However, it seems that the <br>
SPLICE can only embed "static" code (I am not sure if my description is <br>
accurate or not) in Isabelle/ML to the top level. For example,</p>
<p>theory Scratch4 imports<br>
   Main<br>
   "Splice/Splice"<br>
begin</p>
<p>ML {*<br>
val g:int -&gt; int = (fn x =&gt; x+2);</p>
<p>fun g1 (x:term): term = (if is_Bound x then x else g <br>
(HOLogic.dest_number x |&gt; snd) |&gt; HOLogic.mk_number @{typ int}) ;</p>
<p>fun g2 (x:term):term  =  Const ("<a href="http://Groups.plus_class.plus">Groups.plus_class.plus</a>", @{typ "int ⇒ <br>
int ⇒ int"}) $ x $ @{term "2::int"};</p>
<p>*}</p>
<p>definition "foo= (λx. SPLICE  ‹g2 (Bound 0)›)"</p>
<p>print_theorems (<em>foo_def: foo = (λx. x + 2)</em>)</p>
<p>definition "foo'= (λx. SPLICE  ‹g1 (Bound 0)›)"</p>
<p>print_theorems (<em>foo'_def: foo' = (λx. x)</em>)</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>what I want is to access the computation by g in the top level. <br>
Currently, I can only do it by explicitly constructing computations in g <br>
using constants (i.e. g2 and foo), while what I really wish is to access <br>
results computed by g without knowing how they are computed (i.e. g1 and <br>
foo'). Unfortunately, foo and foo' are not equivalent yet.</p>
<p>My whole idea is to compute something externally (in Isabelle/ML or even <br>
a program written in C), and then verify and port the result back to the <br>
top level. Of course, I can hard-code the whole computation in the top <br>
level (with definition/fun/function) without proving anything, but I <br>
feel it may not be necessary.</p>
<p>Again any suggestion is highly appreciated,<br>
Wenda</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The use of the word "top level" is very strange.  Maybe you just mean the <br>
material you can put into an Isabelle theory document, between the "theory <br>
... begin" and "end".  That language is called "Isabelle/Isar outer <br>
syntax", but it merely means you can put arbitrary commands there that are <br>
ultimately defined somewhere in Isabelle/ML. Command like 'definition' or <br>
'theorem' are also defined as such -- this can be proven in Isabelle/jEdit <br>
via C-hover-click on the keywords.</p>
<p>Since the 'ML' command is of the same kind, the easyiest answer to your <br>
question is to use that to evaluate ML expressions in Isabelle/Isar <br>
source.  That gives you values in the ML environment.</p>
<p>I guess that your actual question is: "How do I get values produced in <br>
Isabelle/ML into the Isabelle/HOL logic?"  Since ML can control the logic, <br>
but not the other way round, the standard approach is the use ML to set up <br>
a logical statement (and prove it) on demand.</p>
<p>Here it is usually possible to split the problem into two parts: the <br>
harder one to find a solution (outside the logic) and the easier one to <br>
establish a desired property of it (within the logic).</p>
<p>You can also produce the ML code in creative ways, e.g. from HOL <br>
specifications via the code generator.</p>

<p>From: Wenda Li &lt;<a href="mailto:wl302@cam.ac.uk">wl302@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Makarius and code generation experts,</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing out my inaccuracies, it is always good to know ways <br>
to polish my questions.</p>
<p>In terms of my question -- "How do I get values produced in Isabelle/ML <br>
into the Isabelle/HOL logic?", my current try is through some code <br>
generation setups. That is, to declare a function constant, and manually <br>
link some ML code to it. Since this function constant is not associated <br>
with any theorem, whatever code we are linking to it should not <br>
introduce inconsistencies to the logic.</p>
<p>Here is what I have got so far,</p>
<p>theory Scratch4 imports<br>
   Main<br>
begin</p>
<p>consts double ::"int ⇒ int"</p>
<p>code_printing code_module "Untrusted" ⇀ (SML)<br>
{*structure Bar : sig<br>
   val double' : int -&gt; int;<br>
end = struct<br>
   fun double' n = n+n;<br>
end<br>
*}</p>
<p>code_printing constant double ⇀ (SML) "Bar.double'"</p>
<p>export_code double in SML module_name Foo</p>
<p>(*does not work because the native int type is different from the <br>
generated int type *)<br>
value [code] "double 3"</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>This is not work yet, as code_printing may not work the way I am using <br>
it. I was wondering if it is possible to make my idea (i.e. declaring a <br>
constant and manually linking some ML code to it) work?</p>
<p>Again any help is greatly appreciated,<br>
Wenda</p>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch">andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Wenda,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no good theory so far to back up code_printing. So whatever you do <br>
with code_printing, you yourself have to convince yourself that what you are doing is sound.</p>
<p>I still have not found out what you want to achieve in the end. I will nevertheless try to <br>
provide a few hints:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suppose you (1) declare an unspecified constant foo with consts, (2) never define the <br>
constant foo, and (3) set up code_printing for foo to some function foo' in SML. If (a) <br>
foo' is referentially transparent (i.e., no side effects, no access to mutable state) and <br>
(b) the return type of foo is not a code_abstype and (c) the argument types of foo have <br>
not been refined during code generation, then you are pretty safe that Isabelle's logic is <br>
still consistent. The reasoning goes as follows: If you do not define the constant, all <br>
you know about the constant is its type. Thus, by refinement, you can replace it with any <br>
referentially-transparent function during code generation. Referential transparency <br>
ensures that two calls with the same arguments always return the same value. Thus, <br>
evaluation cannot falsify equations like "foo 17 = foo 17". Due to the transformations in <br>
the code generator, code_abstype return types are not safe by default. They are OK <br>
provided that the function foo' returns only those values that satisfy the invariant I of <br>
the abstract type. Otherwise, you could falsify the theorem "I (Rep_type (foo 17))". If <br>
the argument types have been refined, your function has to ensure that it respects the <br>
abstraction. For example, you could declare</p>
<p>to_list :: "'a set =&gt; 'a list"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>and implement it in SML as</p>
<p>"fun to_list (Set.set xs) = xs"</p>
<p>Then, you could prove  "to_list {1, 2} ~= to_list {2, 1}", which is obviously false as <br>
{1,2} = {2,1} in HOL.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>If any of these conditions are not satisfied, you yourself have to see whether <br>
everything stays sound. In particular, as soon as you specify the constant foo somehow, <br>
you have to be very careful. My AFP entry Native_Words is full of code_printing statements <br>
for such cases, and I spent a lot of thought on making sure that I do not introduce <br>
inconsistencies. As we do not have a formal model of code generation, only a certain level <br>
of confidence can be provided (by inspection and testing), but never a rigorous proof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From your previous mails, I had the impression that you wanted to compute results in <br>
untrusted code and then use them back in HOL after checking their correctness. This is <br>
possible with the above approach of declaring an unspecified constant, binding it to some <br>
SML code (subject to the above restrictions), and checking the result. The code equation <br>
could look as follows:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>lemma [code]:<br>
   "bar x =<br>
   (let r = foo x<br>
    in if check x r then r else Code.abort (STR ''Error in result of foo'') (%_. bar x))"</p>
<p>If the check function imposes sufficiently many checks, you can prove this lemma without <br>
knowing anything about foo.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
Andreas</p>

<p>The short answer here is that what you want to do is impossible with<br>
'SPLICE' or similar techniques. It is impossible to refer to dynamic ML<br>
computations in the Isabelle term language. Imagine if it were possible:<br>
For the example you've shown, that would also mean that the proof kernel<br>
would need to be able to execute arbitrary ML functions in order to<br>
perform reductions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My whole idea is to compute something externally (in Isabelle/ML or even<br>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean with "hard coding". There is no necessity to<br>
write the Isar specification by hand. As Makarius pointed out, the general<br>
technique is to not just write ML code which computes the values you are<br>
interested in, but also ML code which "lifts" those values into the "logic<br>
language". For example, you can write a piece of ML code which proves a<br>
lemma or which specifies a function. (One could say that "ML is the<br>
scripting language of Isabelle" -- although this is not entirely<br>
accurate.)</p>
<p>However, this will still not allow you to prove results about dynamic ML<br>
function executions. Defining your function in HOL and then using the code<br>
generator is in my opinion the preferable way.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>

<p>From: Wenda Li &lt;<a href="mailto:wl302@cam.ac.uk">wl302@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Andreas and Lars,</p>
<p>I am so grateful to have your feedback, from which I have learnt a lot. <br>
And also I do apologize for any of my previous inaccuracies that caused <br>
confusions.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>From your previous mails, I had the impression that you wanted to<br>

foo'') (%_. bar x))"</p>
<p>If the check function imposes sufficiently many checks, you can prove<br>
this lemma without knowing anything about foo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what I want to achieve in the end! Suppose the check <br>
function is strong enough, I can define foo in an arbitrary way and <br>
still prove this lemma (i.e. "without knowing anything about foo"). One <br>
way to implement foo is of course, as suggested by Lars, to define it <br>
within the Isabelle/HOL logic: we can have something like:</p>
<p>fun foo x = ...</p>
<p>in the Isabelle/Isar source, and the code generator will do the job. <br>
However, suppose the computation performed by foo is complicated and <br>
there exists highly efficient external tools (e.g. Z3) that implement <br>
foo, it might be more appealing to use (after checking) results returned <br>
by external tools rather than re-implementing an almost-certainly-slower <br>
foo in Isabelle/Isar (though we don't need to worry about the proofs).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is possible with the above approach<br>
of declaring an unspecified constant, binding it to some SML code<br>
(subject to the above restrictions), and checking the result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what I want to do in the first step. What I don't know is how to <br>
do the "binding" step, and code_printing in my previous email is just <br>
one attempt to achieve this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, you could declare</p>
<p>to_list :: "'a set =&gt; 'a list"</p>
<p>and implement it in SML as</p>
<p>"fun to_list (Set.set xs) = xs"</p>
<p>Then, you could prove  "to_list {1, 2} ~= to_list {2, 1}", which is<br>
obviously false as {1,2} = {2,1} in HOL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This example makes perfect sense to me now and it really didn't occur to <br>
me before. Thanks for such a wonderful example!</p>
<p>Overall, the whole idea is just an exploration. If it really does not <br>
work, I can go back to my original plan (i.e. the way Lars suggested).</p>
<p>Again any idea from the list is greatly appreciated,<br>
Wenda</p>

of declaring an unspecified constant, binding it to some SML code<br>
(subject to the above restrictions), and checking the result. The code<br>
equation could look as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p>lemma [code]:<br>
  "bar x =<br>
  (let r = foo x<br>
   in if check x r then r else Code.abort (STR ''Error in result of<br>
foo'') (%_. bar x))"</p>
<p>If the check function imposes sufficiently many checks, you can prove<br>
this lemma without knowing anything about foo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what I want to achieve in the end! Suppose the check function is strong<br>
enough, I can define foo in an arbitrary way and still prove this lemma (i.e. "without<br>
knowing anything about foo"). One way to implement foo is of course, as suggested by Lars,<br>
to define it within the Isabelle/HOL logic: we can have something like:</p>
<p>fun foo x = ...</p>
<p>in the Isabelle/Isar source, and the code generator will do the job. However, suppose the<br>
computation performed by foo is complicated and there exists highly efficient external<br>
tools (e.g. Z3) that implement foo, it might be more appealing to use (after checking)<br>
results returned by external tools rather than re-implementing an almost-certainly-slower<br>
foo in Isabelle/Isar (though we don't need to worry about the proofs).<br>
If you define foo in HOL and generate the code for foo, there is not much point in using a <br>
checker function. If you define foo in HOL and serialise it to some other hand-written ML <br>
function, getting this right is actually more difficult than if there was no definition of <br>
foo in HOL (because you additionally have to make sure that the HOL definition agrees with <br>
the SML implementation). Having an undefined constant is fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what I want to do in the first step. What I don't know is how to do the "binding"<br>
step, and code_printing in my previous email is just one attempt to achieve this.<br>
I suggest that you have a look at the AFP entry Native_Word. It contains a lot of <br>
non-trivial code printing examples, also in combination with integers. You might also want <br>
to have a look at my TLS paper from last year's Isabelle workshop [1]. Section 4 discusses <br>
the issues a bit. If you want to use types for exchanging data between generated code and <br>
hand-written or library code, you have to use the types for data exchange. In <br>
Isabelle/HOL, they are unit, bool, a * b, a + b, a option, integer and natural. I.e., you <br>
should convert your "int"s to "integer" first. Again, lots of examples are in the <br>
Native_Word entry.</p>

<p>Hope this helps,<br>

<p>For example, you could declare</p>
<p>to_list :: "'a set =&gt; 'a list"</p>
<p>and implement it in SML as</p>
<p>"fun to_list (Set.set xs) = xs"</p>
<p>Then, you could prove  "to_list {1, 2} ~= to_list {2, 1}", which is<br>
obviously false as {1,2} = {2,1} in HOL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This example makes perfect sense to me now and it really didn't occur to me before. Thanks<br>
for such a wonderful example!</p>
<p>Overall, the whole idea is just an exploration. If it really does not work, I can go back<br>
to my original plan (i.e. the way Lars suggested).</p>
<p>Again any idea from the list is greatly appreciated,<br>

Dear Andreas,</p>
<p>Many thanks for such a wonderful paper! The discussion about foreign <br>
function interface in the paper is super useful to me. I finally got my <br>
problem solved.</p>
<p>Wenda</p>
