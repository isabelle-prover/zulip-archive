<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au">thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
A week or two ago, Makarius asked us the canonical question:<br>
   "Are there any remaining uses of Proof General?"</p>
<p>I take it Makarius is inquiring whether there are any applications left<br>
that <em>require</em> ProofGeneral as opposed to one of the PIDE implementations.</p>
<p>It happens that earlier in the year, I used ProofGeneral to do some<br>
surgery on the "Fastpath" proof. This is the largest and worst of the<br>
proofs about the C code of seL4. At the time I felt that Isabelle/jEdit<br>
was unworkable for this task. I investigated this again today.</p>
<p>I'm now convinced I can do further surgery on this proof using only<br>
PIDE, although the process is currently slower and more painful than<br>
using ProofGeneral.</p>
<p>Those who are interested in pathological uses of Isabelle can find the<br>
proof I'm talking about on github <a href="https://github.com/seL4/l4v">https://github.com/seL4/l4v</a> and the<br>
relevant file here<br>
<a href="https://github.com/seL4/l4v/blob/master/proof/crefine/Fastpath_C.thy">https://github.com/seL4/l4v/blob/master/proof/crefine/Fastpath_C.thy</a><br>
although there may be difficulty in building the proof. We're thinking<br>
about simplifying the build process in the future.</p>
<p>It is very important to set the goal print limit to 1. Otherwise too<br>
much CPU is lost attempting to print goals, and Isabelle/jEdit gives at<br>
least the impression that it has broken down entirely. Once the goals<br>
limit is set to 1, Isabelle/jEdit succeeds in reporting on all points in<br>
the proof <em>eventually</em>.</p>
<p>I also set the goals limit to 1 in ProofGeneral. This was easier,<br>
firstly because there is a menu option, and secondly because watching<br>
the "blue region" makes it clear how much time is lost on printing.</p>
<p>In Isabelle/jEdit I had to declare [[goals_limit = 1]] explicitly in the<br>
text. Unfortunately this requires backing up to a sensible place. After<br>
some thought I've added "using [[goals_limit = 1]]" permanently to the<br>
two worst proof scripts.</p>
<p>Is there any particular reason why the goals limit isn't a setting that<br>
can be adjusted from a panel or the options in Isabelle/jEdit?</p>
<p>I also tried the "parallel_print" setting which Makarius added when I<br>
last brought this up. This does more or less the opposite of what I<br>
want. However, like ProofGeneral's blue region, it makes it easy to see<br>
the problem. After moving the cursor down rapidly, the window "greys<br>
out" for a while, and then returns to white one line at a time as the<br>
goal states print in order. This process might take a minute or so.</p>
<p>This explains why Isabelle/jEdit seems so slow in these cases: the goal<br>
states render in order, while the user waits for output where their<br>
cursor actually is. In the parallel case the window goes white<br>
immediately once the print tasks have forked, from which point there is<br>
no indication of progress, giving the impression the system has just<br>
given up.</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like to see some approximation ProofGeneral's behaviour, in<br>
which many commands can be processed and only one goal state rendered.<br>
Yes, my proofs are pathological, full of applications of fast<br>
methods/tactics but with large complex goal states. I suspect, however,<br>
that I'm not alone.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

<p>I find this a bit curious, as it is my understanding that PIDE's <br>
"perspective" mechanism should actually deliver the output to the user's <br>
cursor. From Makarius' UITP-2014 paper:</p>
<p>"Activation or deactivation of PRINT tasks is subject to the document <br>
perspective. The whole theory library that is edited might be big, but <br>
only small parts are visible in the editor. PIDE document processing <br>
takes the open text windows as indication where to invest resources for <br>
continuous processing."</p>
<p>The perspective not only tells the underlying process which windows is <br>
open, but also what command spans ('lines') are in view, and in our Coq <br>
incarnation of PIDE, we use this fact: each individual proof is handled <br>
by a separate worker process, and the proofs that are in the perspective <br>
get priority of processing and printing: in our limited practice, we <br>
have seen this gives a better feeling of responsiveness of the prover, <br>
as the output is reported where the user's cursor is, even in <br>
bigger/slower files.</p>

<p>As a general principle, the Isabelle NEWS file is of prime importance to<br>
document the "history of user-relevant changes". It is easily accessible<br>
in many spots, including the main Isabelle web page. Isabelle/jEdit also<br>
provides a minimal "IDE" to navigate the NEWS file with some tree<br>
structure via SideKick, and hypersearch helps to find relevant keywords.</p>
<p>Users who want to be up-to-date wrt. the current state-of-the-art of<br>
Isabelle should study the NEWS file whenever a new release comes out, to<br>
see how things are done better in the new version, in contrast to old<br>
ones. At least when there is some unexpected behaviour, the NEWS file<br>
should be consulted for explanation. Doing that here yields:</p>
<p>* Proof General with its traditional helper scripts is now an optional<br>
   Isabelle component, e.g. see ProofGeneral-4.2-2 from the Isabelle<br>
   component repository <a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/components/">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/components/</a>.  Note that<br>
   the "system" manual provides general explanations about add-on<br>
   components, especially those that are not bundled with the release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am old time Emacs User (20+ years) and for that reason I was <br>

</blockquote>
<p>See the "jedit" manual for the proper terminology of Isabelle/jEdit as<br>
standard application of the PIDE (Prover IDE) framework. It does not<br>
make any sense to make a parallel of "Proof General" vs. "jEdit": jEdit<br>
is the underlying editor, so it would correspond to Emacs here. The name<br>
of the integrated application is "Isabelle/jEdit", and that is just an<br>
example of other Isabelle/PIDE applications, such as Isabelle/Eclipse or<br>
Clide.</p>
<p>Apart from proper names an concepts, we are back to the canonical<br>
question: Are there any remaining uses of Proof General?</p>
<p>Just being stuck out of habit over decades is no good reason. The word<br>
"reason" is related "ratio" or "rational", but sticking blindly to<br>
habits is rather irrational. This natural inertia has sucked up a lot of<br>
resources over the years. It is better to spend resources now to figure<br>
out how close we are to the final disposal of Isabelle Proof General --<br>
after more than 5 years of Isabelle/PIDE development.</p>
<p>That is a serious topic, but some hard facts need to be put on the<br>
table, not just "I don't want to change habits".</p>

<p>I'm using PG with the release version. Now I don't remember all the<br>

<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/components/">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/components/</a> and unpacked it inside<br>
Isabele2014/contrib (I think it can go anywhere as long as you set the<br>
PROOFGENERAL_HOME environment var). Then I copied the 'emacs' script<br>
from the previous release's 'lib/Tools' folder into the 2014's<br>
'lib/Tools' folder. I think I've set the PROOFGENERAL_HOME environment<br>
variable in my '.bashrc'. Now 'isabelle emacs' works as before.</p>
<p>The jEdit Prover IDE is great but it's greedy compared to the<br>

There is no need to do all this manually. As Makarius mentioned, this is<br>
prepared as an component and components are documented in the system manual:</p>
<p>Add the line</p>
<p>init_component "$SOME_DIR/ProofGeneral-4.2-2"</p>
<p>to your $ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/settings file, where $SOME_DIR refers to<br>
the directory where you want to store the extension. ($USER_HOME/contrib<br>
might be a good value for that, as that is the directory the repository<br>
version stores its components by default).</p>
<p>Then execute</p>
<p>isabelle components -a</p>
<p>to automatically install the missing component. Afterwards,</p>
<p>isabelle emacs</p>
<p>should give you a Proof General, provided you have an appropriate emacs<br>
installation around.</p>

<p>From: Vadim Zaliva &lt;<a href="mailto:vzaliva@cmu.edu">vzaliva@cmu.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Let me put forward some arguments in defence of Proof General support in Isabelle.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this discussion the functionality of PIDE such as Proof General as <br>
well as Isabelle/Jedit could be broadly split into 3 categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Basic functionality - basic editing functionality used in Isabelle mode as well as for other <br>
modes. Here you have managing multiple buffers, windows, search, clipboard, completion, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isabelle specific interface. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other functionality of the PIDE which is not strictly speaking is necessary for working with Isabelle.<br>
 For example integration with other languages (ML, LISP, Haskell), spell checker integration, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have limited experience with #2 but for my purposes both Proof General and Isabelle/JEdit were comparable.<br>
(Some people might find Jedit/Isabelle asynchronous proving superior to Proof General's sequential mode but I<br>
like the control Proof General gives me. One of the reasons is that some of my lemmas take a long time to prove and I do not want to to try prove them until I am ready to do so. For example when I am reorganizing my proofs and moving code around<br>
I would not want it to rush and try prove things until I am finished.)</p>
<p>Most importantly in #1 I found jEdit (mind you, not Isabelle/jEdit but jEdit itself) lacking, compared to Emacs.<br>
A couple of trivial examples: I-search and working with rectangular blocks in copy/paste.</p>
<p>Finally, although it is not directly related to Isabelle, I think in #3 emacs have much more to offer due to <br>
the amount of code written for Emacs over the decades.</p>
<p>For example I am working with Haskell, LISP code and Isabelle proofs at the same time and now I am forced to run jEdit and Emacs concurrently. Emacs key binding in jEdit are not exactly the same as real Emacs on Mac so I am constantly struggling<br>
when switching between the two. With Proof General I was easily editing all Isabelle, LISP and Haskell from the comfort<br>
of the same familiar environment.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Vadim Zaliva</p>

there was the turning point for practical use of Isabelle/jEdit as the <br>
main application of the PIDE framework.</p>
<p>Hardcore users of Proof General Emacs have chosen to ignore this over a <br>
long time. In Isabelle2014 the tiny change to make Proof General <br>
"optional" -- with proper documentation in NEWS and hardly any effort to <br>
reactivate it based on information from the "system" manual -- seems to <br>
have the effect that people actually do wake up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the purpose of this discussion the functionality of PIDE such as <br>
Proof General as well as Isabelle/Jedit could be broadly split into 3 <br>
categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Basic functionality - basic editing functionality used in Isabelle<br>
   mode as well as for other modes. Here you have managing multiple<br>
   buffers, windows, search, clipboard, completion, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isabelle specific interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other functionality of the PIDE which is not strictly speaking is<br>
   necessary for working with Isabelle.  For example integration with<br>
   other languages (ML, LISP, Haskell), spell checker integration, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have limited experience with #2 but for my purposes both Proof General <br>
and Isabelle/JEdit were comparable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means you did not spend long enough with Isabelle/jEdit, to find out <br>
what it really does (and what not yet).  The "jedit" manual in <br>
Isabelle2014 is once again updated and extended, and now rather long with <br>
almost 50 pages.  There is a lot to discover, but long-term Proof General <br>
users need to unlearn quite a lot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people might find Jedit/Isabelle asynchronous proving superior to <br>
Proof General's sequential mode but I like the control Proof General <br>
gives me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The document-oriented approach with implicit checking is inherent in PIDE.</p>
<p>If you don't believe in it, you are welcome to start a project to <br>
implement a PG-emulation using the official Isabelle protocol function <br>
interface (not the old TTY loop, which is already legacy).  This is <br>
possible in user-space, using the current Isabelle/Scala infrastructure to <br>
connect Isabelle to the outside world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most importantly in #1 I found jEdit (mind you, not Isabelle/jEdit but <br>
jEdit itself) lacking, compared to Emacs. A couple of trivial examples: <br>
I-search and working with rectangular blocks in copy/paste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both search and blocks work much better in jEdit than in Emacs.  After 15 <br>
years of Emacs, I left it behind in 2006, and today I can't live without <br>
jEdit quick-search / hyper-search and various advanced selection modes. <br>
The two weeks I had invested in 2006 to unlearn Emacs key bindings and <br>
learn a few jEdit tricks have paid off.</p>
<p>The general qualities of jEdit also convinced me in 2006/2007 to make it <br>
the basis for the main example application of PIDE.</p>
<p>This does not mean all PIDE applications need to work with jEdit. <br>
Isabelle/Eclipse and Clide have already been mentioned, and will hopefully <br>
be updated soon to Isabelle2014.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, although it is not directly related to Isabelle, I think in #3 <br>
emacs have much more to offer due to the amount of code written for <br>
Emacs over the decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be accounted both on the positive and negative side.  Tons of <br>
existing material in Emacs makes it slow to move anywhere.  Most of the <br>
material is actually obsolete.</p>
<p>In contrast, jEdit has many useful plugins, while many things are missing, <br>
but it is easy to improve on that.  I have done quite something for <br>
Isabelle/jEdit -- the "Isabelle" plugin has become a large assembly of <br>
modules to augment jEdit in many ways, both specifically and <br>
non-specifically to Isabelle.</p>
<p>jEdit is somewhere in the middle in project size and complexity, e.g. <br>
compared to Emacs or Eclipse, and it is relatively easy to move it <br>
onwards, with a little bit of enthusiam and energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example I am working with Haskell, LISP code and Isabelle proofs at <br>
the same time and now I am forced to run jEdit and Emacs concurrently. <br>
Emacs key binding in jEdit are not exactly the same as real Emacs on Mac <br>
so I am constantly struggling when switching between the two. With Proof <br>
General I was easily editing all Isabelle, LISP and Haskell from the <br>
comfort of the same familiar environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With "familiar environment" we are back to "I don't want to change <br>
habits".</p>
<p>I don't see why an Isabelle front-end should specifically support Emacs, <br>
apart from accidental side-conditions from the past.  Why not vi instead? <br>
The old debate of Emacs vs. vi has long been settled in favour of vi <br>
anyway.</p>

Incremental search in jEdit is by default to "Alt+,"; rectangular<br>
selection can be toggled by "Alt+#".</p>
