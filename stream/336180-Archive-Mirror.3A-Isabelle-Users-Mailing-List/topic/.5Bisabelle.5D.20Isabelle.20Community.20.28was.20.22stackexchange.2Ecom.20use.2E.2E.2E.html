<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:c.sternagel@gmail.com">c.sternagel@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>in my opinion we have two distinct issues which got accidentally merged in</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg03860.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg03860.html</a></p>
<p>While I agree with Makarius on</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am more concerned about this wiki here:<br>
<a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community</a> since it is provided by one of the<br>
established Isabelle sites.</p>
<p>I would still like to see a genuine Isabelle community contributing here,<br>
and doing serious maintenance.  Right now it is just a scribbling <br>
board for<br>
people who were discontent with some of the official READMEs or <br>
manuals, and<br>
even that is often pointless already due to continuous updates of the<br>
official versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't see why isabelle user communication should change from the (in <br>
my opinion) very well working mailing lists to anywhere else. I did <br>
never use stackoverflow or stackexchange myself (i.e., have no account) <br>
but of course occasionally arrive there via web searches. Today I read <br>
their "about" section and it seems to be mostly their goal that <br>
questions get professional answers fast. I would say that is exactly <br>
what is currently happening on the mailing lists.</p>
<p>Of course this is specific to Isabelle. And some of the suggestions in <br>
earlier e-mails did more sound like building a more general community <br>
(e.g., all users of any kind of proof assistant). In principle that <br>
sounds good. A good thing about the current setting is that it is <br>
focused (I do not have enough reading capacity to go through answers <br>
concerning other proof assistants while being concerned with some <br>
isabelle specific question). Of course if questions occurred (on one of <br>
the isabelle lists or any list of another proof assistant) that were not <br>
tool specific, they could be forwarded to this overflow/exchange thingy <br>
(after that was established).</p>
<p>To summarize my opinion. There are the following different issues:</p>
<p>1) Isabelle user communication, including Q&amp;A. (I think: well covered by <br>
the current lists.)</p>
<p>2) Isabelle community content (potentially, tips and tricks, tutorials, <br>
resources, ...) which is currently maintained in a wiki and could be <br>
improved.</p>
<p>3) Building a more general community (not Isabelle specific).</p>
<p>cheers</p>

Technically speaking, I favour Usenet over mailing list, because I already  <br>
follow some other Usenet groups, and using the Isabelle mailing list  <br>
through the Gmane interface, often present issues. A mailing list is not  <br>
what's the more handy, and I personnaly would better enjoy a forum or a  <br>
Usenet group (a real one, not Gname interfacing a mailing list to make it  <br>
look like a Usenet group).</p>
<p>This is just a technical matter by the way, nothing wrong with people  <br>
here, who I enjoy a lot ;)</p>

<p>From: John Wickerson &lt;<a href="mailto:jpw48@cam.ac.uk">jpw48@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>Can I just add my two cents on the {mailing-list/stack-exchange/wiki}-issue?</p>
<p>I have often thought that it would be quite nice to move Isabelle support <br>
from the mailing-list to something like Stack Exchange (SE), so I am <br>
pleased to hear it being discussed as a possibility.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SE pages (e.g. [1]) are a pleasure to read (and I reckon that's a big <br>
factor behind the success of SE). In contrast, the Isabelle Wiki [2], to my <br>
mind, looks out-of-date and unappealing. Also, compared to the <br>
mailing-list, code snippets in SE can be formatted as code snippets, and <br>
math symbols can be formatted properly too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think SE might be less intimidating to beginners. Maybe it's just me, <br>
but I think the idea of sending a newbie question to any mailing-list, <br>
knowing that it will appear in hundreds of people's inboxes, is <br>
significantly scarier than just posting it on a website (yes, even if those <br>
same people subscribe to the website's feed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to edit questions and answers would be quite useful. Among <br>
other benefits, questions can be later tagged with keywords, making them <br>
more likely to show up in Google searches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reputation system might be quite fun.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As Gottfried has pointed out, the SE idea would only work if <em>all</em> the <br>
support migrates over from the mailing-list. This would be quite a radical <br>
change, and as Chris says, the mailing-list does generally work very well.</p>
<p>A lightweight way to implement this change would be just to start asking <br>
and answering Isabelle questions on Stack Overflow, e.g. here: <br>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/isabelle">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/isabelle</a></p>
<p>Alternatively, one could propose a dedicated Isabelle SE site, e.g.:<br>
<a href="http://isabelle.stackexchange.com/">http://isabelle.stackexchange.com/</a></p>
<p>cheers,<br>
John</p>

<p>Isabelle-users is quite academic where a general knowledge of logic,<br>
lambda calculus, rewriting and type systems is expected. A stack<br>
exchange site would be the place where real newbies could pose their<br>
questions. Having the SE site need not empty the mailing list, only<br>
shape it to have mostly power-user discussion. I guess.</p>

<p>How about a computational logic site, for proof theory, model<br>
checking, theorem proving theory and actual systems question? Isabelle<br>
is too narrow a topic for an SE site. There is a CS and a Theoretical<br>
Computer Science section already:</p>
<p><a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/">http://cs.stackexchange.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/">http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/</a></p>

<p>I did not fully understand that reasoning.  Gottfried's plan was for a <br>
separate SE site, and that requires substantial community behind it. <br>
Although I like the idea of all prover people joining in one site, they <br>
will probably still be too small and insignificant, even if the <br>
fragmentation is overcome.</p>

<p>Indeed, that is already there.  Some guys started asking questions and <br>
some other answered them.  I don't see any conflict with isabelle-users <br>
here.</p>
