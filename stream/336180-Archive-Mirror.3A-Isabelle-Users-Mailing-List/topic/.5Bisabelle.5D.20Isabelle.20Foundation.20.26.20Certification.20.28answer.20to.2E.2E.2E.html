<p>From: Andrei Popescu &lt;<a href="mailto:a.popescu@mdx.ac.uk">a.popescu@mdx.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Makarius, </p>
<p>First, I thank you very much for looking into this. I have a conference tutorial to prepare for this Sunday, and this is why I will be rather brief in my reply. Next week I'll address <br>
the points you are raising in much greater detail. </p>
<p>Second, if you can, please ignore that reference to the technical report -- it is indeed a lingering reference, which we unfortunately forgot to remove. At the preparation of the camera-ready, we managed to <br>
include sufficient technical details in the paper, especially since we received an extra page. So now the paper essentially includes that report. I am here to offer any missing technical details, should you <br>
request any -- but if you read the paper in good faith, it is likely you will not even need additional explanations.  </p>
<p>Third, I kindly ask you that, during our discussion about this, you respect my different opinion here, which can be summarized as follows: </p>
<p>BEGIN opinion </p>
<p>Even though Isabelle/HOL is implemented on top of a logical framework, we can conceptually speak about its structure as: </p>
<p>(A) a logic L, consisting of axioms and rules of deduction</p>
<p>(B) the logic L augmented with a definitional mechanism (namely, type and constant definitions) -- let me call it L_D</p>
<p>The current situation with Isabelle/HOL is the following: Even though L is consistent (in that it cannot prove False), L_D is inconsistent (in that it can prove False).</p>
<p>END opinion </p>
<p>Even though, as the developer of the Isabelle <em>software</em> , you believe the situation is much more complex, I kindly ask you to make an effort and understand this point of view. <br>
The purpose of any logical framework (including Isabelle/Pure and Edinburgh LF) is to facilitate the implementation of a logic, not to intrude with the logic. I am sure that the implementation of <br>
Isabelle/HOL inside Isabelle/Pure does a good job at achieving this. I am saying this as a fairly experienced user of Isabelle/HOL.  </p>
<p>The development from our paper works with the logics L and L_D assumed above. Again, if you read the paper in good faith, you will be able to understand what is being proved there and perhaps <br>
convince yourself that the proposed change to the system will at least achieve the following goal: prevent certain ways of proving False which is particularly disturbing to many many users. </p>
<p>Finally, I have a possibly strange request: Please do not trust your judgement <em>alone</em>, because you (like anybody else) may be wrong, and may not realize it because of the way you look at things. <br>
There must be someone (at least one person) on this mailing list whose judgement you trust. Please ask that person for a second opinion about: (1) the actual problem discussed here and (2) the solution we propose in the paper. <br>
If possible, please also make the name of that person public.  </p>
<p>All the best and talk to you again soon, <br>
   Andrei </p>

<p>From: Andrei Popescu &lt;<a href="mailto:A.Popescu@mdx.ac.uk">A.Popescu@mdx.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Sorry, a couple of further brief notes: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This proper distinction also explains, why typedefs were not treated in the past, because it is hard to understand them in generic Isabelle/Pure, without an unfriendly takeover of the framework by HOL troups.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It is of course impossible. We have to let the HOL troops in at this point, there is no way around this.  </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A few more notes on the paper: I actually liked the "Inconsistency Club" versus "Consistency Club", although it is hard to define that boundary. Just a single Boolean value to measure the reliability and robustness of a <br>
proof assistant in black or white is a bit lacking. Apart from shades of grey, such a measure desparately needs more than one dimension.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>"Consistency Club" here does not refer to bullet-proof systems, but to formal efforts of partly ensuring consistency (whatever that means :-)  ). In particular, this club does not contain theorem provers, but formal developments.  </p>
<p>All the best, <br>
  Andrei</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
OK, so I take the pulished paper as is, taken from <br>
<a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~kuncar/documents/kuncar-popescu-itp2015.pdf">http://www4.in.tum.de/~kuncar/documents/kuncar-popescu-itp2015.pdf</a></p>
<p>In the third round of looking at it, I have now started to read the <br>
technical part and have already learned many interesting things.  I will <br>
comment (and criticize) more later, when the big picture has evolved a bit <br>
further.</p>
<p>I need to appeal again to the professional routine of the Isabelle <br>
development and release process.  Users will have true reasons to get <br>
worried, when non-trivial changes to core system components and their very <br>
foundations can be pushed-in just by making a lot of noise in public.</p>
<p>I've not been at the ITP talk, but I can imagine how it went, just by <br>
extrapolating the style and manner of some paragraphs in the paper.</p>
<p>You may remember yourself that the initial idea of BNF (co)datatypes was <br>
expected to be implemented in one year, or so.  Ultimately it required <br>
many years, and several wizards to finish the job.  Behind the scenes we <br>
even had to get David Matthews involved, to extend the playground of the <br>
ML platform.  I also had to make "dangerous experiments" again -- as you <br>
call it in the paper -- in order to have it all go through smoothly.</p>
<p>Adapting the ideas presented in the presented paper in the proper way for <br>
Isabelle will not take as long as BNF datatypes, but it is not immediate.</p>
<p>It could have been finished already, if we did not have serious <br>
meta-problems that are still ignored by most participants of the debate. <br>
This is why I spend so much time here, instead of looking through ML <br>
sources.</p>

<p>Quite true. However, we took the decision a long time ago to detect and reject cyclic constant definitions. In this example, a cycle evades detection because it involves a typedef. Closing this loophole would not represent any change in policy.</p>

<p>From: Andrei Popescu &lt;<a href="mailto:A.Popescu@mdx.ac.uk">A.Popescu@mdx.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Makarius, </p>
<p>I propose splitting this thread in two (as other people also implicitly suggested):</p>
<p>(1) Should cyclicity checks through typedefs be introduced, to prevent situations such as Example 2?</p>
<p>I have to say that this paragraph from your postings has made my day:</p>
<p>You wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The proposed changes of the present paper are genuine feature additions<br>
that go beyond the known and documented model of Isabelle/HOL.  This is<br>
why I reduced the priority to a reasonable level. And in fact, we are<br>
talking here about a few months latency of TODO-list pipeline -- things<br>
routinely take much longer than that.  Isabelle is not a research<br>
prototype that can be changed arbitrarily at a high rate. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If I read it correctly, your answer to the question is "Yes, but let's do it properly." <br>
I don't think anybody can argue with the fact that you are the person to do it properly. <br>
But emphasizing the "Yes" part, and perhaps placing it at the beginning of your first answer <br>
on this thread would have helped immensely.   </p>
<p>(2) Should typedef really be axiomatic, or should it be made definitional in Isabelle/HOL?</p>
<p>Here, you also seem to not be completely satisfied with the current status: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, one could argue if it is a good idea to treat typedef like<br>
that. This would lead to the very start of a serious discussion -- one<br>
without rumors and unnecessary confusion caused by worrying about<br>
publicity or "bad press"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, I have many things to add. In fact, I would like to argue strongly for having typedef definitional in Isabelle/HOL, and would like <br>
to invoke the results from our paper as a justification for the possibility of enforcing <em>and claiming</em> definitionality. <br>
I know there will be a long discussion here, because our notions of definitionality differ and because our notions <br>
of logical framework differ. I am sure that at the end of this discussion I will convince you that I have a point, and probably  <br>
you will show me that my point needs to be refined in order to be applicable to the real Isabelle/HOL.  <br>
But I am looking forward to have this discussion in a relaxed manner,^[*] outside of the issue (1).</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You may remember yourself that the initial idea of BNF (co)datatypes was<br>
expected to be implemented in one year, or so.  Ultimately it required<br>
many years, and several wizards to finish the job.  Behind the scenes we<br>

ML platform.  I also had to make "dangerous experiments" again -- as you<br>
call it in the paper -- in order to have it all go through smoothly.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting -- I did not know about the required extension of the infrastructure. And of course <br>
I appreciate the support you offered with the BNF package; I also hope you find it to be a useful addition to the system. </p>
<p>All the best, <br>
   Andrei  </p>
<p>[*] We had such a (very fruitful and pleasant) discussion the first time I showed you the plan for the BNF package.<br>
Btw, that package is designed with the assumption that typedef is/can-be definitional. If we truly thought of typedef as (hopelessly) <br>
axiomatic, I and my coauthors would not have gone to the trouble to reduce a sophisticated (co)datatype universe all the way down to typedef. <br>
And this is also true about the previous datatype package by Stefan.  </p>
