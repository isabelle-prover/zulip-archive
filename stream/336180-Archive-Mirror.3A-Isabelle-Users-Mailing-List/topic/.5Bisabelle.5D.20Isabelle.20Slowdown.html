Hello,</p>
<p>thanks for all the answers to my last question. Now I have made up an<br>
ML-tactic to address my problem, that looks tail-recursive, but I<br>
managed to run into the problem that after about 25k subgoals of a proof<br>
with more than 50k subgoals Isabelle gets very slow and needs about<br>
1.2Gb of RAM. It gets that slow that it needs about 10mins to solve a<br>
subgoal that can be solved in 10secs if you copy it out of the context<br>
and solve it alone. Is there a way to minimize Isabelle's bookkeeping<br>
during a proof even further? I mean all subgoals of a proof are somehow<br>
independent from each other as are the theorems. I will probably not use<br>
a theorem to prove another one, so all I am interested in is the fact<br>
that Isabelle can prove all subgoals of a goals and not more. I am not<br>
really interested in a proof tree, since it will be far too big to<br>
inspect, I rather log the subgoals to a file, so that one can inspect<br>
them and verify their proofs. </p>
<p>Maybe the tactic has some kind of "memory leak", I can post it here if<br>
you want to analyze it, but it is a little lengthy. </p>
<p>Regards, <br>
 Dominik</p>
