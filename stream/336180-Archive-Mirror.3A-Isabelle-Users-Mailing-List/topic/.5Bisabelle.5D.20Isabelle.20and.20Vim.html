Hi Wolfgang,</p>
<p>I really recommend you try VSCode with the Vim plugin. <br>
I only use basic features of Vim, so I can't speak about more advanced functionality.</p>
<p>In general, Isabelle in VSCode is quite good. Sometimes I miss something (or did not search long enough) like e.g. the search functionality, an overview over the status of all the theory.<br>
For those things, I switch to jedit.</p>
<p>My only pain point is currently that the pretty symbols plugin is sometimes very slow. </p>
<p>But all in all very usable and you can edit Vim-style.</p>
<p>Best<br>
Nils</p>

<p>That is all very alien to the Isabelle/PIDE approach (and of other<br>
high-end ideas). Ultimately there is a static type error here, talking<br>
about quite different things.</p>

Efficient editing and good semantic IDE support are different things,<br>
but they are not contradictory but in fact complement each other.<br>
Unfortunately we seem to have only tools these days that are good in at<br>
most one of those things.</p>

Hi Mathias,</p>
<p>I am not completely sure, whether I have the same issue (I did not relate it to hovering).<br>
However, the slowness of prettify-symbols seems to be related to a lot of theory files, even if they are not opened for viewing or editing.<br>
So I think, your proposed solution might fix my problem.</p>
<p>And thank you for the overview plugin! I will try it sometime in the future when I upgrade my theories from Isabelle 2017.</p>
<p>Best<br>
Nils</p>

the Net, before you've sent me a private mail recently.</p>

there are still pending problems with more fundamental infrastructure<br>

<p>This project has not seen activity in approx. 1 year.</p>
<p>Generally, my impression is that the approach should be as in<br>
Isabelle/jEdit: actual replacement of symbols when source is loaded, and<br>
the reverse operation for saving. It will require more tinkering with<br>
VSCode, though, and this is definitely not going to happen for the<br>
Isabelle2019 release.</p>
