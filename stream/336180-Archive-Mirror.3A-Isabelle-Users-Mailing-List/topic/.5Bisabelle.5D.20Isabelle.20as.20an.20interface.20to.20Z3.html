Dear Isabelle users,</p>
<p>I am producing Z3 code to check whether a data structure given in input satisfies certain set-theoretical properties.</p>
<p>I find such properties are much more easily written down in Isabelle than directly in Z3, so I am using sledgehammer with overlord=true, and then I take the generated prob_z3.smt_in and tweak it.</p>
<p>To me, it looks like Isabelle could also be, in addition to its functionalities, a useful way of interfacing to SMT solvers in cases not necessarily related to proof finding, as I am doing in my particular case.</p>
<p>However, I have little control on the z3 file I obtain: the syntax is not so readable, and the list of facts there can be populated with irrelevant asserts.<br>
I played with sledgehammer's options max_facts=smart and fact_thresholds, but I am not sure that they give me enough control.</p>
<p>My questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>is there a better approach to use Isabelle this way (as a general-purpose interface to z3)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>does it make sense at all to use it this way, or are there more convenient interfaces to avoid writing every involved notion at the z3 or SMT-lib level?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Best,</p>

<p>Interesting. Could you explain a little bit more what kind of tweaking you are doing at the SMT-LIB level, and what you are trying to achieve? I get the impression that you are using SMT for their model finding capabilities, as opposed to proving. Is this correct? If so: How do you deal with quantifiers (which normally lead SMT solvers to answer "unknown" rather than "sat")?</p>
<p>If possible, could you send a small example of an Isabelle theory file, the generated SMT-LIB file, and your tweaked SMT-LIB file, so that I get a picture of what you are doing?</p>

<p>From the perspective of a user of Isar, not really. But if you're ready to program some ML, it should be possible to reuse large parts of the current SMT module to achieve what you want.</p>
<p>But again, I'd be curious to know how you define the difference between "general purpose" and "proof finding" -- is it just "model finding" or is it more?</p>

<p>If what you have in mind is model finding, work has recently started at Inria Nancy on an SMT-based successor to Nitpick, called Nunchaku. It will be based primarily on the CVC4 model finder (which is, in my experience, even more powerful than Z3). There's nothing to show yet, but you can always keep an eye on</p>

<p>The idea is to use Z3 to check whether some finite set-theoretical relation (i.e., a set of pairs) can be completed to a bigger relation satisfying some simple requirement (e.g., being a partial order).<br>
Since Isabelle/HOL already features a bit of (naive) set theory which I could take advantage of in doing that, I thought to give Isabelle a shot as an intermediate layer.</p>

<p>Thanks for the generous help offer!<br>
However, I wouldn't want to waste your time since, as it appears from the link above, this effort could be sterile.<br>
Anyway, the kind of Isabelle lemma I used to generate the most elementary z3 input file is something like (with the due dependencies imported):</p>
<p>lemma "EX P. (1::nat,2::nat) \&lt;in&gt; P &amp; (2::nat,3::nat) \&lt;in&gt; P &amp; trans P &amp; antisym P &amp; irrefl P" <br>
sledgehammer [provers=z3, spy=true, overlord=true, debug=true]</p>
<p>The corresponding z3 input file already hangs z3.</p>

<p>Right. However, if your quantifiers happen to range over uninterpreted sorts (types), finite model techniques can be used. See e.g. Andrew Reynolds's Ph.D. thesis or the SMT Workshop 2015 paper he wrote with Cesare Tinelli and me and which I mentioned in the previous email.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma "EX P. (1::nat,2::nat) \&lt;in&gt; P &amp; (2::nat,3::nat) \&lt;in&gt; P &amp; trans P &amp; antisym P &amp; irrefl P" <br>
sledgehammer [provers=z3, spy=true, overlord=true, debug=true]</p>
<p>The corresponding z3 input file already hangs z3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. You might have a little bit more success with Nitpick (and, hopefully one day, Nunchaku):</p>
<p>lemma "EX P. (1::nat,2::nat) \&lt;in&gt; P &amp; (2::nat,3::nat) \&lt;in&gt; P &amp; trans P &amp; antisym P &amp; irrefl P" <br>
    nitpick [satisfy, dont_box]</p>
<p>Nitpick found a potentially spurious model:</p>
<p>Skolem constant:<br>
        P = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)} </p>
<p>("dont_box" is unfortunately necessary here to disable a heuristic.)</p>

<p>I do a bit of necrothreading to report on some developments on my side.</p>
<p>We found useful application of sledgehammer's SMT generator beyond its intended usage, I think.</p>
<p>In our approach, generated SMT is either directly used to compute, or anyway fed to the solver to show its equivalence with the more efficient SMT code we wrote some other way.</p>
<p>This way, we retain the possibility of proving in Isabelle the stuff we want about the final SMT code, and have therefore a sort of correctness about SMT code (arguably a good thing, given the low level of readability of SMT code one easily gets); moreover, by staying in Isabelle as long as we can, we can integrate our code with other tools (Nitpick, etc...).</p>
<p>This has some similarity with the current functional code generation feature of Isabelle. </p>
<p>Reports are scattered among conference papers, in particular:</p>
<p><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7890603/?reload=true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7890603/?reload=true</a> (sections IV and V)<br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05383">https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05383</a> (section 5, particularly Figure 7)</p>
<p>Hope this can be of interest to somebody.</p>
