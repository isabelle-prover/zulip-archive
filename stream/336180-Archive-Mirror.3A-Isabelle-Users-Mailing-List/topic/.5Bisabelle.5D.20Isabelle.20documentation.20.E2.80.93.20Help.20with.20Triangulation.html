<p>Some people actually do want that. One thing that draws people to<br>
<a href="http://metamath.org">metamath.org</a>,<br>
for example, is that every single step is shown... The only rules are<br>
syntax definition and substitution, and the people that<br>
like metamath consider that an extremely important feature. On the other<br>
hand, they have the good taste to break each<br>
proof down into small chunks, so you rarely (?) see a proof that's more<br>
than a screenful of text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be desirable to have a mode in Isabelle in which for an automated proof<br>
each single step is made explicit and displayed afterwards (or saved to disk in a file)<br>
with full type information.<br>
It shouldn't be too difficult to implement both modes, one without tracking<br>
(for performance), and one with tracking (allowing one to follow each single<br>
step).</p>

<p>You seem to be feeling a lot of frustration with Isabelle. I can't say I'm<br>
not feeling similar frustrations, but<br>
in my experience, that frustration is just a thing that happens when you<br>
try to really understand any<br>
big complicated system. The way through it is to be patient, ask questions,<br>
experiment, study what<br>
other people have done (or what other people have <em>asked</em>, either here or<br>
on stack overflow), and<br>
just trust that eventually things that were confusing at first will<br>
eventually start to make sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't the case for HOL (HOL4). With the HOL handbook [Gordon and Melham, 1993]<br>
(and an online tutorial) I was able to fully understand and work with the system<br>
within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, with a clear and concise presentation of the concepts and the logic(s)<br>
within a good documentation (and not many scattered papers) the principles of any large<br>
system can be explained properly.</p>
<p>Maybe the Isabelle team should consider asking Andy Pitts to write a logic part<br>
for Isabelle and Isabelle/HOL (as soon as no major changes are expected anymore)<br>
with the same brilliance like that of the logic part of the HOL handbook.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also... My impression (and I could be wrong about this) is that most of the<br>
users of Isabelle are not just<br>
going it alone, but are academics working closely with and being taught by<br>
other people who are<br>
intimately familiar with the system already. Nobody's written a "Learn You<br>
an Isar for Great Good" and<br>
there's not (yet) been a huge influx of curious outsiders blazing trails<br>
for everyone else. So that<br>
means people like you and me (who seem to be sometimes frustrated<br>
outsiders) have on opportunity<br>
to be the trailblazers -- the ones who subject ourselves to getting lost<br>
for a while, knowing<br>
that when we eventually do find our way, we can make it easier for the next<br>
person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what I wrote some time ago on this list (concerning Isabelle,<br>
not just Isar).</p>
<p>The theoretical foundation ([Paulson, 1988]) is excellent, and Isabelle is an<br>
impressive software, but the documentation is a nightmare. In it, logical<br>
foundations are mixed up with technical details. It has many references<br>
to articles outside of the documentation (at least in earlier versions), forcing<br>
one to struggle one's way through a jungle of numerous articles. I believe<br>
it took me years just to find out that [Paulson, 1988] is the theoretical foundation.</p>
<p>The documentation should enable one to work with the software independently,<br>
but in fact it is a supplementary reference for "academics working closely with<br>
and being taught by other people who are intimately familiar with the system<br>
already".</p>

<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
Carrying out proofs in Isabelle can be quite easy, but this is not the point.</p>
<p>A logician wants to know what actually happens below the surface,<br>
i.e., what the logical concepts (foundations) are, and how the formulae<br>
are represented internally (with full details such as type information).</p>
<p>For example, in order to avoid the inconsistency as presented on p. 2 of<br>
<a href="http://andreipopescu.uk/pdf/compr_IsabelleHOL_cons.pdf">http://andreipopescu.uk/pdf/compr_IsabelleHOL_cons.pdf</a><br>
and quoted at<br>
<a href="http://owlofminerva.net/kubota/r0-faq/">http://owlofminerva.net/kubota/r0-faq/</a><br>
an additional check is made at run-time.</p>
<p>If I'm not mistaken, the current Isabelle version implements a run-time check on<br>
whether a theory is well-formed based on the dependency relation<br>
as defined on p. 8 in the paper linked above. (In other words, it is verified<br>
that there are no circular definitions.)</p>
<p>Such an intricate logical concept - which differs from other existing systems -<br>
should be mentioned in the manual, and preferably in a separate part on the logic<br>
(in this case Isabelle/HOL).</p>
<p>Usually, avoiding inconsistencies is the task of the type system.<br>
Additionally, in HOL, some extensions have restrictions on definitions<br>
(see, e.g., [Gordon and Melham, 1993, p. 220, condition (iii)], or p. 33 of the online version<br>
at <a href="http://freefr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/hol/hol/kananaskis-11/kananaskis-11-logic.pdf">http://freefr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/hol/hol/kananaskis-11/kananaskis-11-logic.pdf</a> ),<br>
which are verified prior to accepting the definition and concern only the definition itself,<br>
not the whole theory.</p>
<p>Performing run-time checks (after the definitions were accepted) on the whole theory<br>
is something completely different and should be announced prominently.</p>
<p>But this isn't the case, as far as I can see.</p>

Let me just add that one can also contribute to this envisaged AFP entry "Number <br>
Theory Miscellany" once it is in place, not just now. The same is in principle <br>
true for any AFP entry, although most of them don't have this library character, <br>
and of course you have to liaise with their authors first.</p>
