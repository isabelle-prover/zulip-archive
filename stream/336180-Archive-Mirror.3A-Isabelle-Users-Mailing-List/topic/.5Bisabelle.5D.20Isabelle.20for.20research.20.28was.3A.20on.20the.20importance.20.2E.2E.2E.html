<p>From: José Manuel Rodriguez Caballero &lt;<a href="mailto:josephcmac@gmail.com">josephcmac@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
If I am wrong in the following lines, please feel free to correct me, I am<br>
far from being an expert in proof assistants (such a correction may help<br>
other beginners having the same wrong ideas). My two arguments for the<br>
"sorry" approach in actual research in mathematics are the following, which<br>
seem to apply to both the human brains and the computers:</p>
<p>Argument 1 (The Tower of Babel): A library in which the types corresponding<br>
to the statements of the theorems and their corollaries are assumed to be<br>
inhabited rather than to be proved to be inhabited is more efficient from a<br>
computational point of view, e.g., sledgehammer should work faster than in<br>
the traditional approach because the search space is smaller. So, even if<br>
we know the proof of a theorem, we may omit such a proof in order to<br>
improve the computational efficiency of the proof assistant by eliminating<br>
unnecessary lemmas.</p>
<p>Argument 2 (The Tortoise and the Hare): Informal mathematics develops<br>
faster than formal mathematics for the same obvious reasons that it falls<br>
apart easier. So, to do research in contemporary mathematics,<br>
non-controversial theorems should be assumed to be true in a proof<br>
assistant, as most mathematicians do in their brain. Few creative<br>
contemporary mathematicians really know all the proofs of the theorems that<br>
they used in their research, because mathematics developed in an<br>
exponential way.</p>
<p>Angeliki's above-mentioned observation applies to Argument 2. Nevertheless,<br>
using the "sorry" approach, the discussion will be no longer about validity<br>
of logical reasoning, but about the translations from ZFC to simple type<br>
theory. This last subject does not belong to the foundations of the<br>
particular branch of mathematics where we are proving the theorem, e.g.,<br>
modular forms, but to type theory and formal logic. Furthermore, it is<br>
easier to do experiments changing the statements in Isabelle than in a<br>
paper, because the paper does not change color after a mistake is found.</p>
<p>A proof assistant, with a library of types corresponding to contemporary<br>
theorems written in Isabelle assumed to be inhabited by "sorrry" will be a<br>
useful tool to do informal mathematics and such a practical solution should<br>
not be confused with the systematic project of formally verifying all<br>
mathematics. I do not say that to implement such a library of statements<br>
without proofs is easy, but it is the only way to reach the hare.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
Jose M.</p>

Dear José,</p>
<p>Isn't the "formal math through sorry" thing you're<br>
proposing very close to what will be given by Tom Hales'<br>
formal abstracts project?  So isn't this happening already<br>
in some small way?</p>
