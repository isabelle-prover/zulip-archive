<p>I always find it interesting to see how mathematicians understand our<br>
proof system. It definitely influences its future evolution.</p>

<p>Just looking at the PDF it was obvious to me that this is an informal<br>
(La)TeX document, the way how mathematicians like to do it.</p>
<p>Did you know that Isabelle is first and foremost a formal document<br>
preparation system, with LaTeX merely as backend for low-level<br>
typesetting? See the explanation of "isabelle mkroot -d" in the "system"<br>
manual.</p>
<p>Using Isabelle sources for a document like yours makes it easy to quote<br>
formal pieces. either checked or unchecked (e.g. via the @{text} and<br>
@{theory_text} antiquotations). It also makes it easier to keep the<br>
document up-to-date wrt. inevitable changes of Isabelle.</p>

Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Attached is a short guide intended to introduce Isabelle to mathematicians<br>
or more generally people with a mathematical rather than computer science<br>
background. The guide was written by myself (Alexander Hicks) and José<br>
Siqueira (CC'd). Both of us completed an MASt in Mathematics at Cambridge<br>
and worked with Isabelle over the summer at the Cambridge Computer<br>
Laboratory. We decided to write this guide as the existing content we found<br>
was mostly written by and geared towards computer scientists.<br>
I've attached a pdf copy of the guide, I've also uploaded it to a github<br>
page: <a href="https://github.com/alexanderlhicks/IsabelleGuide">https://github.com/alexanderlhicks/IsabelleGuide</a> so there is a<br>
permanent link to it. Feel free to host it and distribute it as you like.<br>
Hopefully so of you will find it useful or interesting.<br>
Note that neither José or I are currently (or will be in the near future)<br>
doing work related to Isabelle so there are no current plans to keep this<br>
updated with new Isabelle releases and so on. If you find mistakes or have<br>
comments, we will both be happy to amend the current version as time allows<br>
(so it could take a while). I think we would also both be fine with someone<br>
building on top of this if they wish, we still have the tex file.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Alex<br>
