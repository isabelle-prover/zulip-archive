<p>Makarius is right in guessing that I'm referring to Isabelle2005 - it <br>

useful work.</p>

<p>The huge gap between Isabelle2005 and Isabelle2007 is in fact exceptional. <br>
There were 25 months between the two releases, and actually Isabelle2006 <br>
missing.  In 2007 it was still unclear if we would recover again to a sane <br>
state.</p>
<p>The transition Isabelle2005 -&gt; Isabelle2007/2008 also marks the point <br>
where really ancient customs from the late 1990-ies were finally given up, <br>
with a delay of 5-10 years.</p>
<p>Taking both together, there has been definitely a loss of Isabelle <br>
applications from the past, those that did not manage the jump into the <br>
current century.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Isabelle2007 on we have followed a more disciplined release schedule, <br>
with a limited amount of pain caused by incompatibilities, as before <br>
Isabelle2005.  So applications that follow the stepping stones of each <br>
official release now should be quite at easy to port.</p>

<p>Here it greatly helps to sort out old/legacy things <em>before</em> making a <br>
step forwards, and not to make too many steps at the same time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I gather things have got worse since then, in terms of incompatibilities <br>
between versions of Isabelle and therefore the prospects of users making <br>
use of other users' work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, by sticking to very old versions of Isabelle, other people will <br>
hardly be able to re-use such work.  I reckon that the interval of <br>
relevant Isabelle releases consists of the 2-3 last ones.  It is also <br>
important to refrain from offering things "for the latest snapshot, which <br>
is the one on my laptop".  The probability that two people have the same <br>
"latest versions" and can thus share some work is approximately 0.</p>
<p>Here is an arbitrary example for a project that relates a range of <br>
versions of both itself and Isabelle in a nice way:<br>
<a href="http://staff.aist.go.jp/y-isobe/CSP-Prover/CSP-Prover.html">http://staff.aist.go.jp/y-isobe/CSP-Prover/CSP-Prover.html</a></p>
<p>Another way is to wrap things up as an article for AFP, following the <br>
guidelines by its editors.  Porting is than mostly auto-magically.</p>
