<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:c.sternagel@gmail.com">c.sternagel@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>1) First a trivial observation: When I start Isabelle/jEdit via</p>
<p>isabelle jedit -d .</p>
<p>and the current directory contains a ROOT file with a session FOO, then <br>
the logic selector in the theory panel will contain the session FOO.</p>
<p>If I do the same via</p>
<p>isabelle jedit</p>
<p>FOO is not there, which is expected.</p>
<p>Now, after doing</p>
<p>isabelle build -d . -b FOO</p>
<p>there is the heap image FOO in my ~/.isabelle/Isabelle2013-2/heaps/... <br>
but nevertheless the logic selector will not contain FOO when starting <br>
jEdit via</p>
<p>isabelle jedit</p>
<p>Again, this is as expected.</p>
<p>2) Now I was wondering about the following: For users that start <br>
Isabelle/jEdit via clicking on an icon, which is I guess equivalent to doing</p>
<p>$ISABELLE_HOME/Isabelle2013-2</p>
<p>on a console. How are they expected to access FOO as default logic? <br>
Maybe the logic selector should provide all images that are present in <br>
ISABELLE_PATH ? But then again, how are GUI-only users expected to build <br>
FOO in the first place? Maybe it would be good to have something like <br>
the former "build_dialog" that can be started from within Isabelle/jEdit?</p>
<p>cheers</p>

<p>From: "Elsa L. Gunter" &lt;<a href="mailto:egunter@illinois.edu">egunter@illinois.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Makarius,<br>
   Basic question: in Isabelle2014 (GUI), how do I start with a heap I <br>
have built, instead of HOL?</p>
<p>In Isabelle2014, if I build a heap with say</p>
<p>isabelle build -d '$AFP/Kleene_Algebra' -b Kleene_Algebra</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>isabelle build -s -d '$AFP/Kleene_Algebra' -b Kleene_Algebra</p>
<p>this puts a heap in the expected place(s).  However, I am clueless as to <br>
how to start Isabelle/jEdit with such a heap.  If I start up the <br>
Isabelle/jEdit GUI,<br>
Kleene_Algebra does not appear as a choice for logic in the pull-down <br>
menu in the Theories panell (although I believe it use to in an older <br>
version).   If I try</p>
<p>isabelle jedit -l Kleene_Algebra</p>
<p>I get a box with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Undefined session(s): "Kleene_Algebra"<br>
This is despite having /Users/elsa/svn/AFP in my<br>
~/.isabelle/Isabelle2014/etc/components<br>
file.   Below you quote a paragraph from system.pdf suggesting that <br>
using ROOTS in the $ISABELLE_HOME_USER directory will somehow address <br>
this.  I'm not at all sure what this has to do with the -d flag for the <br>
isabelle executable, which allows the user to specify a directory for <br>
finding the ROOT file for a session.  More to the point, I do not know <br>
how to use ROOTS.  The ROOTS file in $ISABELLE_HOME contains a <br>
collection of path fragments.  I gather the sessions described in the <br>
ROOT files in those directories are made available as the choices of <br>
starting logic (?) for an Isabelle session.  But there are way more <br>
"logics" than heaps, so I'm not even sure if this is particularly <br>
relevant   Are these paths interpreted relative to the location of ROOTS,<br>
$ISABELLE_HOME, the $ISABELLE_PATH, or what?  If I put <br>
'$AFP/Kleene_Algebra' in ROOTS, I get<br>
Illegal character "$" in path element specification "'$AFP"<br>
The error(s) above occurred in "'$AFP/Kleene_Algebra'"<br>
The error(s) above occurred in session catalog <br>
"/Users/elsa/.isabelle/Isabelle2014/ROOTS"<br>
If I put an absolute path into ROOTS in $ISABELLE_HOME_USER, then it <br>
offers it to me as a choice of Kleene_Algebra in the logics, but <br>
choosing it seems to have no real effect; it still loads the theories in <br>
Kleene_Algebra over again, apparently from Main.  For Kleene_Algebra, we <br>
are only talking about a few theories of relatively modest size. <br>
However, I have need of half a dozen or so theories from AFP, including <br>
JinjaThreads,  as well as a few home-grown libraries and I really need <br>
not to have to rebuild all that every time I try to get some work done <br>
in Isabelle (or even just try to continue the very painful fight to <br>
bring my work up to date with Isabelle 2014).</p>

<p>Building heaps (or "logics") yourself is sometimes needed in batch mode, <br>
but normally you don't do it manually when working with PIDE.  You just <br>
tell Isabelle/jEdit where to find ROOT or ROOTS files via option "-d DIR", <br>
and it will allow you to select additional sessions in the GUI or via <br>
option "-l SESSION".</p>

<p>The ROOTS files allow to make -d options (of isabelle build or isabelle <br>
jedit) persistent. The shortest answer to all your questions is to have <br>
$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/ROOTS with a line like this</p>
<p>$AFP</p>
<p>without any extra quotes or spaces -- this is not a bash script, just a <br>
text file with lines to be taken literally.</p>
<p>I principle, AFP as a "component" could do this for you, but it refrains <br>
from it by default, since its session name space is quite large, and would <br>
affect important maintenance operations like "isabelle build -a".</p>
