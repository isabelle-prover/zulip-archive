I am trying to examine the possibility of using some different fonts with  <br>
jEdit in Isabelle. My normal 5.0 version of jEdit with my Java runtime  <br>
works fine to give me certain fonts (FreeFont, OTF, in particular), and I  <br>
have checked that it has the glyphs that I care about, but for some  <br>
reason, the Isabelle/jEdit instance is not giving me those fonts as an  <br>
option. Is there some way to get this? Is it just that it is running with  <br>
a different JVM version, or is it something in the way jEdit is combined  <br>
with Isabelle, or something else entirely?</p>

The easiest way to make OTF fonts work with the classic JVM 1.6 that is <br>
bundled with Isabelle2012 is to use fontforge to convert to TTF, and place <br>
the results in ~/.fonts/ in the usual way. You should then load <br>
Isabelle2012/etc/symbols with the UTF8-isabelle encoding to see if <br>
everything works out.</p>
<p>Generally, arbitrary selections of Linux packages with a substring "jdk" <br>
or "jedit" or "scala" in the name won't work together by default to host <br>
Isabelle/jEdit adequately.  OpenJDK 1.6 is not worth trying -- I gave up <br>
on it 1-2 years ago.  OpenJDK 1.7 is a bit better, but not quite there <br>
yet, and Isabelle2012 requires 1.6 anyway.</p>
<p>It is one of the big advantages of Isabelle/jEdit that it is not at the <br>
mercy of accidental packages found on the user's system, unlike Proof <br>
General with its constant worries about Emacs varieties.</p>
<p>What is your "normal 5.0 version of jEdit" exactly?  I've been testing <br>
5.0pre1 myself several weeks, until I had to revert to stable 4.5.2 due to <br>
I/O dropouts on Linux with the 5.0 testing branch.  The jEdit maintainers <br>
seem to be lagging behind their original release plans for 5.0 for several <br>
weeks.  Although that is not really relevant for Isabelle/jEdit, since it <br>
comes with its statically bundled jEdit 4.5.1 distribution, a version that <br>
has been tested a lot.  (It is also slightly patched to make advanced text <br>
rendering work in the first place, see also <br>
