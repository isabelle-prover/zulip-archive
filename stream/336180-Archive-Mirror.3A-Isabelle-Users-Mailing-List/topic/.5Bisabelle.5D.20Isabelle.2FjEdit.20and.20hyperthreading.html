Hi,</p>
<p>Isabelle/jEdit has an option to configure the number of threads in use for parallel proofs:<br>
   Plugins &gt; Plugin options &gt; Isabelle &gt; General &gt; Parallel processing &gt; Threads</p>
<p>By default, this is set to 0 which indicates the "hardware max." I find on machines with hyperthreading, this means the<br>
number of physical cores, not the number of logical hardware threads. E.g. on a machine I have here with 2 hyperthreaded<br>
cores, Isabelle/jEdit appears to use 2 threads when I would prefer 4. I realise I can set this manually, but I was<br>
wondering if the default behaviour is deliberate? Perhaps the assumption is that the shared resources on the cores are<br>
kept busy enough by Isabelle that the extra threads won't help. I'm just asking out of curiosity, more than anything<br>
else. The host environment is 64-bit Linux by the way.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Matt</p>

I think the behaviour has changed between 2014 and 2015 as 2014 used to use<br>
100% of CPU with hyperthreading turned on and 2015 now peaks only just<br>
above 50%.</p>
<p>I've been running with hyperthreading disabled in the BIOS anyway as I did<br>
some benchmarking (using run_tests from seL4) with 2014 and the fastest<br>
configuration I found (for my x5680) was with hyperthreading disabled.<br>
Some of the tests were a bit faster at the same clock speed with<br>
hyperthreading disabled but the main benefit was that by disabling<br>
hyperthreading I could run with a higher clock speed for the same CPU<br>
temperature at max load.</p>
<p>I also benchmarked the difference between speedstep on and off (on an i7<br>
5820k this time) and see a 10% improvement by turning speedstep off which<br>
will be useful in the winter when I need a heater.</p>

<p>Thanks, Harry, informative to hear your results. I don't have the same processor, but I suspect mine<br>
behaves the same in limiting the clock frequency with hyperthreading enabled. I don't want to<br>
disable it or speedstep, so I'll just live with my current setup.</p>
