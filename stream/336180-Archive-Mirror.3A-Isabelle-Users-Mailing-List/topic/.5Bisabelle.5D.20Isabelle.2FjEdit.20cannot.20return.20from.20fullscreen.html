<p>From: Ramana Kumar &lt;<a href="mailto:rk436@cam.ac.uk">rk436@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>I am using Isabelle2015. When I run Isabelle/jEdit, I can enter fullscreen<br>
mode (F11). If I then try to exit fullscreen mode (press F11 again), the<br>
entire window turns grey and I cannot see anything. (The mouse cursor would<br>
indicate that the window is still there underneath the grey, though, since<br>
it changes from a text cursor to a pointer cursor around where the buffer<br>
changes to the menu.)</p>
<p>If I switch back to fullscreen mode, it comes back, but there is no way<br>
back to non-fullscreen mode without restarting the prover. What could be<br>
wrong? What can I do?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Ramana</p>

This sounds like an odd Linux/X11 window manager problem.  Java/AWT makes <br>
certain assumptions that don't hold for recent forks and variations on <br>
window managers.  Since there is so much choice of window managers on <br>
Linux, the solution is to choose one that works: I am using Xfce4, for <br>
example.</p>

Hmm... well, to be honest, I'm very happy with my window manager (apart<br>
from this possible interaction with unrealistic assumptions in Java/AWT).</p>
<p>It's not yet obvious to me that the window manager is really the problem.<br>
Does anyone have any methods by which to analyse the situation further?</p>
<p>[Perhaps I should just use a theorem prover IDE that works. There is choice<br>
there too :)]</p>

Thanks very much, Brian!</p>
<p>Impersonating LG3D does appear to work.</p>
<p>I also have set the _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING environment variable, but<br>
only setting that variable didn't work.</p>
<p>I am surprised that just setting the environment variable didn't work,<br>
since the version of java (1.7.0) bundled with Isabelle2015 is quite<br>
recent. Does Isabelle's java require some special treatment of environment<br>
variables?</p>

<p>Trying them on a machine with the xmonad window manager I can get the <br>

This is an ancient argument of Window manager projects versus Java/AWT. <br>
Funnily, Sun made both the X11 WM specifications and Java at about the <br>
same time many decades ago, but it seems by different teams that did not <br>
speak to each other. The web is full of questions and answers about that, <br>
it is futile to repeat that here.</p>
<p>The official Isabelle Installation website solves the problem by this <br>
intensional specification of Requirements for Linux:</p>
<p>* Window manager / Desktop environment that works with Java/AWT/Swing</p>

FWIW this requirement seemed necessary but not sufficient to me in the past. Modern Isabelle works fine for me, but the first few Isabelle/jEdit releases were unusable on my then window manager (a Gnome/Xmonad hybrid), despite other Java AWT/Swing programs running fine. At the time I limped along on the slowly bitrotting Emacs setup and thankfully by the time this disappeared Makarius' improvements to the jEdit setup made it play nice with my window manager.</p>

Can you pin down anything specific that changed in the jEdit setup in this <br>
respect?  I don't think I did anything myself there, although there might <br>
have been positive side-effects from other tuning.</p>
<p>I would guess it was merely Oracle ironing out some snags once again, but <br>
they cannot fully finish that without changing something fundamental in <br>
their X11 vs. AWT approach.</p>
<p>Since both X11 and AWT are legacy they might just wait until both are <br>
phased out, although I have no idea if there is a clear vision of what <br>
will come after it.  Maybe Wayland + JavaFX?</p>

<p>I was never really sure. I suspect it was an upgrade of the JRE bundled with Isabelle. However, I don't know why this<br>
helped as I tried running standalone jEdit under the same JRE at the time and it had no problems. I did not investigate<br>
in depth at the time as I had a viable workaround (Emacs).</p>
