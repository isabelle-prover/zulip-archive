<p>From: Christoph LANGE &lt;<a href="mailto:math.semantic.web@gmail.com">math.semantic.web@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle experts,</p>
<p>my impression (which may have been wrong) from Isabelle2013 was that<br>
"try" tries "try0" before "sledgehammer".  In Isabelle2013-1-RC3 this no<br>
longer seems to be the case.</p>
<p>I find this quite annoying because I have made it a habit to enter "try"<br>
after almost every statement.  In many cases I don't know whether try0<br>
would be sufficient to prove something, or whether a more complex proof<br>
(such as those that sledgehammer finds) is required.  Then, when<br>
sledgehammer finds a proof, looking at the lemmas used by this proof<br>
sometimes gives me the intuition that try0 might also suffice, e.g. when<br>
I know that all of these lemmas are simp rules.</p>
<p>Here is a self-contained almost minimal example.  I didn't try this with<br>
older versions but I'd be happy to do so.  Please ignore the first step:<br>
maybe there is an easier proof for this, but for _this_ email only the<br>
second step is relevant.</p>
<p>notepad<br>
begin<br>
  fix R::"('a × 'b) set"<br>
    and N::"'a set"<br>
    and n::'a<br>
  have "{ (x, y) . (x, y) ∈ R ∧ x ≠ n }¯ = { (y, x) . (y, x) ∈ R¯ ∧ x ≠ n }"<br>
    by (smt Collect_cong converse_unfold curryE curry_split<br>

  then have "Domain { (x, y) . (x, y) ∈ R ∧ x ≠ n } = Range { (y, x) .<br>
(y, x) ∈ R¯ ∧ x ≠ n}" try<br>
end</p>
<p>On my machine try0 finds that simp/auto/force each take 2 ms.</p>
<p>However when I say "try", it resorts to running sledgehammer, which<br>
tells me:</p>

<p>… this shows that the first proof step is not necessary at all, because<br>
"using Domain_unfold by auto" suffices to establish the second step<br>

Hi Christoph,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay in answering.</p>
<p>"try" does a number of things in parallel, using the ML function "Par_List.get_some". Because it may use several threads in parallel, there are no guarantees about which result will be printed first. Usually, "try0" results tend to be shown first because the "try0" thread is launched first and it tends to return first as well; but Sledgehammer has become faster, and "try0" is only as fast as its slowest tool (with a timeout of 5 s).</p>
<p>In short, this does not appear to be a deep difference between Isabelle2013-1-RC1 and Isabelle2013, but rather a matter of (bad) luck.</p>
<p>Still, the behavior you described is somewhat undesirable, so I've now made it less likely to happen in the repository version of Isabelle (change c7af3d651658). When "try0" is invoked from "try", it now stops as soon as it has found one proof, instead of reporting detailed timings for different tools.</p>
<p>Since this is not a true regression, and there is an easy workaround (i.e. invoke "try0" directly), I will not ask Makarius to add the change to the final version of Isabelle2013-1. If this is very important to you, I would suggest that you apply the patch locally. In any case, the patch should be part of (the expected) Isabelle2014.</p>
<p>Thank you for your report.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jasmin</p>
