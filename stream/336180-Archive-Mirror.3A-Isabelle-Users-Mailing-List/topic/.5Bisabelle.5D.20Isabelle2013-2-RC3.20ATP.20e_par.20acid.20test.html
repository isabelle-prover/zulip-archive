<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Makarius,</p>
<p>The short story is that I can reliably get non-terminating processes (or <br>
processes that can't be shut down, and that will run for a long time), <br>
but so far, I can only do that with the ATP e_par, and when it's started <br>
with a bunch of other ATPs.</p>
<p>The theorem I use for the test has to be put it at the bottom of a <br>
theory, so that Sledgehammer can find some relevant facts.</p>
<p>The test is to start Sledgehammer, and then terminate it prematurely by <br>
deleting the "r" in "Sledgehammer", sometimes soon, and sometimes later. <br>
I actually have to let e_par run for a while to get the right conditions <br>
for it to not terminate.</p>
<p>I didn't spend a lot of time experimenting with the command I show next, <br>
which doesn't use e_par, but it uses most every ATP that's available to <br>
me, and I haven't seen any problems from prematurely terminating the <br>
Sledgehammer command. This is the command:</p>
<p>ML {* Multithreading.max_threads_value () *}<br>
    ML {* Multithreading.max_threads := 300 *}<br>
    ML {* Multithreading.max_threads_value () *}</p>
<p>theorem "False = True"<br>
    sledgehammer [minimize=smart,preplay_timeout=10,timeout=60,verbose=true,<br>

    leo2        cvc3<br>
    "]<br>
    oops</p>
<p>From here, two key points are that e_par starts up 12 eprover.exe <br>
processes regardless of what max_threads is set to, that the number and <br>
order of ATPs run with it affect things, and "max_thread := 4" is what <br>
sets up the particular sequence I list below.</p>
<p>I give the Isar command below, but I work it like this:</p>
<p>1) I start the command.<br>
2) Lots of eprover processes will be started and terminated, several times.<br>
3) At about 40 seconds using my CPU, the ATP "leo" will be running with <br>
12 eprover.exe processes, during a time when processes aren't being shut <br>
down and started (shown by green and red lines using <br>
<a href="http://systemexplorer.net/">http://systemexplorer.net/</a> )<br>
4) I delete the "r" in "Sledgehammer".<br>
5) The processes keep running much long than what I'm willing to wait. <br>
(I have waited up to 15 minutes to see if they would terminate, and they <br>
didn't.)<br>
6) I exit the PIDE. Processes are terminated except for the ATP related <br>
processes. I attach a screen shot showing the many non-terminating <br>
processes.</p>
<p>The command is this:</p>
<p>ML {* Multithreading.max_threads_value () *}<br>
    ML {* Multithreading.max_threads := 4 *}<br>
    ML {* Multithreading.max_threads_value () *}</p>
<p>theorem "False = True"</p>
<p>sledgehammer [minimize=smart,preplay_timeout=10,timeout=60,verbose=true,<br>
                  isar_try0=true,isar_proofs=smart,provers="<br>
       e_par e leo2 z3 metis z3_tptp spass yices cvc3 smt spass_poly<br>
    "]</p>
<p>oops</p>
<p>The steps listed above don't always work, but they probably work more <br>
than 50% of the time.</p>
<p>In the PIDE options, the default for "Threads" is "0", which is what <br>
controlled my "max_thread" until I started changing "max_threads" with <br>
the ML command, which affected me being able to get the sequence of <br>
events to happen as I described above. The value "max_threads := 4" gets <br>
the same results as the "Threads" set to "0". I have a 4 core CPU with <br>
no hyperthreading.</p>
<p>This is no problem for me. The ATP e_par actually terminates much of the <br>
time, and I haven't been using it because of the large number of <br>
processes that it starts.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I don't actually have to terminate the Sledgehammer command. This worked <br>
three times in a row:</p>
<p>1) Log out and back into my Windows account.<br>
2) Run the command I showed with max_threads set to 4.<br>
3) It gets to where "leo" and 12 "eprover.exe" processes are running, <br>
and they don't timeout like they should.</p>
<p>I think it's related to the number of threads, but not completely. I can <br>
change max_threads to 3, and e_par times out like it should. I change it <br>
back to 4, and it can time out like it should.</p>
<p>I did the log out/log in sequence with max_threads set to 3, and it did <br>
like with 4, except "leo" wasn't running, but it didn't do it twice in a <br>
row. The number 4 seems worse, but 3 fails, and every computer might be <br>
different.</p>

<p>300 threads are quite a lot, but I suggested to go towards and beyond the <br>
limits of what is feasible :-)</p>
<p>The e_par implementation ($E_HOME/runepar.pl) has its own process <br>
management and allocation of CPU resources.  It does not take the number <br>
of ML threads into account.  Looking a bit through the script, I see <br>
various potential weaknesses and non-portabilities.  E.g. there is ulimit, <br>
which only works reliably on various brands of Unix, not the generic <br>
quasi-POSIX of Isabelle that includes Cygwin.  It is also unclear if its <br>
internal signal handling is really robust (e.g. the Cleanup does not wait<br>
for the process farm.)</p>
<p>A general note on Multithreading.max_threads: changing that in Isabelle/ML <br>
might lead to some surprises, because the PIDE protocol will update its <br>
value after some change of properties, using the value that is given in <br>
Isabelle/Scala, which is the same that you see in Isabelle/jEdit in the <br>
dialog "Plugin Options / Isabelle / General / Threads".</p>
<p>ML {* Multithreading.max_threads_value () *} is fine to check what <br>
Isabelle/ML is presently using.</p>

<p>Does that mean you have a local installation of leo?  I've never looked <br>

<p>We've had that already: switching off the light with the hammer --- by <br>
shutting down the outermost PIDE application --- does not really help. <br>
It can leave processes behind at the bottom of the implicit hierarchy.</p>
<p>POSIX processes are relatively difficult to control systematically.  One <br>
needs to look at particular implementations, to see that they are within <br>
reason of fork, wait, signal handling etc.</p>

<p>Indeed.  It seems to be an experiment to allocate as many CPU cores as <br>
feasible, with different strategies for E tried in parallel.</p>

Yes, "e_par" should be considered experimental. Beyond the technical issues, it didn't perform well on our benchmarks.</p>

<p>I have about 70 processes running normally, and with threads set to 300, <br>
only a maximum of about 140 processes are ever running for the "False = <br>
True" test. An ATP running as a thread sometimes starts up lots of <br>
processes of its own. With threads set to 4, a max of about 90 processes <br>
will be running on my computer.</p>
<p>I think I'll try threads set to 12 for a while, even though you've said <br>
it should be set to the number of physical cores. One of the new remote <br>
ATPs that came with Isablle2013-1 is "remote_agsyhol", which is finding <br>
proofs.</p>
<p>I've added that to my "first pass ATPs", so here are the 12 I use for a <br>
first pass. Setting threads to 12 lets all of the them start (or maybe <br>
it needs to be more than 12), and many of them will sometimes timeout fast:</p>
