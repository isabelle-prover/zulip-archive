Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>I've been working a few days with RC3 now. Even if you say "As long as <br>
it comes back eventually, it is not fully frozen." I find the <br>
responsitivity of Isabelle/jEdit in the presence of non-terminating/slow <br>
tasks unsatisfactory. I regularly have to interrupt my work for 30 <br>
seconds or so to wait for Isabelle/jEdit. This often occurs when jumping <br>
back up within a proof and changing something that causes some of the <br>
later commands to diverge or if I simply have some diverging try running <br>
on my last goal which I don't care about at the moment.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a problem which doesn't affect "pro users" as much as they <br>
always know how their proof will work and only type commands that <br>
immediately run successfully. ;)</p>
<p>Another side remark: Where is one supposed to place the sledgehammer <br>
panel in docked mode? I only see three bad options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Switching between the output and the sledgehammer panel all the time. <br>
Obviously bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Docking it at the right. The space there is to thin.</p>
</li>
<li>Docking it at the top. Because all the panels waste so much space <br>
there isn't much space left for my proof script, of which I like to see <br>
as much as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>And one feature request:<br>
When ctrl+hovering over some fact/variable whose definition is currently <br>
visible it would be nice if that where high-lighted and maybe <br>
eclipse-like also all occurrences in a different colour.</p>

Dear Isabelle users,</p>
<p>this is still one more release candidate for the second attempt to make a <br>
stable release of Isabelle this autumn:</p>
<p><a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013-2-RC3">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013-2-RC3</a></p>
<p>The good news is that no new problems have shown up, but I managed to find <br>
a solution to an old problem of external process management.</p>
<p>Notable changes versus Isabelle2013-2-RC2:</p>
<p>* More robust termination of external processes managed by Isabelle/ML:<br>
     support cancellation of tasks within the range of milliseconds, as<br>
     required for PIDE document editing with automatically tried tools<br>
     (e.g. Sledgehammer).</p>
<p>* Clarified application icons and window titles -- more uniform on all<br>
     platforms.</p>
<p>* Minimal tuning of some Isabelle/jEdit GUI elements.</p>
<p>The final Isabelle2013-2 release should emerge after 2-3 days of further <br>
testing. This is the very last chance to point out serious drop-outs.</p>
<p>Observations from testing release candidates may be discussed here on <br>
isabelle-users (not isabelle-dev), on the bitbucket tracker <br>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/issues">https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/issues</a> or via private <br>
mail.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, Isabelle/Scala and Isabelle/jEdit are waiting for <br>
Isabelle/ML.  The interruptibility of the underlying Poly/ML process is <br>

<p>I did not hear anything about such inconveniences in the past couple of <br>

dared to report.</p>

<p>You can also dock left, or let the window float (even several copies of <br>
it).  The jEdit action isabelle.sledgehammer activates some instance of <br>
the panel according to standard jEdit policies.  You can experiment <br>
binding this to some keyboard shortcut.</p>

<p>Even more could be done there, and is in the pipeline for quite some time <br>
already.</p>
<p>I've got too much side-tracked by technical issues that are strictly <br>
speaking outside my control and responsibility, such as general JVM <br>
integrity and too much divergence and fragmentation of major operating <br>

Sorry, can't tell because I didn't use Isabelle/jEdit intensively before.<br>
How many "threads" do you have active, compared to the physical <br>
hardware? This can be changed in "Plugin Options / Isabelle / General" <br>
and the effective value is reported by ML <br>
"Multithreading.max_threads_value ()". <br>
ML "Multithreading.max_threads_value ()" returns 4, I've an Core i5 with <br>
4 hardware threads running on 2 cores, I changed max_threads to 2, I'll <br>
see how that works out.</p>

Does it mean you are a former Proof General user or non-user?</p>
<p>If you have large "scripts" that depend a lot on sequential stepping and <br>
easily run into non-termination of some parts, you can try flipping the <br>
"Continuous checking" option, e.g. in the Theories panel.  There is also a <br>
keyboard shortcut "C+e ENTER" for it, which is a bit reminiscent of <br>
Escape-Meta-Alt-Control-Shift.</p>
<p>This hand-control is a bit odd, but it sometimes helps.  The system should <br>
eventually become smarter in just the right scheduling of pending tasks, <br>
but not here and not now.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Some more notes on this: there was a very old race condition where the <br>
external process, when cancelled too early, was not killed at all.  This <br>
was not relevant in the past, because cancellation happened only due to <br>
relative long timeouts (seconds) not the user editing (milliseconds). <br>
(This is why I always call the TTY loop "boring", instead of the genuine <br>
interaction that happens in the PIDE document processing game.)</p>
<p>As a consequence, there could be these typical "eprover" processes being <br>
left over, after some minutes or hours of editing with auto sledgehammer <br>
enabled.  The new scheme is much more robust, but without any claim for <br>
100% certainty (which is very difficult to achieve with arbitrary POSIX <br>
processes).</p>
<p>The effect was particularly bad on Windows, where process startup takes <br>
approx. 100ms instead of 1..10ms on Unix, but it did happen on Unix in <br>
practice as well.  I was finally convinced when I saw a stray "java" <br>
process due to auto nitpick on Linux, so it was neither the notorious <br>
Windows platform nor the very special eprover with its sophisticated <br>
internal signal handling.</p>
<p>Further practical notes on automatically tried tools in Isabelle/jEdit:</p>
<p>* The Isabelle option "threads" should be the physical number of cores.<br>
     On Intel hardware with hyperthreading this is doubled by default and<br>
     thus reduces editor reactivity by too many parallel tasks.</p>
<p>i3 has 2 cores<br>
     i5 has 2 or 4 cores<br>
     i7 has 2 or 4 or 6 cores</p>
<p>* "Auto methods", which is similar to the command 'try0', tends to burn<br>
     a lot of cycles.  Its internal parallelization and the global auto<br>
     tool time-out probably require some rethinking: this is still too<br>
     close to TTY mode, where the CPU is mostly idle, and sometimes rushes<br>
     through a few parallel tasks on all available cores.  In PIDE, the<br>
     prover does more things all the time -- similar to an operating<br>
     system.</p>

The issues I had with RC1 appear to have been fixed in RC2, things ran<br>
fairly smoothly in that version.</p>
<p>My work during the last few days consisted mostly of writing<br>
definitions and thinking on paper, so I haven't had any opportunity to<br>
test the process termination part of RC3 properly, but a few quick<br>
tests indicated that it's working fine there, too.</p>
