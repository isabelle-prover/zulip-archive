<p>From: Alfio Martini &lt;<a href="mailto:alfio.martini@acm.org">alfio.martini@acm.org</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>After experimenting with Isabelle2013-RC2 for Windows (in my W7 laptop), I<br>
can give the following feedback:</p>
<p>1) Intialization of Cygwin this time was successfull. Avast did not find<br>
any problem with the following<br>
program:</p>
<p>C:\Isabelle2013-RC1\contrib\cygwin\bin\peflags.exe</p>
<p>2) Avast it is however still very suspicious (considering them of low<br>
reputation) with these ones, allowing<br>
them to execute in sandbox mode though (after scrutinizing each file for<br>
about half a minute):</p>
<p>C:\Isabelle2013-RC1\Isabelle2013.exe<br>
C:\Users\AlfioMartini\Isabelle2013-RC2\contrib\polyml-5.5.0-3\x86-cygwin\poly.exe<br>
C:\Users\AlfioMartini\Isabelle2013-RC2\contrib\exec_process-1.0.3\x86-cygwin\exec_process.exe</p>
<p>3) Old style of processing documents (via IsaMakefiles) is now working<br>
again in this version (see image<br>
attached)</p>
<p>4) Executing</p>
<p>isabelle build -o document=pdf -g doc</p>
<p>still shows the error when compiling the "Programming and Proving"<br>
tutorial. Maybe the LaTeX setup<br>
should be updated to include the package "eulervm.sty" or, as you suggest<br>
in a previous e-mail,<br>
that this package should not be used (or something else be used in its<br>
place). See image attached.</p>
<p>5) Most important, those ambiguous and strange error messages (as discussed<br>
in another live<br>
thread) in the output window are<br>
still present. I include here a file "error_test.thy" so you can see<br>
exacty, on the spot, what<br>
it is going on.</p>
<p>Best!<br>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
So Sledgehammer is back in the saddle again. I run 13 ATPs together, and <br>
the ATPs that normally find proofs all return normally. If I run 24 ATPs <br>
together, then it seems to cause some of the ATPs to time out or <br>
terminate when they otherwise wouldn't, but they terminate in a normal <br>
manner by returning an error message.</p>
<p>Getting analytical about the output panel, I'd say there are two types <br>
of information, primary information and secondary information.</p>
<p>With Sledgehammer set for a 60 second timeout, the output is always <br>
going to be primary information, meaning that I'm always going to want <br>
to look at the output from the time I start the command until the <br>
command finishes.</p>
<p>It turns out that I've switched today to using the tooltip window to <br>
look at the Sledgehammer window, since it doesn't get overwritten with <br>
new data while Sledgehammer is running.</p>
<p>The cycle is something like this:</p>
<p>1) Start Sledgehammer.</p>
<p>2) Hover over "sledgehammer".</p>
<p>3) When the tooltip window pops up, click on the "Detach tooltip window" <br>
icon so that it's a normal window and doesn't disappear if I click <br>
somewhere else.</p>
<p>4) Scroll to the bottom to see if there's any new output there to think <br>
about, and maybe go ahead and click on a proof to insert it and <br>
terminate Sledgehammer.</p>
<p>5) Close the window.</p>
<p>6) Loop through items 2 through 5 until sledgehammer finishes, and then <br>
do it one last time.</p>
<p>So, I use whatever features are there to be used. If the output panel <br>
went away, I obviously wouldn't use it.</p>
<p>But some information you want to look at a lot, and some information you <br>
only want to look at on an as need basis. So if you have to do more work <br>
than you used to to look at information that you look at a lot, then you <br>
will long for yesterday.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

Dear Makarius,</p>
<p>once more I want to bring up an older thread (back then on isabelle-dev) <br>
about the Output Panel.</p>
<p>See <br>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg03072.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg03072.html</a> <br>
[*]</p>
<p>If we open a new empty theory file and do not immediately insert the <br>
"end" (or any other character, for that matter) that belongs at the end <br>
of a theory file, we are always one-off with the caret, i.e., error <br>
messages as well as normal output is only visible after moving the caret <br>
to the left once. Examples (caret position indicated by [...]):</p>
<p>theory Test[]</p>
<p>I expect "Outer syntax error: keyword "begin" expected, but end-of-input <br>
was found" in the Output Panel, but see nothing, if I go back to "theory <br>
Tes[t]" the error message shows up.</p>
<p>theory Test imports Main begin<br>
   thm refl[]</p>
<p>I expect "?t = ?t", but get nothing (again it works after changing to <br>
"thm ref[l]").</p>
<p>find_theorems "_ = _"[]</p>
<p>It seems that the search is run, but we don't get the output until we <br>
have "find_theorems "_ = _["]". The same hold, e.g., for sledgehammer: <br>
the command is run, but we do not see the output.</p>
<p>All of this examples work as expected, as soon as at least 1 additional <br>
character is added <em>after</em> the current position.</p>
<p>I think especially for beginners, starting from a completely empty file <br>
is a common use case. End the current behavior might be a bit unexpected.</p>
<p>IIRC, you said that this is a general jEdit problem?</p>
<p>For the current release: is there a workaround (e.g., always append a <br>
newline at the end of a new file)? Or otherwise, I would mention at a <br>
(very) prominent place that we should always start by inserting "end" at <br>
the end of a file. Or, even better, jEdit could insert a temple <br>
automatically for any new *.thy file, e.g.,</p>
<p>theory &lt;Filename&gt;<br>
   imports &lt;Import&gt;<br>
   begin<br>
   []<br>
   end</p>
<p>where &lt;Filename&gt; is taken from the user (if available), &lt;Import&gt; might <br>
default to "Main" and [] is the initial cursor position).</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>chris</p>
<p>[*] An aside: I would very much like to link to the "official" <br>
isabelle-dev mail archive, but it is not searchable, and even if you <br>
managed to find a certain message somehow, links between threads are <br>
just cut at month borders, which makes it very hard to follow longer <br>
threads.)</p>

<p>So why do it without?  You need the end eventually, so you can make it <br>
part of the standard habit of starting a new theory.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, jEdit has a blind spot at the very end of the buffer, due to special <br>
tricks it does for handling files with or without final line terminator. <br>
Even worse, the numeric length of the buffer is one off, so plugins <br>
unaware of that easily produce NPE particles.  I have once tried to file a <br>
tracker item at the jEdit project, but these guys are not as reactive as <br>
we are here on the Isabelle mailing lists.  One should try again, ideally <br>
in a constructive version, i.e. a patch proposal for jEdit.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I think genuine beginners don't even get that far.  They need to be told <br>
to open some .thy file and put a certain template there.  Some people do <br>
not even manage to get Isabelle/jEdit start up -- in the last two releases <br>
I tried to improve the success rate at that spot primarily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the current release: is there a workaround (e.g., always append a <br>
newline at the end of a new file)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Isabelle2013 codebase already has various internal workarounds, and it <br>
is close to a local optimum that is hard to change without breaking things <br>
again.  There used to be funny effects when moving the caret, like showing <br>
old versions of output, instead of showing nothing, as it should be now.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Most people don't even read the most prominent bits of information, like <br>
ANNOUNCE or NEWS.  It is better to make jEdit put a template there without <br>
too much hassle, but that old idea did not make it in the Isabelle2013 <br>
release.</p>
<p>What could be done right now is to make a nice video for the first <br>
encounter with Isabelle/jEdit, and put this somewhere on youtube.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
It should actually work better than in Isabelle2012 now.  It was just an <br>
accident that the Cygwin version from that time was handling the <br>
inherently fragile spawing of external processes most of the time.  The <br>
Cygwin in Isabelle2013-RC1 was less benign, and this old problem was <br>
harder to ignore.</p>
<p>For Isabelle2013-RC2, David Matthews changed Poly/ML to work with parallel <br>
Cygwin processes in a robust manner.  I managed to run tests like <br>
HOL-Nitpick_Example with all its Java processes for Kodkod without <br>
problems.</p>
<p>If anybody still sees external Cygwin processes that crash in strange ways <br>
(with stack dump), or left-over processes that are not cancelled properly, <br>
please report this.  (You can use the Windows task manager or "ps" on the <br>
Cygwin Terminal to check this.)</p>

Yes, this is approaching a good way to do it. A minor technical snag <br>
remains: the tooltip is not updated dynamically, and this won't happen for <br>
Isabelle2013.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
It wasn't predictable, and it didn't happen but maybe once every 30 <br>
minutes, at the most, and when I was doing a lot of typing.</p>
<p>I did a little typing with the default jEdit install folder for <br>
Isabelle2103-RC3, and it works, but I won't immediately find out if it's <br>
a problem.</p>
<p>It could be related to the fact that I use two views to edit the same <br>
file. The cursor of one view might be at the very bottom of the file, <br>
and so every keystroke in the 2nd view causes the 1st view to have to do <br>
its continuous proving thing. The typing gets sluggish, but I use it <br>
like that quite a lot anyway.</p>
<p>Another mystery was that the side panel would close occasionally, as if <br>
I had clicked on the side panel tab of the plugin.</p>
<p>Things have primarily been uneventful, especially with the <br>
multi-threading fix for Cygwin.</p>

I don't know if it's RC related or not, but the output format of the  <br>
“print_locales” command, could be improved, displaying one element at a  <br>
line instead of all elements in a flow. The actual output looks bulky in  <br>
the output pan.</p>

Another one (I installed RC2 when coming back to Isabelle, and don't  <br>
remember if it was the same before), also about what's displayed in the  <br>
output pan, now by the “display_rules” command.</p>
<p>Quick case: “thm conjI” displays “?P ⟹ ?Q ⟹ ?P ∧ ?Q” in the output pan.  <br>
OK, but “display_rules” displays “?P ⟹ ?Q ⟹ ?P ∧ ?Q” without its name,  <br>

To answer in a confusing way: Main is HOL ;)</p>
<p>But seriously. In the PDF, "HOL" refers to the logic HOL (not to the <br>
theory file HOL.thy). And everything that is loaded by Main.thy <br>
(including the theory Hilbert_Choice.thy, which adds "someI") is part of <br>
the logic image HOL, and thus of the logic HOL as used in Isabelle/HOL. <br>
(Additionally there are of course extensions like theories from <br>
~~/src/HOL/Library or the AFP, but what Main.thy represents is kind of <br>
the minimal version that a user should see.)</p>
<p>hope this helps,</p>

You are absolutely right. This section describes the primitive HOL theory (HOL.thy). When it was written, Isabelle/HOL followed the traditional formalisation in which the existential quantifier was defined with reference to Hilbert's epsilon operator. Later, the formalisation was changed to eliminate this entirely unnecessary dependence on the axiom of choice, with Hilbert's epsilon being introduced much later in the development. It is now possible to formalise mathematics without use of the axiom of choice in Isabelle/HOL, but you would have to do without a great many things, including Sledgehammer.</p>

<p>Wow, great! :) I was wishing this. Before I came to Isabelle, at the time  <br>
I didn't knew any prover system, I tried to imagine such things, and in my  <br>
mind, this was always coming with this: “if it automate some proof or  <br>
proof step, the user should be able to learn what the steps was, it should  <br>
be visible in some way”. That's important, as the matter, I feel, is not  <br>
only about the prover understanding a proof, but also about the human  <br>
author and human reader, understanding it too.</p>
<p>Many thanks for the great point!</p>

<p>It means that the "rule" method in HOL has additional rules available: the <br>
ones of Pure (print_rules) and the ones of the classical reasoner context <br>
(print_claset).  It is wired up in a way that you normally get what you <br>

<p>Yes, this implicit use of single-step rules from the context according to <br>
the structure of your problem, is an important aspect of Isar -- the <br>
"Intellegible semi-automated reasoning" so to say.  Fully automated <br>
reasoning is used in different spots.</p>
<p>Until proper IDE feedback for "rule" steps arrives you can use rule_trace <br>
as crude approximation:</p>
<p>notepad<br>
begin<br>
   note [[rule_trace]]</p>
<p>have "A ∧ B"<br>
   proof  -- trace<br>
     show A sorry<br>
     show B sorry<br>
   qed</p>
<p>from <code>A ∧ B</code> obtain A and B ..-- trace</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>This gives you the unfiltered uninstantiated candiates that the method <br>
guesses from the situation.</p>
<p>(In Isabelle2012 the trace output needs to be enabled by the check-box in <br>
the output panel; in Isabelle2013 it is always there.)</p>

I is still without names, the way it has been before.</p>
<p>It is not impossible to improve that eventually, but not trivial either. <br>
For Isabelle2013 some print commands were improved --- e.g. find_theorems <br>
and find_consts to markup their name references --- but not print_rules, <br>
print_simpset, print_claset.</p>

Maybe this solved a mysterious problem.</p>
<p>After reading the above, I looked at the options in the output panel to <br>
see what check boxes are there. Until now, I've never done anything but <br>
look at the output of the output panel.</p>
<p>A few minutes ago, I clicked on the "Detach" button, and an empty "Info" <br>
window popped up, and that's what's been happening to me, an "Info" <br>
window has been mysteriously opening up.</p>
<p>I'll be typing, and then an empty "Info" window will open up, and my <br>
fingers haven't been near the CNTL or ALT keys. I've been looking high <br>
and low for any shortcut that will do that, and I haven't found any.</p>
<p>I'll use this email as a means to mention the plugin that has become my <br>
main plugin to get a global view of what's in my file.</p>
<p>Attached are two screenshots for a total of 150 Kbytes.</p>
<p>I create my search strings in the highlighter for individual words or <br>
strings, as shown in the first image. I then group the keywords, one way <br>
being to edit this plugin file:</p>
<p>\jedit\plugins\gatchan.highlight.HighlightPlugin\highlights.ser</p>
<p>The highlighter plugin not only highlights for me, but it becomes my <br>
main way to get a sidebar list of the different groups of keywords, as <br>
shown in the second image, where what is shown is the "everything group".</p>
<p>Sidekick doesn't work for me. I can't control the nesting very well; <br>
it's either too expanded, or I have to click through too many nodes.</p>
<p>One flat list with highlighter is better than sidekick's tree.</p>

cannot be invoked with arguments, so I have to play tricks with focus <br>
events to transfer content to the detached window.</p>
<p>Can you try this again with Isabelle2013-RC3 without any of your local <br>

clean $ISABELLE_HOME_USER as you have probably noticed already.</p>
