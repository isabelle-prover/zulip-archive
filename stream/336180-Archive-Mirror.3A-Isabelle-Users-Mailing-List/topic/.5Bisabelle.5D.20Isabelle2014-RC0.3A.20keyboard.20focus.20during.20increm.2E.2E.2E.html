Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>while playing with Isabelle2014-RC0, the following behaviour of Isabelle/jEdit regularly <br>
disrupted my work flow. Suppose that I use the incremental search bar to search for <br>
something in the current buffer. For example, I'd like to jump to the first <br>
"lift_definition" command in a theory. After typing lift_d, the view already shows what I <br>
was looking for. Having read the information I was interested in (without pressing any <br>
further keys), I then press some other keys to navigate in the theory file (such as PgUp <br>
and PgDn). This tricks me into thinking that the keyboard focus now is back in the main <br>
text area. However, as soon as I press Key-Up, I end up scrolling through the history of <br>
incremental search, which causes the text area to jump around wildly. Can I somehow set <br>
that one I start scrolling with keys, the focus is transferred back to the main text area?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>
<p>PS: Thanks for all the effort to build PIDE. I haven't used ProofGeneral for a while now <br>
and I don't miss it much.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
jEdit has many tricks of keyboard focus change that I don't understand in <br>
all details, but I have adapted to some of its aspects in Isabelle/jEdit <br>
as of the Isabelle2014-RC0 snapshot.</p>
<p>For example, the main text area cursor is now always visible, but changes <br>
color depending on focus: without focus it is rendered via <br>
caret_invisible_color, which is a very pale and greyish version of the <br>
original red.  So when the cursor becomes pale in that sense, it means <br>
special tricks apply: only those key events are passed to the text area <br>
that are presently uninterpreted by the GUI component that does have the <br>
focus.  This can be the search bar, action bar, completion popup etc.</p>
<p>I did not know the search bar incident yet, and put it on my list of <br>
things to keep in mind, whenever I revisit this very delicate topic of <br>
focus and event propagation again.</p>
<p>Note that Isabelle2014-RC0 it is already a bit more smooth than in <br>
Isabelle2013-2 concerning keyboard focus and event propagation.  This was <br>
the result of myself spending 3 days as actual user (for the AFP entry <br>
Roy_Floyd_Warshall) and watching closely for snags, to iron them out <br>
afterwards.</p>
<p>The more such fine points become known, the better the chances that they <br>
can be sorted out eventually.</p>
