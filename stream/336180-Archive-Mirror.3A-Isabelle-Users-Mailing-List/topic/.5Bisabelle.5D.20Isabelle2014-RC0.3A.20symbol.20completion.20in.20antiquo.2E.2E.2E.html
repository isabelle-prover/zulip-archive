There are many fine points like that, which I would have liked to see in <br>
forthcoming Isabelle2014, but did not make it due to still existing <br>
baggage of Proof General legacy.</p>
<p>Maybe after next week at Vienna we have a better impression how many <br>
remaining uses of Proof General are left over (as well as remaining <br>
users).</p>
<p>Everyone is invited to discuss that not just with me, but with any of the <br>
Isabelle/jEdit veterans.  Early adopters have jumped on the train in <br>
October 2011 with the first stable release of the Prover IDE, and the <br>
coming one is already version 5 in the internal counting.</p>

Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>I am wondering why symbol completion in antiquotations inside text blocks behaves <br>
differently from symbol completion in ordinary term statements. Here's an example:</p>
<p>If I type a symbol name like \alpha in a lemma statement such as</p>
<p>lemma "\alpha"</p>
<p>then I can tell Isabelle to replace \alpha by α. (In fact, I have enabled immediate <br>
completion, so \alp suffices.) Inside antiquotations, however, this does not seem to work.</p>
<p>text {* @{term "\alpha"} *} makes Isabelle complain about a "bad escape character in <br>
string". In order to get α, I now have to type \&lt;alpha&gt; and then press Ctrl-B. This <br>
becomes particularly annoying with longer symbol names like \&lt;rightharpoonup&gt;.</p>
<p>Is this difference intentional? I would have expected that antiquotations switch back to <br>
"inner syntax mode" and thus behave as in ordinary term statements.</p>
<p>Andreas</p>

I read the text on completion, but I must admit that I would not have been able to figure <br>
out your explanation with dropping out of the language context. As is usual in the <br>
Isabelle documentation, your text describes the general principles, but not the concrete <br>
instances that one encounters in practice. For example, I was not able to figure out which <br>
language contexts exist (in a plain Isabelle/HOL session) and when language contexts are <br>
switched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There probably are the contexts "outer syntax", "inner syntax", "LaTeX text", ML source, <br>
but there could also be something like "inner syntax inside the antiquotation text" which <br>
might behave differently from "inner syntax inside the antiquotation term" and "inner <br>
syntax inside the antiquotation const". I don't know how I could find out which language <br>
context I am currently working in. Maybe it suffices to display the language context of <br>
the curser somewhere in Isabelle (e.g., in the status bar as Emacs used to do it).</p>
<p>I remember a presentation you gave long ago (possibly at the workshop in Cambridge in <br>
2010) in which you showed that you can nest an term antiquotation inside an ML <br>
antiquotation inside ... inside a text block. That made me think that there is probably <br>
not one separate language context for each antiquotation, but that I might expect the same <br>
behaviour as with normal inner syntax.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This is done with the ubiquitious C-hover idiom: it produces a popup <br>
saying "language: NAME".  The other flags for the language are not <br>
printed, but accessible dynamically in SideKick with "isabelle-markup" <br>
parser in the status window:</p>
<p>&lt;language name="NAME" symbols="false" antiquotes="false" delimited="true"/&gt;</p>
<p>Or you look in ~~/src/Pure/PIDE/markup.ML for the language contexts that <br>
are presently used in Isabelle/Pure -- but tools could invent their own.</p>
<p>To make this exploration more fun, consider this formal Isar source:</p>
<p>text ‹ see @{file "~~/src/Pure/PIDE/markup.ML"} ›</p>
<p>Here the file-system path specification has language context "path", <br>
because the "file" antiquotation has provided that semantic information. <br>
This means that file-name completion is active in PIDE: you can type some <br>
prefix of it and use C+b to get more from the directory content.</p>
<p>If this is madness, there is method in it ...</p>

Does that mean that cartouches for antiquotations will not be part of <br>
Isabelle2014? Just for the record: I would like to have</p>
<p>@{term ‹α something›}</p>
<p>since, as you said, this would avoid some problems with symbol completion.</p>
