<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle users,</p>
<p>after 8 days of testing Isabelle2014-RC1, the second official<br>
release candidate Isabelle2014-RC2 is now available:</p>
<p><a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2014-RC2">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2014-RC2</a></p>
<p>The following fine points that have been addressed:</p>
<p>* tuning of documentation</p>
<p>* update of Haskabelle to work with recent versions of ghc</p>
<p>* minor changes to SMT2, sledgehammer, datatype_new tools</p>
<p>* misc tuning and clarification of PIDE interaction</p>
<p>Observations and problems of release candidates may be discussed <br>
here on isabelle-users, or via private mail with the person who is <br>
responsible (when that is obvious).</p>
<p>In the next round it will become more difficult to find the remaining <br>
problems.  People who have reported anything for previous release <br>
candiates should check again if the situation has indeed improved.</p>
<p>Ambitious users may already start updating their existing applications to <br>
work with Isabelle2014-RC2 -- it should be hardly distinguishable from <br>
final Isabelle2014.</p>
<p>Makarius</p>

<p>From: bnord &lt;<a href="mailto:bnord01@gmail.com">bnord01@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi there,</p>
<p>some observation I made when moving my development to 2014-RC2:</p>
<p>When opening my Development in Isabelle/jEdit 2014-RC2 I got some (3-4) <br>
error markers that the theorem nat_add_commute was not found in some <br>
metis commands. I cleared them manually until all error markers were <br>
gone. Then when I restarted Isabelle/jEdit I got more error markers of <br>
the same kind, cleared them again manually until all were gone. But I <br>
still found 2 places were nat_add_commute was used using search <br>
afterwards which were not marked as errors.</p>
<p>Environment:<br>
Macbook Pro, 2.4GHz Core i5 (2 Cores with 4 Threads), 8GB RAM, OS X <br>
10.9.4, threads = 2, ML_OPTIONS="-H 500 --gcthreads 2"</p>
<p>Suggestion: Some "Report bug" or at least "Generate system report" <br>
support would be nice so you get the system information you need.</p>
<p>Side note: I used indentation folding in 2013 to get some basic folding <br>
support. I could enable it by moving my settings manually but the GUI <br>
support to changing this setting seems to be gone, at least I couldn't <br>
find it any more.</p>
<p>Best<br>

<p>The relevant information is also context dependent.  At the moment I won't <br>
expect any HW/OS specific non-determinism.  In more than 50% of the cases, <br>
a "bug" is just user confusion anyway.</p>

<p>In 2013 there was more than one Isabelle release: Isabelle2013 uses <br>
jedit-5.0.0, but Isabelle2013-2 uses jedit-5.1.0 like current Isabelle2014 <br>
release candidates.  That could also make a difference, but I don't think <br>
so.</p>
<p>$ISABELLE_HOME_USERS/jedit/properties is the most relevant place to look <br>
for persistent state. If you sort this line-wise, you can compare the <br>
content with what you've had before.</p>

Yes I figured that out, but my first go was just sledgehammer again <br>
which worked fine. Later I did a find/replace which edited two more <br>
occurrences.</p>

No I wasn't sure just made the above observations. But I figured this <br>
one out now, just noticed that for long documents the bar on the right <br>
(whatever you call it) doesn't display markers for the whole document <br>
but only for some part. You have to scroll through the whole document <br>
after processing it to see whether there are any markers. This isn't <br>
what one is used to from other editors with such a feature.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
That is called "text overview".  There is an Isabelle plugin option "Text <br>
Overview Limit" with a default of 65536.  You can probably use the double <br>
of that on your machine, without significant slowdown of real-time update <br>
and painting.</p>
