Dear Makarius,</p>
<p>Is there already an action (or command, I'm not sure on the naming here) <br>
in Isabelle/jEdit for whatever C-hover does internally. Then a keyboard <br>
shortcut could be assigned to it, avoiding the need to use the mouse.</p>
<p>I'm asking since while showing Isabelle/jEdit to others I often get the <br>
question whether it wasn't possible to avoid using the mouse.</p>
<p>Of course C-hover is possible recursively, which would not directly work <br>
with the keyboard currently (maybe if keyboard focus was transferred to <br>
the popup and there would be a cursor available?).</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>chris</p>

<p>I usually try to provide jEdit actions for the main things by default, but <br>
this is not always easy.  For example, the "`" completion template is hard <br>
to reach on some national keyboards, so I tried to wrap it up as <br>
remappable action, but did not manage so far because of entangled GUI <br>
events.</p>
<p>Tooltips are also not so immediate.  There are various GUI event listeners <br>
and timers around it.  Ultimately it goes through <br>
PIDE.rendering().tooltip().  We've already seen smart approaches with <br>
Beanshell scripting on this mailing list, far beyond what I usually do <br>
myself, so maybe someone manages that.</p>

<p>I wonder where this anti-mouse movement is coming from.  Nostalgic users <br>
of vi?  Or bad mouse hardware?  I am myself using a relatively <br>
old-fashioned 3-button-wheel mouse from 5 years ago, which might have been <br>
the peak of this technology.  More recent touchpads also work for me, <br>
notably on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>In principle the popup is a nested jEdit textarea, with special tricks <br>
around it to make it work smoothly.  The cursor is disabled explicitly. <br>
After all this is not Emacs, with its "everything is a buffer approach".</p>
<p>Generally, I don't think that the single-focus text cursor is a good <br>
concept for the future.  The Output panel also has that as retro-feature <br>
only.  BTW, in the classic GUI terminology of Java/Swing, the "cursor" is <br>
actually the mouse pointer, and a text cursor within a text area is called <br>
"caret".</p>
<p>Maybe this talk from "1973" (actually 2013) by Bret Victor <br>
<a href="http://worrydream.com/dbx/">http://worrydream.com/dbx/</a> helps again to revive the visions to work with <br>
"modern" computer displays effectively.</p>

Neither; it's increased productivity. When I'm typing with both hands,<br>
but then need to transfer one hand to the mouse and spend several<br>
seconds on aiming the pointer exactly where I need it, this is a larger<br>
disruption. Especially when this switch has to be done quite often.</p>
<p>A mouse is an efficient tool, when I don't need the keyboard or resting<br>
one hand there is sufficient, like for example for browsing, gaming or<br>
others. But not for developing or writing in general.</p>
<p>It is also quite ok, when I'm only skimming through a theory and looking<br>
at different things or try to understand a certain proof. Then it's ok<br>
to point here and there.</p>

I do use the mouse a lot in development, but maybe that's an instance of <br>
gaming, or maybe I am just old-fashioned (being socialized when a mouse <br>
was something very special).</p>
<p>If the reluctance to use the mouse is a general trend in "development" <br>
then current IDEs must have keyboard shortcuts for the tooltip idioms that <br>
we have.  Maybe someone wants to look around and write a summary for the <br>
situation in Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ IDE, Visual Studio.</p>

I'd like to add to this, because I've been one of the people to bother<br>
Chris with this question.</p>
<p>I'm not a strong opponent of using the mouse, though I think that having<br>
keyboard shortcuts for common actions is very desirable for efficiency,<br>
and looking up types of identifiers is a very common interaction when<br>
using Isabelle, so deserves having such a shortcut. (Note that the<br>
cursor will often be in the vicinity of the identifier of interest,<br>
while the mouse pointer may be anywhere in the jedit window.)</p>
<p>Despite having no issues with using the mouse per se, I find C-hover<br>
very annoying. There are two reasons for this with Isabelle/jedit's<br>
default settings. The more important one is that my usual approach for<br>
mouse interaction is to move the mouse to the right spot, and then click<br>
appropriately. With C-hover, one has to press the Control key before the<br>
mouse pointer comes to rest; if I forget doing that, I have to press<br>
Control and wiggle with the mouse; rather than one interaction with the<br>
mouse I now need two. The second issue I'm experiencing is that the<br>
popup does not appear immediately, i.e. the UI forces me to wait.<br>
Fortunately, one can reduce the popup delay to improve interactivity.</p>

In Eclipse there is F2 for the tool tip and F3 for open declaration and <br>
of course a lot of other useful stuff, I virtually never use the mouse <br>
when writing Scala code in Eclipse except for creating new run <br>
configurations, during debugging and stuff, but even there I prefer <br>
tabbing through forms and stuff over using the mouse.</p>
<p>Another feature I miss is instance highlighting to directly see where <br>
the term/fact under the cursor is used and the equivalent of a call <br>
hierarchy for theorems.</p>
<p>I don't use the other IDEs but I'm very confident that they'll have <br>
similar features, a quick web search produced Crtl+F1 for InteliJ.</p>
<p>However I seldom use the tool tip in Isabelle/jEdit, what may be nice if <br>
it wouldn't just show the type but also the definition and maybe a <br>
selection of theorems in which the term appears, respectively the fact <br>
itself when hovering a fact.</p>
<p>Keyboard support for open declaration together with for moving back and <br>
forth would be nice. Yet this would become less necessary if the tool <br>
tip already would show the definition, I use this a lot in my PDF viewer <br>
(Skim, with the mouse) where hovering a link opens a tool tip showing <br>
the linked position which is incredibly useful for looking up citations.</p>
