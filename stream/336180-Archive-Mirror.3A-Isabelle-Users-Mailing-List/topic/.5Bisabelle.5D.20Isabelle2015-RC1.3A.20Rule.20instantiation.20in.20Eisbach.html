<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch">andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Eisbach developers,</p>
<p>First of all, thanks for designing and implementing Eisbach. Unfortunately, I am <br>
struggling with instantiating variables in rules when I write my own proof methods in Eisbach.</p>
<p>Abstractly,</p>
<ol>
<li>I select a rule R by matching a list L of theorems against a term, and</li>
<li>then instantiate a variable in R with a term obtained by matching the conclusion <br>
against a pattern.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, I always get the error "More instantiations than variables in theorem" <br>
although all the theorems in the list L contain at least one variable. I do not know where <br>
this error comes from. Below is a small example:</p>
<p>theory Scratch imports Main "~~/src/HOL/Eisbach/Eisbach_Tools" begin</p>
<p>consts foo :: "'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ bool"<br>
lemma my_thms: "foo x y z ⟹ z ∧ y" "foo x y y ⟹ x ∧ z" sorry</p>
<p>lemma "⋀z. A z ∧ B"<br>
apply(<br>
   match concl in "f x y" for f x y ⇒ ‹<br>
     match my_thms in R:"PROP P ⟹ f u v" for P u v ⇒ ‹<br>
       rule R[of x]<br>
     ›<br>
   ›<br>
)<br>
oops</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Thanks for any help,<br>
Andreas</p>
<p>PS: I am trying to build something similar to the apply_split method in the Eisbach paper <br>
presented at ITP2014.</p>

Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>Unfortunately the ITP paper is slightly out of date, specifically regarding rule instantiation. The "match" method is now meant to guard rule instantiation at run-time by ensuring that the matched theorem(s) has<br>
the correct slots available. This is done by using meta-quantifiers in your patterns. Specifically the semantics of a match are that a "for-fixed" variable may match anything, whereas a meta-quantified variable<br>
must match against a schematic. So in your example, assuming you wish to instantiate "P", your pattern should be "!!P. PROP P ==&gt; f u v" for u v". This statically ensures that any matched rule can be instantiated appropriately (so the failure occurs in the match, rather than the rule instantiation).<br>
The motivation for this requirement is perhaps more clear when using match to define an Eisbach method, rather than when used in-place.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that a pattern like "f x y" for f x y will produce a large set of possible matches, due to "match" using the unifier internally. The usual best-practice approach is to add type annotations to your pattern to restrict the matches.<br>
There is some argument for extending the match pattern language to support more precise term deconstruction, but I'm waiting to see more use cases before adding more complexity.</p>

It would be interesting to explore the question if/how the new "rewrite" <br>
method facilities could be re-used here.</p>

Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, I cannot get this to work at all. Your suggested <br>
pattern "!!P. PROP P ==&gt; f u v" raises a type error. After several failed attempts, I am <br>
now stuck at the following where something really strange happens.</p>
<p>lemma "⋀z. A z ∧ B"<br>
apply(<br>
  match concl in "f x y" for f x y ⇒ ‹<br>
    match my_thms in R:"⋀x :: _ :: type. P x ⟹ f u v" for P u v ⇒ ‹<br>
      print_fact R,<br>
      print_fact R[of undefined],<br>
      rule R[of undefined]<br>
    ›<br>
  ›<br>
)</p>
<p>If I name the bound variable to be matched by a schematic, print_fact R outputs something <br>
like foo ?x ?y ?x ⟹ ?x ∧ ?y whereas the matched rule is "foo x y z ⟹ z ∧ y", i.e., it <br>
unifies x with z. If I rename the bound variable !!x to !!z, the rule stays in its general <br>
form. Still, the method still fails, because the variable instantiations are done in a <br>
strange order (not in the order in which they occur in the theorem).</p>
<p>I do not know the form of the assumption of my matched theorem in my real use case, I just <br>
know that there is a variable in the assumptions and that I want to instantiate the first <br>
one. How can I express this in Eisbach? I tried to play with "!!x :: _ :: type. PROP P x <br>
==&gt; PROP Q" but this did not match anything I tried.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

<p>It's likely you've uncovered an issue with variable clashes here, picking a fresh name for the bound variable seems to result in the expected behaviour. I imagine I've overlooked some schematic index management somewhere, I'll look into it ASAP.</p>

<p>Still, the method still fails, because the variable instantiations are done in a strange order (not in the order in which they occur in the theorem).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The method instantiations are done in the order that they are declared in the match. So in your example "undefined" will be bound to whatever x matches against, regardless of the form of the actual rule.<br>
It is precisely equivalent to writing "R[where x=undefined]".</p>

<p>I do not know the form of the assumption of my matched theorem in my real use case, I just know that there is a variable in the assumptions and that I want to instantiate the first one. How can I express this in Eisbach? I tried to play with "!!x :: _ :: type. PROP P x ==&gt; PROP Q" but this did not match anything I tried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The notion of the "first" schematic is not something that can be described with a match pattern. Again, this is perhaps some indication that a more expressive pattern language is needed.<br>
Your pattern should backtrack over all possible ways some "P" can be bound such that "x" is bound to a schematic from the theorem, within these backtracking options will be the one that happens to be first.</p>
<p>However I believe this backtracking is not happening in your specific example, and I think it's actually a related issue to the other one. Bear with me while I investigate.</p>
