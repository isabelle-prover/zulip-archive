Hi,</p>
<p>when I first started RC0, the default setting was quite confusing for me.</p>
<p>I moved the current line cursor to a lemma statement.<br>
What I observed:<br>
  The bottom buffer was set to output. It displays nothing<br>
  The right buffer shows the Documentation panel.</p>
<p>What I expected:<br>
  The proof state is displayed somewhere.</p>
<p>The proof state is only visible when I select the state panel (as<br>
documented). This might be confusing for new-comers. In addition, my<br>
proof state is usually huge, but by default, the right panel is very<br>
small.</p>
<p>Splitting state and output may be a good idea for power users with<br>
large displays. On my laptop with only one fullHD display, I just<br>
can't find a satisfying setting. Maybe it is a good idea to distribute<br>
Isabelle with a simple GUI setup. Power users can still change the<br>
defaults. This would mean that by default, the proof state is sent to<br>
the output panel.</p>
<p>What do other users think?</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br>
  Cornelius</p>

<p>Why?  Proof state is only secondary in Isar.  It is possible to give <br>
several hours of Isabelle introduction without ever showing State (and <br>
Output).  It depends a bit on the topic and the target audience, and on <br>
the mindset of the presenter how it is all done.</p>
<p>I normally show first the main text area, then its popups, then other <br>
things.  Eventually also Output, State, Theories.</p>
<p>Unguided new-comers first see the main text buffer and the Documentation <br>
panel -- the latter now starts the clickable "Examples".  We probably also <br>
need a guide to the remaining documentation -- maybe another example <br>
theory that uses the new @{doc} antiquotation.</p>

<p>I've just checked again with a conventional 16x9 Full-HD 17" Laptop from <br>
2013, using the default 18px font for the main text area.  This <br>
immediately gives at least these options:</p>
<p>(1) Main text is restricted to old-school 80 chars per line, and the<br>
     right docking area (with State panel) is extended into the middle of<br>
     the main window.</p>
<p>Result: almost 50% screen size for State.</p>
<p>(2) Main text area uses extended line length of 100 chars, and the right<br>
     docking area is extended to 30-40% of main window size.</p>
<p>Result: approx. 30-40% screen size for State, or approx. 50% if the<br>
     output font scale is set to 85% (this can be done persistently with<br>
     the Isabelle plugin option "Font Scale").</p>
<p>Younger people may also try smaller fonts for the main text and/or output.</p>
<p>It is also possible to make a floating instance of State, and put it on a <br>
separate physical screen.  That is an investment of 100-200 EUR for <br>
hardware, and some desk space.</p>

<p>That was actually the intention of the arrangement of Isabelle2016-RC0. <br>
What can be simplified further?</p>
<p>I still need to update the Isabelle/jEdit manual in this respect, although <br>
I have the impression that most users avoid manuals as much as possible.</p>
<p>In addition there could be a nice introductory video.  It is occasionally <br>

<p>It is painless. I can confirm that ;-)<br>

<p>Maybe I also need such an introduction. I'm using Isabelle for some<br>
years now and learned many new things when I attended one of your<br>
short introduction talks. In particular, the trend to move away from<br>
<code>declare[[everything]]</code> and get the result in the output buffer<br>
towards ctrl+hover everything. Thanks.</p>

<p>Actually, I did not get the intention behind the GUI until now.<br>

<p>From: Julian Brunner &lt;<a href="mailto:julianbrunner@gmail.com">julianbrunner@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
My thoughts on the subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interactively viewing the proof state is important to me even though<br>
I never write apply-style proofs. When faced with a proof obligation,<br>
I like to collect the facts that I think will be relevant with<br>
'using'. This allows me to stare at both the facts and the goal<br>
simultaneously in the proof state, getting a better grasp on how to<br>
prove the goal. Without the proof state, I would have to restate the<br>
facts explicitly in order to view them in close proximity to the goal<br>
statement and relieving me of the mental effort of keeping them all in<br>
my mind. It also allows me to play around with the facts and the goal<br>
in order to get a better idea of the proof. Of course, once found, I<br>
may still want to clean up the proof to make it readable without<br>
having access to the proof state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proof state is also useful when dealing with complex induction<br>
rules, relieving me of the mental effort of instantiating the<br>
induction rule in my mind and presenting me with nicely formatted<br>
subgoals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, these points do not really apply to educational examples<br>
where an experienced user already knows what the proof state is going<br>
to be at each point of the proof, as well as which tools will be able<br>
to solve which goals. However, they do apply to inexperienced users as<br>
well as experienced users working on complex proofs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I prefer the 2-buffer model as it takes up less space on my screen<br>
without forcing me to switch between two different panels to get<br>
various kinds of feedback from the system. It allows me to work with<br>
two theories (vertical split), the Theories panel and the Output panel<br>
on a single screen (see attached screenshot). When using the 3-buffer<br>
model, at most one of the feedback buffers actually provides<br>
information most of the time, with the other one just wasting space.<br>
However, since it's not always the same feedback buffer that is<br>
important, I need to keep both of them open anyways. This problem is<br>
made worse by the fact that these panels cannot both be docked at the<br>
bottom by default (since these terms can become large, I prefer to<br>
have them displayed in a wide rather than a tall buffer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I prefer touching my mouse as little as possible as I am a fast<br>
typist and keeping my hands on the keyboard is usually much more<br>
efficient. I feel like hovering the mouse over text in order to get<br>
interactive feedback would slow me down significantly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please keep in mind that this is not a plea to change anything. I'm<br>
perfectly happy with the Output panel with the "Proof state" checkbock<br>
ticked. I just wanted to give some insight into my workflow and maybe<br>
provoke further input from people working similarly or differently to<br>
give the developers more data to work with.<br>

<p>Dear Isabelle users,</p>
<p>the coming Isabelle2016 release is scheduled for February 2016, after the<br>
next big Java 8 update by Oracle in January and some weeks before the<br>
deadline of ITP 2016.</p>
<p>To get started with systematic testing there is now the relatively early<br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2016-RC0">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2016-RC0</a> (corresponding to<br>
Isabelle/e18444532fce and AFP/c62777f3e932).</p>
<p>The website, NEWS, ANNOUNCE etc. are already mostly up-to-date.  Some<br>
documentation is still lagging behind, notably the Isabelle/jEdit manual.<br>
There are further fine points still to be sorted out.</p>
<p>When discussing problems, observations, suggustions, etc. the mail subject<br>
line should be changed to something meaningful (but the release candidate<br>
number still given in the message body).</p>
<p>As usual it is important to keep general laws of causality in mind: release<br>
candidates may still change, but the final release is final. Although this<br>
is tautological, in the past few releases we've often had complaints right<br>
after final lift-off, when it was too late.</p>
<p>So the best time to start testing is now.</p>

<p>Fine.  It should be trivial to use that model.  Just a few clicks to <br>
change the defaults.  (Unless you have counter examples on that.)</p>
<p>The new model with separate Output vs. State was in the pipeline for many <br>
years.  There were various reasons why it emerged for Isabelle2016, based <br>
on feedback by power users and observations of new users in the past few <br>
years.</p>
<p>I have already learned that <em>any</em> change in user interface always produces <br>
resistance and reluctance on the side of users who have got used to a <br>
different mode of operation.  This makes it hard to work out if there are <br>
genuine problems remaining, or just more time required to get used to it.</p>

That is a rather old thread. I don't see any connection to the way it <br>
works in Isabelle2016-RC0.</p>
<p>Of course you can always re-open a new discussion.</p>

Personally, I have no problem with the change itself. The new way is cleaner, avoiding mixing error messages with the state output. But it could be disconcerting when encountered for the first time, so we need to advertise it clearly. I have completely switched to the State window and only display the Output window very exceptionally. Other people will do things differently.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The key difference to the version in November 2015:</p>
<p>* Output has a button to enable "Proof state"</p>
<p>* State has a button to disable "Auto update"</p>
<p>Thus it is trivial to switch certain modes of operation on the fly.</p>
<p>The State buffer is conceptually cleaner and has many other advantages. <br>
The main disadvantage: users need to change old habits, as usual.</p>
