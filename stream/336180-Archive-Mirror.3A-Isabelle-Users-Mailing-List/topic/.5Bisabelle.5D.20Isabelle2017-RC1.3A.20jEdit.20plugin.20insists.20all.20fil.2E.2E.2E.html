<p>This sounds like a conflict of a legacy build process based on "make"<br>

increasingly inside Isabelle/jEdit.</p>
<p>At some point you should try to overcome this tension, and do it all<br>
within static theory sources (by loading other files into a theory from<br>
within).</p>

<p>See the following NEWS entry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command-line invocation "isabelle jedit -R -l SESSION" uses the parent<br>
image of the SESSION, with qualified theory imports restricted to that<br>
portion of the session graph. Moreover, the ROOT entry of the SESSION is<br>
opened in the editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last week, I finished updating all our proofs to Isabelle2017-RC0,<br>
without significant issues. I am still checking against RC1, but so far<br>
so good.</p>
<p>However, I have noticed that in RC1, "isabelle jedit -R -l SESSION" no<br>
longer ignores sessions that are not ancestors of SESSION. So now, we<br>
really do need to generate all files mentioned in all sessions<br>
accessible from the ROOTS file, and all their theories, before we can<br>
open Isabelle/jEdit on any of our sessions.</p>
<p>This will make life very difficult for us.</p>
<p>I have thought about this since my previous email, and I doubt we can<br>
ever escape what you describe as a "legacy build process" based on<br>
"make".</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this: For our proofs about the seL4 C kernel, we<br>
rely on the build process for the C kernel to generate preprocessed<br>
sources. Our C parser, implemented in Isabelle/ML, then generates a C<br>
specification from these preprocessed kernel sources. We need to mention<br>
the preprocessed sources in a ROOT file, to ensure that Isabelle<br>
rebuilds the session at the right times.</p>
<p>Without the leniency of the RC0 behaviour of "isabelle jedit -R", our<br>
options appear to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before attempting to open Isabelle/jEdit, run a "make" step which<br>
  generates all the files for all our sessions. While not too<br>
  inconvenient, it's distasteful that we would need to generate<br>
  preprocessed kernel sources for a session near the top of our hierarchy,<br>
  just to work on our library sessions at the leaves.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also the chance that we find ourselves in a chicken-and-egg<br>
  situation, where we can't generate files because some theory is broken,<br>
  but we can't edit the theory because we haven't generated files! We<br>
  would need to temporarily patch our build system to bootstrap ourselves<br>
  out of such a situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactor our ROOT and ROOTS files, so that we can select whichever<br>
  subset of sessions we want, and exclude sessions which require files<br>
  we don't yet want to generate. There may be many such subsets, requiring<br>
  many ROOT and ROOTS files, each with its own directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, such a structure just re-encodes dependencies that are<br>
  already present in the ROOT files. So limiting the scope could be (and<br>
  indeed, was previously) automated by Isabelle/jEdit.</p>
<p>Neither of these options is attractive. We would really like <em>some</em><br>
mechanism to limit which sessions Isabelle/jEdit looks at, whether or not<br>
that's "-R". There may be other options I have not considered, in which<br>
case, I would welcome any reasonable suggestions!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that after Isabelle2017-RC0 (e.g. in current snapshots from<br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/devel/release_snapshot">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/devel/release_snapshot</a>) the session-qualified<br>
imports are even more rigorous. It might cause additional problems for<br>
your setup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the whole, session-qualified imports seem to be a very positive<br>
change.<br>
However, at least from the perspective of a user, they seem<br>
unrelated to the<br>
problem we're facing here.</p>

<p>You could also try to generate empty templates first.</p>

<p>The full exploration of the session name space by Isabelle/jEdit is<br>
required to map file names to logical theory names. Without that you<br>
cannot refer to session-qualified theories.</p>

<p>I've tried 1af360d1cad2, and confirm that it resolves our problem.</p>
<p>Your reply to Florian Haftmann in the thread "Qualified theory imports and<br>
isabelle jedit -l … -R …" now also makes sense to me.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, although it's still not clear to me why it's necessary, or even<br>
desirable, to do this full exploration eagerly at Isabelle/jEdit startup.<br>
Although it would be more fiddly to arrange for the exploration to be done<br>
on demand, surely it is at least possible?</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for helping us out of this problem!</p>
