Hi,</p>
<p>I think the following should (depending on the intended semantics of<br>
sessions) either give an error or have a different behavior.</p>
<p>In a specific setup (see below) involving sessions, the Draft session, and<br>
a symlinked directory, jEdit will load the same theory file twice, once as<br>
A.A and once as Draft.A. There will be no error message. Both A's in the<br>
theory panel will open the same file, but editing that file will affect<br>
only one of the two instances of A in the Isabelle backend. (E.g., typing<br>
nonsense will produce red marks in the theory panel in only one of the<br>
A's.) The other A is effectively read-only.</p>
<p>How to reproduce?</p>
<p>- Untar the attached tgz (in Linux).<br>
   - It contains a session root directory dir1, and a symlink dir2 to dir1<br>
   - The session root contains a session A with A.thy, a session B = A +<br>
   B.thy, and a sessionless file Test.thy (e.g., a scratch file) importing<br>
   A.thy without qualification</p>
<p>- Run Isabelle with parameters "jedit -d dir2 dir2/B.thy dir2/Test.thy</p>
<p>Observations:</p>
<p>- The effect does not occur when first cd'ing into dir2.<br>
   - The effect can also be avoided by always using qualified imports in<br>
   scratch-theories (like Test.thy)</p>
<p>- The effect can be avoided by avoiding symlinks<br>
   - Possibly the theory import as I did it is "improper" user behavior<br>
   (although convenient for experimentation), this is why I wrote that there<br>
   should probably an error message.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

<p>Even when following those instruction, there can be some confusion in<br>
jEdit/PIDE (short: jEdit), I think.<br>
While for the build process, I think everything is clear (when reading<br>
enough of the documentation), in jEdit, I am not sure it's totally clear<br>
how jEdit determines dynamically which theory file is in which session.<br>
(E.g., with Isabelle 2018, I have had a number of times the situation that<br>
I created a new theory file (which then jEdit assumes to be in Draft), then<br>
imported it from another theory (which is already in a named session X),<br>
and then the new theory should be in the X (not in Draft anymore), but it<br>
takes a bit of closing of files and clicking the Purge button until jEdit<br>
realizes this. In the process, I see duplicated theories in the theory<br>
view, etc.) All those problems are transient though (in the sense that they<br>
vanish when restarting jEdit).</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Do you have more symlinks here?</p>
<p>Anyway, it is very difficult to have a discussion with non-standard<br>
terminology. The standard one is as follows:</p>
<p>* VSCode: a text editor by Microsoft<br>
  * jEdit: a text editor by the jEdit project team<br>
  * PIDE: some Isabelle infrastructure for Prover IDEs<br>
  * Isabelle/VSCode: Isabelle Prover IDE based on VSCode<br>
  * Isabelle/jEdit: Isabelle Prover IDE based on jEdit</p>
<p>Recently I have tried hard to make the behaviour of Isabelle/VSCode and<br>
Isabelle/jEdit agree, concerning the mapping of plain file names to<br>
formal session-qualified theory names, but there might be still oddities<br>
somewhere. Figuring that out, requires to look very closely what really<br>
happens, and where.</p>

<p>The environment where I work on my main development has a symlink, so I<br>

I would like to stress that that example does not "use" the symlinks.<br>

<p>These are interesting corner cases, concerning the mapping of file names<br>
to session-qualified theory names, and naming theories in the first place.</p>
<p>I have updated the test-archive slighty, to print the resulting formal<br>
theory name within the context. E.g. in "isabelle build" the messages<br>
end up in the session log gz files.</p>
<p>One problem with the symlink dir2 -&gt; dir1 is that in one place it gets<br>
normalized (e.g. isabelle.Sessions.Known.files) and in another place<br>
this is omitted (e.g. isabelle.Sessions.directories). I have now updated<br>
that for the next release (after Isabelle2018) as follows:</p>
<p>changeset:   68745:f95e2f145ea5<br>
user:        wenzelm<br>
date:        Wed Aug 15 13:02:48 2018 +0200<br>
files:       src/Pure/Thy/sessions.scala<br>
description:<br>
canonical session directories in correspondence to Known.files;</p>
<p>This avoids the duplication of theory A in Isabelle/jEdit, but that is<br>
actually wrong! When you import just "A" from theory B.B, it should<br>
become B.A: you can see that in the "isabelle build" log gz file.</p>
<p>The mistake is importing "A" from B.B instead of "A.A": it is a "general<br>
user error", but the system could be more friendly in checking that and<br>
pointing that out.</p>
<p>I think for the next release we really need a plain and simple scheme<br>
where session theory files may reside, and rule out such odd situations<br>
where a base directory contains files for different sessions.</p>
