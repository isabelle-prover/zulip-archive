<p>From: Joachim Breitner &lt;<a href="mailto:breitner@kit.edu">breitner@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle-users,</p>
<p>we (rightfully) pride ourselves with how natural nicely written Isar<br>
proofs are. But things are (always) not perfect, and there is always<br>
room for careful improvements.</p>
<p>Consider this rather idiomatic proof:</p>
<p>lemma "length (filter P xs) ≤ length xs"<br>
proof(induction xs)<br>
  case Nil thus ?case by simp<br>
next<br>
  case (Cons x xs)<br>
  show ?case<br>
  proof(cases "P x")<br>
    case True with Cons<br>
    have "length (filter P (x#xs)) = Suc (length (filter P xs))" by simp<br>
    also note Cons.IH<br>
    also have "Suc (length xs) = length (x#xs)" by simp<br>
    finally show ?thesis by this simp<br>
  next<br>
    case False with Cons<br>
    have "length (filter P (x#xs)) = length (filter P xs)" by simp<br>
    also note Cons.IH<br>
    also have "length xs ≤ length (x#xs)" by simp<br>
    finally show ?thesis .<br>
 qed<br>
qed</p>
<p>It is a nicely written structural proof and easy to follow. But there is<br>
a wart: The case distinction!</p>
<p>* I have to write "show ?case" to initiate a case distinction. But<br>
        this is not natural: At this point, the final result is not what<br>
        is on my mind. And in a manually written proof, I would not<br>
        re-state the current goal at this point.</p>
<p>* If I had not used the "case" command I would actually have to<br>
        copy’n’paste the current goal here; obviously not very nice.<br>
        Especially if there are multiple case distinction, each<br>
        requiring me to copy that.</p>
<p>* The goal was conveniently named ?case, but suddenly I have to<br>
        write ?thesis. I (believe I) understand the techical reasons,<br>
        but again, this is a violation of the principle of least<br>
        surprise.</p>
<p>What I would like to be able to write is something like</p>
<p>lemma "length (filter P xs) ≤ length xs"<br>
proof(induction xs)<br>
  case Nil thus ?case by simp<br>
next<br>
  case (Cons x xs)</p>
<p>cases("P x")<br>
    case True with Cons<br>
    have "length (filter P (x#xs)) = Suc (length (filter P xs))" by simp<br>
    also note Cons.IH<br>
    also have "Suc (length xs) = length (x#xs)" by simp<br>
    finally show ?case by this simp<br>
  next<br>
    case False with Cons<br>
    have "length (filter P (x#xs)) = length (filter P xs)" by simp<br>
    also note Cons.IH<br>
    also have "length xs ≤ length (x#xs)" by simp<br>
    finally show ?case .<br>
  qed<br>
qed</p>
<p>No seemingly redundant statement of the subgoals, the ability to simply<br>
use ?case and the conventional flow of thoughts and facts in such a<br>
proof.</p>
<p>This would also open the way to conveniently discharge multiple subgoals<br>
in one case distinction:</p>
<p>lemma "A" and "B"<br>
proof-<br>
  have "C" sorry</p>
<p>cases ("D")<br>
    case True<br>
    from <code>C</code> show A using True sorry<br>
    thus B using True sorry<br>
  next<br>
    case False<br>
    from <code>C</code> show B using False sorry<br>
    thus A using False sorry<br>
  qed<br>
qed</p>
<p>(Note that in this case, no ?thesis is available, and<br>
        show A and B proof (cases "D") <br>
 does not do the right thing, as it apply the cases rule only to the<br>
first subgoal, so it becomes messy to do this proof right now.)</p>
<p>This is the users mailing list, so I’ll refrain from making wild<br>
assumptions about if and how this could be implemented, and whether<br>
there is a similarity to the obtains command, but instead ask you for<br>
feedback on the user-facing design of this feature:</p>
<p>Is it something you’d want as well?<br>
Is the syntax nice?<br>
What could be the closing keyword, if not qed?</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
Joachim<br>

I think this "use-case" is covered by raw proof blocks. In general I <br>
often find that proofs get much more readable when using those (of cause <br>
the caveat is that we often have to restate assumptions/their negations, <br>
but this can all be handled by tasteful use of "let ?x = ..." before). <br>
So here is what I would write:</p>
<p>lemma "length (filter P xs) ≤ length xs"<br>
proof (induction xs)<br>
   case (Cons x xs)<br>
   { assume "P x"<br>
     with Cons have "length (filter P (x#xs)) = Suc (length (filter P <br>
xs))" by simp<br>
     also note Cons.IH<br>
     also have "Suc (length xs) = length (x#xs)" by simp<br>
     finally have ?case by simp }<br>
   moreover<br>
   { assume "¬ P x"<br>
     with Cons have "length (filter P (x#xs)) = length (filter P xs)" by <br>
simp<br>
     also note Cons.IH<br>
     also have "length xs ≤ length (x#xs)" by simp<br>
     finally have ?case . }<br>
   ultimately show ?case by cases<br>
qed simp</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>right. This works ok for boolean cases, but what if my invocation of the<br>
"cases" method is actually a complicate 5-way case distinction on some<br>
expression, or an inductive predicate with multiple variables and lots<br>
of assumptions in each case.</p>
<p>There I really would like to rely on named cases, and that rules out<br>
manual proof blocks.</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch">andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Joachim,</p>
<p>Personally, I do not mind having to state the "show ?case" part, because it makes clear <br>
that you really need to do the case distinction to prove the whole case. In fact, I think <br>
that your case distinction in the example is not as it should be, because you only need it <br>
to for the unfolding of filter. The remaining reasoning is essentially the same, and I <br>
would prefer if that could be expressed more easily.</p>
<p>Here's what I would like to see as the proof structure:</p>
<p>lemma "length (filter P xs) ≤ length xs"<br>
proof(induction xs)<br>
    case Nil thus ?case by simp<br>
next<br>
    case (Cons x xs)<br>
    let ?n = "if P x then 1 else 0"<br>
    have "length (filter P (x#xs)) = ?n + length (filter P xs)"<br>
      by(cases "P x") simp_all<br>
    also note Cons.IH<br>
    also have "?n + length xs &lt;= length (x # xs)"<br>
      by(cases "P x") simp_all<br>
    finally show ?case .<br>
qed</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Isabelle does not provide good syntax to express such expression. I think <br>
this is the reason for having so many proofs in the style of show ?case proof(cases ...).</p>
<p>As Christian Sternagel mentioned, raw proof blocks are sometimes an option, but I do not <br>
like them much either. If you have multiple goals, you can use "case_tac [!] ..." instead <br>
of "cases ..." to do a case distinction on all of them. Unfortunately, this does not give <br>
you the case names.</p>
<p>Andreas</p>

<p>From: Joachim Breitner &lt;<a href="mailto:breitner@kit.edu">breitner@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>True, in this sense the example is a bit lacking. And you are rightly<br>
pointing out that fact that for showing an intermediate statement using<br>
case distinction the current scheme is useful. So I would not go as far<br>
to expect that</p>
<p>cases ("xs")<br>
    case Nil<br>
    have P<br>
  next<br>
    case (Cons x xs')<br>
    have P<br>
  qed</p>
<p>to be equivalent to </p>
<p>have P<br>
  proof (cases "xs"))<br>
    case Nil<br>
    have P<br>
  next<br>
    case (Cons x xs')<br>
    have P<br>
  qed</p>
<p>and hence (heh) suggest this feature only for the case (heh) where one<br>
or more actual subgoals are shown (heh) in each case (heh).</p>
<p>(Although I would not dismiss the above if it turns out to be feasible).</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
