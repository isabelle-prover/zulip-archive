<p>As to why I use --"......" instead of "text{<em>....</em>}", (<em>....</em>), and <br>

in my first phase of editing a THY file. I'm always happy to analyze things.</p>
<p>My source code editing method could partially described with these <br>
phrases: "readability", "absorb information fast", "get around fast", <br>
"don't let the code get so unwieldy you don't know what's there", and <br>
"always have an idea of where you're at in the code on an outline level".</p>
<blockquote>

'section' command)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose is just visibility, so that as I'm scrolling down through a <br>
document fast, I can see when there's a sectioning command, and I can <br>
see at what level it's at, that is, whether it's section, subsection, or <br>
subsubsection. One paragraph symbol means "section". Three paragraph <br>
symbols means "subsubsection".</p>
<p>Graphics can, many times, help us absorb a lot more information, and <br>
absorb it faster than reading text.</p>
<p>Here's where someone might think I would make a request of you. I could <br>
request that you hide the syntax "section{*", and based on command <br>
context, make the words inside "section{<em>.....</em>}" bold.</p>
<p>But if you lock me into them, I might not like your decisions on font <br>
style and font size. Mathematica is highly customizable, but at some <br>
point it becomes, "I just want something that's basic, functional, looks <br>
decent, and doesn't require me to give people a style document."</p>
<p>As it is, I'd rather be working in jEdit as I am now than in Mathematica.</p>
<p>I'm still experimenting, but there are three types of information that I <br>
want to find and recognize fast:</p>
<p>1) Sectioning: what level a section command is at, and what the heading <br>
says, both when scrolling and when looking at the Sidekick panel.</p>
<p>(a) I do that as shown by the attached images; that is, using a <br>
--"...." command with bold text for scrolling through the text, and <br>
immediately followed by a sectioning command underneath it for the <br>
Sidekick panel. I have to have two. I can't read the title in Sidekick <br>
if it's full of \&lt;bold&gt; symbols.</p>
<p>2) The start of textual exposition, or text notes under theorems and <br>
other keywords.</p>
<p>(a) I do that with \&lt;bullet&gt; and some scientific amount of <br>
indentation, which I haven't locked in yet.</p>
<p>3) Toplevel keywords such as theorem, definition, syntax, notation, and <br>
definition.</p>
<p>(a) I'm still experimenting. For example, the blue and boldfaced <br>
keyword "theorem" is not enough to make it stand out from lots of other <br>
keywords in its vicinity. I'm currently experimenting with this for <br>
unnamed theorems, like this:</p>
<p>theorem --"\&lt;^bold&gt;(*\&lt;^bold&gt;) What the theorem does starts <br>
here..."</p>
<p>With that, I can also replace "*" with a number, if needed, so that I <br>
can reference it within a section.</p>
<p>I'm still looking for a more perfect symbol than "*". \&lt;bullet&gt; is not <br>
vertically centered in the "( )", and "*" doesn't stand out enough. I <br>
try things like \&lt;^bold&gt;(\&lt;^bold&gt;\&lt;^bold&gt;). I need to identify theorems <br>
quick when they're interspersed with a bunch of bulleted text. But now, <br>
I'm in realm of "personal tweaking".</p>
<p>To find something that works, looks good, and helps me see it and <br>
recognize it fast, that takes a lot of experimenting. For my other <br>
editor for LaTeX, I put a massive amount of work into syntax <br>
highlighting and making trees in a sidepanel.</p>
<p>The "looking good" is not an unimportant part of it. It's for myself, <br>
but I don't like looking at obnoxious, gaudy looking code.</p>
<p>I need dark, black symbols to stand out, like \&lt;bullet&gt; and <br>
\&lt;paragraph&gt;, but there's not a lot of them available. I used <br>
\&lt;spadesuit&gt; for a while in place of \&lt;paragraph&gt;, but it got on my nerves.</p>
<p>Simplicity and full featured is a hard balance to find. The \&lt;bold&gt; for <br>
use in identifiers will be a huge addition. I'll just grow with whatever <br>
you add, and hope you don't force something on me that doesn't look good <br>
to me, but if you do, I'll live with it.</p>
<p>Oh yea, as to why I don't use "text{<em>......</em>}". I don't like seeing <br>
"text", and <code>--"....."</code> only uses 4 characters instead of 8 characters. <br>
Of the options available for writing notes, it looks the best, but I do <br>
resort to <code>--{*.....*}</code> if I need to do lots of quoting using double <br>
quotes.</p>
<p>Both "text{<em>....</em>}" and --"....." make the background grey, and I would <br>
turn that off if I could. An example of "I live with it", because it's <br>
not a problem. The grey is a little too dark on my laptop monitor, but I <br>
mainly have jEdit on my external monitor.</p>
<p>If I ever do need to covert everything to use "text{<em>.....</em>}", I'll just <br>
go through lots pain and agony.</p>
<p>The image attachments show how I'm trying to balance the need for <br>
reading information in Sidekick with "reading when scrolling", all <br>
without ending up with something ugly or obnoxiously cluttered up, and <br>
where different symbols and formatting makes the 3 different categories <br>
stand out in 3 different ways.</p>

<p>Some of these aspects are shared by projects like Markdown, which I have <br>
encountered just recently myself, although the ideas (and tools) are <br>
already there for several years.  The idea is to write plain text with <br>
some level of "formality", such that the immediately readable text can be <br>
typeset in reasonable quality offline (or as preview online, like in the <br>
"enki" editor).</p>
<p>I've started thinking about making Isabelle section / text / "--" follow <br>
some Markdown principles.  You have already \&lt;bullet&gt; symbols that <br>
approximate a formal itemization.  A bit more such things could become <br>
standard one day.</p>

<p>Maybe in the next round of jEdit trickery.  There is still the TokenMarker <br>
limitation imposed by the original code base, but I might eventually <br>
manage to get a tiny little modification accepted by the jEdit maintainers <br>
to make font styles dependent on a semantic context, not just the plain <br>
text you see in the buffer.</p>

<p>With that, I can also replace "*" with a number, if needed, so that I can <br>
reference it within a section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BTW, there is a semiformal "tag" concept that could be used here:</p>
<p>theorem %important ...</p>
<p>Right now these tags are mainly relevant for LaTeX output, but one could <br>
make more of them.  You can also try to be creative with non-alphabetic <br>
tag names, although LaTeX will choke on that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm still looking for a more perfect symbol than "*". \&lt;bullet&gt; is not <br>
vertically centered in the "( )", and "*" doesn't stand out enough.</p>

<p>It seems that when merging Bitstream Vera and TeX fonts in IsabelleText, <br>
I've got the spacing not exactly right.  This is the normal situation for <br>
a non-fontdesigner like myself tinkering with existing fonts. <br>
Nonetheless the outcome is so much better than anything we've had in the <br>
last 15 years, and also slightly better than STIX in many respects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I try things like \&lt;^bold&gt;(\&lt;^bold&gt;\&lt;^bold&gt;). I need to identify <br>

</blockquote>
<p>Personal tweaking may be perfected by assigning your own (unused) Unicode <br>
points to (unused) Isabelle symbols in $ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/symbols <br>
like this:</p>
<p>\&lt;blob&gt;   code: 0x2593 font: STIXGeneral</p>
<p>This gives you a 75% grey shade quad, assuming you and your recipients <br>
have that font and your etc/symbols file.  Otherwhise they will see a <br>
literal \&lt;blob&gt; which is also OK.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both "text{<em>....</em>}" and --"....." make the background grey, and I would <br>
turn that off if I could. An example of "I live with it", because it's <br>
not a problem. The grey is a little too dark on my laptop monitor, but I <br>
mainly have jEdit on my external monitor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next Isabelle release, all these colors will be configurable via <br>
user options.  Then people can come up with their own "themes".</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Makarius,</p>
<p>If you get some ideas from this that's good, but I'll do 6 things and <br>
then back out of 5 of them.</p>
<p>I don't want to work with LaTeX right now, but I'm switching things <br>
around so that I can either build a PDF through Isabelle, or through my <br>
own scripts.</p>
<p>I switch to "text{<em>...</em>}" to use it like it's typically used, and I use <br>
<code>--"...."</code> for adding comments to proofs and other syntax.</p>
<p>I get rid of the bullets and make more intelligent use of subsubsection. <br>
When everything ends ups having a bullet, they lose their effect.</p>
<p>I use the section commands like normal; I get rid of the bold text in <br>
the section title, and I get rid of the duplicate title.</p>
<p>It's worth spending some time to try and format the code so that it's <br>
more readable in jEdit, but complexity can only be reduced so much.</p>
<p>Cheap imitations aren't the way to go if they complicate things too <br>
much. LaTeX is supposed to extend things, not be duplicated.</p>
<p>Other than \&lt;^bold&gt; in identifiers, you could lock in jEdit today for 2 <br>
or 3 years, and it would be good enough.</p>
<p>I see on [isabelle-dev] that it's not locked in, and the speed <br>
improvements sound good. If users can create huge theories beyond <br>
Complex_Main, and other users can use those theories without having to <br>
build the heap, that simplifies things. Speed can solve a lot of problems.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

I might as well attach related requests, which would be a request for a <br>
set of italic commands, like:</p>
<p>\&lt;^iitalic&gt;, \&lt;^bitalic&gt;, and \&lt;^eitalic&gt;,</p>
<p>where \&lt;^iitalic&gt; would be a command that could be used in an <br>
identitifer, like \&lt;^isub&gt; and \&lt;^isup&gt;.</p>
<p>And I might as well request</p>
<p>\&lt;^ibold&gt;,</p>
<p>for things like vectors and special sets.</p>
<p>I'm sure Makarius has already thought of all this, and either doesn't <br>
have time to do it, or has already decided he doesn't want to do it, <br>
maybe because it can't be practically done.</p>

Implementing, maintaining, discontinuing features is all very time <br>
consuming -- with increasing efforts on this scale.  The \&lt;^sub&gt; \&lt;^isub&gt; <br>
\&lt;^bsub&gt; \&lt;^esub&gt; varieties emerged in historic sitations.  Even now it <br>
should be possible to get there with \&lt;^sub&gt; alone in most applications, <br>
but it needs work to untangle all that.</p>
<p>In formal text italic style does not make much sense, because the formal <br>
text is implicitly "italic" already.  You see this when printing in LaTeX <br>
in the "best style" \isabellestyle{it} that imiates Don Knuth as best as <br>
possible.  If you need "non-italic" special styles, you can define your <br>
own symbols like \&lt;sin&gt; \&lt;cos&gt; \&lt;tan&gt; and render them in LaTeX as usual.</p>
<p>In informal text, one could think of bold and italic in the sense of <br>
Markdown.  What is a good notation for that?  It needs to co-exist with <br>
regular latex macros.</p>

In informal text, one could think of bold and italic in the sense of <br>
Markdown.  What is a good notation for that?  It needs to co-exist <br>
with regular latex macros.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Markarius, I'm not using your tool the same way you use it.</p>
<p>To summarize, what I'm trying to get even more is a "logical Mathematica <br>
thing". Ultimately, I don't have to have \&lt;iitalic&gt; and \&lt;ibold&gt;, my use <br>
of jEdit as a "Mathematica thing" is already happening.</p>
<p>I quoted from the last email because that applies, although not the <br>
"preview", though that sounds like a good thing. I want to write like <br>
I'm writing in a word processor, and that's what I'm already doing.</p>
<p>My marked up THY file is what I'll call a pre-LaTeX version. LaTeX is <br>
compile, compile, compile, and compile after every few changes to <br>
prevent having to track down errors. Plus, I'll spend an hour trying to <br>
make an equation look perfect, when all I'm doing is making notes about <br>
a textbook. That's a waste when I may delete much of what I do.</p>
<p>There will be what I publish for public consumption, which will be a <br>
LaTeX product, but my preliminary markup of a THY file is for me. I need <br>
to not get lost in the details, which is a combination of markup using <br>
bullets and other symbols, using section headings with bold titles, and <br>
Sidekick trees.</p>
<p>So \&lt;^iitalic&gt; is not a duplication of effort when a person is primarily <br>
reading a theory with jEdit, rather than a PDF. Would I want to <br>
italicize every variable in a formula? I might. I can already subscript <br>
and superscript every variable, and put things like "\&lt;^isub&gt;_" in them.</p>
<p>I can get LaTeX without your LaTeX tools, but I can only get in jEdit <br>
what you provide in jEdit. But what you've given is very generous.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

I think it is better to move in a presentational direction: you write the <br>
formal text without special markup for italics, but the implicit markup as <br>
logical identifiers that the prover provides is turned into italics <br>
on-screen.  So it would be just a continuation of the blue, green, brown <br>
variable game with font-styles.</p>
<p>I did not do this so far, because jEdit cannot change the font-style once <br>
it has been assigned statically by its token marker.  It will require <br>
another round of convincing it to do it nonetheless -- like I already did <br>
with the text rendering as you see it in Isabelle2012.</p>

<p>It did occur to me that when "every character" is italicized, I really <br>
don't want to be putting an \&lt;italic&gt; in front of "every character". <br>
Trying to back out of that could end up being a nightmare, or really <br>
aggravate someone else wanting to use my stuff.</p>
<p>It sounds like plans for even more of a Mathematica thing.</p>

<p>Actually, with Mathematica, their document model is way more complex <br>
than what I need, or have time to learn.</p>
<p>A combination of basic text editing, with an 80 character column, a few <br>
extra symbols, some consistent formatting using your comment command <br>
<code>--"........"</code>, and section headings, are good enough to make things <br>
readable. The math formulas are pretty much readable by default.</p>
<p>With Isabelle2011, I was using LaTeX to produce a readable document. <br>
Recently, I broke my LaTeX build script, and before I got it fixed, I <br>
said, "Forget LaTeX right now. I have 500 pages of theorems I have to <br>
implement, and if I can't make it all work, then it's worthless to make <br>
something look good that's worthless."</p>
<p>I attach a screen shot. How would it print out with LaTeX? It would look <br>
terrible, I'm sure, but that's not the purpose. If I want to print it, I <br>
can print it out with a regular printer driver. But I read everything in <br>
electronic form, so I always need a tree view, and Sidekick gives me <br>
that in jEdit.</p>
