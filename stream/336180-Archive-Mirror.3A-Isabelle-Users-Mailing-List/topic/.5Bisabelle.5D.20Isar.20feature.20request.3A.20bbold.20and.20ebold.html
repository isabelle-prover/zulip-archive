<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>For subscripts I never use \&lt;^bsub&gt; and \&lt;^esub&gt;. They don't work on <br>
Cygwin anyway, and I'm too lazy to fire up the VirtualBox Linux to find <br>
out if that's true in Linux.</p>
<p>It actually turns out for the better, because subscripting more than two <br>
letters is to be minimized, which means I only normally use two \&lt;...&gt; <br>
commands anyway, plus \&lt;^isub&gt; works everywhere, and "-_" is easier to type.</p>
<p>However, I am now using \&lt;^bold&gt; in the notes of my comments, or in <br>
section headings. To move fast, I'm writing notes using the Isar \&lt;...&gt; <br>
symbols to get some better formatting in jEdit, which make my notes more <br>
readable for me.</p>
<p>Consider this heading:</p>
<p>section{*\&lt;paragraph&gt; T\&lt;^bold&gt;h\&lt;^bold&gt;e <br>
\&lt;^bold&gt;A\&lt;^bold&gt;x\&lt;^bold&gt;i\&lt;^bold&gt;o\&lt;^bold&gt;m \&lt;^bold&gt;o\&lt;^bold&gt;f <br>
\&lt;^bold&gt;E\&lt;^bold&gt;x\&lt;^bold&gt;t\&lt;^bold&gt;e\&lt;^bold&gt;n\&lt;^bold&gt;s\&lt;^bold&gt;i\&lt;^bold&gt;o\&lt;^bold&gt;n <br>
\&lt;paragraph&gt;*}</p>
<p>That says, "The Axiom of Extension". The bold makes it stand out when <br>
I'm scrolling down through a THY, but the additional characters make it <br>
hard to read in the Sidekick panel.</p>
<p>At this very moment, I have a bulleted list, and I would like the first <br>
phrase of my bulleted item to be bold. To do that, I have to go into my <br>
other editor, go to the line, highlight the text, and use a script to <br>
put a \&lt;^bold&gt; in front of every letter.</p>
<p>It's just an idea, this \&lt;^bbold&gt; and \&lt;^ebold&gt;. Wants are insatiable. <br>
Editors which already have lots of features are very tolerable.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>Actually, the Isabelle symbols where never meant to be used in informal <br>
text, only in formal one.  Normally you do document markup in LaTeX, where <br>
you would use \textbf{...} as usual.  This does not mean there could not <br>
be any reforms, but how long it will take is unspecified.</p>
<p>Just last week I was preparing some slides in Isabelle, and found the <br>
traditional latex batch-run quite cumbersome, so the obvious thing is to <br>
renovate the HTML presentation instead and make it render on the spot in <br>
real-time in Isabelle/jEdit (lets say in some Preview panel).</p>
<p>My main concern at the moment is to find good in-text representation of <br>
list environments; bold, emphasize, or even text colors would be obvious <br>
extensions.  Apart from implementation efforts, an open question is how to <br>
spell this out in the source text.  Maybe a reduced version of Markdown? <br>
But the whole thing needs to be conservative over the embedded LaTeX in <br>
Isabelle theories.</p>
<p>Ultimately, jEdit is a simple texteditor, so questions remain how far it <br>
can be stretched without breaking down.</p>

<p>Markarius,</p>
<p>So it works after  all. That's what it's doing.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip.</p>

<p>So in that case, I appeal to formal use only, such as \&lt;^ibold&gt; to <br>
signify that a variable is a vector. We all know how we'd be in a world <br>
of hurt without vectors, and how a vector is represented either with an <br>
overhead arrow, or with bold.</p>
<p>I say more about LaTeX markup vs. jEdit markup in the other reply.</p>

<p>I reduce my requests. The commands \&lt;^iitalic&gt; and \&lt;^ibold&gt;, that's all <br>
I'm asking for now. I address the italic issue in the other reply.</p>

<p>You may have read my other email by now, but I make my argument again.</p>

<p>It's purely to have another option for me to mark up a THY so that it's <br>
more readable for me. I spin here the "educational use of Isabelle like <br>
that of Mathematica". When THYs can be marked up to be very readable in <br>
their own right, then there's the possibility of passing around THY <br>
files in an educational setting, although that's not the purpose of my <br>
request.</p>
<p>I just want to be able to read the mathematics that I'm writing in <br>
jEdit, without having to resort to LaTeX. At a certain point, the <br>
technical hassles can kill your inspiration.</p>
<p>I don't know how important it would be for me to italicize variables so <br>
that they have a traditional look in jEdit. If all you have to do is add <br>
\&lt;iitalic&gt; in the identifier specification and in one ML file, it's my <br>
opinion that wouldn't be an unacceptable expansion of Isar, but that's <br>
me, and you didn't ask my opinion.</p>
