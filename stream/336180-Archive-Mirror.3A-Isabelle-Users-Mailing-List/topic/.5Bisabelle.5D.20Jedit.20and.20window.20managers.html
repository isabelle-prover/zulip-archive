Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm one of those masochists that use a tiling window manager and have had issues making<br>
Isabelle/jedit unusable that have been discussed on this list previously. I've been languishing in<br>
Proof General land for a while and today I inadvertently opened Isabelle/jedit to discover my<br>
previous GUI show stoppers are gone. In particular, if you full screen jedit (F11) in a tiling<br>
window manager the cursor alignment issues also seem resolved.</p>
<p>I don't know which Isabelle version bump was the cure and I suspect it was just a JRE increment, but<br>
I just wanted to nudge anyone else in the same limbo to give Isabelle/jedit another try on the<br>
latest release.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Matt</p>
<p>P.S. Many thanks to David Greenaway for causing me to re-evaluate and realise this.</p>

<p>Nothing of that is speficic to Isabelle/jEdit or jEdit.  These are general <br>
problems of AWT/Swing versus X11 window managers, and major projects like <br>
Netbeans, IntelliJ, Minecraft have the same problems with 50% of Linux <br>
installations.</p>
<p>Oracle is doing evasive maneuvers occasionally, so whenever there is a <br>
change it is due to the JDK version.  In Isabelle2013-2 that is jdk-7u40, <br>
which is generally a very good one: it works very well on Windows and Mac <br>
OS X (even with Retina), and quite reasonably on more than 50% of Linuxes.</p>
<p>Anybody who feels like helping Oracle to make things better can <br>
participate in the ongoing testing of jdk-8, see also <br>

<p>After installing it somewhere, the Isabelle settings environment needs to <br>
be informed about it, e.g. like this for Mac OS X (in <br>
$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/settings):</p>
<p>ISABELLE_JDK_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0.jdk/Contents/Home"</p>

<p>Re-evaluation of Isabelle/jEdit is very important for every Isabelle <br>
release.  Since the first public version in Isabelle2011-1 (October 2011), <br>
every following release step was so steep that I've got complaints from <br>
Isabelle/jEdit users that they have to learn so many new things.</p>

Are you saying that there are principal deficiencies with (some) Linux  <br>
versions or does it only concern  SWING in older JDKs on Linux?<br>

The problem is AWT + various X11 window managers (i.e. normally on Linux); <br>
Swing is on top of AWT.  The situation for Java &lt;= 6 is rather bad, but <br>
much better for Java 7 or 8.</p>
<p>E.g. see the OpenJDK discussion <br>
<a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/awt-dev/2012-April/002556.html">http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/awt-dev/2012-April/002556.html</a> <br>
which was prompted by yet another fork of some well-known Linux desktop <br>
environment. Whenever that happens there is one more "choice" of Linux <br>
diversity (i.e. more chaos), and one more step away from Linux as serious <br>
desktop OS.</p>
<p>To some extent, recent JDK 7 and 8 have managed to catch up with various <br>
window managers, and some others like xmonad have become more flexible to <br>
actually support AWT.  Compared to Windows and Mac OS X, that is all still <br>
a bit fragile, though.  I am increasingly estranged from my home platform.</p>
