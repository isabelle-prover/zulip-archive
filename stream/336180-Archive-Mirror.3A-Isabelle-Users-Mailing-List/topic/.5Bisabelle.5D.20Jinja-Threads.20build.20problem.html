Finally, I broke down the problem to a strange behaviour of<br>
Proof-General:</p>
<p>Take the following minimal example:<br>
  theory A<br>
  imports Main  <br>
  begin<br>
    ML_val {*<br>
      tracing "Looping ...";<br>
      fun f a = f a;<br>
      f 1<br>
      *}<br>
  end</p>
<p>theory B imports A<br>
  begin</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Then use PG to load theory B. It will happily do so, ignoring that the<br>
ML_val command is still running. Actually, the ML_val command is<br>
started, and still running when PG displays the theory as processed.</p>
<p>However, when loading the theory A with PG, it gets stuck at the ML_val<br>
command as expected.</p>
<p>What has happened here? Is this a problem of PG, or of some<br>
Isabelle-stuff used elsewhere (As PG does not do loading of required<br>
theories itself, I suspect the problem lies somewhere in Isabelle)</p>
<p>This raises another question about the semantics of ML_val:<br>
  Is a theory correct, where some ML-val command diverges?</p>

<p>ML_val is a diagnostic command and these get forked by default, just like <br>
proofs.  Non-termination and errors need to be exposed by a proper join in <br>
the right place by the system, but this was actually broken for TTY / <br>
Proof General, which is in some sense legacy for quite some time already.</p>
<p>In Isabelle2013-1-RC4 I've addressed this issue, such that it works like <br>
the standard batch build or the document model of Isabelle/Scala/jEdit.</p>
<p>Remaining users of Proof General should take a very close look at <br>
Isabelle2013-1-RC4.  There has been significantly less testing of the old <br>
TTY mode, due to constantly decreasing numbers of every day users.  I use <br>
myself Proof General mainly for "ispell", and only until I've found some <br>
time to activate spell-checking in jEdit properly.</p>

<p>Here you are on the bare TTY loop, and that does not fork diagnostic <br>
commands.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Formally yes, since there is no connection of the diagnostic command to <br>
the thm values derived from the LCF kernel.</p>
<p>Practically no, since all the forks of a theory body should be properly <br>
joined.  This is an important computational aspect outside of the logic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The diverging ML_val command was introduced by my changes, that<br>
accidently produced a code equation of the form "f a b = f a b"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Isabelle/jEdit you see non-terminating commands as dark-violet areas in <br>
the Theories panel, or the individual buffer overview (right column next <br>
to text area).</p>
<p>What is still missing is some kind of "Status panel" to make a summary of <br>
the whole session, similar to what isabelle build does in batch mode to <br>
wrap up in the very end.</p>
