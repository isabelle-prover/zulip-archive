Journal of Automated Reasoning</p>
<p>Special issue on the POPLmark Challenge</p>
<p>Call for Papers</p>
<p>How close are we to a world in which mechanically verified software is<br>
commonplace? A world in which theorem proving technology is used<br>
routinely by both software developers and programming language<br>
researchers alike? One crucial step towards achieving these goals is<br>
mechanized reasoning about language metatheory.  Researchers in<br>
programming languages have long felt the need for tools to help<br>
formalize and check their work. With advances in language technology<br>
demanding deep understanding of ever larger and more complex<br>
languages, this need has become urgent.</p>
<p>In 2005, a group of programming language researchers at Penn and<br>
Cambridge issued "The POPLmark challenge": a set of challenge problems<br>
aimed at the programming language and theorem proving community to<br>
gauge progress in mechanizing programming language metatheory. The<br>
solutions to this challenge have been gathered at</p>
<p><a href="http://plclub.org/mmm/">http://plclub.org/mmm/</a></p>
<p>The goal of the special issue is a retrospective on the POPLmark<br>
challenge, summarizing and analyzing what has been learned.</p>
<p>Submissions are encouraged, but not limited to, the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Complete, polished descriptions of specific POPLmark solutions,<br>
   including well-commented proof scripts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis and comparison of solutions to the POPLmark challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Descriptions and code for proof assistant extensions/libraries<br>
   developed explicitly for the purpose of programming language<br>
   metatheory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New formalization techniques, especially with respect to binding<br>
   issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposals for new challenge problems that benchmark programming<br>
   language work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Manuscripts should be unpublished works and not submitted<br>
elsewhere. Revised and enhanced versions of papers published in<br>
conference proceedings that have not appeared in archival journals<br>
are eligible for submission. All submissions will be reviewed<br>
according to the usual standards of scholarship and originality.</p>
<p>Submissions are due June 15, 2009. We will keep a tight review<br>
schedule to enable publication of the special issue by mid<br>
2010. Papers that do not progress through the reviewing cycle in a<br>
timely manner may be published in a later issue.</p>
<p>Papers should be in pdf format following the JAR guidelines for<br>
authors. We encourage authors to keep their submissions below 30<br>
pages. Authors should submit their papers electronically to<br>
<a href="mailto:sweirich@cis.upenn.edu">sweirich@cis.upenn.edu</a>.</p>
