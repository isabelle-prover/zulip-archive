<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Greetings,</p>
<p>The previously stated suboptimal, non-response-non-feedback formality <br>
applies; a very scary formality under unknown circumstances, before the <br>
knowns become known; a formality not to be fully formally stated more <br>
than once every 6 months, or at least not twice within a week, even at <br>
the expense of being ambiguous.</p>
<p>If I'm covering info already covered, I apologize more than those who <br>
apologize for the possibility of sending out duplicate notices for calls <br>
for submissions.</p>
<p>This is just a report that I get an error for a session run that I don't <br>
get in the PIDE.</p>
<p>The following outer syntax command causes an error in the session run, <br>
but not in the PIDE:</p>
<p>FOOBAR\&lt;open&gt;test\&lt;close&gt;\&lt;open&gt;test\&lt;close&gt;</p>
<p>If a space is put between the two commands '\&lt;close&gt;\&lt;open&gt;', then there <br>
is no error, or if quotes are used instead of cartouche delimiters.</p>
<p>I include the example theory and outer syntax command below. A small <br>
image is attached showing the failure in the session run.</p>

<p>Makarius,</p>
<p>Part of its meaning was to say that I won't respond back to anyone who <br>
responds back to me. But to show respect, among other reasons, such a <br>
rule should be applied with discretion.</p>
<p>There are jokes to be made, but all this is no joking matter. It is also <br>
an example of a problem where there is no good solution. The purpose of <br>
a "bug tracking" system would be narrowly defined, but this is a forum, <br>
and a forum is about engaging with people as humans. (Note: As to "bug <br>
tracking" systems, though I don't agree with how you dealt with a <br>
particular event, your philosophy sounds reasonable to me. In the end, <br>
though, apart from this, I consider "things" like that to be "Isabelle <br>
internal politics", and not for me to be concerned with.)</p>
<p>First, I just state another rule of mine about how I operate on the web, <br>
where I consider this as part of the web. My rule is not to engage with <br>
people privately who aren't personal friends. If something starts in <br>
public, I make a point of keeping it in public.</p>
<p>There's this problem that I want to protect my technical interests, by <br>
reporting problems, but the traffic is light here, and so I can end up <br>
creating a big footprint here. I do want a footprint on the web, but I <br>
don't want one here. I do searches on the isabelle-user's page, and <br>
there I am, showing up way too much.</p>
<p>Stating a formality was maybe the third iteration of trying to solve <br>
this problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isabelle outer syntax is normally written with a bit more space, e.g. <br>
like this:</p>
<p>FOOBAR \&lt;open&gt;test\&lt;close&gt; \&lt;open&gt;test\&lt;close&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us consider that your time is more valuable than mine.</p>
<p>You tell me how to do things, but then I don't do it your way. At this <br>
point, it has already been a waste of your time to read this, and the <br>
last two sentences.</p>
<p>When you can see my ideas as a whole, then it won't be a waste of your <br>
time to tell me how I should do things. In a just a few minutes, you'll <br>
you be able to say, "Yea, there's a few good ideas here, I see why <br>
you're having to do things different", or, "This is worthless, there's <br>
no good reason for you to be doing things different.".</p>
<p>The use of no space would be specific to using "FOOBAR" as a <br>
text-text-argument markup tag, in a way that's meant to take up as <br>
little space as possible. As to two-arg outer syntax tags, there is also <br>
text-term and term-text. Below, I say that new additions to releases <br>
eliminate any special needs.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>And this would be in line with how I think I should operate sometimes, <br>
that problems like these have been taken care of, or will eventually get <br>
taken care of, so there's no need for me to get involved. But then the <br>
flip-side-analogy is 10 people getting served, who came in after me; I <br>
assume I'll get served, but I don't, because they lost my order.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I continue to welcome new additions, and I see the addition of  <br>
\&lt;^verbatim&gt; and \&lt;^emph&gt;.</p>
<p>I try to build on what others have done, so to the extent that the new <br>
features line up with what I think I need, or to the extent that they <br>
only can be used in one way, I use them the normal way. To your chagrin, <br>
I may use them differently.</p>
<p>What I do shouldn't undermine anything. For me, it's the real deal. For <br>
others, I hope to make it a demo of what could be done, most likely in a <br>
more sophisticated way.</p>
<p>I end this mentioning three "features", some outer syntax commands that <br>
get interpreted as LaTeX newtheorem environments, where the source that <br>
follows is put in a fancyverb environment with line numbers, directly <br>
underneath the newtheorem title. The 3rd feature would be "subtle" <br>
syntax that gets interpreted as a very specific LaTeX equation environment.</p>
<p>I ask, "Do these features exist?", and, "If they don't, should you make <br>
implementing them a priority just for me?"</p>
<p>The answers are no and no. What I want is more textbook style. What you <br>
guys needs is more journal style.</p>
<p>I could explain what my ideas are for the two-text argument of FOOBAR <br>
above, as a tag, but it would be a waste of your time. If I ever produce <br>
something, it'll already have been superseded by a new feature, or <br>
you'll very quickly be able to look see at what might interest you.</p>
<p>New features sometimes eliminate a need for what I've done, but <br>
sometimes they don't. Given enough time, anything I've done, you'll have <br>
done better, but I have to commit now.</p>
<p>With all due respect, I don't respond to those who respond back to me.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
There is already a "tag" feature that allows to wrap Isabelle document <br>
commands (like 'text') or other formal command (e.g. proof commands) in a <br>
LaTeX environment.</p>
<p>An example can be seen here:<br>

<p>Maybe that is already sufficient to implement all 3 points above.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Markarius,</p>
<p>I suppose I should finish what I started, which requires that I attempt <br>
to explain some of my ideas.</p>
<p>I attach two images which show what I did the first year in 2012, when I <br>
implemented about 9 ZFC axioms based on Obua's THY. The particular image <br>
shows work on permutative rewrite rules. T.Nipkow tipped me off about <br>
those. As to the words in the image, don't pay too much attention to <br>
that. I say more about the images below.</p>
<p>Thanks for the links. I opened the document. I'll use some of it to <br>
argue that we're not in sync as to our current vision of what the <br>
internals of a THY should look like.</p>
<p>(NOTE: At line 564 all I see special is '%mlex'. You might mean that <br>
commands are available to tie into the low-level machinery. If that's <br>
what you mean, I don't know how much that helps me. Using machinery can <br>
require getting educated about the machinery. It's much easier to get <br>
educated about things like parsing with PEG.js and Node.js, than it is <br>
to get educated about Isabelle machinery. What I say below may reflect <br>
that I didn't get your drift, but I think we're still at odds.)</p>
<p>First, by all appearances, you prioritize according to what want. With <br>
syntax, what's not there must reflect your own personal preferences.</p>
<p>Now, I state two opinions:</p>
<p>1) A TeX file, full of LaTeX commands, isn't readable.</p>
<p>2) When a THY is marked up heavily in LaTeX, the THY isn't readable.</p>
<p>3) Should I go further? Isar commands, such as 'subsubsection', which <br>
are fashioned after the corresponding LaTeX commands, contribute nothing <br>
to readability, and in fact, hinder readability, just like LaTeX.</p>
<p>This is not criticism on my part. It's a reflection of what has been <br>
important to you, given that you prioritize according to what you want.</p>
<p>My goal? Eliminate all use of LaTeX from THY documents (other than a few <br>
infrequently used commands), and moreover, eliminate "verbose" Isar <br>
commands that distract from readability.</p>
<p>Here's a LaTeX command from ML.thy: \begin{verbatim}</p>
<p>A LaTeX verbatim command like that will never be in my THY. In my THY, <br>
verbatim environment markup never has to be used, except for the few <br>
places outside of a newtheorem environment, and there the syntax is <br>
reasonably subtle.</p>
<p>You say, "Maybe that is already sufficient to implement all 3 points <br>
above. " No. (SEE NOTE ABOVE)</p>
<p>My markup "tags" are outer syntax definitions. They wrap what they're <br>
supposed to mark up, and nothing wraps the markup tags, because wrapping <br>
requires additional characters and symbols. What I have as outer syntax <br>
may also sometimes be used in textual exposition, where, of course, it's <br>
text, though still markup, but that's not wrapping, that's using tags in <br>
text. (SEE NOTE ABOVE)</p>
<p><em>EXPLAINING THE FOOBAR COMMAND</em></p>
<p>Defining too many outer syntax commands is no good, so my FOOBAR was a <br>
general purpose text-text command, one use being a LaTeX equation <br>
environment. Everything is subject to further change, but I show its <br>
use, where the period represents \&lt;cdot&gt;, and "&lt;" and "&gt;" represent <br>
cartouche delimiters.</p>
<p>.&lt;x + y = z + w<br>
           = m + y<br>
           = q + r&gt;&lt;eq.jkl1608&gt;</p>
<p>The alignment of the '=' symbols may get lost.</p>
<p>I will parse that equation into a LaTeX environment, inserting <br>
end-of-lines, and whatever else is necessary. The '\&lt;open&gt;eq\&lt;cdot&gt;' is <br>
the part of the tag that tells me it's an equation environment. It's <br>
possible, given the numerous types of LaTeX equation environments, I <br>
might want 'e1', 'e2', etc. to represent other kinds of environments.</p>
<p>I could change 'eq' to 'q', but the '\label', 'jkl1608',is most of the <br>
clutter, so there's no reason to save one letter.</p>
<p>If all my syntax is defined, I can also have a term-text command, so <br>
that my formula is an active term, rather than just text.</p>
<p><em>IMAGES, MORE IMAGES</em></p>
<p>In 2012 and 2013 I developed my funky markup language, with just a <br>
little knowledge of regular expressions. Since then, the words "parsing" <br>
and "grammars" sunk in to my conscientious. It's the result of being <br>
exposed to the talk of computer scientists, who deal in languages.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get back to where I was, but with much cleaner syntax. <br>
It'll take me six months to a year to get there, because I'm also trying <br>
to work on getting some number systems, vectors, and boolean logic done.</p>
<p>The first image is my funky markup, in the THY, which is fairly <br>
readable. The second image shows my PDF. These things involve personal <br>
preference, but I like how my PDF looks.</p>
<p>I've moved on, on some things, but it formed the basis of some things. I <br>
can't converge back, from the divergence. I'm too deep in. What's most <br>
important is that I actually finish something.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB<br>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Makarius,</p>
<p>This email is to finish things up before I send in another email, about <br>
the big problems with RC1.</p>
<p>My game has changed, so I installed. I don't do proof with Isabelle <br>
anymore, so my need for help will be near zero.</p>
<p>I only do programming with Isabelle. The right foundation has to be <br>
laid, and programming is part of the foundation; there's not enough time <br>
to do both.</p>
<p>The first part is to you. The rest is just me talking.</p>
<p>I jumped to conclusions about <code>\&lt;^emph&gt;</code>, but the associated symbol for <br>
the command is good. Not having true italics is no big loss, but not <br>
having a true bold font would be a really big loss.</p>
<p>The extra bullet symbols are good.</p>
<p>I got everything converted that's important.</p>
<p>You switched the way Windows paths work, but I found those problems when <br>
you put out a test release last year. Here's how I now have to set <br>
USER_HOME to be able to change my home folder:</p>
<p>set USER_HOME=/cygdrive/e/D_1/w rk/g_d/gezz</p>
<p>I had some ML in between {<em>...</em>}, which allowed me to not having <br>
matching cartouches. Using 'isabelle build' wouldn't allow that. Now I <br>
have a dummy right cartouche like this:</p>
<p>val split1 = IsE.split_symS_delim_to_snd "\&lt;open&gt;" setup1; val _ = <br>
"\&lt;close&gt;"</p>
<p>I tell you that to let you know that all the programming commands I've <br>
implemented are all dependent on the cartouche delimiters.</p>
<p><em>BAD PROBLEMS</em></p>
<p>I'll send in a different email about the bad problems. There's been some <br>
bad process runaway, a blue screen of death, and bad hanging for the <br>
64-bit Windows version.</p>
<p><em>FRONT END MATH</em></p>
<p>I've been driven by a simple number theory problem, where the proof was <br>
based on manipulating base ten digits.</p>
<p>The long story is too long, but here's a good book:</p>
<p>Computer Arithmetic and Verilog HDL, by Cavanagh</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Computer-Arithmetic-and-Verilog-HDL-Fundamentals/Cavanagh/9781439811245">https://www.crcpress.com/Computer-Arithmetic-and-Verilog-HDL-Fundamentals/Cavanagh/9781439811245</a></p>
<p>That was supposed to give me the model for computer arithmetic in <br>
Isabelle/HOL, for number systems.</p>
<p>In my mind, I just break up a decimal number as a sum of digits, <br>
multiplied by the appropriate power. In Isabelle/HOL, it's not simple at <br>
all, because all the basic groundwork isn't there. It seems true types <br>
for at least bases 3, 5, 7, and 10 should be there.</p>
<p>Now, take a standard function, "f:A --&gt; B", where A and B are elements <br>
of the power set of the natural numbers. How do you easily state A and B <br>
as your domain and codomain in HOL?</p>
<p>You don't, not easily. It could be reasonably easy, but right now it's <br>
not. Part of the problem is just a "syntax feature problem". It's not a <br>
logic problem.</p>
<p>Nothing in all this is a problem with the software. The software is <br>
powerful enough, if people are flexible and will fill in all the gaps.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

Have you tried Isabelle2016-RC0 already?</p>
<p>It provides many new things concerning document markup and markdown. Very <br>
few LaTeX macros are remaining. Since you are using creative add-ons to <br>
Isabelle document preparation, there is also a chance that something stops <br>
working.</p>
<p>Now is still a chance to work it out.  Later in the release process, <br>
further changes will be less likely.</p>
