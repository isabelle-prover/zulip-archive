<p>From: John Harrison &lt;<a href="mailto:John.Harrison@cl.cam.ac.uk">John.Harrison@cl.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Apologies if you've already got this, but I didn't see an announcement<br>
on the HOL or Isabelle lists, so it seemed worth repeating it. Note that<br>
one of the categories explicitly mentioned is "automated reasoning".</p>

<p>KURT GOEDEL CENTENARY RESEARCH PRIZE FELLOWSHIPS</p>
<p>The Kurt Goedel Society is proud to announce the commencement of the<br>
research fellowship prize program in honor of the celebration of Kurt<br>
Goedel's 100th birthday.</p>
<p>The research fellowship prize program is sponsored by the John<br>
Templeton Foundation and will offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>two Ph.D. (pre-doctoral) fellowships of $60,000 US per annum for two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two post-doctoral fellowships of $80,000 US per annum for two years and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one senior fellowship of $120,000 US per annum for one year based on an<br>
   international open competition, resulting in the publication of research <br>
   papers in a special issue of a premier journal in mathematical logic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following International Board of Jurors will be in charge of<br>
evaluating the applications:</p>
<p>Peter ACZEL, University of Manchester (GB)<br>
Lev BEKLEMISHEV, Russian Academy of Sciences (RUS)<br>
John BURGESS, Princeton University (USA)<br>
Harvey FRIEDMAN, Ohio State University (USA) CHAIR<br>
John HARRISON, Intel Corporation (USA)<br>
Wilfried HODGES, Queen Mary University of London (GB)<br>
Simon KOCHEN, Princeton University (USA)<br>
Jan KRAJICEK, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic (CZ)<br>
Menachem MAGIDOR, Hebrew University (ISRAEL)<br>
Dave MARKER, University of Illinois at Chicago (USA)<br>
Michel PARIGOT, Universite Paris 7 (FRANCE)<br>
Pavel PUDLAK, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic (CZ)<br>
Hilary PUTNAM, Harvard University (USA)<br>
Jeff REMMEL,University of California at San Diego (USA)<br>
John STEEL, University of California at Berkley (USA)<br>
Frank STEPHAN, National University of Singapore (SINGAPORE)<br>
Albert VISSER, University of Utrecht (NL)</p>
<p>Goal and Criteria of Merit</p>
<p>The purpose of these fellowships is to support original research in,<br>
and areas surrounding, the foundations of mathematics. (See Scope<br>
below for more details.) These fellowships are intended to carry<br>
forward the legacy of Kurt Goedel, whose works exemplify deep insights<br>
and breakthrough discoveries in mathematical logic, with profound<br>
impact on the philosophy and foundations of mathematics. In pursuit of<br>
similar insights and discoveries, we adopt the following criteria of<br>
merit for evaluating Fellowship applications:</p>
<p>1. Intellectual merit, scientific rigor and originality of the<br>
   submitted paper and work plan. The paper and research plans should<br>
   combine visionary thinking with academic and scientific excellence.</p>
<p>2. Potential for significant contribution to basic fundamental<br>
   issues of wide interest, and the likelihood for opening new,<br>
   seminal lines of inquiry that bear on such issues.</p>
<p>3. Impact of the Fellowship on the project and likelihood that the<br>
   Fellowship will make the proposed new lines of research possible.</p>
<p>4. The expectation that the proposed research will be successful.</p>
<p>5. Qualifications of the applicants will be evaluated on the basis<br>
   of all available information including CV, research paper, research<br>
   plans, research accomplishments, and letters of recommendation<br>
   (recommendation letters are not required for senior applications).</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>Original fellowship proposals in the areas of</p>
<p>* model theory<br>
    * proof theory<br>
    * recursion theory<br>
    * set theory<br>
    * foundations of mathematics<br>
    * philosophy of mathematics<br>
    * foundations of computer science (related to logic)<br>
    * automated reasoning (related to logic)<br>
    * complexity (related to logic)</p>
<p>All fellowship proposals, regardless of subject area, will be judged<br>
according to</p>
<p>* the relevance and resemblance of the research (finished and<br>
      proposed) to the great insights and originality of Kurt Goedel</p>
<p>* its general interest and clarity of motivation<br>
    * its rigorous scientific quality and depth.</p>
