<p>Theme of Conference:</p>
<hr>
<p>Safety critical systems represent an ever-increasing problem domain,<br>
challenging verification techniques to catch up. Within the field of<br>
aeronautics alone, we find the need for verification of algorithms for<br>
separation assurance, air traffic control, auto-pilot, Unmanned Aerial<br>
Vehicles (UAVs), adaptive avionics, automated decision authority, and<br>
much more. Recent advances in formal methods have made verifying more of<br>
these problems realistic. Thus we need to continually re-assess what we<br>
can solve now and identify the next barriers to overcome. Only through<br>
an exchange of ideas between theoreticians and practitioners from<br>
academia to industry can we extend formal methods for the verification<br>
of ever more challenging problem domains.</p>
<p>The goal of this workshop on formal methods for verification is to<br>
examine formal verification techniques, their theory, application areas,<br>
current capabilities, and limitations. This format is designed to<br>
introduce researchers, graduate students, and partners in industry to<br>
those topics that are of fundamental interest and importance, to survey<br>
current research, and to discuss major unsolved problems and directions<br>
for future research.</p>
<p>The meeting will be comprised of invited talks covering the major<br>
research areas, and more specialized contributed talks, including<br>
student talks. Contributed talks will consist of 30-minute research<br>
expositions providing state-of-the-art information on recent<br>
developments related to formal methods, and a number of 15-minute talks<br>
on current research given by undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<hr>
<p>Topics of Interest:</p>
<hr>
<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>* advances in formal verification techniques<br>
    * formal models of distributed computing<br>
    * planning and scheduling<br>
    * automated air traffic management<br>
    * fault tolerance<br>
    * hybrid systems/hybrid automata<br>
    * embedded systems<br>
    * safety critical applications<br>
    * safety cases<br>
    * accident/safety analysis</p>
<hr>
<p>Invited Tutorials:</p>
<hr>
<p>* Gerard J. Holzmann (NASA JPL) - On Limits<br>
    * John Rushby (SRI) - Formal Methods and Certification<br>
    * Moshe Y. Vardi (Rice University) - From Philosophical to<br>
Industrial Logics</p>
<hr>
<p>Submissions:</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two categories of submissions:</p>
<p>* Regular Talks. These talks will be 30 minutes in length, including<br>
questions.</p>
<p>* Student Talks. These talks will be 15 minutes in length, including<br>
questions.</p>
<p>Both categories of talks will be selected from the abstracts submitted<br>
to the LFM 2008 web site.</p>
<hr>
<p>Location and Cost:</p>
<hr>
<p>The workshop will take place at the Marriott Hotel, City Center at<br>
Oyster Point, Newport News, Virginia, USA. Information on hotel block<br>
reservations and travel are located on the LFM 2008 web site. Note that<br>
hotel reservations at the special block rate must be made on or before<br>
30 March 2008.</p>
<p>There will be no registration fee charged to participants. All<br>
interested individuals, including non-US citizens, are welcome to<br>
attend, to listen to the talks, and to participate in discussions.<br>
However, all attendees must register. We especially encourage students<br>
and other researchers possibly interested in specializing in formal<br>
methods to attend as this will be a good opportunity to become more<br>
knowledgeable about this area of research.</p>
