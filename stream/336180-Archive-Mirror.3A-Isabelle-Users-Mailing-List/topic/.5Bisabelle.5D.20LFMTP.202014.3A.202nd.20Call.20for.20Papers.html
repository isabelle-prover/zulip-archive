<p>DESCRIPTION: Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common<br>
substrate for representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide<br>
variety of deductive systems of interest in logic and computer<br>
science. Their design and implementation on the one hand and their use<br>
in reasoning tasks ranging from the correctness of software to the<br>
properties of formal computational systems on the other hand have been<br>
the focus of considerable research over the last two decades. This<br>
workshop will bring together designers, implementers, and<br>
practitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure<br>
and utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable<br>
binding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the<br>
expressivity and lucidity of the reasoning process.</p>
<p>TOPICS: LFMTP 2014 will provide researchers a forum to present<br>
state-of-the-art techniques and discuss progress in areas such as the<br>
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming<br>
   languages and related formally specified systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of<br>
   variable binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning<br>
   about, datatypes defined from binding signatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and<br>
   associated reasoning techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New theory contributions: canonical and substructural frameworks,<br>
   contextual frameworks, proof-theoretic foundations supporting binders,<br>
   functional programming over logical frameworks, homotopy type theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of logical frameworks, e.g., in proof-carrying<br>
   architectures such as proof-carrying authorization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Techniques for programming with binders in functional programming<br>
   languages such as Haskell, OCaml, or Agda and logic programming<br>
   languages such as lambda Prolog or Alpha-Prolog.<br>
   with encoding programming languages theory will be particularly<br>
   welcome.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SUBMISSIONS: In addition to regular papers, we also solicit "work in<br>
progress" reports, in a broad sense. Those do not need to report<br>
original or fully polished research results, but should be interesting<br>
for the community at large.</p>
<p>Submitted papers should be in PDF, formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN<br>
style guidelines<br>
(<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates</a>). The<br>
length is restricted to 8 pages, except for "work in progress" papers,<br>
which are restricted to 4 pages.  Submission is via EasyChair<br>
(<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lfmtp2014">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lfmtp2014</a>).</p>
<p>Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their paper at the<br>
workshop.</p>
<p>PROCEEDINGS: Accepted regular papers will be included in the<br>
proceedings, which will be published in the ACM International<br>
Conference Proceedings Series, available in the ACM Digital<br>
Library. Authors are encouraged to publish auxiliary material with<br>
their paper (technical appendixes, source code, scripts, test data,<br>
etc.).</p>
