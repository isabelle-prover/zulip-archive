<p>From: Claudio Sacerdoti Coen &lt;<a href="mailto:claudio.sacerdoticoen@unibo.it">claudio.sacerdoticoen@unibo.it</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Colleagues,<br>
we would like to announce a few changes to the LFMTP 2020 workshop,<br>
that is scheduled to take place on 29th June 2020, co-located with FSCD<br>
and IJCAR this year. </p>
<p>1) LFMTP 2020 will follow FSCD-IJCAR lead to move to an online-only<br>
format for this year. </p>
<p>2) We will now require only a 2-page abstract submission, instead of a<br>
full paper. The abstracts will go through a quick informal review.<br>
Accepted abstracts will be invited for presentation at the workshop.<br>
After the workshop, authors will be invited to submit the full versions<br>
of their submissions for the post proceedings, which will undergo a<br>
proper review.</p>
<p>3) The submission deadline is now extended to 18 May 2020.</p>
<p>The amended call for papers can be found below.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Claudio Sacerdoti-Coen and Alwen Tiu<br>

<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>Logical Frameworks and Meta-Languages: Theory and Practice <br>
LFMTP 2020</p>
<p>Paris, France<br>
29 June 2020</p>
<p>Affiliated with FSCD 2020 and IJCAR 2020</p>
<p><a href="https://lfmtp.org/workshops/2020/">https://lfmtp.org/workshops/2020/</a></p>
<p>Submission deadline: 18 May 2020</p>
<p>ABOUT LFMTP</p>
<p>Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for<br>
representing, implementing and reasoning about a wide variety of<br>
deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their<br>
design, implementation and their use in reasoning tasks, ranging from<br>
the correctness of software to the properties of formal systems, have<br>
been the focus of considerable research over the last two decades. This<br>
workshop will bring together designers, implementors and practitioners<br>
to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and utility of<br>
logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable binding,<br>
inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the expressiveness<br>
and lucidity of the reasoning process.</p>
<p>LFMTP 2020 will provide researchers a forum to present state-of-the-art <br>
techniques and discuss progress in areas such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming<br>
languages, process calculi and related formally specified systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formalisation of model-theoretic and proof-theoretic semantics of<br>
logics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable<br>
binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning about,<br>
datatypes defined from binding signatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and<br>
associated reasoning techniques, including inductive types of higher<br>
dimension in homotopy type theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Graphical languages for building proofs and their applications in<br>
geometry, equational reasoning and category theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New theory contributions: canonical and substructural frameworks,<br>
contextual frameworks, proof-theoretic foundations supporting binders,<br>
functional programming over logical frameworks, homotopy and cubical<br>
type theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of logical frameworks: proof-carrying architectures,<br>
proof exchange and transformation, program refactoring, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Techniques for programming with binders in functional programming<br>
languages such as Haskell, OCaml or Agda, and logic programming<br>
languages such as lambda Prolog or Alpha-Prolog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design and implementation of systems and tools related to meta-<br>
languages and logical frameworks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>All deadlines are established as the end of day (23:59) AoE.</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission deadline:          18 May 2020 </li>
<li>Notification to authors:       1 June 2020 </li>
<li>Workshop:                     29 June  2020</li>
</ul>
<p>SUBMISSION INFORMATION</p>
<p>We solicit submissions of long abstracts describing original research<br>
results or descriptions of work in progress. The topics of the<br>
submissions should be of interest to the LFMTP community at large. </p>
<p>Submitted papers should be in PDF, formatted using the EPTCS LaTeX<br>
style. The length is restricted to 2 pages.</p>
<p>Submission is via EasyChair: <br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=lfmtp2020">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=lfmtp2020</a> </p>
<p>All submissions will undergo a light peer-review process and the<br>
authors of those accepted will be invited to present their papers at<br>
the workshop.</p>
<p>POST-PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>After the workshop we will publish post-proceedings in the Electronic<br>
Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) series. </p>
<p>Authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to submit the full<br>
versions of their papers for publication in the post-proceedings,<br>
subject to another round of review. </p>
