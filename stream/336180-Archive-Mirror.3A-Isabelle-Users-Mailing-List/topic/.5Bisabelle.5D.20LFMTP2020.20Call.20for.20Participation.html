<p>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION</p>
<p>Logical Frameworks and Meta-Languages: Theory and Practice&lt;<a href="https://lfmtp.org/workshops/2020/program.shtml">https://lfmtp.org/workshops/2020/program.shtml</a>&gt;<br>
LFMTP 2020</p>
<p>On-line conference,<br>
==&gt; 29-30 June 2020 &lt;==</p>
<p>Affiliated with  FSCD 2020 and IJCAR 2020&lt;<a href="https://fscd-ijcar-2020.org/">https://fscd-ijcar-2020.org/</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>=====================================</p>
<p>ABOUT LFMTP</p>
<p>Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for representing, implementing and reasoning about a wide variety of deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their design, implementation and their use in reasoning tasks, ranging from the correctness of software to the properties of formal systems, have been the focus of considerable research over the last two decades. This workshop will bring together designers, implementors and practitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the expressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning process.</p>
<p>LFMTP 2020 will provide researchers a forum to present state-of-the-art techniques and discuss progress in areas such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming languages, process calculi and related formally specified systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formalisation of model-theoretic and proof-theoretic semantics of logics.</p>
</li>
