<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br>
================<br>
FCS'09</p>
<p>Workshop on Foundations of Computer Security<br>
<a href="http://www.loria.fr/~cortier/FCS09/">http://www.loria.fr/~cortier/FCS09/</a></p>
<p>August 9-10, 2009, Los Angeles, California, USA<br>
Affiliated with LICS'09.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>
================<br>
Papers due:     April 14 (extended!), 2009<br>
Notification of acceptance:     May 29, 2009<br>
Final papers:   June 30, 2009</p>
<p>SCOPE<br>
======<br>
Computer security is an established field of computer science of both<br>
theoretical and practical significance. In recent years, there has been<br>
increasing interest in logic-based foundations for various methods in<br>
computer security, including the formal specification, analysis and design<br>
of security protocols and their applications, the formal definition<br>
of various aspects of security such as access control mechanisms,<br>
mobile code security and denial-of-service attacks, and the modeling<br>
of information flow and its application to confidentiality policies,<br>
system composition, and covert channel analysis.</p>
<p>The aim of the workshop FCS'09 is to provide a forum for continued<br>
activity in different areas of computer security, bringing computer<br>
security researchers in closer contact with the LICS community and giving<br>
LICS attendees an opportunity to talk to experts in computer security,<br>
on the one hand, and contribute to bridging the gap between logical<br>
methods and computer security foundations, on the other.</p>
<p>We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security<br>
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions<br>
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in<br>
new results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques and<br>
tools for the formal specification and analysis of security protocols. We<br>
thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work (possibly based<br>
on already published material) and on work in progress.</p>
<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Automated reasoning techniques, Composition issues, Formal specification,<br>
Foundations of verification, Information flow analysis, Language-based<br>
security, Logic-based design, Program transformation, Security models,<br>
Static analysis, Statistical methods, Tools, Trust management for Access<br>
control and resource usage control, Authentication, Availability and<br>
denial of service, Covert channels, Confidentiality, Integrity and<br>
privacy, Intrusion detection, Malicious code, Mobile code, Mutual<br>
distrust, Privacy, Security policies, Security protocols</p>
<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must<br>
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION <br>
===========<br>
Submissions should be at most 15 pages (a4paper, 11pt), including<br>
references.  The cover page should include title, names of authors,<br>
co-ordinates of the corresponding author, an abstract, and a list<br>
of keywords. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected<br>
immediately. Additional material intended for the referees but not<br>
for publication in the final version - for example details of proofs -<br>
may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the<br>
page limit.</p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit their papers electronically, as portable<br>
document format (pdf) or postscript (ps); please, do not send files<br>
formatted for work processing packages (e.g., Microsoft Word or<br>
Wordperfect files). The only mechanism for paper submissions is via the<br>
dedicated easychair submission web page.</p>
