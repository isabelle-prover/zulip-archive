<p>DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP</p>
<p>It has been understood since the late 1960s that tools and<br>
structures arising in mathematical logic and proof theory<br>
can usefully be applied to the design of high level programming<br>
languages, and to the development of reasoning principles for<br>
such languages. Yet low level languages, such as machine code,<br>
and the compilation of high level languages into a low level ones<br>
have traditionally been seen as having little or no essential<br>
connection to logic.</p>
<p>However, a fundamental discovery of this past decade has been<br>
that low level languages are also governed by logical principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From this key observation has emerged an active and fascinating<br>
new research area at the frontier of logic and computer science.<br>
The practically motivated design of logics reflecting the structure<br>
of low level languages (such as heaps, registers and code pointers)<br>
and low level properties of programs (such as resource usage)<br>
goes hand in hand with the some of the most advanced contemporary<br>
researches in semantics and proof theory, including classical<br>
realizability and forcing, double orthogonality, parametricity,<br>
linear logic, game semantics, uniformity, categorical semantics,<br>
explicit substitutions, abstract machines, implicit complexity<br>
and sublinear programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LOLA workshop, affiliated with LICS, will bring together<br>
researchers interested in the various aspects of the relationship<br>
between logic and low level languages and programs.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>- Typed assembly languages<br>
     - Certified assembly programming<br>
     - Certified and certifying compilation<br>
     - Proof-carrying code<br>
     - Program optimization<br>
     - Modal logic and realizability in machine code<br>
     - Realizability and double orthogonality in assembly code,<br>
     - Implicit complexity, sublinear programming and Turing machines<br>
     - Parametricity, modules and existential types<br>
     - General references, Kripke models and recursive types<br>
     - Closures and explicit substitutions<br>
     - Linear logic and separation logic<br>
     - Game semantics, abstract machines and hardware synthesis<br>
     - Monoidal and premonoidal categories, traces and effects</p>

     * Xinyu Feng (University of Science and Technology of China)<br>
     * Greg Morrisett (Harvard University)<br>
     * Xavier Rival (INRIA Roquencourt and ENS Paris)<br>
     * Zhong Shao (Yale University, co-chair)<br>

<p>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>LOLA is an informal workshop aiming at a high degree of<br>
useful interaction amongst the participants, welcoming<br>
proposals for talks on work in progress, overviews of larger<br>
programmes, position presentations and short tutorials as well<br>
as more traditional research talks describing new results.</p>
<p>The programme committee will select the workshop presentations<br>
from submitted proposals, which may take the form either of<br>
a short abstract or of a longer (published or unpublished) paper<br>
describing completed work.</p>
<p>The submissions should be made by easychair at<br>
