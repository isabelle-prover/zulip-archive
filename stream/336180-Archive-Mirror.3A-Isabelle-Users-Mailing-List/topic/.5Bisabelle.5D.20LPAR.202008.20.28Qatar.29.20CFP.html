<p>LPAR 2008</p>
<p>15th International Conference on<br>
Logic for<br>
Programming,<br>
Artificial Intelligence and<br>
Reasoning</p>
<p>Doha, Qatar<br>
November 22-27, 2008</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qatar.cmu.edu/lpar08/">http://www.qatar.cmu.edu/lpar08/</a></p>
<p>The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, <br>
Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year <br>
after year, some of the most renowned researchers in the areas of <br>
automated reasoning, computational logic, programming languages and <br>
their applications come to present cutting-edge results, to discuss <br>
advances in these fields, and to exchange ideas in a scientifically <br>
emerging part of the world. The 2008 edition will be held in Doha, <br>
Qatar, on the premises of the Qatar campus of Carnegie Mellon <br>
University.</p>
<p>Logic is a fundamental organizing principle in nearly all areas in <br>
Computer Science. It runs a multifaceted gamut from the foundational <br>
to the applied. At one extreme, it underlies computability and <br>
complexity theory and the formal semantics of programming languages. <br>
At the other, it drives billions of gates every day in the digital <br>
circuits of processors of all kinds. Logic is in itself a powerful <br>
programming paradigm but it is also the quintessential specification <br>
language for anything ranging from real-time critical systems to <br>
networked infrastructures. It is logical techniques that link <br>
implementation and specification through formal methods such as <br>
automated theorem proving and model checking. Logic is also the stuff <br>
of knowledge representation and artificial intelligence. Because of <br>
its ubiquity, logic has acquired a central role in Computer Science <br>
education.</p>
<p>New results in the fields of computational logic and applications are <br>
welcome. Also welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may <br>
examine open questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing <br>
theories and practices. Topics of interest include, but are not <br>
limited to:</p>
<p>* Automated reasoning<br>
     * Interactive theorem proving<br>
     * Implementations of logic<br>
     * Proof assistants<br>
     * Program and system verification<br>
     * Model checking<br>
     * Rewriting and unification<br>
     * Logic programming<br>
     * Constraint programming<br>
     * Logic and databases<br>
     * Modal and temporal logics<br>
     * Proof-carrying code<br>
     * Translation validation<br>
     * Logic for the semantic web<br>
     * Foundations of security<br>
     * Description logics<br>
     * Non-monotonic reasoning<br>
     * Specification using logics<br>
     * Logic in artificial intelligence<br>
     * Lambda calculus<br>
     * Constructive logic and type theory<br>
     * Computional interpretations of logic<br>
     * Logical foundations of programming<br>
     * Logical aspects of concurrency<br>
     * Logic and computational complexity<br>
     * Knowledge representation and reasoning<br>
     * Reasoning about actions<br>
     * Proof planning<br>
     * Effectively presented structures<br>
     * Logic of distributed systems</p>
<p>Invited Speakers</p>
<hr>
<p>It has been a tradition of LPAR to invite some of the most influential <br>
researchers in the focus areas to discuss their work and their vision <br>
for their fields. We are honored that the following members of the <br>
community have accepted this invitation.</p>
<p>* Edmund Clarke, Carnegie Mellon University (USA)</p>
<p>Other invited speakers will be announced soon</p>
<p>Submission Instructions</p>
<hr>
<p>Submissions must not substantially overlap papers that have been <br>
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a <br>
conference with proceedings. Papers should be submitted in Portable <br>
Document Format (PDF); papers submitted in a proprietary word <br>
processor format such as Microsoft Word cannot be considered. <br>
Submissions can be of two types:</p>
<p>* Regular papers are meant to describe solid new research <br>
results. They can be up to 15 pages long in LNCS style, including <br>
figures, bibliography and appendices.</p>
<p>* Short papers are intended to report on interesting work in <br>
progress. They can be at most 5 pages long in the LNCS style.</p>
<p>Papers can be electronically submitted by visiting <br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlpar2008">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlpar2008</a><br>
. Prospective authors are required to register a title and an abstract <br>
a week before the paper submission deadline (see below).</p>
<p>As with the previous editions, the accepted regular papers of LPAR'08 <br>
will be published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in<br>
Computer Science series. They will be available at the conference.</p>
<p>Programme Committe Chairs</p>
<hr>
<p>* Iliano Cervesato (Carnegie Mellon University, Qatar)<br>
     * Helmut Veith (Technische Universit=E4t Darmstadt, Germany)<br>
     * Andrei Voronkov (University of Manchester, UK)</p>
<p>Participation</p>
<hr>
<p>Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of <br>
them will be present at the conference. Papers that do not adhere to <br>
this policy will be removed from the proceedings.</p>
