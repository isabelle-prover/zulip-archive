<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
First of all, as the author of Isabelle/Isar and Isabelle/ML, I claim the <br>
natural authority to determine the name and title of the work.</p>
<p>I do care about such things, and spend a long time thinking and rethinking <br>
what any of the Isabelle/XYZ aspects really are, and if they are used with <br>
proper terminology.  Complexity in the system and its concepts needs to be <br>
kept in check.  Sloppy or obsolete terminology does not help to understand <br>
the true structure of the system, but prevents people discovering how the <br>
system really works (and what great and still explored things may be done <br>
with it).</p>
<p>When I read somethink like "on the ML level of Isabelle/HOL" or "to do <br>
XYZ, I have to go down to the ML level" it sounds very strange and alien <br>
to me, someone speaking about a different system, or a system from a <br>
different era.</p>
<p>Isabelle/ML is not a cold and damp cellar where you go down occasionally <br>
to poke around. Instead it is the main implementation and extension <br>
language of Isabelle, which is fully integrated with the logical <br>
environment and the Prover IDE.  See also <br>
<a href="https://www.lri.fr/~wenzel/Isabelle_Orleans_2012/slides.pdf">https://www.lri.fr/~wenzel/Isabelle_Orleans_2012/slides.pdf</a> how I explain <br>
the languages of Isabelle these days to beginners.  At Edinburgh this <br>
spring, we even started with Isabelle/ML programming first, before doing <br>
any Isabelle/HOL specifications or proofs, or showing how the Isabelle/HOL <br>
code generator allows to go from Isabelle/HOL back to Isabelle/ML again.</p>
<p>Moreover Isabelle/ML is now the most advanced implementation of Standard <br>
ML, with substantial IDE support, efficient parallel programming etc.  It <br>
just happens to ship with a massive theorem proving environment by <br>
default, which is its main application.  (At the bottom, all the hard work <br>
is done by Poly/ML thanks to David Matthews.)</p>
<p>IIRC, the tentative term "ML level of Isabelle" came up when the main mass <br>
of old-style ML tactic scripts were converted into "apply-scripts" in the <br>
Isar source language.  Of course, Isar is much more than a language for <br>
non-ML proof scripts.  You are a user from that pre-Isar era of Isabelle. <br>
Are you still doing ML proof scripts these days?</p>
<p>Since you never got acquainted with Proof General, and its non-ML mode of <br>
scripting, you should try now Isabelle/jEdit.  It allows direct editing of <br>
Isabelle sources (any of its many embedded languages) with direct feedback <br>
in the editor, without the strange locking of the buffer due to Proof <br>
General.  Thus it is closer to old TTY mode, but you no longer have to <br>
manage the prover state in your head as you type.</p>
<p>This is how Isabelle is exposed to the professional user today.  And in <br>
fact, what you see in the front is the jEdit editor framework that uses <br>
Isabelle/Scala to access semantic content provided by the prover.  So the <br>
outermost "layer" of Isabelle2013 happens to be Isabelle/Scala, with <br>
everything else in the background.</p>
<p>Note that the former expression "Isabelle/Scala layer" is no longer used, <br>
since Isabelle/Scala can be accessed from Isabelle/ML already since <br>
Isabelle2011-1, and I hope to get more interconnection of Isabelle/Scala <br>
vs. Isabelle/ML, similar to the way other Isabelle languages may be <br>
embedded into each other. If this is madness, there is method in it ...</p>

<p>The whole thread is rather long - but it includes my words</p>
<p>I think this email thread is getting too long - my first post was of<br>
    stuff that I asserted (and still do) that you can't imagine how to<br>
    do it sensibly other than in Standard ML.</p>
<p>Here's another example, from what I'm doing right now</p>
<p>fun ctxt_tac sg state =<br>
   (atac ORELSE' (resolve_tac (tl ctxt.intrs) THEN' ctxt_tac)) sg state ;</p>
<p>fun perm_msde_tac' sg = FIRST' [ etac keepFD, (* was atac *)<br>
   (resolve_tac [msde.seqs, msde_commas, msde_commas_rev]<br>
     THEN_ALL_NEW perm_msde_tac'),<br>
   rtac refl_msde',<br>
   eresolve_tac msde_commas_empty] sg ;</p>
<p>val perm_msde_tac = (REPEAT o ematch_tac [keepF_thin]) THEN' <br>
perm_msde_tac' ;</p>
<p>In saying that no-one has made any suggestion as to how to do this other <br>
than in Standard ML I should acknowledge that the suggestion has been <br>
made that one can do this and wrap it up in Isar - but my experience - <br>
as described in the email below made this a worst option</p>

<p>(quote)<br>
In fact I'm working on a project now where it is demanded that <br>
everything is in Isar, so I have to try to work in this way.  And it is <br>
incredibly frustrating, because things seem to sometimes work, and <br>
sometimes not, with no apparent reason, seemingly randomly.</p>
<p>Mostly my problems are something do to with theories.  I don't know if <br>
the problems I've faced today are because of theories or not, but I <br>
think it is quite likely.  But I waste an enormous amount of time trying <br>
to cope with things that don't work as expected.  What is a simple job <br>
when I'm doing proofs using "the raw interactive ML toplevel" becomes <br>
slow and frustrating when I try to use Isar as much as possible, while <br>
using ML for the things not available in Isar.<br>

<p>Isabelle/jEdit mainly supports Isabelle theory files, where ML is <br>

theory.</p>
<p>You can also use 'ML_file' in Isar, but the extern file will lack Prover <br>

<p>Definitely not.  Why are you still using Isabelle2005? Because it happens <br>

<p>That is hopeless.  The very idea of Isabelle as I know it since 1993 has <br>

<p>The amount of care has actually increased in recent years -- care about <br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
What you get via theory_of_thm is merely a certificate of the background <br>
theory context of some derived entity.  You should hardly ever access that <br>
in your ML at all (the main exception is to use Thm.cterm_of or <br>
Thm.ctyp_of to re-certify things according to a given certificate).</p>
<p>Historically, the theory of a theorem was at some point used as "the <br>
context", e.g. for parsing or printing.  That has long been replaced by an <br>
explicit proof context of type Proof.context.  If you don't have the <br>
proper context around in your ML function that's bad luck: you must pass <br>
it in as explicit argument.  The system always provides you a proper <br>
context where you need it, and you just pass on what you've got in the <br>
canonical way.</p>
<p>When experimenting with the 'ML' command in Isar, you can use the <br>
antiquotation @{context} to refer to the context of the ML compiler <br>
invocation at that point.  It is important to understand the distinction <br>
between static compile-time and dynamic run-time, though.  I.e. you should <br>
not hardwire some @{context} into your Isabelle/ML, unless it is really <br>
meant to stick to a particular context for later use with proof tools.</p>

For several years already that manual with the internal identifier "ref" <br>
has been called "Old Isabelle Reference Manual", with the following note <br>
at the start:</p>
<p>Note: this document is part of the earlier Isabelle documentation and is<br>
   mostly outdated. Fully obsolete parts of the original text have already<br>
   been removed. The remaining material covers some aspects that did not<br>
   make it into the newer manuals yet.</p>
<p>Going back some years, e.g. to Isabelle2008 there is still a section 1.4, <br>
but it is obsolete for quite a long time already.  In Isabelle2013 that <br>
section is already removed, and in the coming Isabelle2013-1 the whole <br>
"ref" manual will no longer be there.  (At last -- after 5 years of <br>
refurbishing its content for the newer manuals, notably "isar-ref" and <br>
"implementation".)</p>

Makarius,</p>
<p>I'm sorry for the confusion, I thought it was apparent from my earlier <br>
emails that I am using Isabelle2005</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
