The Fourth International Workshop on<br>
            Proof eXchange for Theorem Proving (PxTP)</p>
<p><a href="http://pxtp15.lri.fr/">http://pxtp15.lri.fr/</a></p>
<p>August 2-3, 2015, Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>associated with CADE 2015</p>
<p>Important dates</p>
<p>* Abstract submission: Thu, May 7, 2015<br>
  * Paper submission: Thu, May 14, 2015<br>
  * Notification: Tue, June 16, 2015<br>
  * Camera ready versions due: Thu, June 25, 2015<br>
  * Workshop: August 2-3, 2015</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The PxTP workshop brings together researchers working on various aspects<br>
  of communication, integration, and cooperation between reasoning systems<br>
  and formalisms.</p>
<p>The progress in computer-aided reasoning, both automated and interactive,<br>
  during the past decades, made it possible to build deduction tools that<br>
  are increasingly more applicable to a wider range of problems and are<br>
  able to tackle larger problems progressively faster. In recent years,<br>
  cooperation of such tools in larger verification environments has<br>
  demonstrated the potential to reduce the amount of manual intervention.<br>
  Examples include the Sledgehammer tool providing an interface between<br>
  Isabelle and (untrusted) automated provers, and also collaboration of<br>
  the HOL Light and Isabelle systems in the formal proof of the Kepler<br>
  conjecture.</p>
<p>Cooperation between reasoning systems relies on availability of<br>
  theoretical formalisms and practical tools to exchange problems,<br>
  proofs, and models. The PxTP workshop strives to encourage such<br>
  cooperation by inviting contributions on suitable integration,<br>
  translation and communication methods, standards, protocols,<br>
  and programming interfaces. The workshop welcomes the interested<br>
  developers of automated and interactive theorem proving tools,<br>
  developers of combined systems, developers and users of translation<br>
  tools and interfaces, and producers of standards and protocols.<br>
  We are interested both in success stories and in descriptions<br>
  of the current bottlenecks and proposals for improvement.</p>
<p>Topics</p>
<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of<br>
  cooperation between reasoning tools, whether automatic or<br>
  interactive. More specifically, some suggested topics are:</p>
<p>* applications that integrate reasoning tools (ideally<br>
    with certification of the result);</p>
<p>* translations between logics, proof systems, models;</p>
<p>* distribution of proof obligations among heterogeneous<br>
    reasoning tools;</p>
<p>* algorithms and tools for checking and importing (replaying,<br>
    reconstructing) proofs;</p>
<p>* proposed formats for expressing problems and solutions for<br>
    different classes of logic solvers (SAT, SMT, QBF, first-order<br>
    logic, higher-order logic, typed logic, rewriting, etc.);</p>
<p>* meta-languages, logical frameworks, communication methods,<br>
    standards, protocols, and APIs connected to problems, proofs,<br>
    and models;</p>
<p>* comparison, refactoring, and optimization of proofs;</p>
<p>* practical experiences, case studies, feasibility studies;</p>
<p>* applications relying on importing proofs from automatic theorem<br>
    provers, such as certified static analysis, proof-carrying code,<br>
    or certified compilation;</p>
<p>* data structures and algorithms for improved proof production in<br>
    solvers (e.g., efficient proof representations).</p>
<p>Submissions</p>
<p>Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either<br>
  an extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15<br>
  pages). Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which<br>
  will select a balanced program of high-quality contributions. Short<br>
  submissions that could stimulate fruitful discussion at the workshop<br>
  are particularly welcome. We expect that one author of every accepted<br>
  paper will present their work at the workshop.</p>
<p>Submitted papers should describe previously unpublished work, and must<br>
  be prepared using the LaTeX EPTCS class (<a href="http://style.eptcs.org/">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>).<br>
  Papers will be submitted via EasyChair, at the PxTP'2015 workshop page<br>
  (<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pxtp2015">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pxtp2015</a>). Accepted full<br>
  papers will appear in an EPTCS volume.</p>
