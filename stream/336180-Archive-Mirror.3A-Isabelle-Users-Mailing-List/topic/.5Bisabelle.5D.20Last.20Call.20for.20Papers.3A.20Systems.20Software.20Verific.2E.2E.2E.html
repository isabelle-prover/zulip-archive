<p>7th Systems Software Verification Conference (SSV 2012)<br>
                November 28--30, 2012<br>
                  Sydney, Australia</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ssv-conference.org/">http://www.ssv-conference.org/</a></p>
<p>*Scope</p>
<p>Industrial-strength software analysis and verification has advanced in<br>
recent years through the introduction of model checking, automated and<br>
interactive theorem  proving, and static analysis  techniques, as well<br>
as correctness  by design,  correctness by contract,  and model-driven<br>
development.  However, many techniques  are working  under restrictive<br>
assumptions that are invalidated  by complex embedded systems software<br>
such  as  operating  system  kernels,  low-level  device drivers,  or<br>
microcontroller code.</p>
<p>The  aim  of  this  workshop  is to  bring  together researchers  and<br>
developers  from  both  academia  and  industry who  are facing  real<br>
software and real  problems with the goal of  finding real, applicable<br>
solutions.  By  “real” we  mean  problems  such  as time-to-market  or<br>
reliability that the  industry is facing. A real  solution is one that<br>
is applicable to the problem in industry and not one that only applies<br>
to an abstract, academic, toy version  of it. In this workshop we will<br>
discuss software  analysis and development techniques  and tools; this<br>
forum will  serve as  a platform to  discuss open problems and future<br>
challenges in dealing with existing and upcoming systems-level code.</p>
<p>Topics include, but are not restricted to:<br>
    • Model checking<br>
    • Automated and interactive theorem proving<br>
    • Static analysis<br>
    • Automated testing<br>
    • Model-driven development<br>
    • Embedded systems development<br>
    • Programming languages<br>
    • Verifying compilers<br>
    • Software certification<br>
    • Software tools<br>
    • Experience reports</p>
<p>*Submissions</p>
<p>Submissions must  be made electronically through  the EasyChair system<br>
(<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssv2012">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssv2012</a>)  until September<br>
19th,  2012.  Papers should  be  up  to 10  pages  in  pdf format  and<br>
formatted  in EPTCS  style. Additional  details  may be included in a<br>
clearly marked appendix,  which will be read at  the discretion of the<br>
program committee.   All will be  subject to peer review under normal<br>
conference  standards.   Experience  reports  and papers  on work  in<br>
progress    are   welcome   as    long   as    there   is    a clear<br>
contribution.  Submissions which  are based  or discuss  a non-trivial<br>
piece of software are required to make all those non-standard software<br>
parts  available, which  a referee  may need,  in order  to check the<br>
claims of the submission.</p>
<p>Submitted papers  must not  have previously appeared  in a journal or<br>
conference  with published  proceedings and  must not  be concurrently<br>
submitted to  any other peer-reviewed  workshop, symposium, conference<br>
or archival  journal. Any partial  overlap with any such published or<br>
concurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated.</p>
<p>*Publication </p>
<p>The proceedings will be published with EPTCS (<a href="http://eptcs.org">http://eptcs.org</a>).</p>
