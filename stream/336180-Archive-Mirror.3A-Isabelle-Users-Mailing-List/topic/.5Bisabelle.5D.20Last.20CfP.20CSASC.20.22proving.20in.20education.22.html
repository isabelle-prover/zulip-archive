<p>Proving in Mathematics Education<br>
                      at University and at School<br>
                  ====================================<br>
                      Minisymposion at CSASC 2013<br>
                             9-13 June 2013<br>
                            Koper,  Slovenia<br>

<hr>
<p>Computer Theorem Proving (TP) is reliably grounded on formal calculus<br>
— whereas proof is not taught as a formal calculus in general academic<br>
education. Rather, students adopt the habits of their academic<br>
environment and copy the way of proving from their academic teachers.<br>
Evidently this results in a lack of confidence for most students and<br>
in a lack of control of what they are doing. High-school seems<br>
affected by these academic traditions such, that proof is considered<br>
too comprehensive for most students in spite of curricula containing<br>
mathematical proof.</p>
<p>The Minisymposion presents experiences from courses supported by TP<br>
technology at academia and at high-school throughout Europe. A major<br>
point of discussion will be the issue to narrow the gap between<br>
high-school math and academic math in Science, Technology and<br>
Engineering education. In particular, the (planned/envisioned) use of<br>
existing TP software systems in an educational setting or concrete<br>
plans for (future/desired) educational TP software systems should be<br>
demonstrated with the aim to get a common view on the requirements for<br>
such systems that would make them widely accepted teaching tools.</p>
<p>This minisymposion is motivated by the hope that bottom-up approaches<br>
in local cooperation might be more successful than pretentious<br>
top-down approaches to the sensible, but important topic. For<br>
preparing discussions we invite submission of abstracts (up to 500<br>
words \approx 1 page) on topics including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Demonstration of tools supporting proofs and using TP technology,<br>
   i.e. tools which generate assumptions, which interactively or<br>
   automatically perform proofs, which systematically generate proof<br>
   obligations, which use TP for checking user input, etc.<br>
   (... called "TP-based" software in the sequel)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiences from academic courses of various kinds using TP-based<br>
   software --- probably including feature requests for future<br>
   development of such software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of mathematics and mathematical activities which might<br>
   specifically take advantage from support by TP-based software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematical concepts and (TP-based) technology specifically<br>
   relevant for software support for teaching and learning to prove</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiences from initiatives and activities filling the gap between<br>
   school and university --- and their relation to TP-based technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
