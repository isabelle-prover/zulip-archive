Hi Viorel,</p>
<p>the answer to your issue has many facets.</p>
<p>Historically, syntactic classes where necessary since the class +<br>
operations &amp; instantiation infrastructure has not yet emerged.  With the<br>
class package my first thought was to avoid syntactic classes entirely,<br>
since they allow to write down things for which one might expect certain<br>
properties to hold, which, in fact, do not, only with more specific sort<br>
constraints:</p>
<p>(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)<br>
        2 + 2 = 4 -- an Isabelle classic!</p>
<p>(an aside: there is a similar issue with min/max which are defined<br>
purely syntactical, not only on linear orders)</p>
<p>I kept the then existing syntactic classes a) for backward compatibility<br>
and b) since they carry syntax by default.  The case for inf and sup<br>
then was different.</p>
<p>Nowadays I have to admit that in situations like yours syntactic classes<br>
for inf and sup would allow a more liberal building of the class<br>
hierarchy.  Indeed, I recently had some thoughts how you could achieve<br>
something like »import class parameters, but with different<br>
specification from which the original specification follows«, in essence<br>
a class with simultaneous subclass.  But it looked rather complicated.</p>
<p>I have no strong opinion whether to turn inf and sup into syntactic<br>
classes.  But note that to simplify your instantiation proofs you can<br>
prove a specific introduction rule for P ==&gt; OFCLASS('a, left_inf) where<br>
P is the body of your left_inf class.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
    Florian<br>

<p>There are several similar situations that arise in Isabelle's real<br>
analysis class hierarchy. For example, RealVector.thy introduces type<br>
classes topological_space and metric_space. Every metric space is also<br>
a topological space, so we definitely want a subclass relationship<br>
topological_space &lt; metric_space. The naive way to formalize these<br>
classes is shown below.</p>
<p>class topological_space =<br>
  fixes "open" :: "'a set =&gt; bool"<br>
  assumes open_UNIV: "open UNIV"<br>
  assumes open_Int: "open S ==&gt; open T ==&gt; open (S \&lt;inter&gt; T)"<br>
  assumes open_Union:: "ALL S:K. open S ==&gt; open (Union K)"</p>
<p>class metric_space = topological_space +<br>
  fixes dist :: "'a =&gt; 'a =&gt; real"<br>
  assumes dist_eq_0_iff: "(dist x y = 0) = (x = y)"<br>
  assumes dist_triangle2: "dist x y \&lt;le&gt; dist x z + dist y z"<br>
  assumes open_dist: "open S = (ALL x:S. EX e&gt;0. ALL y. dist y x &lt; e --&gt; y : S)"</p>
<p>Of course, the problem here is that whenever we want to prove an<br>
instance of the metric_space class, Isabelle expects us to re-prove<br>
all the topological_space axioms as well, even though they are implied<br>
by the metric_space axioms! To avoid this, I broke up the class<br>
definitions using some syntactic classes:</p>
<p>class "open" = fixes "open" :: "'a set =&gt; bool"</p>
<p>class topological_space = "open" +<br>
  assumes open_UNIV: "open UNIV"<br>
  assumes open_Int: "open S ==&gt; open T ==&gt; open (S \&lt;inter&gt; T)"<br>
  assumes open_Union:: "ALL S:K. open S ==&gt; open (Union K)"</p>
<p>class dist = fixes dist :: "'a =&gt; 'a =&gt; real"</p>
<p>class open_dist = "open" + dist +<br>
  assumes open_dist: "open S = (ALL x:S. EX e&gt;0. ALL y. dist y x &lt; e --&gt; y : S)"</p>
<p>class metric_space = open_dist +<br>
  assumes dist_eq_0_iff: "(dist x y = 0) = (x = y)"<br>
  assumes dist_triangle2: "dist x y \&lt;le&gt; dist x z + dist y z"</p>
<p>Then we can prove a subclass relationship:</p>
<p>instance topological_space &lt; metric_space<br>
proof ...</p>
<p>Now instance proofs for metric_space give us exactly the proof<br>
obligations we want.</p>
<p>Similar relationships exist among a whole sequence of classes, and<br>
they are set up in a similar manner:<br>
topological_space &lt; metric_space &lt; real_normed_vector &lt; real_inner</p>

<p>The redefined class hierarchy as I presented it above still has this<br>
same kind of problem: If you write something like "dist x y = dist y<br>
x", the inferred sort for x and y is "dist", and not "metric_space" as<br>
you would like. I solve this problem with the following ML command:</p>
<p>setup {* Sign.add_const_constraint<br>
  (@{const_name dist}, SOME @{typ "'a::metric_space =&gt; 'a =&gt; real"}) *}</p>
<p>This tells Isabelle's parser/typechecker to automatically infer a<br>
metric_space class constraint whenever the "dist" constant is used.<br>
This works great most of the time, but there are rare occasions when I<br>
need to temporarily turn off the extra constraints (see<br>
Library/Inner_Product.thy) which is a pain.</p>

<p>Such a feature might be worthwhile; after all, my workaround for the<br>
problem is rather complicated too! This feature would let us radically<br>
simplify the class hierarchy in the real analysis theories. It would<br>
also let us simplify the group/ring class hierarchy a bit. But perhaps<br>
most importantly, it would let users define classes like Viorel's<br>
"left_inf" class in the most natural way.</p>

<p>From: Viorel Preoteasa &lt;<a href="mailto:viorel.preoteasa@abo.fi">viorel.preoteasa@abo.fi</a>&gt;<br>
Hello Brian, Florian,</p>
<p>Thank you for your answers.</p>
<p>It seems that the only reason for not having<br>
syntactic classes for inf and sup is because<br>
an expression "inf a b", by default will<br>
have a too week type. However you do accept<br>
this compromise for the arithmetic operators<br>
which seems more difficult to justify.</p>
<p>As Brian pointed out syntactic classes are needed<br>
also when dealing with topological and metric spaces<br>
in order to avoid reproving things for every instantiation.</p>
<p>I have another example which is also in the favor of<br>
syntactic classes. In Isabelle 2009 the operations<br>
Inf and Sup were defined as part of the complete<br>
lattice structure, and now they are syntactic classes.<br>
It seems that there was  a similar problem for the complete<br>
lattice operations.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Viorel</p>

A further aspect: Pure.intro declaration have precedence over the intro<br>
classes method, as shown in the folling silly example:</p>
<p>lemma nonsense [Pure.intro]:<br>
  "False \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; OFCLASS('a, default_class)"<br>
  ..</p>
<p>instance bool :: default<br>
apply default<br>
oops</p>
<p>By declaring your customary class introduction rules Pure.intro, they<br>
are preferred in instance proofs.</p>

Does that solve the issues that were raised on this thread earlier?  I <br>
have followed the matter only with one eye, without really understanding <br>
the full situation.</p>
<p>The "default" proof step is a little bit entangled, it tries to be smart <br>
in including certain aspects of "intro_classes" to make such proof <br>
patterns look somehow obvious.  The classical reasoner overrides "default" <br>
later once more, to add its classical viewpoint to the "rule" part.</p>
<p>If there is a need for it, such things can certainly be reformed, but it <br>
would require a brief inspection of the status quo and the parts of the <br>
history leading to it.</p>
<p>If plain Pure.intro (which already works with the "rule" method, BTW) is <br>
sufficient, it is even easier.</p>

I guess the intro_classes method must maintain a list of introduction<br>
rules for OFCLASS predicates; maybe we could just introduce an<br>
attribute for adding new theorems to this list (replacing any<br>
pre-existing rule for the same class). I wouldn't expect this to be<br>
too hard to implement.</p>
<p>But I think that the real challenge for making the process<br>
user-friendly is to find a way to avoid mucking around with<br>
"Sign.add_const_constraint".</p>
