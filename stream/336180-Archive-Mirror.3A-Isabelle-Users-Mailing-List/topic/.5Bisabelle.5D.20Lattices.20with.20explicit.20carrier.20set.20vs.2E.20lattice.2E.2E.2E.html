<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:peter.lammich@uni-muenster.de">peter.lammich@uni-muenster.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>there are two ways of defining lattices in Isabelle:<br>
The first approach makes the carrier set of the lattice explicit, as<br>
e.g. in HOL/Algebra/Lattice.thy, the<br>
second one (in HOL/Lattices.thy and HOL/Lattices/*) uses implicit<br>
carrier sets (the UNIV-set of a type) and type-classes.</p>
<p>Is there a systematic/automatic way to go from theorems with the<br>
implicit carrier set to corresponding theorems for an explicit carrier set?</p>
<p>My concrete problem is, that I have many theorems for the implicit<br>
carrier-set, but the algorithms I want to verify require parametric<br>
carrier sets, e.g.<br>
I need the lattice of all subsets of control locations in the program,<br>
that has some nice properties (e.g. finite-height) only, if there are<br>
only finitely many<br>
control locations.</p>
<p>However, because the set of control locations is a parameter of the<br>
algorithm I want to verify, I cannot fix it in advance, and thus cannot<br>
define a datatype of control locations, that<br>
would be required to show that it's corresponding set-type is in the<br>
lattice-typeclass.</p>
<p>Any ideas? Is the only way to redo the proofs of all necessary theorems<br>
for explicit carrier sets?</p>
<p>Regards and thanks for any hints,<br>
  Peter</p>

<p>The developer version contains a transfer tool (written by Amine Chaieb) <br>
which may be helpful in situations like yours. Currently it is used for <br>
lifting theorems between int and nat etc. But there is not really much <br>
experience in using it, and it is not part of an official release, so <br>
expect the unexpected! (and maybe redoing the proofs is less painful in <br>
the end). Probably Amine or someone else can point you to an example of <br>
how it can be used...</p>

<p>From: Jeremy Avigad &lt;<a href="mailto:avigad@cmu.edu">avigad@cmu.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Friends,</p>
<p>Below Alex is referring to a transfer method that Amine and I  <br>
developed while I was revising Isabelle's number theory library,  <br>
designed to help transfer theorems about the natural numbers to  <br>
equivalent statements about the nonnegative integers and vice-versa.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: whenever you have a bijection from a subset A of  <br>
one type (possibly the universal set) to a subset B of another, and  <br>
some functions and relations that respect the bijection, then any  <br>
theorem about A is equivalent to a theorem about B. (Similarly things  <br>
can be said about surjections rather than bijections, e.g. quotient  <br>
maps.) The transfer method simply applies carefully chosen rewrite  <br>
rules to translate theorems back and forth between such domains.</p>
<p>You can find the code for transfer in Transfer.ML, and the rules  <br>
designed specifically for transfer between nats and ints in  <br>
Nat_Transfer.thy of the developer version. They are put to use in  <br>
files like GCD.thy, Primes.thy, and UniqueFactorization.thy (the  <br>
latter two are in NumberTheory). It is pretty nifty: you give the  <br>
method a nat theorem and it returns the corresponding int theorem, or  <br>
vice-versa. It even works with higher-order constructs like summation,  <br>
etc.</p>
<p>But the methods are still in a prototype stage. Amine and I still need  <br>
to find time to polish them and put in rules for other higher-order  <br>
constructs, and improve the interface and document it. I'm not sure if/ <br>
when that will happen...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this won't solve Peter's problem. The issue is that, in  <br>
general, one does not have bijections between parameterized structures  <br>
and types. This is what makes simple type theory simple: types can't  <br>
depend on parameters. (There is a trick due to John Harrison for  <br>
encoding natural numbers as types, and using polymorphism over type  <br>
variables, but it is limited.) Axiomatic type classes are simply stuck  <br>
in type-land.</p>
<p>If you really want to use structures that depend on parameters, here  <br>
are some options:</p>
<p>(1) (Re)do everything in locales, as Larry suggests.</p>
<p>(2) Give up on simple type theory and use a dependent type theory like  <br>
Coq (see e.g. Gonthier's finite group theory project).</p>
<p>(3) Give up on simple type theory and go the other direction, to set  <br>
theory. See, for example, Mizar's type system for an example of how  <br>
infrastructure for keeping track of types can be added on top of set  <br>
theory.</p>
<p>Tobias Nipkow, Brian Huffman, Amine Chaieb, and I once discussed ways  <br>
that one could embed Isabelle's type theory in a larger set-theoretic  <br>
framework, e.g. adding a type of sets and axioms that guarantee that  <br>
"small" types correspond to sets. If done right, that could yield a  <br>
consistent system (e.g. having the same logical strength as set  <br>
theory) where one could go back and forth between typed and set- <br>
theoretic versions of theorems, and so, indirectly, from axiomatic- <br>
type class versions to set-based locale versions. I still think that's  <br>
an idea worth exploring, if anyone is willing and able.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Jeremy</p>

<p>From: "Dr. Brendan Patrick Mahony" &lt;<a href="mailto:brendan.mahony@dsto.defence.gov.au">brendan.mahony@dsto.defence.gov.au</a>&gt;<br>
This is an issue that has been of interest for some time.</p>
<p>If you want to do interesting mathematics (eg about lattices rather  <br>
than using lattices) you really should be using explicit carrier sets.</p>
<p>My intuitions suggest that the existing axclass - locale binding could  <br>
be strengthened to support moving seamlessly from "pure" mathematics  <br>
(on carrier set algebras) to "applied" mathematics (on type algebras).  <br>
A "carrier" locale could be associated with the "type" axclass and new  <br>
axclasses could be developed as specialised extensions of the  <br>
"carrier" locale (restrict to single type parameter, what else?). An  <br>
instance of the axclass is induced from an interpretation of the  <br>
locale with a universal carrier set.</p>
<p>We have a lattice development with this sort of structure, carrier  <br>
based development of sub-lattices, lattice morphisms, and other useful  <br>
approaches to proving lattice instances. A couple of linking theorems  <br>
then connect axclass and locale to make it easy to prove type lattice  <br>
instances.</p>
<p>It would be nice if the Isabelle axclass mechanism gave serious  <br>
support for this sort of approach.</p>

Yes, this would be an excellent research project for somebody who is  <br>
familiar with a variety of type theories and also has an intuitive  <br>
understanding of set theory. But finding such a person is probably  <br>
more difficult than finding somebody who is conversant in both Latin  <br>

So it is a "challange". My question is whether having such a theory<br>
makes it easy to tailor Isabelle to do such lifting between the two<br>
kinds of theory development? How much programming work would this be<br>
to have a usable framework?</p>
