<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:c-sterna@jaist.ac.jp">c-sterna@jaist.ac.jp</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>just for fun, I recently wanted to formalize the first "pearl" from the <br>
book "Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design" (by Richard Bird) inside <br>
Isabelle/HOL. The solutions in the book are implemented in Haskell and <br>
sometimes rely on lazy evaluation.</p>
<p>I stumbled across the following points. In proofs the case of infinite <br>
lists is (as far as I read) never considered (i.e., plain structural <br>
induction on finite lists is used). However, the implementations <br>
sometimes contain infinite lists like [0..]. Since this "omissions" are <br>
only done in contexts where the lists that are used for induction are <br>
really finite, this seems to be fine.</p>
<p>My question is now, how closely can such a kind of proof be imitated <br>
inside Isabelle/HOL?</p>
<p>Lets consider we use "'a llist" (from AFP/Coinductive) for lazy lists <br>
and "'a list" for finite lists.</p>
<p>If I'm correct, the new transfer package should be able (after <br>
appropriate setup) to transfer facts from "'a list" to "'a llist" with <br>
additional "lfinite ..." assumptions (and also the other way round?). <br>
But how this setup is actually done, I did not find out. The current <br>
documentation of the transfer package is rather inaccessible (in fact I <br>
only know of the example theories that are mentioned in the NEWS file).</p>
<p>Another issue is that Haskell functions (on lazy lists) are defined <br>
using notation like "fun" of Isabelle/HOL despite not being based on <br>
well-founded recursion, whereas for function definitions on "'a llist" <br>
in Isabelle/HOL this does not work (at least I don't know how). That is, <br>
there is a gap between what is used in Haskell programming and how this <br>
can be "simulated" in Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>So, here is a wish-list:</p>
<ul>
<li>in contexts where we have "lfinite", reuse facts on "'a list" functions</li>
<li>
<p>provide a command that allows to define functions on "'a llist" using <br>
the same notation as "fun" (is this already possible?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for Haskell code generation Nil and LNil as well as Cons and LCons <br>
should be unified and mapped to [] and (:) of Haskell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>moreover, would it be possible to unify "equivalent" (modulo <br>
infiniteness) functions like "map" and "lmap", "filter" and "lfilter" <br>
..., for code generation?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My main questions are:<br>
1) how would the above mentioned transfer setup work?<br>
2) how realistic is the above wish-list and what do you think about it?</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>chris</p>

<p>I'd recommend you scrape the theory out of the AFP - it subsumes the JFP paper.<br>

<p>However I have not investigated how you'd connect an inductive thing (e.g. a function nat =&gt; 'a) to it's coinductive counterpart (e.g. an 'a llist) using it. (It works in a domain theoretic setting as recursive domain equations have unique fixed points.)<br>
I guess this is the same problem as relating "'a list" to "'a llist"?</p>
<p>There's some work on this by Thorsten Altenkirch et al that is heavy on the category theory (TLCA 2001?) - I think the keyword is "containers". See the original worker/wrapper paper by Hutton and Gill for the reference.</p>

<p>From: Peter Gammie &lt;<a href="mailto:peteg42@gmail.com">peteg42@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Christian,</p>
<p>Probably. Roughly I think Altenkirch et al show that if you have a function from an inductively-defined domain then there is an equivalent coinductive definition of that function.</p>
<p>You can think of it as a generalisation of using lazy lists to memoise functions from the natural numbers, as Hutton and Gill did in their worker/wrapper paper. In their setting, for (partial) f :: nat -&gt; 'a, f x is memoised by the x'th element of the lazy list. (In a total setting you'd want to use streams, not lazy lists.)</p>
<p>In general you need to index into a more complex coinductive type (whose structure depends on the type of the function's domain). There's probably a link to differentiating datatypes, zippers and so forth too.</p>
<p>Their framework probably handles the issue in the paper I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>BTW I think it is great you are contemplating putting Bird et al's work through a proof assistant. Parts of Bird's theory of lists (from circa 1987) are still visible in List.thy. One might hope the newer work is similarly useful.</p>
<p>I'll leave the questions about code generation to Brian and Florian.</p>

Dear Christian,</p>
<p>if you want to formalise functional programming, I recommend HOLCF over <br>
Coinductive, because domain theory is the semantics behind Haskell, not <br>
coinductive datatypes. HOLCF lists, for example, can distinguish between <br>
"definitely terminating", "definitely infinite", and "evaluated up to a certain <br>
point with unknown rest". Coinductive lists ('a llist) cannot express the last <br>
case. You can then also do induction over HOLCF lists, known as Scott induction.<br>
However, using standard HOL types and functions within HOLCF may need some work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lets consider we use "'a llist" (from AFP/Coinductive) for lazy lists and "'a<br>
list" for finite lists.<br>
The predicate "lfinite" is defined inductively, so you could do induction on <br>
that. But obviously, your induction then has to thread through this predicate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If I'm correct, the new transfer package should be able (after appropriate<br>
setup) to transfer facts from "'a list" to "'a llist" with additional "lfinite<br>
..." assumptions (and also the other way round?). But how this setup is actually<br>
done, I did not find out.<br>
I tried to set it up in the attached theory, but it only seems to works in the <br>
wrong direction: You can prove theorems on 'a list by transferring them to 'a <br>
llist with the lfinite predicate. Since neither 'a llist nor 'a list are defined <br>
in terms of each other, you need to do the setup manually, i.e., prove all those <br>
transfer rules that relate functions on 'a llist with those on 'a list. Maybe <br>
the transfer package experts can improve my attempt.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

Unfortunately, there is currently no support for corecursive definitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So, here is a wish-list:<br>
- in contexts where we have "lfinite", reuse facts on "'a list" functions<br>
That would be great, but you have to ensure that the functions on 'a llist <br>
behave exactly like on 'a list. This is non-trivial for underspecified functions <br>
like hd and nth when applied with inappropriate parameters (such as []). I tried <br>
hard to make these functions coindice (see, e.g., the "undefined (Suc n)" in the <br>
definition of lnth), but I do not remember whether this was always possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>provide a command that allows to define functions on "'a llist" using the same<br>
notation as "fun" (is this already possible?)<br>
I hope that the new package for codatatypes provides at least "coprimrec". I <br>
doubt that there will be a powerful tool for arbitrary corecursive definitions, <br>
because the internal constructions and proofs required differ considerably from <br>
well-founded recursions.</li>
</ul>

functions like "map" and "lmap", "filter" and "lfilter" ..., for code generation?<br>
The last two should be easy to accomplish. Even you yourself could do that, one <br>
only has to adapt the section on code_type and code_const in List.thy for <br>
Coinductive_List_Lib.</li>
</ul>

Absolutely and definitely true. HOLCF is explicitly a theory of computation; Coinductive is merely a theory of infinite objects. Such a pity if it doesn't yet support code generation.</p>

<p>That's right: The automation provided by the setup_lifting command is<br>
designed for transferring theorems from supertype to subtype, not the<br>
other way around. But you can always define your own transfer relation<br>
manually, in whichever direction you want. The attached theory file<br>
defines a relation for transferring from list to llist (it is the<br>
converse of the relation that would be generated by setup_lifting),<br>
and shows how it can be used.</p>
<p>Using the "transfer" proof method (which acts like the "descending"<br>
method from the Quotient package) is rather cumbersome for these kinds<br>
of examples; once we get around to implementing counterparts to the<br>
"lifting" method and "lifted" attribute, transferring theorems from<br>
list to llist should be a lot easier.</p>

<p>Using the planned but yet-to-be-implemented "transferred" attribute,<br>
this kind of transfer should be completely automatic. You should be<br>
able to write</p>
<p>map_append [transferred tr_llist]</p>
