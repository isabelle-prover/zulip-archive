<p>From: Holger Gast &lt;<a href="mailto:gast@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de">gast@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Joachim,</p>
<p>The issue arises from I3P trying to have the messages of previous<br>
commands available for the user for inspection. For this to work,<br>
Isabelle has to print the goal state, which may take some time<br>
(sometimes &gt; 100ms, or even more for really large goal states).<br>
I had already noticed this, but it was never severe enough to prompt action.<br>
Since we agreed that the availability of previous messages is desirable,<br>
simply turning off the output is no solution.</p>
<p>I have therefore added to the I3P framework the notion of<br>
"lazy messages", of which Isabelle only sends a "proxy" with an identifier,<br>
and internally keeps the information for generating the message<br>
on request. (Due to the structure-sharing, purely functional<br>
representation employed throughout Isabelle, this is not a<br>
major overhead.) When the user points the UI to a lazy message,<br>
it is requested from Isabelle on the fly.</p>
<p>With this setup, the perceived processing speed in<br>
release 1.0.8 has increased very much.</p>
<p>Lazy messages, as implemented, also cover more general scenarios<br>
than just the goal output. For instance, I have had good results<br>
for bulk trace messages where the proxy contained enough information<br>
to let the user decided whether the message is relevant at all.<br>
If this is interesting to other people, I can provide more details.<br>
Also, the LazyMessageHandler in the Isabelle2009Driver<br>
(in the 1.0.8 source code) explains the essential idea of how to<br>
garbage-collect message references across the process boundary<br>
using Java's WeakReference/ReferenceQueue mechanisms.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for pointing this out, and also for the offline<br>
discussion and for testing the changes beforehand. It certainly<br>
raised very interesting design &amp; programming challenges :)</p>
<p>Holger</p>
