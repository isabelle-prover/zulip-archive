I frequently use the forms:</p>
<p>case (constr v1 v2 ...)<br>
  hence j1:"..." and j2:"..." ... by auto</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>case (constr v1 v2 ...)<br>
  have j1:"..." and j2:"..." ... by fact</p>
<p>Both of these now give a warning:</p>
<p>### Legacy feature: implicit use of prems in assumption proof</p>
<p>I would not like to see these forms eliminated.  It seems natural to<br>
set out the known facts before working on the proof.  </p>
<p>What is the intended replacement for this style?  If users are<br>
intended to use the names such as constr.hyps and constr.prems, could<br>
these names be shown along with "this" in the goal window?</p>
<p>This naming scheme, constr.hyps and constr.prems, could be improved.<br>
In my old system LEGO, when defining an inductive type/relation you<br>
could (optionally) give names to side conditions/premises.  When you<br>
did induction on that type/relation, the assumptions were given names<br>
derived from the premises they came from, and the induction hypotheses<br>
were also given names derived from the premises they came from.<br>
E.g. we might have beta_app.leftPrem and beta_app.leftPrem.ih, where<br>
beta_app is the rule name, leftPrem the name of the premise, and<br>
beta_app.leftPrem.ih the induction hypothesis derived from the left<br>
premise of thet rule.</p>
<p>At the least, Isar could name the induction hypotheses something like<br>
constr.ih instead of mixing them up in constr.hyps.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Randy</p>

<p>This warning indicates that the above 'by' steps are actually "deceptive", <br>
meaning that both auto and fact failed to solve the atomic sub-proofs <br>
completely.</p>
<p>In the second case you just need to say "fact+" to produce multiple facts.  </p>
<p>The first case needs to be debugged by looking at the internal goal state, <br>
after turning <code>by auto'' into </code>apply auto'' temporarily.  You will then <br>
see that some subgoals are left over, which happen to be solvable by <br>
referring to prems that are not indicated explicitly in the text.  I.e. <br>
``by auto'' was actually wrong as a description of how the proof works.</p>

<p>Yes, this will happen at some later stage.  At the moment we are glad <br>
enough to have gotten rid of alphabetically sorted bound variables.</p>
