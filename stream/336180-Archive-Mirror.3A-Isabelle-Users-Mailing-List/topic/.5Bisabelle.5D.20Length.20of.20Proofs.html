As I see it, there are advantages to both interfaces. And everything is accessible from ML simply because it is the implementation language, although of course this access may not be very convenient. I think it's generally accepted these days that the ML level really is more appropriate for development than for ordinary reasoning. It isn't realistic to support both Isar and the ML level as the day-to-day user interface; even with unlimited resources, such duplication wouldn't be very elegant.</p>
<p>Isabelle has undergone very rapid change over the years, and this has meant leaving a lot of old practices behind. I know that it has caused users difficulties in the past, and it's unfortunate, but maintaining upwards compatibility is also very difficult. As one of the earliest Isabelle users, you naturally feel this much more than others do.</p>

Actually, the Prover IDE supports both Isabelle/Isar and Isabelle/ML <br>
pretty well -- note that Isabelle/ML needs to be distinguished from the ML <br>
bootstrapping environment to get the Isabelle/Pure/Isar implementation up <br>
and running.</p>
<p>You can even imitate the proof style from the 1990-ies like this:</p>
<p>apply (tactic {* my_tac @{context} 7 *})</p>
<p>Its definitely not elegant, and there is little reason to use this form <br>
today.  It is better to use method_setup to define your own application <br>
specific proof methods first, and then use them in the proofs.</p>

Larry,</p>
<p>I take your first point, that "everything is accessible from ML",  but <br>
in a practical sense, I would say it's not because the code is so <br>
difficult to understand.  (Much more difficult than either Isabelle as <br>
it was in 1997, or HOL, to give examples within my experience.)</p>
<p>In a way, my first contribution to this thread was to make it clear that <br>
both "development" and "ordinary reasoning" are intertwined - there was <br>
quite a lot of "development" involved in getting the right combination <br>
of compound tactics and proof steps to avoid a proof script which would <br>
have been 10000 lines long.</p>
<p>The bigger issue is that pen and paper proofs I do and publish in a <br>
journal will be available as long as people want to read them.  The <br>
Isabelle proofs I do are in Isabelle 2005, and include theory and ML <br>
files from 1997, and so will in the future be inaccessible to anyone who <br>
doesn't (or can't) install Isabelle 2005  (which only seems to work with <br>
one particular version of PolyML).  Given the philosophy of Isabelle <br>
developers, prospective users need to be warned that if they want to <br>
write proofs which will be accessible to future researchers, they need <br>
to be done in print.</p>
<p>Finally, it's worth pointing out that no one in this thread has actually <br>
come up with a suggestion about how to do the sort of proof which was <br>
the subject of my original post other than using Standard ML (which, I <br>
understand, was designed for exactly that purpose).</p>

<p>This is why I have never separated Isabelle/Isar and Isabelle/ML in that <br>
sense, they are just two different languages of the Isabelle user-space. <br>
My first command implemented on the Isar toplevel was 'ML'.</p>
<p>Isabelle/ML happens to be used much less in applications these days, <br>
though, and this is no problem, merely an indication that the abstractions <br>
of Isar do most of your work already without extra tinkering in ML.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've pointed to the Isar command 'method_setup' already.  If you <br>
look it up in the isar-ref or implementation manual, and then look at 5-10 <br>
examples in the library, you should rather quickly get an idea how to <br>
define your own basic proof tools, like in the old ML-only times of <br>
Isabelle in the 1990-ies.</p>

<p>We will come back to this on-topic on the original thread.  So far I've <br>
skimmed a little over these theories by Christoph Lange, and it looks <br>

I think it's a great pity that you are using such an elderly version of Isabelle.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of legacy code that simply can't be ported, or an application where it works really well, okay. But for general proofs, there is simply no comparison between the Isabelle of today and one that is seven years old. Sledgehammer, counterexample finding, a very powerful function definition package, lots and lots of AFP theories… You shouldn't forego all of those.</p>

Larry,</p>
<p>I don't suppose the legacy code simply can't be ported, any more than it <br>
can't be translated into HOL.  But when I started to port it from <br>
Isabelle2005 to Isabelle2007 (still using ML tactics) I quickly gave <br>
up.  I expect it would be much worse now.</p>
<p>And although it seems as though the documentation is more extensive now <br>
than it was then, to learn Isar I would anticipate having some <br>
questions.  And the sort of answers I've had in the past to questions <br>
("look at Makarius's thesis") aren't encouraging.  The point is that to <br>
contemplate converting everything to Isar I need to _know_ that help <br>
will be available.</p>
<p>And anyway, what is the point of a system where you write tactics and <br>
then wrap them up as required to give them the type required by <br>
method_setup, rather than just write tactics? (This is of course a <br>
question to which the answer might be apparent if there was a more <br>
accessible description of the structure of an Isar proof than Makarius's <br>
thesis). Or learning something as totally weird as the grammar of the <br>
Isar language?</p>

There is no doubt that the APIs have changed rapidly over the years, in large part to accommodate user requests (in particular, for all declarations to work within locales). It certainly does make life difficult for developers.</p>
<p>There is a significant philosophical difference between Isabelle and HOL. I had always intended (perhaps even in 1986) that users should not have to write code in order to prove theorems.

document in the "isar-ref" manual, as all other Isar commands.  The <br>
"implementation" manual has further documentation about what proof methods <br>
are, compared to bare-bones tactics (which are also documented there).</p>
<p>The "plus" is much more than be discussed on such a mail thread.  It also <br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The situation is a bit more general than this, and it is hard to arrange <br>
Isar vs. ML in "levels" in particular.  Both are intertwined, cf. my <br>
explanation of Isabelle/Isar and Isabelle/ML as as the Yin and Yang of <br>
Isabelle <br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2012-April/msg00066.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2012-April/msg00066.html</a></p>
<p>In general Isar vs. its embedded languages works like this:</p>
<p>* Isar is the main framework of Isabelle to integrate many<br>
     other languages.</p>
<p>* The Isar languages for specifications (e.g. 'theorem', 'definition',<br>
     'function') and proofs (e.g. 'fix', 'assume', 'show' ...) are the<br>
     primary applications of the Isar framework.</p>
<p>* The logical language (Pure types/terms/propositions with specific HOL<br>
     notation) is another important embedded language, cf. the quotes that<br>
     have been around this language even in the ancient ML-only times of<br>
     Isabelle in the 1990-ies.</p>
<p>* ML is embedded into Isar in a similar manner, but at the same<br>
     time it is the implementation language of Isar.  Moreover, ML quoted<br>
     inside Isar can antiquote logic/Isar expressions.  So the image for<br>
     that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yin_and_Yang.svg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yin_and_Yang.svg</a></p>
<p>In everyday life you don't use the ML inside Isar a lot, but you can <br>
whenever you need to.  It is more convenient than the ancient ML toplevel <br>
ever was.  In Isabelle/jEdit you also have substantial IDE integration for <br>
this ML inside Isar.</p>

<p>You're certainly right about opaque blocks of tactics - but having to <br>
execute a proof to see the intermediate steps has got to be the price <br>
you pay for not having to write down all those intermediate steps. This <br>
whole thread started with the topic of an (I assume) Isar proof which <br>
was too long to be readable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know what local facts (or indeed facts generally) are.  I <br>
suspect it's part of the larger question of what the state of a part <br>
completed Isar proof consists of, and how it related to what you see on <br>
the screen.  I understood (a year or two ago) that this was not documented.</p>

The thread is indeed getting long and tedious, and it is unclear if it <br>
ever ends.  When I say "ML" or "Isabelle/ML", it practically always means <br>
the ML that is embedded into Isar.  This is what you use for professional <br>
applications these days.</p>
<p>There is also a raw ML bootstrap environment to get the Isabelle/Pure <br>
implementation to the point where it can run the Isar toplevel with this <br>
embedded ML.  In the 1990-ies, the user would continue with that raw ML <br>
toplevel to do proofs, but hardly anybody on the mailing list would <br>
remember that today.</p>
<p>Insisting to work with the raw ML toplevel is like traveling on a train <br>
like this: <a href="http://gehcrew.blogspot.fr/2010_03_01_archive.html">http://gehcrew.blogspot.fr/2010_03_01_archive.html</a></p>
<p>This technique works for a tramway to some extent, but not on the <br>
high-speed train that Isabelle has become in recent years, where you <br>
better sit comfortably inside.  And to get on such a train you merely <br>
purchase a ticket, you don't come with its technical manuals and take the <br>
engine apart while it is moving.</p>

<p>I'm not clear on the significance of your discussion about the meaning <br>
of "ML" but when I say Standard ML I mean any use of it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the link to (apparently) a German travelogue - it's a change <br>
to the tedium, if nothing else.</p>
<p>I'm left guessing what the discussion about trams and high-speed trains <br>
is really about, but it may be worth noting that there is an <br>
intermediate level of awareness which can actually be quite useful, such <br>
as timetables, route maps, destination signs on trains and so forth.</p>
<p>But if you like railway analogies - have you ever been to Karlsruhe? <br>
The city trams and high-speed trains actually use the same tracks.</p>

<p>I don't know if this is a factor in this particular set of proofs, but <br>
often a particular sequence of proof steps is reused repeatedly. </p>
<p>In such a case it is advantageous not to have to write them all down <br>
repeatedly, but to reuse them. </p>
<p>The Standard ML interface to Isabelle is ideally suited to this <br>
purpose.  Unfortunately its use has become actively discouraged in <br>

good use of the Standard ML interface.</p>

<p>val th = rdp (tn [dca1, dppsA, dica1, dassoc]) ;</p>
<p>in the above, each additional theorem in the list of arguments to tn <br>
involves several proof steps</p>
<p>val ctr_assoc_tacs = [<br>
  (EVERY' (init_dvi_ctr_tacs [dassoc]) 1),<br>
  (EVERY (xstacs ([dassoc, dassoc] MRS duA2))),<br>

  EVERY ctr_cs1_tacs, EVERY ctr_cs2_tacs,<br>
  EVERY ctr_rstars_tacs, EVERY ctr_rssA_tacs ] ;</p>
<p>If I had written this out in the modern style (using Isar) the above <br>
would expand to thousands, probably tens of thousands, of lines of code.</p>

Almost always, it is possible to considerably shorten proofs by use (and <br>
proper setup) of automated techniques (maybe even more so when using <br>
Isabelle/ML). The other extreme is to explicitly write every single step <br>
in Isar (as I know from myself and many students I taught, mostly <br>
beginners use this kind of proofs... of course it also depends on your <br>
intended audience).</p>
<p>In my opinion both extremes are bad. It is an art (as is often pointed <br>
out in Isar related manuals) to write Isar proofs that are readable yet <br>
not too verbose. But if you master this art, the gain is that others can <br>
actually read your proofs and follow the steps without even starting <br>
Isabelle (which is definitely not the case with the technique shown by <br>
Jeremy; so I would rather use that technique that are considered <br>
"trivial" by humans... but then again humans are often wrong in their <br>
initial judgment of what is trivial ;)).</p>
<p>I guess what I want to say is that no, proofs do not have to be <br>
exceedingly long in many cases, but sometimes long versions (or rather <br>
versions of appropriate length) are much better to read and maintain.</p>

As far as I am concerned, I never discouraged the use of Isabelle/ML, it <br>
merely came out of use as proof scripting languages, because there are <br>
better ways these days.  Christian Sternagel has already hinted at the <br>
fine art to combine structured Isar proof elements, and an assorted <br>
collection with proof tools.</p>
<p>If you still want to have hard-core quick script hacking, the community <br>
for that is centered around SSReflect, which is continuing traditions of <br>
APL for proof recording.  The scripts then come out very tight and terse, <br>
by experts for experts.</p>
<p>I am still keen to seen such a quick-hacking approach turned into proper <br>
use for an advanced Prover IDE: instead of recording the gesticulation of <br>
the author in the script, it would produce a nice structured, readable, <br>
maintainable proof document.</p>

features in Isabelle which were accessible only from Isar, not from the <br>
Standard ML interface.</p>
<p>In my book this discourages the use of Standard ML, and also provides an <br>
