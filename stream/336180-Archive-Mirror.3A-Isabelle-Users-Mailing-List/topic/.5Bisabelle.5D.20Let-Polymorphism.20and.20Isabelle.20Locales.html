<p>From: Mario Alvarez &lt;<a href="mailto:mmalvare@eng.ucsd.edu">mmalvare@eng.ucsd.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle Users,</p>
<p>I'm currently working on a project where I want to have polymorphic "fixes"<br>
constants in locales. The context is that I'm trying to build a framework<br>
for composing semantics of certain types of syntax trees with extension<br>
points represented as Isabelle type variables. My goal is to achieve a<br>
separation of concerns between pieces of the semantics that only care about<br>
the structure of the tree, and other that only care about the concrete data<br>
embedded at individual nodes in the tree. For the former, I want something<br>
like</p>
<p>(* 1 *) "(forall 't1 't2 't3 . 'x =&gt; ('t1, 't2, 't3) gensyn =&gt; 'mstate =&gt;<br>
'mstate)"</p>
<p>(Gensyn being the name of the syntax tree data structure). I'd like to use<br>
locales to declare semantics for different specialized types of this syntax<br>
tree. Each locale will have parameters that look like the above. These<br>
parameters are integrated together to give a semantics that has a type like<br>
the following:</p>
<p>(* 2 *) "('x, 'y, 'z) syntax =&gt; 'state =&gt; 'state"</p>
<p>The definition of this semantics (as an inductive) happens inside a locale<br>
with equation (<em>1</em>) as a fixes parameter. Note that is should be invalid<br>
for Isabelle<br>
to assume that it is always the case that 't1 = 'x, 't2 = 'y, 't3 = 'z,<br>
etc. This would make the parameter "not parametric enough", and allow the<br>
user to pass in terms that "know too much" about the data stored at nodes<br>
in the tree.</p>
<p>My (handwavey) understanding of how polymorphism works in Isabelle is that<br>
only "finished" definitions are allowed to be let-polymorphic, and "fixes"<br>
in locales aren't "finished" in the appropriate way. It seems that in<br>
proof-contexts there is a "let" command that could be used that might be<br>
helpful here, but locales don't seem to have an equivalent.</p>
<p>I've looked into using Isabelle's Overloading facility, but this doesn't<br>
achieve exactly what I want, because there doesn't seem to be any way to do<br>
Overloading inside of a local context, and I may want to declare multiple<br>
different semantics for different syntax trees of the same (specialized)<br>
type (I'd like to be able to isolate each one into its own locale).<br>
Typeclasses have the same problem: I want to be able to define possibly<br>
different implementations for the same type, and let the user select them<br>
by choosing the appropriate locale.</p>
<p>Are there any other options I have? I've attached a stripped-down version<br>
of what I'm trying to implement; hopefully it won't be too difficult to see<br>
where this problem arises (note that I am using Isabelle2018 rather than<br>
Isabelle2019, although I imagine that Isabelle2019 would give the same<br>
result).</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Mario<br>
