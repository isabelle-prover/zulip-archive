Dear Andreas,</p>
<p>I am certainly open to changes. Here are two that I would welcome: simplifying <br>
the code or adding informal explanations. In the case of your proposed change I <br>
did notice that it would increase the running time and was also a bit concerned <br>
about that.</p>
<p>I am afraid I cannot remember what situations prompted Norbert to write the more <br>
elaborate simproc.</p>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch">andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Tobias,</p>
<p>An informal explanation of the code is in the NEWS file (for Isabelle2005). It explains <br>
pretty well what is going on.</p>
<p>Simplifier: new simproc for "let x = a in f x".  If a is a free or<br>
   bound variable or a constant then the let is unfolded.  Otherwise<br>
   first a is simplified to b, and then f b is simplified to g. If<br>
   possible we abstract b from g arriving at "let x = b in h x",<br>
   otherwise we unfold the let and arrive at g.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this does not help much in understanding the motivation and indented use <br>
cases for the simproc. From a proving perspective, Norbert's case looks quite pragmatic to <br>
me: let's inline and see what happens - maybe one can regain the abstraction afterwards. <br>
Thus, the simproc breaks the abstraction of the binding - if more can be done, then it <br>
will be done.</p>
<p>This is in line with my experience. Let bindings help to make definitions more readable, <br>
but for proving, I usually just get rid of them by unfolding Let_def, because the <br>
classical reasoner does not deal with them at all and the simplifier does these funny <br>
transformations.</p>
<p>I am not really happy with this behaviour. I'd prefer something (maybe a different let) <br>
that respects the abstraction. What are your and others' experience with this?</p>
<p>Below are my thoughts on respecting the abstraction:</p>
<p>From a conceptual point of view, the let binding should respect the abstraction. That is, <br>
the new variable should be treated like a fresh constant - this is presently the case <br>
without the simproc. Unfortunately, proving then becomes a nightmare because no properties <br>
of the variable are known to the provers. It would be good to have some mechanism that <br>
automatically transfers the required properties from the bound term to the variable, but <br>
it is not clear what these properties should be. In fact, being equal to the bound term is <br>
also a property. So the simproc let_simp just goes all the way of transferring the <br>
properties by inlining.</p>
<p>Still, I wonder whether let_simp is doing to much. Essentially, it tries to guess when the <br>
binding should be unfolded (by trying out all possibilities). The other abstraction <br>
facilities in Isabelle such as definition and function have well-defined rules for when to <br>
break the abstraction automatically: definition only explicitly when the user unfolds the <br>
defining equation, and function when the argument matches the pattern. This seems to work <br>
rather well in practice. With let_simp, it does not work for bindings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not a good understanding of how such on-the-fly abstractions (let <br>
bindings) should be handled in general. I just have a few data points. Norrish and Slind <br>
(TPHOLs 2005 proof pearl) argue that it is important in some cases to keep the abstraction <br>
of let bindings (and the names of the bound variables). Their approach extracts let <br>
bindings from proof goals and makes them available as assumptions. Thus, the user can <br>
manually derive the required properties for the bound variables and---equally <br>
importantly---the let bindings are out of the way in the proof term.</p>
<p>Urban mentioned a similar problem in <br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2013-November/msg00277.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2013-November/msg00277.html</a>.</p>
<p>What I like about let_simp is that it eliminates duplicate let bindings, i.e., the term</p>
<p>let x = f a b in let y = f a b in P x x y y</p>
<p>becomes</p>
<p>let x = f a b in P x x x x</p>
<p>It also folds the abstraction if the bound term occurs in the body:</p>
<p>let x = f a b in P x x (f a b)</p>
<p>becomes</p>
<p>let x = f a b in P x x x</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the current simproc does not get the let out of the way. For example, to <br>
prove the following, I have to unfold the binding.</p>
<p>1 + (let x = f a in x + x) = (let x = f a in 1 + (x + x))</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

I like the elimination of atomic let bindings (and the elimination if there are <br>
&lt;= 1 occurrences of the bound variable), but not the rest of the current <br>
let_simp. If possible, I would relegate that to a special simproc that can be <br>
activated on demand.</p>
<p>A mechanism to make let-bindings in a goal available as assumptions (as in HOL4) <br>
would be nice, but that only seems to sense in combination with a structured <br>
proof that can access these assumption by some name.</p>

<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au">thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
While the let-simp simproc is being discussed, I might mention the<br>
problem I ran into with it.</p>
<p>Note that the body of the let is simplified twice, once by the normal<br>
bottom-up algorithm of the simplifier, and again with the let-expression<br>
unfolded as part of let-simp.</p>
<p>Now suppose that you start with a largish program which uses the let<br>
construct for structuring:</p>
<p>"let a = 1;<br>
     (b, s) = f a s;<br>
     (c, s) = g b s;<br>
     d = a + b;<br>
     ... etc"</p>
<p>Running the regular simplifier on this is exponential in the nesting<br>
level of the lets. The innermost expression will be simplified with each<br>
possible combination of folding and unfolding of all the let expressions<br>
it is in.</p>
<p>There's also a secondary problem in my case, which is that the let<br>
expression was folded in the first place to avoid an exponential blowup.<br>
I tried working around this, but the long story is that I gave up on<br>
using Isabelle for handling this problem.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, you might want to think about avoiding the exponential issue.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

Dear experts on rewriting,</p>
<p>I have a problem with let bindings and commutative rewrite rules. Here is an example and <br>
my understanding of what is happening.</p>
<p>lemma "(let pb = foobar b in f pb (λpad. g (pb * pad :: int))) = bar"<br>
apply(simp add: mult.commute)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>mult.commute rewrites pb * pad into pad * pb, because pad seems to be smaller than pb <br>
in the term order that the simplifier uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The let simproc determines that pb occurs more than once in the body, so it does not <br>
inline the let binding. Instead, it simplifies the body with knowledge pb = foobar b. <br>
Thus, the simplifier now sees pad * foobar b. Since "foobar b" is smaller than pad in the <br>
term order, commutativity kicks in again and we get foobar b * pad. Now, the simproc <br>
abstracts the simplified body over foobar b again and replaces it with pb. So we are back <br>
to pb * pad. Thus, the simplifier goes over the whole term again and we are back at step 1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In my understanding so far, commutative rewrite rules are safe (in the sense of <br>
termination) to add to the simplifier, but the let simproc interferes with this. Is this a <br>
known problem? Can the let simproc be somehow changed to avoid this?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

Dear Andreas,</p>
<p>I was not aware of this interaction but it does not surprise me - the let <br>
simproc is magic - but you can switch it off. I have no idea if it can be <br>
modified to avoid this interaction in the first place. That sounds like a time sink.</p>

Dear Tobias,</p>
<p>I had another look at the implementation of let_simp. I guess that one might be able to <br>
change the let simproc fairly easily. The idea is as follows. For non-trivial lets (at <br>
least two occurrences of the bound variable and the bound term is not atomic), the let <br>
simproc inlines the bound term in the body, normalises the result with the simplifier and <br>
the current simpset, and then replaces all the remaining occurrences of the bound term in <br>
the normalised term with the bound variable.</p>
<p>There is already a check whether the new body is alpha-beta-eta-equivalent to the old <br>
body. In that case, the simproc aborts with NONE. Now, the interaction can occur only if <br>
the abstracted body is no longer in normal form (although it is with the bound term <br>
inlined)*. Thus, it would make sense to normalise the abstracted body again and check for <br>
equivalence with the original body.</p>
<p>When I add this additional check, the looping in my example disappears. What do you think?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>
<ul>
<li>This may happen due to term order as in my case, but I imagine that simprocs like <br>
NO_MATCH equally cause trouble here.</li>
</ul>

Dear Andreas,</p>
<p>Thank you for your thoughts, but I would rather not change the current setup. I <br>
don't really understand Norbert's code and I don't want to add further bits to <br>
it. Moreover, the problem seems to crop up very rarely. If we were to modify the <br>
code, I would expect one of two results: it hardly has any effect or it breaks a <br>
lot of proofs. In both cases I would want to leave well alone.</p>
<p>Tobias</p>
<p>PS I have recently made some similar change also in HOL and am thinking about <br>
undoing it for some of the reasons above.<br>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch">andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Tobias,</p>
<p>I do not like the situation "We do not fully understand what is going on, so better not <br>
change anything", because this effectively freezes the code as it currently is with no way <br>
to ever improve it. I am pretty sure that my change would have hardly any effect on the <br>
existing proofs (although I would have to test this hypothesis). Still, I agree with your <br>
decision for another reason. The let_simp simproc is already fairly inefficient when there <br>
are nested let expressions such as</p>
<p>let x = foo a b c in<br>
let y = bar a b c in<br>
let z = fbr a b c in<br>
f x x y y z z</p>
<p>because when the simproc triggers on the let for x (i.e., it has already looked at the <br>
lets for y and z), it inlines the x in the body and invokes the simplifier on the body</p>
<p>let y = bar a b c in<br>
let z = fbr a b c in<br>
f (foo a b c) (foo a b c) y y z z</p>
<p>Thus, the simplifier goes over the whole body again, which triggers the let_simp for the y <br>
once more (it has already triggered for this let binding before it triggered for the outer <br>
let). In summary, let_simp's runtime is exponential in the depth of let nestings.</p>
<p>Now, if we were to add another normalisation check for the abstracted body, this would <br>
increase the base of the exponential by one. The non-termination problem occurs rarely <br>
(the main reason is probably that commutativity rules are not in the simpset by default), <br>
so it probably does not justify slowing the simplifier down (although it took me a while <br>
to understand where the non-termination came from).</p>
<p>I consider the exponential running time more of a problem. (Note that this term remains <br>
linear in size if everything is inlined, so there is no exponential blow-up in term size <br>
due to the inlining.) I digged a bit through the history of the simproc, but I was not <br>
able to find any more information on what Norbert's case really is. Is there anyone who <br>
remembers?</p>
<p>Andreas</p>
<p>PS: For completeness, here's the changed simproc with the additional normalisation test <br>
for Isabelle2015-RC3.</p>
