<p>From: Moa Johansson &lt;<a href="mailto:moa.johansson@chalmers.se">moa.johansson@chalmers.se</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I'm currently porting some functionality from the HipSpec lemma discovery system into Isabelle. I have run into a small problem: </p>
<p>What is the proper way of "lifting" the variables in a theorem to meta-variables? <br>
I.e. when the theorem P x = Q y has been proved, I need to convert all Frees (here let's assume they are x,y) to Vars, getting P ?x = Q ?y.</p>
<p>This happens automatically when performing proofs interactively. Basically, I think I want to have almost the functionality of the function Goal.prove, but as this raises an error when the tactic fails it doesn't quite fit. <br>
Seems like this should be quite simple to do, perhaps this is what Thm.generalize is for? If so, what are its expected arguments? Seems like the first two are lists of all the type-variable and variable names we want to lift, but what is the int?</p>
<p>Grateful for tips!</p>
<p>Moa</p>

<p>You might want to have a look at "Drule.generalize". It provides a slightly higher-level interface, without the mysterious "int".</p>

Hi Moa,</p>
<p>an even higher-level interface that also works in a localized setting is <br>
the following:</p>
<p>Proof_Context.export names_ctxt ctxt</p>
<p>Here ctxt is the context in which your theorem lives (in particular the <br>
one that knows about free variables that are not really free but e.g., <br>
fixed by a locale). The second context (names_ctxt) is the enriched <br>
version of ctxt where the variables to be exported have been declared <br>
(e.g., via names_ctxt = Variable.declare_thm thm ctxt).</p>

Not that one again: any of the "without_context" operations are even worse <br>
than the "global" ones.  That is anncient legacy.</p>
<p>We have official type Proof.context with various elementary operations to <br>
fix variables and export results since about 1999.  The "implementation" <br>
manual explains that in section 6.1 with various examples.</p>

<p>Note that "lifting of variables" has a special meaning in Isabelle <br>
terminology, according to Larry.  The "implementation" manual section <br>
2.4.2 explains that to some extent, but you won't need that here.</p>
<p>Above, the question is where x and y were coming from.  Just using <br>
undeclared Free variables causes lots of headaches -- one needs to <br>
understand both the normal Isabelle context discipline and what happens <br>
without that to get things work.</p>
<p>It is easier to rely on the normal context discipline by default, and <br>
trust that this things work (they had more than a decade to mature).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This is because a statement like</p>
<p>lemma "x = x"</p>
<p>has an implicit "eigen context" around it</p>
<p>lemma<br>
     fixes x :: 'a<br>
     shows "x = x"</p>
<p>So you state something for fixed x :: 'a, and get the result for arbitrary <br>
?x :: ?'a (the type generalization is subject to Hindley-Milner <br>
polymorphism).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, I think I want to have almost the functionality of the <br>

</blockquote>
<p>See implementation manual section 6.3 on Goal.prove.  It allows you to <br>
provide fixes and assumes just like a toplevel statement, but that needs <br>
to be explicit in Isabelle/ML.  You can also build up the context <br>
separately, and export proven results from it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but as this raises an error when the tactic fails it doesn't quite fit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't understand that.  It seems to refer implicitly to a particular <br>
approach used here.  Do you want to use local variables within a tactic?<br>
Then just fix them, and export whatever you prove, and they become <br>
schematic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seems like this should be quite simple to do, perhaps this is what <br>
Thm.generalize is for?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thm.generalize is a primitive inference, so it is primitive, not simple. <br>
You can ignore that, unless you want to understand the implementation of <br>
the system.  Mixing primitive things with the simple high-level things <br>
usually leads to something complicated.</p>

I don't know about recent versions of Isabelle, but in Isabelle2005 the <br>
function Drule.standard does this (plus some other useful things).</p>
<p>I see subsequent emails in the thread talk about contexts - again I <br>
don't know about subsequent versions of Isabelle, but in Isabelle 2005 <br>
contexts (as I understand the way the word is used nowadays) are not <br>
part of a theorem.</p>
<p>Of course current versions of Isabelle may use different functions to do <br>
this, and possibly it may not be so easy nowadays</p>

What you call "Isar" above is merely the tactic script emulation, which is <br>
also called "apply-style" occasionally.  This is a minimal standard from <br>
around 2002, but your ML scripts follow the one of 1998.  Proper Isar <br>
proofs are something else.</p>
<p>In old versions of Isabelle there is even some perl script to help in the <br>
semi-automatic conversion, cf. "isabelle convert" in Isabelle2005, but it <br>
was deleted later since it is long obsolete.</p>
<p>This thread is now once again where it gets since 10 years or so: after 15 <br>
years of introducing a new Isabelle theory format, to replace the old <br>
Foo.thy/Foo.ML pair, someone is still using something that hardly anybody <br>
else remembers or cares about.</p>

<p>In exceptional situations yes. Otherwise, we prefer structured Isar over apply style, but do not mandate it. Currently about 3% of the files in the AFP are ML (50 out of 1663, 6 files use ML embedded in .thy).</p>

No, Isabelle2005 has the same notion of global background context (type <br>
"theory") and local proof context (type "Proof.context"), it also has <br>
locales and other applications of local context routinely available.  The <br>
thing that is part of the thm is merely a certificate of the background <br>
theory, not a proper context.  (It is merely a historical accident that <br>
the certificate also contains the full background theory content, not just <br>
its identification stamp.)</p>
<p>Drule.standard was already disruptive to local situations in Isabelle2005, <br>
but many more tools were not properly localized, so it did not stand out <br>
particularly.</p>
<p>Starting with Isabelle2007, old things were systematically removed under <br>
the label of "localization".  That is a long story and still not finished, <br>
but the system is continously converging to a fully local context <br>
displiciple for all proof tools and definitional packages.</p>
<p>The jump from Isabelle2005 to Isabelle2007 (with 25 months distance) also <br>
marks the point where really ancient things from the 1990-ies were <br>
removed. This is the deeper reason why you are yourself still stuck with <br>
it, since it is possible to pretend that it is Isabelle98.</p>
<p>Consequently we have every few months a thread on this mailing list to <br>
uncover features of historic Isabelle versions that hardly anybody <br>
remembers anymore.</p>

Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>Although you say "No", you seem to be agreeing with me that a theorem in <br>
Isabelle2005 is associated with a global background context (type <br>
"theory") and not a local proof context (type "Proof.context") (I take <br>
it that this is the same thing as a "proper context").</p>
<p>More importantly you seem to regard things from the 1990-ies as really <br>
ancient.  While that may be so in the context of computer hardware, it's <br>
not so in the context of mathematical proofs. The pen and paper <br>
mathematical proofs I did in the 1970s are still 100% useful today, and <br>
that's the way I want it to be.</p>
<p>Jeremy</p>

<p>Yes, type thm has a back-reference to some background theory.  This is its <br>
certificate in the sense of the LCF kernel.  It is not a proper context. <br>

<p>In contrast, a proper context has type Proof.context, and is separate from <br>
type thm. When you work with formal entities (typ, term, thm) in <br>

context is required for all non-trivial operations: parsing, printing, <br>
advanced proof tools.</p>
<p>If you don't have a proper context, that's bad, but there is no problem to <br>

<p>Hi Makarius,</p>

<p>Whether they are proofs is a question which others might debate, and <br>
have done so, at least since the proof of the four-colour theorem, if <br>
not before.  Whether they can be read today (without running them on an <br>
Isabelle system) - with only the greatest of difficulty. They're to be <br>
run on an appropriate system. Reading their source is more difficult <br>
than a document in LaTex or HTML, easier than a document in PostScript <br>
or PDF.  And I can read (on the computer) documents dating from 2005 in <br>
all of these formats without "struggling days or weeks to make [the 2005 <br>
versions of interpreters of those languages] run on current systems".  <br>
My whole point is that it should NOT be difficult for anyone to run <br>
proofs today which were written in 2005 (or, indeed, much earlier).</p>
<p>And of course if I were to write out _all_ the steps of the proofs I've <br>
done recently, whether in Isar, or any other language without (eg) <br>
TRYALL (EVERY' [ ....]) there would be hundreds of thousands of lines of <br>
code, so no-one would read it anyway, so I don't actually see what your <br>
point is in asking whether anyone can read my proofs. Isar proofs <br>
wouldn't (and, within reason, couldn't) be read either.</p>

<p>That problem is de-facto solved since 2004: Isabelle/AFP <a href="http://afp.sf.net">http://afp.sf.net</a></p>
<p>You merely need to put your material into shape (according to minimal <br>
standards that are routine today) and submit it to the editors of the <br>
archive.  Afterwards it is usually maintained "automagically" to work with <br>
current Isabelle versions, but in extreme cases the editors might ask for <br>
you for assistance.</p>
<p>Thus you can see old Isabelle applications from the late 1990-ies fresh <br>
and running on Isabelle2013-2, e.g. see the 2004 edition where the <br>
archive was started by importing material from previous years.</p>

<p>That was merely an attempt to close the circle on this thread.  It started <br>
out about proper treatment of fixed and schematic variables in Isabelle <br>
today, using a proper Proof.context.  That is quite different from the <br>
all-global nothing-local situation in Isabelle98, which we should better <br>
forget here.</p>

Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>I've been told similar things on occasions before, and it turns out not <br>
to be true.  Unless (in this case), your "minimal standards" means <br>
rewriting everything in Isar.  Which, as my previous email pointed out, <br>
is not on, since I'm guessing my latest effort involves three to four <br>
hundred thousand tactic applications.</p>
<p>If I'm wrong about this, please clarify</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jeremy</p>
