<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:peter.lammich@uni-muenster.de">peter.lammich@uni-muenster.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>I encountered a problem/bug(?) with locales and imported theories.<br>
I have four theories:<br>
  def: Defines a locale<br>
  add: Adds some lemma to the locale<br>
  inst: Interprets the locale, but does <em>not</em> import add<br>
  use: Imports add and inst</p>
<p>The problem is, that I need to use the added lemma in the<br>
interpretation. However, it is not visible in the theory "use".<br>
Even more strange things happen, if I try to reinterpret the locale in<br>
theory "use": The re-interpretation (done with a different prefix name)<br>
adds no lemmas, neither the ones originally defined in the locale, nor the<br>
ones added by the theory "add".</p>
<p>The only workarounds that I can currently figure out is instantiating<br>
the missing lemmas by hand, i.e. lemmas xyz_lem = locale_name.lem[OF<br>
xyz_is_interp] or trying to change the structure of the imports-graph.<br>
Is there some better method how to get the desired lemmas, especially<br>
the ones that are declared as [simp] and hence should be filled into the<br>
simpset?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
  Peter</p>
<p>Here follows a boiled-down example: (I also attached a tgz with the four<br>
thy-files)</p>
<p>theory "use"<br>
imports inst add<br>
begin</p>
<p>thm int.orig   -- "Works"<br>
  thm l.added    -- "The theorem is in the locale"<br>
  (* thm int.added  -- "Does not work ... ok, would have to be merged on<br>
import" *)</p>
<p>interpretation xxx: l .</p>
<p>-- "The namespace below xxx seems to be empty ?"<br>
  thm xxx.orig  -- "Does not work"<br>
  thm xxx.added -- "Does not work"</p>
<p>end</p>
<hr>
<p>theory "def"<br>
imports Main<br>
begin<br>
  locale l<br>
  begin<br>
    lemma orig: True ..</p>
<p>end<br>
end</p>
<hr>
<p>theory add<br>
imports "def"<br>
begin</p>
<p>context l begin<br>
    lemma added: "x=x" ..<br>
  end</p>
<p>end</p>
<hr>
<p>theory inst<br>
imports "def"<br>
begin</p>
<p>interpretation int: l .</p>
<p>thm int.orig</p>
<p>end</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>This is a long-standing bug in Isabelle's implementation of locales.<br>
It was discussed briefly on the mailing list in February 2008:</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2008-February/msg00001.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2008-February/msg00001.html</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Those are exactly the two workarounds that Clemens Ballarin suggested<br>
on the list last February. I'm afraid the situation with the locale<br>
package has not changed, so one of those workarounds will still be<br>
necessary. Of the two, making the import structure more linear is<br>
probably the easiest one to use. The drawback is that it introduces a<br>
lot of extra theory dependencies that shouldn't be there. (For much of<br>
Isabelle's history, import graphs were required to be totally-ordered,<br>
and most of the packages were apparently designed with this in mind.<br>
The locale package is not the only package in Isabelle that doesn't<br>
handle theory merges very well.)</p>

<p>Brian was so kind to dig out my answer to an earlier enquiry of the  <br>

<p>It is not possible to force the re-interpretation of a locale  <br>
instance.  In fact, the interpretation does not take place for any  <br>
locale fragments that are subsumed by existing interpretations (also  <br>
indirect ones created by sublocale).</p>

<p>If you want too keep the diamond theory hierarchy because "inst"  <br>
contains a lengthy proof of the interpretation theorem, you might  <br>
consider leaving the proof in "inst" but move the interpretation to  <br>
"use".  This is, however, not going to work very well if you have a  <br>
hierarchy of locales.</p>

<p>At the very least, I think I can safely say that when locales and<br>
interpretations are used together with theory merges, the result is<br>
often not what users expect.</p>
<p>The issue stems from the interaction between two Isabelle features<br>
(locales and theory-merging), so I guess I shouldn't have called it a<br>
bug in the locale package; it could just as well be called a bug in<br>
Isabelle's theory-merging feature.</p>

<p>After thinking about this a bit more, I now see a situation where<br>
"rounding up" interpretations during merges could cause problems. The<br>
problem is that the same "merge" could happen in more than one place.<br>
Here's an example:</p>
<p>theory A  (defines locale "foo")<br>
theory B imports A (proves lemma "bar" in locale 'foo")<br>
theory C imports A (interpretation "baz" of locale "foo")<br>
theory D imports B C (merge creates lemma "<a href="http://baz.bar">baz.bar</a>")<br>
theory D' imports B C (merge creates another lemma "<a href="http://baz.bar">baz.bar</a>")<br>
theory E imports D D' (???)</p>
<p>Maybe the duplicate lemmas aren't such a big problem, but as you<br>
pointed out, the locales could have syntax or other declarations that<br>
operate on the theory context in arbitrary ways.</p>
<p>If there is not a good solution to the locale/theory-merge issue, then<br>
I think it should be made clear in the documentation that using<br>
locales together with theory-merges is <em>not supported</em>.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Theory merge does nothing more than delegate the actual merge operation to <br>
theory data provided in user space (here the locale mechanism).  So there <br>
cannot be a bug "in" Isabelle's theory merge feature, but you could call <br>
the whole feature a bug, because it raises delicate questions (which is a <br>
well-known fact).  But then, "feature" and "bug" are really synonyms, and <br>
life can be generally simplified by deleting both words from one's <br>
dictionary (which I have done many years ago).</p>
<p>BTW, the locale mechanism is properly called a "target" (of the local <br>
theory framework).  A "package" is something that implements a <br>
specification mechanism that lives within such a target, e.g. 'inductive', <br>
'function', 'primrec'.</p>
