<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Randy,</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice, which was very helpful.<br>
In an email sent privately, somebody else also pointed out the importance of <br>
Twelf as a logical framework system, and mentioned various logical frameworks <br>
by Robin Adams as well as Beluga.<br>
I have added Twelf to the graph (and a footnote on p. 3) and compiled my <br>
research results further below.</p>
<p>The reason why I haven't studied the details of logical frameworks yet is that <br>
there are two both legitimate, although conflicting methods of representing <br>
mathematics, and logical frameworks clearly belong to the second method <br>
(top-down), which is based on the first method (bottom-up).</p>
<p>For example, in Isabelle's metalogic M by Larry Paulson, the Eigenvariable <br>
conditions appear as two distinct (independent) conditions:<br>
"Eigenvariable conditions:<br>
∀I: provided x not free in the assumptions<br>
∃E: provided x not free in B or in any assumption save A"<br>
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-130.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-130.pdf</a>, p. 19<br>
(The object logic serving as an example here is intuitionistic first-order <br>
logic.)</p>
<p>By contrast, in the logic Q0 by Peter Andrews, the restrictions in these <br>
(derived) rules have their origin in the substitution procedure of (the <br>
primitive) Rule R', which is valid only provided that it is not the case that <br>
"x is free in a member of [the set of hypotheses] H and free in [A = B]." <br>
[Andrews, 2002, p. 214].<br>
For the introduction of the universal quantifier, cf. the Rule of Universal <br>
Generalization (Gen) (Theorem 5220 in [Andrews, 2002, p. 222]).<br>
For the elimination of the existential quantifier, cf. Rule C (Theorem 5245 in <br>
[Andrews, 2002, p. 230]). (Note that Andrews' Rule C covers all cases, and <br>
Paulson's rule ∃E only the special case x=y of Rule C.)</p>
<p>Hence, in a bottom-up representation (like Q0) - unlike in a top-down <br>
representation (like Isabelle's metalogic M) - it is possible to trace the <br>
origin of the two Eigenvariable conditions back to a common root, i.e., the <br>
restriction in Rule R'.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, in order to fully reveal the underlying philosophical <br>
principles, a bottom-up representation is required, which follows the principle <br>
of "expressiveness" (Andrews). I prefer the term "reducibility"; John Harrison <br>
uses the term "decomposition": "complex inference rules which ultimately <br>
decompose to these primitives".<br>
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/papers/reflect.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/papers/reflect.pdf</a>, p. 1 (PDF p. 2)</p>
<p>A bottom-up representation (which is better suited for foundational research) <br>
is clearly a Hilbert-style system: It has the elegance of having only a few <br>
rules of inference (in Q0 even only a single rule of inference - Andy Pitts: <br>
"From a logical point of view, it would be better to have a simpler <br>
substitution primitive, such as 'Rule R' of Andrews' logic Q0, and then to <br>
derive more complex rules from it." [Gordon and Melham, 1993, p. 213]). <br>
Metatheorems are not expressible within the formalism; the metatheorems are <br>
literally "meta" ("above" - i.e., outside of - the logic). In software <br>
implementations of Q0 or descendants (Prooftoys by Cris Perdue or my R0 <br>
implementation), the metalogical turnstile (⊢) symbol is replaced by the <br>
logical implication, which shows the tendency to eliminate metalogical elements <br>
from the formal language.</p>
<p>A top-down representation (which is better suited for applied mathematics: <br>
interactive/automated theorem proving) is either a natural deduction system <br>
(like HOL) or a logical framework (like Isabelle): It has a proliferation of <br>
rules of inference (e.g., eight rules for HOL [cf. Gordon and Melham, 1993, pp. <br>
212 f.]). Metalogical properties (metatheorems) are expressible to a certain <br>
extent, e.g., using the turnstile (⊢) symbol (the conditionals / the parts <br>
before the turnstile may differ in the hypothesis and the conclusion), or the <br>
meta-implication (⇒) in Isabelle's metalogic M (not to be confused with the <br>
implication (⊃) of the object-logic), see<br>
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-130.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-130.pdf</a>, p. 4<br>
Unfortunately, the gain of expressiveness in terms of metalogical properties by <br>
making metatheorems symbolically representable is obtained at the price of <br>
philosophical rigor and elegance in expressing the underlying object logic <br>
(object language).</p>
<p>In summary, since the top-down representations (capable of expressing <br>
metatheorems) are based on the corresponding bottom-up representation (object <br>
logic), the bottom-up representation has to be studied first before unraveling <br>
further dependencies in a top-down representation. I believe Q0 or some <br>
descendant of it to be such a basis for reducing mathematics to formal logic as <br>
intended in Russell's philosophical program of logicism.</p>

<p>According to Pfenning and Elliott (1988), higher-order abstract syntax has an <br>
even more expressive power than Isabelle's λ-calculus: "Isabelle [18] uses a <br>
representation similar to ours for the statement of rules, and uses <br>
higher-order unification for deduction. Isabelle's λ-calculus representation <br>
does not have the expressive power of higher-order abstract syntax, but <br>
explicitly encodes quantifier dependencies."</p>
