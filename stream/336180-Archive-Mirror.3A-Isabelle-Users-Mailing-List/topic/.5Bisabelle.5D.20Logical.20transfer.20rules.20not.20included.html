<p>From: Daniel Raggi &lt;<a href="mailto:danielraggi@gmail.com">danielraggi@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
In my extensive use of the transfer package I have found that there are<br>
many logical transfer rules that are not included in the original package.<br>
For example, I think only the first one of the following rules is included:</p>
<p>"(op = ===&gt; op = ===&gt; op --&gt;) op /\ op /\"<br>
"(op --&gt; ===&gt; op --&gt; ===&gt; op --&gt;) op /\ op /\"<br>
"(op --&gt; ===&gt; op = ===&gt; op --&gt;) op /\ op /\"<br>
"(op = ===&gt; op --&gt; ===&gt; op --&gt;) op /\ op /\"</p>
<p>In general, for all logical operators, only a very small fraction of all<br>
the combinations of equivalence, implication and reverse implication are<br>
included.</p>
<p>I first noticed this because I have some transformation not going through,<br>
so I added what I needed. After a closer analysis of all the similar<br>
missing rules I've added &gt;20. However, after using transfer' with the<br>
extended set of rules I've realised that there might be a good reason why<br>
they were left out. With complex goal statements, the number of possible<br>
transformations using transfer' method becomes very large. After adding<br>
these rules, the tactics I've been working on (which have to deal with a<br>
lot of transformations and choose a specific one according to heuristics)<br>
have become understandably slow to go through.</p>
<p>So my main questions are:<br>
1) is it known that these transfer rules were left out?<br>
2) if so, where they deliberately left out?</p>
<p>I would appreciate any other comments related to this.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Daniel</p>
