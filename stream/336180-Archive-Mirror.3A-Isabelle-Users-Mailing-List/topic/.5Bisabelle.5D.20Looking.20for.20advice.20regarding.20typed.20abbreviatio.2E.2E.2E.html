<p>From: Rafal Kolanski &lt;<a href="mailto:rafalk@cse.unsw.edu.au">rafalk@cse.unsw.edu.au</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle Gurus,</p>
<p>I'm trying to put together a representation of C structures using <br>
records, coupled with a memory model that involves pointers. There is an <br>
operation I'm trying to express elegantly, however, that is giving me <br>
quite a bit of trouble: dereference-and-get-address-of-field.</p>
<p>For example take these two C structures:<br>
struct A {<br>
   char z;<br>
};<br>
struct B {<br>
   int x;<br>
   struct A y;<br>
};<br>
These have correspondingly obvious isabelle record representations (with <br>
names prefixed to prevent collisions).</p>
<p>If we have some variable "sa" holding a pointer to a struct A in memory, <br>
then the dereference-and-get-address-of-field operator (denoted &amp;-&gt;) <br>
should look something like this: sa&amp;-&gt;''x''<br>
representing the C code: &amp;(sa-&gt;x)<br>
This will add the structure offset of field "x" to the address contained <br>
in the pointer "sa" and retype it as a pointer to an int.</p>
<p>Doing the one-step case, as with "x" is possible using overloaded <br>
functions with a manual constraint on the return type, but what I really <br>
want is chaining, for example:<br>
   sa&amp;-&gt;y&amp;-&gt;z should give a char pointer of z within struct A within <br>
struct B.</p>
<p>This is where I'm completely stuck. In my case, a "pointer" is just an <br>
address with a phantom type variable representing the type of value it <br>
points to. I have a function per record that given a string name of the <br>
field, gives its offset within the corresponding structure. I have a <br>
function that given a variable pointing to a structure of some type, <br>
returns the relevant lookup function. The problem is the return value, <br>
since it's type varies based on which field name one requests.</p>
<p>I am aware that this is probably not the neatest way to go about it. <br>
However, I really want to have a nice-looking textual representation for <br>
the user, and ugly details under the carpet if necessary to make that <br>
possible.</p>
<p>The generic problem boils down to (simplified pseudo-Isabelle):</p>
<p>consts (overloaded)<br>
   get_lookup_table_for :: "'a itself =&gt; string =&gt; 'b"<br>
consts (overloaded)<br>
   -- "lookup table for structure A"<br>
   lookup_A :: "'a ptr =&gt; string =&gt; 'b ptr"<br>
   -- "lookup table for structure B"<br>
   lookup_B :: "'a ptr =&gt; string =&gt; 'b ptr"<br>
then define:<br>
   "get_lookup_table_for TYPE(A) = lookup_A"<br>
   "get_lookup_table_for TYPE(B) = lookup_B"<br>
   "lookup_A p ''y'' = (ptr_add p 4)::(B ptr)"<br>
   "lookup_B p ''z'' = (ptr_add p 0)::(char ptr)"</p>
<p>to finally get a function:<br>
   "lookup p name = get_lookup_table_for (TYPE(p)) p name"<br>
which can be chained like so:<br>
   lookup (lookup sa ''y'') ''z''<br>
and that should give something, which will either have the type "char <br>
ptr" inferred, or, if constrained to type "char ptr" can still be <br>
reasoned about.</p>
<p>I wish to avoid having to constrain the type returned by almost every <br>
single structure field lookup when annotating code.</p>
<p>As such, I welcome <em>any</em> method which will work, no matter how clunky. <br>
If it involves ML hackery, no problem.</p>
<p>Would any of you have some kind of recommendation for me? I saw some <br>
posts a while back about doing syntax translations pre and post type <br>
checking, but I'm unsure how to apply them to this situation seeing as I <br>
need the type of "sa" to be able to infer the type of the lookup result.</p>
<p>Sincerely hopeful,</p>
<p>Rafal Kolanski.</p>

I think syntax translations during type checking might solve your problem. <br>
However, I feel that you need a more general framework than the one by Christian <br>
Sternagel. In his approach, the overloaded constant is replaced during type <br>
checking with another constant whose type is more specific. AFAIK this approach <br>
works as follows when it encounters an overloaded constant c during parsing:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1st) Determine the type constraints on c (from surrounding applications/type <br>
annotations etc.)<br>
2nd) Check whether these constraints unify with one of the registered <br>
translations. If so, replace c appropriately.<br>
3rd) After type checking, raise an error if c still occurs literally in the term.</p>
<p>Your problem looks a bit more difficult because the return type of the <br>
overloaded lookup constant not only depends on the arguments' types, but also on <br>
the value. For exmple, suppose that the type of sa is known as<br>
"B ptr". What should be the type of "lookup sa x" in<br>
"x = ''y'' | x = ''z'' --&gt; lookup sa x = ..."?</p>
<p>However, if you only need to succeed in type checking lookup terms when the <br>
second argument is given as a literal string, a similar approach might work.<br>
Instead of looking at the type constraints, you would have to match for term <br>
pattern</p>
<p>Const ("lookup", _) $<br>
(_, &lt;ML representation of "B ptr"&gt;) $<br>
(Const ("Cons", _) $<br>
   (Const ("String.char.Char", _) $ ... ))</p>
<p>and replace this with a specialized constant<br>
lookup_B_y defined as</p>
<p>lookup_B_y p = (ptr_add p 4)::(A ptr)"</p>
<p>If this solves your problem, there might be an even simpler solution: Make the <br>
field name parameter part of the lookup function name. Every struct declaration <br>
gets translated to a list of dereference functions. In your example:</p>
<p>definition lookup_A_z :: "A ptr =&gt; char ptr" ("_&amp;-&gt;''''z''''")<br>
where "lookup_A_z p == ptr_add p 0"</p>
<p>definition lookup_B_x :: "B ptr =&gt; int ptr" ("_&amp;-&gt;''''x''''")<br>
where "lookup_B_x p == ptr_add p 0"</p>
<p>definition lookup_B_y :: "B ptr =&gt; A ptr" ("_&amp;-&gt;''''y''''")<br>
where "lookup_B_y p == ptr_add p 4"</p>
<p>Then, "(p&amp;-&gt;''y'')&amp;-&gt;''z''" should type check and have type "char ptr", although <br>
I have not tested this yet.<br>
Note that if you have multiple structs with the same field name, say</p>
<p>struct C { char x; }</p>
<p>you will get another definition</p>
<p>definition lookup_C_x :: "C ptr =&gt; char ptr" ("_&amp;-&gt;''''x''''")<br>
where "lookup_C_x == ptr_add p 0"</p>
<p>Now, "p&amp;-&gt;''x''" will produce two parse trees, but in most cases, only one will <br>
be type correct.  If this happens multiple times, parsing becomes increadibly <br>
slow because the number of parse trees grows exponentially. In that case, you <br>
can have an overloaded constant for every field name and use Christian <br>
Sternagel's solution. You only need to register translations for "_&amp;-&gt;''x''" and <br>
"_&amp;-&gt;''y''" etc.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
Andreas</p>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu">andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Rafal,</p>
<p>The approach is the same as the adhoc overloading facility by Christian <br>
Sternagel (in the current development version in <br>
~~/src/Tools/Adhoc_Overloading). This mechanism adds the translation via <br>
Syntax.add_term_check to the type checking phase of terms (and similarly the <br>
inverse translation to the printing phase). For more information on this, see <br>
the thread on the mailing list starting with this post:<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2010-May/msg00055.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2010-May/msg00055.html</a></p>
<p>At this very point in the type checking phase, you'd have to replace the generic <br>
constant "lookup" with specialized versions like "lookup_B_y". To determine the <br>
right specialized version, you will need the type of the first parameter and the <br>
value of the second parameter of lookup. Determining the value of the second <br>
parameter could be done with pattern matching. I don't know exactly what the <br>
syntax tree looks like at this stage, but you should be able to find that out.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Andreas</p>
