<p>The 9th International Conference on<br>
      MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>MKM 2010</p>
<p><a href="http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/mkm/">http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/mkm/</a></p>
<p>CNAM, Paris, France, 8th-10th July 2010</p>
<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>Mathematical Knowledge Management is an innovative field at the<br>
intersection of mathematics, computer science, library science, and<br>
scientific publishing. Its development is driven, on the one hand, by<br>
new technological possibilities which computer science, the Internet,<br>
and intelligent knowledge processing offer, and, on the other hand, by<br>
the increasing demand by engineers and scientists for new techniques to<br>
help in producing, transmitting, consuming, and managing sophisticated<br>
mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p>The conference is concerned with all aspects of mathematical knowledge<br>
management. Topics covered include, but are not limited to:.</p>
<ul>
<li>Representations of mathematical knowledge</li>
<li>Repositories of formalized mathematics</li>
<li>Mathematical digital libraries</li>
<li>Diagrammatic representations</li>
<li>Multi-modal representations</li>
<li>Mathematical OCR</li>
<li>Mathematical search and retrieval</li>
<li>Deduction systems</li>
<li>Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems</li>
<li>Authoring languages and tools</li>
<li>MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards</li>
<li>Web presentation of mathematics</li>
<li>Data mining, discovery, theory exploration</li>
<li>Computer algebra systems</li>
<li>Collaboration tools for mathematics</li>
<li>Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>MKM 2010 welcomes research papers and workshop proposals with links to<br>
the above topics. The conference proceedings will be published in the<br>
Springer-Verlag series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI).</p>
<p>More information about the MKM conference series can be found at the MKM<br>
Interest Group Webpage: <a href="http://www.mkm-ig.org/">http://www.mkm-ig.org/</a></p>
<p>Submission Categories<br>
=====================</p>
<p>Papers may be submitted in one of three categories: full papers, short<br>
papers or system descriptions.</p>
<p>Both full papers and system descriptions should not exceed 15 pages,<br>
must be original and not be submitted for consideration elsewhere. Full<br>
or system description papers that are accepted will be published in the<br>
conference proceedings. A submission not accepted as a full paper or<br>
system description will automatically be considered as a short paper.</p>
<p>Short papers are of a less formal nature. They are intended to provide a<br>
forum for the presentation and discussion of works in progress or ideas<br>
that are not (yet) in a suitable form for submission as a full or system<br>
description paper. They may be up to 5 pages in LNCS style. Depending on<br>
the number of short papers accepted, presentation may be as a short talk<br>
or as a poster. It will be at the discretion of the programme committee<br>
to decide whether individual short papers will be accepted for<br>
presentation only or for presentation and publication in the conference<br>
proceedings.</p>
<p>The development of working systems in the field of Mathematical<br>
Knowledge Management is a major undertaking of significant value to our<br>
community. Papers describing such systems, however, are particularly<br>
difficult to compare to non-system development based research with<br>
respect to criteria common in reviewing. For this reason, papers in the<br>
system description category will be considered separately and an<br>
evaluation of their special contribution with be taken into account in<br>
the review process.</p>
<p>Review Process<br>
==============</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Authors must submit an abstract by the abstract submission date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The full paper, of any of the three categories, should be received by<br>
  the paper submission date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authors will then be sent initial reviews of their submissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authors then have the option of, within one week, submitting a single<br>
  response to the reviews, limited to 500 words, in which they can<br>
  clarify any issues or anser any questions that the reviewers had about<br>
  their submission. This response can be submitted only once and cannot<br>
  thereafter be resubmitted or modified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final reviews and acceptance rejection decisions will be sent to the<br>
  authors by the final notification date.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Springer-Verlag.</p>
<p>Submission Details<br>
==================</p>
<p>By submitting a paper the authors agree that if it is accepted at least<br>
one of the authors will attend the conference to present it.</p>
<p>All submissions (except workshop proposals) must be formatted according<br>
to the guidelines used by Springer Verlag for their LNCS and LNAI<br>
series. This format can be found at<br>
