<p>From: "Eugene W. Stark" &lt;<a href="mailto:isabelle-users@starkeffect.com">isabelle-users@starkeffect.com</a>&gt;<br>
I have posted (and seen postings) about this general type of thing here before,<br>
but I am getting a more refined view of what seems to me to be a problem and want<br>
to ask again and provide some data points.</p>
<p>I am running Isabelle 2016 under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  I am using the 64-bit<br>
version on two similar machines, both of which are Intel(R) Core(TM)<br>
i5-4670K CPU @ 3.40GHz (4 cores).  One machine has 24GB RAM, and I have<br>
limited the ML heap to 16GB to avoid spamming other activities, and the other<br>
machine has 16GB RAM, and I have limited the ML heap to 8GB for the same<br>
reason.  The problem I am describing occurs on both machines, but for definiteness,<br>
the screenshots I took today were done on the 16GB machine.</p>
<p>The problem is that, during sledgehammering using "try" it seems that ML will<br>
go "incommunicado" for minutes at a time, and it is hard to figure out why.<br>
During this period the CPU usage ranges anywhere from 100% to 400%, where 100%<br>
means one core.  Based on previous postings, I would normally assume that it is<br>
due to a major GC taking place, but also during these periods, the "Monitor"<br>
window in JEdit does not receive any data updates from ML.  Once ML has come<br>
back online, the Monitor window starts receiving data again, but it interpolates<br>
the missing data by a line.  This makes it difficult to understand exactly what<br>
is going on.  I don't really know whether there are any conditions under which<br>
it is supposed to be the case that ML will stop sending data points to the<br>
Monitor window, but it seems odd to me.  Of course, the long pause for an<br>
unknown period is also frustrating, and in many cases I just terminate and<br>
restart Isabelle, substituting the known wait for my theories to be reloaded and<br>
rechecked for the unknown wait for ML to return.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, Isabelle memory use is limited, it is honoring the limits,<br>
paging traffic is low, and CPU utilization is high, so it is not a thrashing<br>
situation that is taking place.</p>
<p>I am attaching some screenshots that I took today when I let the sledghammering<br>
run for awhile through multiple cycles of this behavior.<br>

<p>On the snapshot from the "Heap" window, you can see spikes in memory <br>
usage, leading to what appears to be a major GC.  Upon completion of the <br>
major GC, the "freeze" sets in, and no data is sent to the monitor for <br>
several minutes. When the data resumes, the heapsize is much lower, but <br>
quickly spikes up to the max and the cycle repeats.  Because there is no <br>
data during the freeze period, it is difficult to tell what is going on, <br>
but I have to wonder what it is doing during those 3+ minutes when there <br>
is only a short spike of computing activity that takes place before it <br>
starts again.</p>

<p>Could anyone comment on whether this behavior is considered "normal"?</p>

<p>It sounds indeed like a normal consequence of a situation where the ML <br>
heap is under high pressure: tons of data produced and the GC + heap <br>
compaction phases trying to reclaim memory.</p>
<p>When the Poly/ML runtime system performs such GC-related operations, all <br>
ML threads are stopped. The Monitor data is produced by such a regular ML <br>
thread, so nothing will be reported during that time.</p>

<p>I am suspicious of some kind of thread signalling/synchronization issue, <br>

speculate.</p>

<p>From the description of the problem, it does not really look like that. <br>
Although there is always a possibility for something really strange going <br>
on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, my guess from a distance is that "sledgehammer" or "try" <br>
produce more data than expected, potentially due to unusually big <br>
theories. You could also try to reset the machine-learning information in <br>
$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/mash_state.</p>
<p>Since you are using 64bit Poly/ML with substantial amounts of heap space, <br>
the question is what makes the theories so big that this is required. Even <br>
the biggest applications on AFP still fit into the small memory model of <br>
32bit with 3.5 GB heap. There is a penalty of approx. factor 2 in memory <br>
requirements, when switching from 32bit to 64bit.</p>

Hello all,</p>
<p>I have seen the described behaviour too. So far, I know that:<br>
it is linked to MaSh (i.e., MePo does not exhibit this slow-down). You can deactivate the learning in the Sledgehammer options (via the Isabelle options in Isabelle/jEdit or sledgehammer_params).<br>
removing the $ISABELLE_HOME_USER/mash_state file helps.</p>
<p>I have not yet found a deterministic way to reproduce it.</p>
