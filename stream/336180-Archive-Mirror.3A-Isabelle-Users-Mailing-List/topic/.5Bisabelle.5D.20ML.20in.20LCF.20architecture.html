<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Here I am sensing some issues that are specific to the classic HOL family, <br>
not Isabelle nor LCF itself. Looking at the sources of good old Cambridge <br>
LCF (from Larry's website), you have a LISP engine that implements an ML <br>
interpreter that is merely a symbolic computation engine, so ML proof <br>
scripts cannot affect the system integrity itself.</p>
<p>Later HOL implementations have done this differently, by starting with an <br>
off-the-shelf ML system (SML or OCaml) and implementing the prover such <br>
that it shares the ML environment with user tools and proof scripts. This <br>
has opened a few potential problems of trustworthiness, although I would <br>
call nothing of this really critical.</p>
<p>In Isabelle we have moved more and more away from that raw exposure of ML, <br>
not just by avoiding ML in regular proof scripts. Isabelle/ML is embedded <br>
into a managed context of the Isar infrastructure.  There where numerous <br>
practical demands that motivated that, such as robust undo history and <br>
support for parallel execution.</p>
<p>Taking this approach of to the extreme, one could easily make Isabelle/ML <br>
a sandboxed environment for purely symbolic computations, without any <br>
access to system functions of Standard ML, or the Isabelle/Pure <br>
implementation itself.  As mentioned before, Poly/ML provides robust means <br>
to invoke ML at runtime, such that user code cannot mess up your system <br>
implementation.</p>
<p>Funnily, when Mark encountered the Isabelle tty for the first time some <br>
months ago, his first impulse was to drop out of the managed Isar <br>
environment, in order to have raw access to the underlying ML :-)</p>
<p>BTW, this no longer works in the Isabelle/Scala Prover IDE protocol, but <br>
for other reasons than anxiety about vulnerability of the prover kernel.</p>

<p>Yes, sandboxing would be the ultimate I suppose.  Presumably you mean that<br>
this would involve some versatile API giving the user effectively the power<br>
to extend the theorem prover like in normal LCF-style systems?  But for the<br>
time being, this all sounds a bit complicated, when all that needs to be<br>
done to secure things as far as the domain of normal running of the ML<br>
program is concerned (i.e. ignoring system functions, somehow circumventing<br>
the ML language, OS-type hacks, etc) is to stop certain crucial ML values<br>
and pretty printers from being overwritten, which I think you said was<br>
already possible in Poly/ML.</p>

<p>Yes this is how I understand how things really work.  Maybe I'm just a<br>
low-level command line junkie :-)</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Fine.  So the next step is to see how raw ML implements Isar, and Isar <br>
incorporates ML again, with some sandboxing already in place.  You should <br>
then get some ideas how to implement a secure system, by adding <br>
appropriate infrastructure instead of chopping everything off as in <br>
HOL-Light, and probably also HOL Zero right now.</p>

users can write their own extensions with all the power of ML?</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Yes, the ML inside Isar is the full Poly/ML moderated by some of our <br>
infrastructure.  It is a bit like an operating system that turns the raw <br>
CPU and memory into virtualized versions, such that user space programs <br>
cannot mess up the whole thing, and the whole system becomes much more <br>
useful and powerful than bare metal.</p>
