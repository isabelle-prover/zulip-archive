Mathematical Structures in Computer Science</p>
<p>Special Issue on</p>
<p>Advances and Perspectives in the Mechanization of Mathematics</p>
<p>Guest Editors: Andrea Asperti and Jeremy Avigad</p>
<p>Call for contributions</p>
<p>Recent advances in automated reasoning and interactive theorem proving <br>
have made it possible to formalize and mechanically check substantial <br>
mathematical theorems, such as the prime number theorem, the four color <br>
theorem, and the Jordan curve theorem. In particular, a number of <br>
interactive proof assistants have been developed to help users manage <br>
libraries of definitions and theorems, and fill in the inferential <br>
details of a mathematical argument. Automated methods are also often <br>
used to verify calculations that are too long and complex to check by <br>
hand. As mathematical proofs become more complicated and, increasingly, <br>
rely on extensive calculation, this gives rise to an exciting <br>
interaction between traditional methods and computational means of <br>
verifying mathematical claims.</p>
<p>The present issue is devoted to recent advances and new perspectives in <br>
this field, including descriptions of formalizations, thoughtful <br>
reflection on the future of the discipline, novel insights, innovative <br>
research directions, and critical assessments of the current state of <br>
the art.</p>
<p>Deadlines</p>
<p>Deadline for submissions: June 28, 2010<br>
Author's notification: September 27, 2010</p>
<p>Submissions:</p>
<p>All papers should be written in pdf and submitted via the EasyChair <br>
system, accessible at the following address: <br>
<a href="https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=mscsadvancesandperspectivesint">https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=mscsadvancesandperspectivesint</a><br>
Authors are invited to write their papers following the mscs <br>
instructions available in the MSCS guide for contributors downloadable <br>
here: <a href="http://assets.cambridge.org/MSC/MSC_ifc.pdf">http://assets.cambridge.org/MSC/MSC_ifc.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Extended versions of work previously published in conference proceedings <br>
are eligible for submission but authors should make it clear how their <br>
submission improves upon the conference publication; in those cases <br>
where Cambridge University Press is not the publisher of the original <br>
conference proceedings, authors should take care to avoid infringing <br>
that publisher's copyright. Authors who wish to discuss potential <br>
submissions are encouraged to contact the guest editors.</p>
<p>Papers should not be longer than 35 pages; shorter papers are obviously <br>
welcome.</p>
