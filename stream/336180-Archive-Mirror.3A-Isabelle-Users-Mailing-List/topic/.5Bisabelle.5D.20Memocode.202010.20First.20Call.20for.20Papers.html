<hr>
<p>The eighth MEMOCODE conference will attract researchers and <br>
practitioners who create methods, tools, and architectures for the <br>
design of hardware/software systems. These systems face increasing <br>
design complexity including tighter constraints on timing, power, costs, <br>
and reliability. MEMOCODE seeks submissions that present novel formal <br>
methods and design techniques addressing these issues to create, refine, <br>
and verify hardware/software systems. We also invite <br>
application-oriented papers, and especially encourage submissions that <br>
highlight the design perspective of formal methods and models, including <br>
success stories and demonstrations of hardware/software codesign. <br>
Furthermore, we invite poster presentations describing ongoing work with <br>
promising preliminary results.</p>
<p>Topics of interest for regular submissions include but are not limited to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>system- and transaction-level modeling and verification, abstraction <br>
and refinement between different modeling levels, formal, semi-formal, <br>
and specification-driven verification,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>design and verification methods for composition of concurrent systems: <br>
multi-core platform architectures, systems-on-chip, networks-on-chip,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>non-traditional and domain-specific design languages for hardware and <br>
software, novel models of computation, and new design paradigms that <br>
unify hardware and software design,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>system-level estimation of performance and power in heterogeneous <br>
hardware/software architectures,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>applications and demonstrators of formal design methodologies and case <br>
studies of innovative system-level design flows, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>modeling and reuse of intellectual property at system-level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PROCEEDINGS:</p>
<p>Conference proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION:</p>
<p>Submissions of research and experience papers will only be accepted <br>
through the conference web site. Papers must not exceed 10 pages and <br>
must be formatted following IEEE Computer Society guidelines. <br>
Submissions must be written in English, describe original work, and not <br>
substantially overlap papers that have been published or are being <br>
submitted to a journal or another conference with published proceedings. <br>
Poster submissions should consist of an abstract of at most 250 words. <br>
The abstract will be distributed to the conference attendants but will <br>
not be published. Note that the poster deadline is different from the <br>
paper deadline.</p>
<p>DESIGN CONTEST:</p>
<p>MEMOCODE will again have a design contest. The contest will start March <br>
1, 2010. The deadline for submission is 31 March 2010 and the <br>
notification of the results is on May 14, 2010. The conference will <br>
sponsor at least two prize categories, each with a significant cash <br>
award. We awarded a $1000 prize in each of the two categories in 2009. <br>
Each team that submits a complete and working entry will be invited to <br>
submit for review a 2-page abstract for the formal conference <br>
proceedings; winning teams will be invited to contribute a 4-page short <br>
paper. Each team submitting a completed and working entry will also <br>
receive a commemorative plaque with their name and results. Please refer <br>
to the conference website for more information and updates.</p>
<p>TUTORIALS:</p>
<p>MEMOCODE will feature tutorials related to hardware/software codesign. <br>
Please send your tutorial proposals to <a href="mailto:alain.girault@inria.fr">alain.girault@inria.fr</a>.</p>
