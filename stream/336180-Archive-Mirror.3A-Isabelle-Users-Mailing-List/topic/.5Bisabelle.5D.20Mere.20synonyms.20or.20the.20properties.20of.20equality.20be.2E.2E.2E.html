<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>Suppose I have three simple theorems:</p>
<p>(1)  theorem the_ordered_pair_property_simp:<br>
        "!u. !v. !r. !s. (u = r &amp; v = s) --&gt; (&lt;u,v&gt; = &lt;r,s&gt;)"<br>
        by simp</p>
<p>(2) theorem "(a = c &amp; b = c) --&gt; a = b"<br>
         by simp</p>
<p>(3) theorem "!u. !v. !A. !B. (A = {u,v} &amp; B = {u,v}) --&gt; A = B"<br>
         by simp</p>
<p>I think my question can be summarized be generalized by this question, <br>
"What do names mean in Isabelle?"</p>
<p>My specific question would be, "Are these theorems that would need to be <br>
proved if they're not restatements of prior theorems in HOL, or do they <br>
come by default because of how name substitution works?"</p>
<p>I see these 4 axioms in HOL.thy:</p>
<p>axiomatization where<br>
      refl: "t = (t::'a)" and<br>
      subst: "s = t \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; P s \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; P t" and<br>
      ext: "(!!x::'a. (f x ::'b) = g x) ==&gt; (%x. f x) = (%x. g x)"<br>
      the_eq_trivial: "(THE x. x = a) = (a::'a)"</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>lemma the_sym_eq_trivial: "(THE y. x=y) = x"</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>lemmas [simp] =<br>
       ...<br>
      the_eq_trivial<br>
      the_sym_eq_trivial</p>
<p>So maybe those last two rules are what simp is using to prove (1), (2), <br>
and (3). And if simp is proving something, it must mean that something <br>
has to be proved, if it hasn't already been proved.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>Your question seems to me to be more about equality and less about names.</p>

<p>No, those two rules are about definite choice (THE), which doesn't appear<br>
anywhere in your three simple theorems above.</p>

<p>Yea, and I think I figured out the proper question. The right question <br>
is not, "Am I proving something, or do I have to prove something?", but <br>
"Does the proof of my theorem require the properties that I want it to <br>
require?"</p>
<p>To make sense of that, here's what I knew was a fairly vacuous statement:</p>
<p>(1) theorem "!u. !v. !r. !s. (r = {u,v}) &amp; (s = {u,v}) --&gt; r = s"<br>
          by simp</p>
<p>But that this isn't:</p>
<p>(2) theorem "!u. !v. !r. r = {u,v} --&gt; (!x. x inS r --&gt; (x = u | x = <br>
v))"<br>
         by(metis upA)</p>
<p>It is best not to use auto proofs in a mindless manner.</p>
<p>I figured out a good test to test whether a theorem is vacuous: put it <br>
before the axioms or theorems that normally make it true. If it's true <br>
by simp there, then there's a good chance that's not the right way to <br>
state your theorem.</p>
<p>This goes back to my past thoughts of what equality means. Equality <br>
doesn't mean identical, because 1/2 = 2/4.  But in normal math, when we <br>
give different names to the same object, we sometimes start <br>
interchanging the names with no appeal to the properties of equality. We <br>
treat the names like synonyms.</p>
<p>The meaning of names aren't ever discussed. That's low-level, and I <br>
started thinking about names after I saw that two congruence classes can <br>
be equal, but yet not "act the same" sometimes.</p>

<p>I'll postpone "choice" for another day, many days into the future.</p>
