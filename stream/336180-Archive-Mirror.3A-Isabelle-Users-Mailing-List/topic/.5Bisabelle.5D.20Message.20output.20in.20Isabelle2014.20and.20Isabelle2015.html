(This is a relaunch of a thread that ended up containing mostly rubbish. <br>
Here is another attempt to shed some light on the factual situation.)</p>
<p>The latter aspect has actually changed here:</p>

description:<br>
non-strict print_state: display old proof state on failure, e.g. <br>
unfinished command;</p>
<p>That is from 09-Jan-2015, and it is the new behaviour in Isabelle2015 on <br>
this thread that was not articulated so far. Try this example in <br>
Isabelle2014 vs. Isabelle2015 to see the difference:</p>
<p>lemma A<br>
   apply fail</p>
<p>Of course, a method application error is also an error, so the old state <br>
is printed first and the error message second.  Thus the error might get <br>
obscured by long proof states, which was the original starting point <br>
above.</p>
<p>The deeper problem is cluttering of Output with too many different things, <br>
and the lack of a dedicated panel just for proof state output. I was <br>
actually thinking about reformed proof state output 1-2 weeks ago, but got <br>
distracted again by the noise here on the mailing list.</p>

<p>Can you explain precisely what you reported for Isabelle2014-RCx?  What <br>
was the "issue" and what was the "fix".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you pointed out, it was already discussed in<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2014-August/msg00115.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2014-August/msg00115.html</a></p>
<p>in the release, the error messages then appeared before the subgoals,<br>
or, more precisely, the subgoals did not appear explicitly at all, but<br>
the error message contained a list of subgoals.</p>
<p>In Isabelle2015, the last goal state before the failing command seems to<br>
get printed, too --- before the error message. This behaviour has a<br>
positive and a negative effect on (my personal) workflow, which somewhat<br>
coincides with your analysis:</p>
<p>Positive: When typing commands, in particular those involving inner<br>
syntax like &lt;have "very-long-term"&gt;, I can see the current goal-state<br>
all the time. In Isabelle2014 you saw "syntax error" or "type error"<br>
most of the time, and had to go back with the cursor to see the<br>
goal-state. I appreciate this behaviour, because, during typing such a<br>
command, you are mostly interested in the previous goal state ... not in<br>
the bogus information that you have a syntax error b/c typing is not<br>
completed yet.</p>
<p>Negative: As already reported before, if you have finished typing the<br>
command, you are expecting that it works. If it does not, you are mostly<br>
interested in the error message, and the proof state of the previous<br>
command is of less importance.</p>
<p>As you point out, this behaviour was introduced in 2015. Note that the<br>
overall problem was introduced with the processing model of PIDE, and<br>
did not exist in Proof-General: There, by issuing a "goto this position"</p>
<ul>
<li>command, you told the IDE that you have finished typing, and now want<br>
to focus on handling the errors.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The deeper problem is cluttering of Output with too many different things, <br>

For those people with large screens, this may be a good solution. It<br>
already worked nicely for PG, where I usually used the "3-pane" mode, or<br>
had three windows: Text, Goal-state, Errors/Warnings. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make up for a nice layout, I would like to dock one panel to<br>
right-top, and the other to right-bottom. Does jedit support such<br>
docking positions, that go beyond left,right,top,bottom?</p>
<p>If you work on a small screen (laptop), you probably still want to have<br>
a mode that consumes less space, and sensibly mixes the outputs.<br>
However, I do not know how a PIDE-like asynchronous IDE can guess what<br>
the user currently wants to see. Perhaps, you could try a heuristics on<br>
the type of error, something like: <br>
Syntax-errors are displayed after the goal-state, failed method errors<br>
before the goal-state.</p>

<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:lammich@in.tum.de">lammich@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
One solution that does not involve too much implementation effort might<br>
be to not include the goal-state into the error message, and output this<br>
shorter error message <em>before</em> the goal-state. </p>
<p>While the user is typing, he would see a short error message that he<br>
could ignore, followed by the goal state. <br>
When the user is inspecting the (error-)result of the command, he would<br>
see the error message first. Warnings should still be printed after the<br>
goal-state</p>

<p>We've had this topic occasionally on the mailing list.  The default <br>
dockable window manager of jEdit can't do that, but it is a general <br>
"framework", so plugins can implement their own policies.  Anybody <br>
interested in some Java/AWT/Swing window management should subscribe to <br>
the jedit-devel mailing list and start a discussion there.</p>
<p>So far I've done myself only very minimalistic tuning of the built-in <br>
window manager, e.g. to add the "Detach" menu item.</p>

<p>In ancient times when Proof General was alive and young (10-15 years ago), <br>
people had rather large displays and power-users even a second display <br>
just for goal state output.</p>
<p>Today people expect to be able to do big things with tiny mobile devices. <br>
With a really high resolution display (4K, 5K, Retina) it might actually <br>
work, if the font size is set to traditional 12px.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The observation by Dmitriy is correct.</p>
<p>The current printing of goal state errors is the result of various reforms <br>
in the past few years. That relatively new behaviour is actually the <br>
reason why I usually do many things without ever looking at the Output <br>
window, often having it closed over a long stretch of time: the message <br>
under the red squiggles usually provides the relevant bits to see what is <br>
missing to finish a proof step.</p>
<p>As already explained on earlier instances of the thread, any built-in <br>
policies to reorder messages in output don't work.  We've had that in <br>
Proof General, and it converged to a big mess over the decades.  In 2007 <br>
that actually caused total existence failure between Proof General 3.x and <br>
4.x.  Then I introduced "isabelle tty" as temporary workaround; then <br>
"isabelle jedit" a bit later.</p>
<p>On a multi-window GUI there is no point to squeeze everything into a <br>
single linear output.  The Query panel already provides a different way to <br>
view a proof state, independently on Output.  Such things are relatively <br>
easy to make, and don't require artificial intelligence from the system to <br>
guess what the user wants to see.</p>

<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:lammich@in.tum.de">lammich@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
So we could extract two feature requests:</p>
<p>1. Allow for a separate errors/warnings and a proof state panel.<br>
Ensure that they can be laid out nicely, such that the user can view<br>
them both simultaneously. In current jedit, the panels could be detached<br>
and the layout been done by the OSs' window manager.</p>
<p>2. Change the current output/proof state panel to display (short<br>
versions of) error messages before warnings. The errors displayed on the<br>
squiggly lines may of course still contain the proof state. I know that<br>
this may be a technical problem, b/c (as far as I know) error messages<br>
are generated by the ML-side, and not touched by the IDE.</p>

<p>From: Tobias Nipkow &lt;<a href="mailto:nipkow@in.tum.de">nipkow@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
I recommend to reread Gerwin's comment on red squiggles in the earlier thread:</p>
<p>I’m not as worried about the scrolling as Peter (you could set goals_limit for <br>
instance, although I’d prefer not to have to), but I do have to point out that <br>
the squiggles can’t be the main interaction mechanism for errors. They are <br>
popups: you have to pick up the mouse, navigate there, and wait to see them. If <br>
the statement is big, the message sometimes obscures what you typed. That's too <br>
disruptive as main mechanism.</p>
<p>It’s good to have the squiggles for errors (esp for position indication), and <br>
they work very well for warnings, but when you’re writing your proof, your brain <br>
doesn’t work as asynchronously as the document model. You will still have your <br>
mental focus at one point and you will still want to see the result of your last <br>
action as quickly as possible and react if it is an error. When you’re writing <br>
the proof, your mental focus is on the output window, so that’s where errors <br>
reports will cause the least mental overhead.</p>
<p>I couldn't agree more.</p>

<p>That is the "AI" approach to messages again.  It has already been <br>

<p>Errors and warnings need to be produced and managed as uniformly as <br>

In Isabelle/jEdit, I've also noticed needing to scroll to see error<br>
messages and goals disappearing when I start typing.  I have been using<br>
multiple views to get everything I want on the screen at once and using<br>
copy paste to keep a snapshot of a goal that I want to look at.</p>
<p>Remainder of this email wanders off topic...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In ancient times when Proof General was alive and young (10-15 years<br>
ago), people had rather large displays and power-users even a second<br>
display just for goal state output.</p>
<p>Today people expect to be able to do big things with tiny mobile devices.<br>
With a really high resolution display (4K, 5K, Retina) it might actually<br>
work, if the font size is set to traditional 12px.</p>

<p>I have run eclipse on my phone and it does work for a "Hello world!" demo<br>
but isn't usable because the interface isn't optimised for touch and using<br>
a mouse and keyboard puts you too far away from the tiny screen.  I think<br>
Isabelle/jEdit would have the same problem on a small high res display.</p>
<p>At work and home, I switched to using 4K TVs for Isabelle/jEdit.  I have<br>
one flat one and one curved one.  The better of the two is the curved one -<br>
a 48" 4K SAMSUNG 48JU6800 (driven by a 9 series NVIDIA GTX @ 60Hz in UHD<br>
colour mode to get 4:4:4 chroma for pixel perfect text).  The curve is<br>
definitely a good thing as the left and right edges seem much farther away<br>
on the flat one even though it is smaller at 40".</p>
<p>Both 4K TVs are very usable at normal monitor sitting distance and about<br>
the same pixel density as traditional monitors so text isn't tiny.</p>
<p>My next step after getting the big screen was to replace my core i7 920<br>
with a (used) Xeon x5680 and overclock it to 4.7 GHz using a new Corsair<br>
H100i cooler and my existing ASUS Rampage II Gene motherboard and Seasonic<br>
M12D PSU.</p>
<p>I used run_tests from seL4 to check stability and benchmark performance and<br>
found that overclocking the RAM also made a significant improvement.</p>
<p>I thought I'd share the details because the big screen and massive<br>
overclock made a huge improvement to usability of Isabelle/jEdit which now<br>
feels fairly snappy.</p>
<p>Also it's a data point indicating available screen real estate for extra<br>
windows for goals and error messages.</p>

I wouldn't call this off topic. It is always interesting to hear about <br>
working user scenarios.</p>
<p>The above sounds like a fairly good machine for the high-end gaming that <br>
interactive theorem proving is today :-)</p>
<p>On my modest 24" Dell 4K monitor (P2415Q) I actually encountered GUI <br>
scaling problems.  Some of my findings are explained in the Isabelle/jEdit <br>
manual section 2.1.2 "Displays with very high resolution", but that is <br>
only a start on that topic.  If there is further experience with <br>
high-resolution GUIs, it is worth a different thread on the mailing list.</p>
<p>The next jEdit release will cope with that better, but it is not yet <br>
available.</p>

<p>I recommend to reread Gerwin's comment on red squiggles in the earlier thread:</p>
<p>I’m not as worried about the scrolling as Peter (you could set goals_limit for<br>
instance, although I’d prefer not to have to), but I do have to point out that<br>
the squiggles can’t be the main interaction mechanism for errors. They are<br>
popups: you have to pick up the mouse, navigate there, and wait to see them.<br>
If the statement is big, the message sometimes obscures what you typed. That's<br>
too disruptive as main mechanism.</p>
<p>It’s good to have the squiggles for errors (esp for position indication), and<br>
they work very well for warnings, but when you’re writing your proof, your<br>
brain doesn’t work as asynchronously as the document model. You will still<br>
have your mental focus at one point and you will still want to see the result<br>
of your last action as quickly as possible and react if it is an error. When<br>
you’re writing the proof, your mental focus is on the output window, so that’s<br>
where errors reports will cause the least mental overhead.</p>

<p>I read that, and it is one of the few things that are not rubbish on the other<br>
thread.</p>

<p>Speak for yourself, but don't insult other contributors to this list. We don't <br>
call red squiggols rubbish either.</p>
