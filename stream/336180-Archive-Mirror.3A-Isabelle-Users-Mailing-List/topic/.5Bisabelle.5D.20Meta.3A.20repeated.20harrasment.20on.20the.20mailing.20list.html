<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>I would like to start a slightly unusual meta-thread. A person named Markus<br>
(Makarius) Wenzel (<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>) has developed a habit of repeatedly<br>
following-up my posts on this mailing list with unpleasant comments with<br>
regard to my character. In particular, he is continuously referring to me<br>
as a 'dummy'. Please find examples in the list below:<br>
<a href="https://mailman46.in.tum.de/pipermail/isabelle-dev/2019-May/016924.html">https://mailman46.in.tum.de/pipermail/isabelle-dev/2019-May/016924.html</a><br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-June/msg00093.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-June/msg00093.html</a><br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-November/msg00099.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-November/msg00099.html</a></p>
<p>According to the Oxford dictionary online, the word dummy has several<br>
meanings. I have extracted the meanings that I consider to be more relevant:</p>
<ol>
<li>a model or replica of a human being/doll</li>
<li>a stupid person</li>
<li>a rubber or plastic teat for a baby to suck on</li>
</ol>
<p>Most certainly, I am a living organism: not a doll or a plastic teat. Also,<br>
I believe that referring to someone as 'stupid' in public for no apparent<br>
reason is both insulting and degrading.</p>
<p>Several months ago, I asked him not to refer to me as a 'dummy' in private<br>
communication. I tried to do so in the most polite manner and, with his<br>
permission, I can display the body of all messages (with the exception of<br>
my signature) that were sent to him. However, my plea was ignored and I was<br>
referred to as a 'dummy' in public almost immediately after sending the<br>
aforementioned email in private (the timing could not have been better).</p>
<p>I believe that he is exhibiting a very inappropriate behavior, especially<br>
given the nature of this mailing list. I would be less concerned about such<br>
comments and behavior on a forum for sports fans or on a forum for a<br>
discussion of alcoholic beverages, for example. However, I believe that<br>
academic forums should demand a certain standard of politeness, tact and<br>
manner of all users. Furthermore, I believe that his comments might be in<br>
violation of the laws of the German Republic, where, to the best of my<br>
knowledge, he resides. In particular, Paragraph 185, Section 14 of the<br>
criminal code of the German Republic (<br>
<a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.pdf">http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.pdf</a>) states:<br>
"An insult shall be punished with imprisonment not exceeding one year or a<br>
fine and, if the insult is committed by means of an assault, with<br>
imprisonment not exceeding two years or a fine." While I have no intention<br>
to pursue a case against him, I believe that it is only in the best<br>
interest of the forum administrators that all users of the forum do not<br>
violate the laws of the country where they reside. Therefore, I would<br>
kindly ask the community and/or the administrators of the mailing list to<br>
take appropriate measures against the unlawful behavior that he continues<br>
to exhibit. Furthermore, ideally, I would like all posts where I am<br>
referred to as a 'dummy' to be removed from the archives of this mailing<br>
list. I believe that the removal of these threads would also be beneficial<br>
for Markus Wenzel, as it would reduce the odds of someone else making a<br>
decision to pursue a criminal case against him.</p>
<p>Overall, Markus Wenzel gives this forum a feeling of a high school<br>
backyard, where he is the toughest bully. I would like to think that I have<br>
had to endure enough bullying in my youth, not to have to do deal with it<br>
ever again (of course, it is very naive of me to think this way...). The<br>
reasons, of course, were different: it was my frail body, my inability to<br>
communicate information verbally as well as most other persons of the<br>
equivalent age and, of course, my interest in sciences. However, a person<br>
in power (whatever is the meaning of the word in a given context) can<br>
always find reasons to bully someone of 'lesser standing'. It could be<br>
one's race, it could be one's religion, it could be one's nationality, it<br>
could be one's disability, it could be the lack of wealth of one's family,<br>
it could be one's profession or social status, or it could simply be a<br>
personal dislike (I have seen and endured more of this than I could wish<br>
upon anyone). Nevertheless, quite frankly, I hold no personal grudge or<br>
resentment towards Markus Wenzel and most other characters who acted<br>
inappropriately towards me in the past. If I was religious, I would have<br>
said "May God have mercy upon their souls", but I am not religious and,<br>
therefore, I will not do it :). Perhaps, given his status in the community,<br>
I would have even acted in a similar manner towards the 'lesser humans<br>
beings'. Nevertheless, I do not like it and the human laws are on my side.<br>
Therefore, I will use all legal means at my disposal to ensure that I am<br>
not harassed ever again.</p>
<p>While the primary reason why I decided to start this thread is, indeed, the<br>
'dummy' references, I believe that Markus Wenzel has repeatedly acted<br>
inappropriately on this mailing list in many other ways. For example, he<br>
has made a number of remarks that were blatantly off-topic in some of the<br>
threads that I started (both for the thread in the narrow sense and for the<br>
Isabelle mailing list in the most general sense). These remarks were<br>
related to Wikipedia articles, anonymity online and general public<br>
policies, but not related to Isabelle or formal methods in any way:<br>
personally, I would consider such posts to be off-topic even if they were<br>
started as an explicit meta-thread on this list. Most professional public<br>
forums (e.g. Stack Overflow) tightly regulate and moderate lengthy<br>
off-topic discussions (including the associated meta forums). I am rather<br>
confident that any user of Stack Overflow/Meta Stack Overflow would be<br>
banned if (s)he repeatedly made posts about (general) Wikipedia articles,<br>
anonymity online or public policies, even though the scope of the website<br>
Stack Overflow is much wider than the scope of this mailing list. Most<br>
certainly, I am not asking for Markus Wenzel to be denied the privilege of<br>
posting on this forum. However, I would like to see the content of the<br>
forum to be regulated more tightly for the benefit of the users.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

I guess this is a typical misunderstanding of non-native speakers. In <br>
Germany the word "dummy" is almost exclusively used for crash test <br>
dummies, which are faceless mannequins. As such the term fits the <br>
appearance of an anonymous person quite well.</p>
<p>In the first linked thread, Makarius also mentioned that he will filter <br>
anonymous addresses from his inbox, so he probably did not get your <br>
request to stop using that term.</p>

<p>This is exactly how I understood Makarius mentioning of "dummy", too.<br>

<p>In essence, this is exactly what I am asking. If a given word can be used<br>
as an insult, then it should never be used with a reference to a person<br>
without a good reason, even more so, if the person has gone out of his way<br>

<p>I am not asking to censor the word "dummy". I am asking not to refer to<br>
other human beings as dummies, that is, I am asking to censor a certain<br>
pattern of behavior. I believe that almost every person would agree that it<br>
is, at least, rude to call another person a dummy, whatever is the intended<br>
meaning of the word. Once again, I would like to repeat that I asked Markus<br>
Wenzel not to use the word "dummy" when referring to me personally and I am<br>
very confident that my message was received by him. As a side remark, this<br>
is the first (non-technical) meta-post that I made on this forum, having<br>
used it for over a year (in fact, it may be the first non-technical<br>
meta-thread that I started on any forum of any kind in my entire life).<br>
However, the number of non-technical and off-topic posts that I received<br>
from Markus Wenzel as replies to the technical threads that I started is<br>
far greater than one. Furthermore, I believe that name-calling without a<br>
cause is "an actual problem that needs to be discussed properly and<br>
carefully", if only as a meta-thread.</p>

states: "An insult shall be punished with imprisonment not exceeding one<br>
year or a fine and, if the insult is committed by means of an assault, with<br>
imprisonment not exceeding two years or a fine." While I have no intention<br>
to pursue a case against him, I believe that it is only in the best<br>
interest of the forum administrators that all users of the forum do not<br>
violate the laws of the country where they reside. Therefore, I would<br>
kindly ask the community and/or the administrators of the mailing list to<br>
take appropriate measures against the unlawful behavior that he continues<br>
to exhibit. Furthermore, ideally, I would like all posts where I am<br>
referred to as a 'dummy' to be removed from the archives of this mailing<br>
list. I believe that the removal of these threads would also be beneficial<br>
for Markus Wenzel, as it would reduce the odds of someone else making a<br>
decision to pursue a criminal case against him.</p>
<p>Overall, Markus Wenzel gives this forum a feeling of a high school<br>
backyard, where he is the toughest bully. I would like to think that I have<br>
had to endure enough bullying in my youth, not to have to do deal with it<br>
ever again (of course, it is very naive of me to think this way...). The<br>
reasons, of course, were different: it was my frail body, my inability to<br>
communicate information verbally as well as most other persons of the<br>
equivalent age and, of course, my interest in sciences. However, a person<br>
in power (whatever is the meaning of the word in a given context) can<br>
always find reasons to bully someone of 'lesser standing'. It could be<br>
one's race, it could be one's religion, it could be one's nationality, it<br>
could be one's disability, it could be the lack of wealth of one's family,<br>
it could be one's profession or social status, or it could simply be a<br>
personal dislike (I have seen and endured more of this than I could wish<br>
upon anyone). Nevertheless, quite frankly, I hold no personal grudge or<br>
resentment towards Markus Wenzel and most other characters who acted<br>
inappropriately towards me in the past. If I was religious, I would have<br>
said "May God have mercy upon their souls", but I am not religious and,<br>
therefore, I will not do it :). Perhaps, given his status in the community,<br>
I would have even acted in a similar manner towards the 'lesser humans<br>
beings'. Nevertheless, I do not like it and the human laws are on my side.<br>
Therefore, I will use all legal means at my disposal to ensure that I am<br>
not harassed ever again.</p>
<p>While the primary reason why I decided to start this thread is, indeed,<br>
the 'dummy' references, I believe that Markus Wenzel has repeatedly acted<br>
inappropriately on this mailing list in many other ways. For example, he<br>
has made a number of remarks that were blatantly off-topic in some of the<br>
threads that I started (both for the thread in the narrow sense and for the<br>
Isabelle mailing list in the most general sense). These remarks were<br>
related to Wikipedia articles, anonymity online and general public<br>
policies, but not related to Isabelle or formal methods in any way:<br>
personally, I would consider such posts to be off-topic even if they were<br>
started as an explicit meta-thread on this list. Most professional public<br>
forums (e.g. Stack Overflow) tightly regulate and moderate lengthy<br>
off-topic discussions (including the associated meta forums). I am rather<br>
confident that any user of Stack Overflow/Meta Stack Overflow would be<br>
banned if (s)he repeatedly made posts about (general) Wikipedia articles,<br>
anonymity online or public policies, even though the scope of the website<br>
Stack Overflow is much wider than the scope of this mailing list. Most<br>
certainly, I am not asking for Markus Wenzel to be denied the privilege of<br>
posting on this forum. However, I would like to see the content of the<br>
forum to be regulated more tightly for the benefit of the users.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

Hi,<br>
If someone feel harassed in the mailing list, that person should solve the problem in private.</p>
<p>I know that to work a lot of time in front of a computer makes people hyper-sensible, but there is a solution: be off-line for a while and enjoy nature.</p>
<p>By the way, to use world like “dummy“ is normal in an academic circle where people have high IQ. For example, both Feynman and Gell-Mann were rude with the speakers, e.g., after a lecture of a guess, Feynman asked to Gell-Mann, who was reading a newspaper, if the speaker was an intelligent person, in such a way that the speaker was able to hear it.</p>
<p>Heisenberg said that Schrödinger was a dummy and conversely. Finally Dirac proved that both, Heisenberg and Schrödinger, get equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
José M.</p>

<p>This is a terrible anecdote that should be taken as a an example of how<br>
<em>not</em> to behave, instead of being used to excuse such behaviour.</p>
<p>Please do not normalize rudeness and bad behaviour by "high IQ"<br>
people—being smart does not give one free rein to trample over the<br>
feelings of others, and in any case there are certainly very many<br>
brilliant people who are as modest and kind as they are smart, as<br>
evidenced by this list.</p>

You are right Josh, both Feynman and Gell-Mann belong to a time where men didn’t care about the feelings of dummy people. But now, 2019, we are living in a world of political correctness. My advice to high IQ people: please, be tolerant with the so-called “dummies” (use another word, e.g. “special people”).<br>
They can be extremely useful when they are on your side.</p>

Dear José Manuel Rodriguez Caballero/All,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, both Feynman and Gell-Mann were rude with the speakers...</p>
<p>Personally, I can hardly see how a precedent of rude behavior can justify<br>
further rude behavior. Taking this line of reasoning one step further could<br>
lead one to believe that if successful politicians of the past massacred<br>
entire populations for no apparent reason (Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin<br>
are prototypical examples), then every politician should be allowed to do<br>
so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have participated in a number of academic and industrial conferences and<br>
I supported a number of technical presentations to senior management of<br>
global corporations. However, I have never witnessed anyone being rude to a<br>
person speaking at a conference or delivering a presentation, even though<br>
the presentations varied drastically in their content and quality. I would<br>
guess that any member of the audience who allowed himself/herself to speak<br>
out of turn during any of the aforementioned events would be asked to leave<br>
by the organizers of the event.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just write about the subject and do not contribute in an excessive way</p>
<p>I would like to think that my contributions to this date were not<br>
excessive: please remember that this list is my only portal for the<br>
exchange of information about Isabelle. Furthermore, it is difficult to<br>
write only about the subject when, for example, I submit a valid correction<br>
to the Isabelle code base, and in return, instead of "Thank you", I receive<br>
a reply "You are a dummy". I have never witnessed a precedent of a personal<br>
insult thrown at a person who had just made a positive contribution to<br>
Isabelle.</p>

<p>I do not believe that superior intelligence (let alone a high IQ test<br>
score) gives anyone the right to be arrogant towards all people of lower<br>
standing based on this narrow criterion. There could be very talented<br>
musicians, painters, sculptors and fiction writers with reasonably low IQ<br>
test scores. Moreover, most likely, there are many people from whose<br>
perspective, you would fall into the category of "special people" according<br>
to your own criterion. For example, please compare yourself and your<br>
achievements with the achievements of Grigori Perelman, Vladimir Voevodsky,<br>
Ruth Lawrence or Akshay Venkatesh (I can ascertain you, it would be<br>
possible to extend this list almost indefinitely if you include all truly<br>
gifted chemists, computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians and<br>
physicists).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I am not the one calling other people names and trying to, somehow, justify<br>
this. I rarely act on impulse and the idea of this thread was conceived<br>
soon after the initial private communication with Markus Wenzel. I was<br>
simply waiting for him to refer to me as a "dummy" once again. Perhaps, you<br>
should take your own advice under consideration: be off-line for a while,<br>
enjoy nature and, most importantly, try to learn to respect people around<br>
you despite your magnificent talents, superior intelligence and other<br>
traits of inborn superiority which were bestowed upon you.</p>

Not really wanting to fan the flames of a dying fire, we all prefer the technical discussion, but as it stands, the majority view of the community on this is under represented (or what I consider the majority view, at least it is confirmed by several off-list conversations on this that I am aware of).</p>
<p>So I’d just like to point out that:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s of course not Ok to insult people on this list</li>
<li>it is perfectly fine to raise such an issue publicly if it has happened on this list</li>
</ul>
<p>There seems to have been at least a degree of language barrier involved, and we should be conscious of the fact that people here come from many different language and cultural backgrounds. If something has been pointed out as insulting, I don’t think it is too much of an ask to refrain from using it.</p>
<p>As Larry said, there is surely no need to call anyone names.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Gerwin</p>

<p>I do not accept unnamed subscribers on this list -- I have used soft and<br>
friendly words to make this clear several times, but it did not help.</p>
<p>By interfering repeatedly with my ongoing discussions, the unnamed subscriber<br>
has provoked a situation where I had to refer to him directly, inventing a<br>
name for the nameless. This can be easily avoided in the future by stopping<br>
such behaviour.</p>
<p>The reason why I don't want to see nameless posts here is the bad culture<br>
coming from it, e.g. on Wikipedia. Over there anonymous subscribers routinely<br>
attack people who are publicly visible, using very strange techniques of<br>
communication (the keyword "harrasment" on the subject smells like that).</p>
<p>This misbehaviour has no direct impact for the anonymous attackers, even if<br>
they are blocked eventually -- they can just return as a different "puppet" later.</p>
<p>I don't want to see anything like that again on our fine mailing list.</p>

Dear Markus Wenzel/All,</p>
<p>This misbehaviour has no direct impact for the anonymous attackers, even if<br>
I partially agree with you. This is why my signature clearly indicates that<br>
I can provide my identity upon request to any user of the mailing list. If<br>
this is not sufficient, I would be happy to pass further ID checks (e.g.<br>
provide a copy of my passport to the administrators of the list).</p>
<p>I would also like to mention that some of the formal proof communities are<br>
less open to the outsiders. For example, there exists "Association of Mizar<br>
Users". To the best of my knowledge, to become a member one needs to submit<br>
an application form and to remain a member one needs to pay a monthly<br>
membership fee (<a href="http://www.mizar.org/sum/">http://www.mizar.org/sum/</a>). Many other websites (e.g.<br>
gambling websites) require one to pass an ID check before the registration<br>
is possible: this did not stop millions of people to register on such<br>
websites.</p>
<p>If the lack of knowledge of the identity of the posters is such grave<br>
concern, then I would kindly suggest implementing an ID check for all<br>
people who wish to post on the list. However, without a requisite ID check<br>
for every member of the mailing list, your policy seems to give more<br>
credibility and respect to liars than to honest people who state clearly<br>
that they do not wish to reveal their identity in public.</p>
<p>At the time when I decided to register this email address, I considered<br>
adopting a human pseudonym. However, I decided against it because I thought<br>
that lying about my identity is not appropriate. Instead, I chose to state<br>
clearly that I simply do not wish to reveal it to the general public. At<br>
the moment, I have a feeling that I am being denied the services that are<br>
provided to anyone who would be shameless enough to lie about his/her<br>
identity.</p>
<p>As a side note, there exist professional researchers who strongly support<br>
the idea of anonymous academic publications (<br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05382.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05382.pdf</a>), not merely anonymous forum posts.</p>

  I did not justify that some people call "dummies" to others on 2019, on<br>
the contrary, I called for tolerance. Concerning your mention of "Hitler",<br>
this person was not rude, he killed himself, he was a coward (for example,<br>
Che Guevara fought until the last moment). Concerning your comparison<br>
between myself and other mathematicians, if you want to do it, ok, just<br>
read my papers before in order to make a fair comparison (Voevosky worked<br>
on Topology and I worked on Elementary Number Theory). Please, stop making<br>

such behaviour.</p>

<p>I do agree with you on the principle and academic tradition of this list that we use our real names, and I wouldn’t want us to move away from that in general.</p>
<p>Larry is the moderator of the list and has explicitly approved this exception, based on the reasons the person gave. He also knows the identity of the person, so the main concerns of the flame wars of the 90s do not apply for this case. The person can be held accountable if need be.</p>
<p>The list itself had a public discussion on the topic, and I think it is clear to people that this is an exception.</p>
<p>Given all this, there has to be a point where we follow Larry’s decision, we have after all given him the trust of doing these for us.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean everyone has to engage with everyone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason why I don't want to see nameless posts here is the bad culture<br>
coming from it, e.g. on Wikipedia. Over there anonymous subscribers routinely<br>
attack people who are publicly visible, using very strange techniques of<br>
communication (the keyword "harrasment" on the subject smells like that).</p>
<p>This misbehaviour has no direct impact for the anonymous attackers, even if<br>
they are blocked eventually -- they can just return as a different "puppet" later.</p>
<p>I don't want to see anything like that again on our fine mailing list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rest assured that neither I nor anyone I know on this list wants to see such behaviour here, and I’m very confident that Larry will take steps against it if it happens. </p>
<p>There is a subtlety on anonymity: the key about anonymity that leads people to misbehave is the belief that there will be no personal consequences to their actions. I have been the victim of fairly extreme (actually criminal) online harassment myself, to the degree that law enforcement was involved directly, and my experience is that the the problem is not explicit anonymity, but the offender impersonating others/using puppet accounts etc, (in this case wrongfully) believing their identity is unknown.</p>
<p>Here, given that the identity is officially known, just not to everyone on the list, saying explicitly “I am posting anonymously” actually draws attention and scrutiny to the behaviour of this person. So far, the anonymous poster has engaged in technical discussion and been a good citizen of this list. They have reacted to what they perceived a consistent attack against them, a reaction which was fair enough given the input they received, even if it was maybe not intended that way. </p>

Dear all,</p>
<p>Here are my three cents on this, as a list of opinions and Christmas wishes:</p>
<p>1) Of course, I agree with Gerwin and others that mailing list harassment or bullying is a serious issue, which should be promptly raised and fought against.</p>
<p>2) However, the discussed case involves no harassment and no bullying whatsoever. Realizing this is hardly a matter of cultural background, native language, etc. -- rather, pure logic shows that Makarius did not use the term "dummy" in reference to Anonymous's intellectual abilities. That would have made absolutely no sense in the context. I wish Anonymous acknowledged this (after re-thinking it over).</p>
<p>3) There is no doubt to me that <em>this</em> Anonymous is a serious contributor, and he gave valid reasons for not revealing his name on the mailing list (though he is happy to reveal it in private, to Makarius or anyone else). Would it be better if he registered as John Doe? So I wish Makarius considered ending his "embargo". However, I am not suggesting that this embargo is in any way related to harassment or bullying.</p>

To end the "embargo" one could use a name that looks like a regular one (not<br>
"John Doe"). Thus we avoid the appearance that anonymous posting with its bad<br>
implications is actually happening here. (There is a difference in violating<br>
rules and circumventing them creatively.)</p>
<p>We did have this in the glorious history of the mailing list already, even to<br>
the point where some colleagues wrote a very witty paper about the social<br>
interactions here:<br>
<a href="https://sketis.net/2017/social-networks-in-the-isabelle-and-coq-community">https://sketis.net/2017/social-networks-in-the-isabelle-and-coq-community</a></p>
<p>That paper is really fun to read, especially for people who have been there<br>
themselves. It also documents the cultural peak of the mailing list so far:<br>
both isabelle-users and coq-club have somewhat declined in recent years.</p>
<p>Maybe this old-school discussion format is no longer understood by a younger<br>
generation that was socialized in a much more aggressive Internet -- with its<br>
strange ways to communicate and implicit power structures enforced by forms of<br>
"higher-order political correctness".</p>

This is certainly what I recommend. The mailing list doesn’t operate a “real names” policy, nor does it have any means of doing so. Nor is there any real need to do so.</p>
<p>I am happy for people to hide their identities, but it’s clear that overt anonymity annoys some people despite the near impossibility of knowing that the sender of any message is the person they claim to be.</p>

Hi,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(There is a difference in violating rules and circumventing them <br>
creatively.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to argue strongly against this sentiment:</p>
<p>First, to my knowledge, no rule has been violated. The anonymous poster <br>
has properly been registered with the mailinglist. They have not lied <br>
about anything. Which rule would have been violated? The fact that <br>
Makarius (and only Makarius so far, as far as I can tell) has exhibited <br>
displeasure at anonymous participation does not, in my opinion, make it <br>
a rule.</p>
<p>Second, the suggestion to circumvent rules creatively surprises me. Do I <br>
understand right that being openly and honestly anonymous is a problem, <br>
while using a fake name and pretending that that is one's real identity <br>
would be OK?</p>
<p>Third, I do not see how participating under a fake name would resolve <br>
any of the problems that Makarius mentioned such as being able to wreak <br>
havoc and then reregister with a new identity. (For the record, I myself <br>
do not think this is a problem here.)</p>
<p>(That being said, for practical purposes, it might be useful if the <br>
anonymous poster would adopt a pseudonym (while still clearly stating in <br>
the email that this is a pseudonym). The advantage is simply that it <br>
will be easier to refer to their contributions. E.g., "Fritz the Cat's <br>
set-to-types implementation" instead of "the anonymous person's <br>
set-to-types implementation".)</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

<p>This is a proposal to transcend classic western thinking and resolve an<br>

Just to be clear, we have no “real names” policy, nor a mechanism to enforce it.</p>
<p>I’m often surprised at attitudes to identity. When my university decided to issue photo ID cards many years ago, we all had to make appointments to be photographed, but we did not have to present any ID, and therefore could claim to be anybody. More recently, somebody who I knew only by email informed me that our project was security-critical and therefore we need to set up PGP keys; when I asked him how we would authenticate these keys to each other, he didn’t even understand the question. But anybody can get a public-private key pair in the name of Albert Einstein or Isaac Newton.</p>

That is indeed a counter model to what I called "common sense" much earlier.<br>
That common sense must be applied, though, by everybody individually and<br>
responsibly.</p>
<p>I keep repeating this, because I see more and more people acting like true<br>
puppets.</p>
<p>(For my part we can close this thread at any time.)</p>

Dear José Manuel Rodríguez Caballero,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply and for clarifying "I did not justify that some<br>
people call "dummies" to others" because I was under the impression that<br>
you were trying to suggest that it is only appropriate to be impolite to<br>
people whom one considers to be less intelligent or, rather, that you miss<br>
the times when it was appropriate to be impolite to others.</p>
<p>With regard to the rest of your message, I would like to mention that I was<br>
aware of the primary topic of your research and your current applied<br>
formalization efforts, as well as the primary topics of the research of all<br>
of the people on the list that I provided, at the time of writing the<br>
message. I was merely trying to point out that there is always someone<br>
whose intellectual abilities and the sheer volume of knowledge far exceed<br>
one's own (these qualities are not directly related to the topic of one's<br>
research): nearly every human being could be considered to be a "dummy"<br>
relative to someone else.</p>
