<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Dan has already explained most aspects of this.  Just for completeness, <br>
here is the relevant snippet from the isar-ref manual:</p>
<p>Structural composition ``@{text m1}@{verbatim ";"}~@{text m2}'' means<br>
   that method @{text m1} is applied with restriction to the first subgoal,<br>
   then @{text m2} is applied consecutively with restriction to each<br>
   subgoal that has newly emerged due to @{text m1}. This is analogous to<br>
   the tactic combinator @{ML_op THEN_ALL_NEW} in Isabelle/ML, see also<br>
   @{cite "isabelle-implementation"}. For example, @{text "(rule r;<br>
   blast)"} applies rule @{text "r"} and then solves all new subgoals by<br>
   @{text blast}.</p>
<p>The citation of isabelle-implementation is pointless, though: the manual <br>
does not mention it in Isabelle2015.  The THEN_ALL_NEW tactical was new in <br>
1998, and I just thought that it is universally known and properly <br>
documented.  See also <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/0e034d76932e">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/0e034d76932e</a></p>
<p>In that ML definition you also see that it is just a matter of working <br>
with subgoal indices, without ever looking at the actual goal state.  The <br>
assumption is that tactics / proof methods work in the way that is <br>
specified in the Isabelle/Isar implementation manual, sections 4.2 <br>
"Tactics" and 7.2 "Proof methods".</p>
<p>The Isar method combinator does some more sandboxing of proof states, to <br>
enforce certain policies, which was observed here in the examples.</p>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch">andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>I am wondering why the new method combinator restricts the first method to the first <br>
subgoal. Is there any deeper reason for this design decision?</p>
<p>I regularly attempt myself to write things like the following</p>
<p>apply(safe; simp_all)<br>
   apply(simp_all; blast)<br>
   apply(auto; force intro: ...)<br>
   apply(case_tac [1-3] x; simp_all)</p>
<p>and then wonder why they don't work as expected (throw the first method at all/the <br>
specified subgoals and then invoke the second method only on subgoals arising from the <br>
first method). What are the use cases for the restriction to the first subgoal? Or am I <br>
just using bad style?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Andreas</p>

Hi Andreas,<br>
It's not really defined what it means for a subgoal to "arise" out of a method which applies to all subgoals.<br>
In the general case a method can perform arbitrary modifications to the collection of subgoals<br>
(including changing the number), and so the "new" subgoals would need to be all of them.</p>
<p>In the restricted case, it is clear which subgoals are new because it is exactly those which are on<br>
top of the subgoal stack.</p>
<p>One possible solution to your problem is to expose "ALLGOALS" as a method combinator. This can be done relatively easily with some<br>
simple Eisbach-provided functionality (I didn't get around to including this in the release):</p>

<p>In this example, "safe" is executed in isolation against each subgoal, and "rule B" applied to each emerging one.</p>
<p>Although this implementation throws away rule cases, you probably get the idea. You could also use PARALLEL_ALLGOALS if desired.</p>
<p>As a side note, something like "(x; simp_all)" never makes sense, the second argument is run against each resulting subgoal in isolation.<br>
You almost certainly mean "(x; simp)".</p>

<p>I had the same thought. The naive solution works in most cases but there are a fair number of edge cases where it breaks down or is unclear. For example, if m1 rotates all subgoals by 1,<br>
does "m1;m2" apply m2 to all subgoals or none? I think without the ability to have a method officially declare what is a "new" subgoal, it will be difficult to address this generally.</p>

<p>I agree that it's a bit strange to suddenly have this implicit [1] restriction. I think, however, that such an application of ";" is improper and should either result in an error or just be considered bad style (if auto is not explicitly restricted to the first subgoal).</p>
<p>I would argue that the introduction of the ";" combinator should result a shift away from using all-subgoal methods as anything but sole terminal methods. If, for example, you chained your long method expression<br>
using ";" to the method which originally produced the subgoals then you would not need to rely on the fact that "auto" applies to all subgoals:<br>
i.e<br>
        apply (cases ..; auto intro: .. simp add: ... ; blast elim: ...)</p>
<p>In this case the scope and intent of "auto ..." is much more clear, and avoids clobbering additional subgoals that sneak in during regular proof maintenance.</p>
