<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to implement a method that gives an informative error message<br>
when application fails (e.g., imagine an algebra tactic returning "subgoal<br>
should not contain &lt;=" or something like that).</p>
<p>I see possibilities how a method can indicate a failure:</p>
<p>- Raise an exception<br>
   - Return a (Seq.Error (K "error message")) result.<br>
   - Return Seq.empty (this is what is done by most methods)</p>
<p>According to my experiments, the first two options are not suitable because<br>
they break method combinators like "method+" and "method?" (I would need<br>
that these will suppress the error.) And the third option does not support<br>
giving an error message.</p>
<p>Is there any best practice how to return informative messages on method<br>
failure?<br>
I feel that this would be very helpful for the user of the method because<br>
often one has to do a lot of try and error to find out why a method didn't<br>
work on a given subgoal.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>you could return Seq.empty and print a warning or tracing message.<br>
However, note that in combination with tacticals (like ?,*), your<br>
method might fail multiple times on different goals and produce a whole<br>
bunch of warning messages ... many of them might be useless, but I<br>
don't think there is a general rule to filter the actual informative<br>
ones ...</p>

<p>A proper tactic or proof method can't do that, for a variety of reasons.<br>
Some of the semantic side-conditions for these very special (lazy)<br>
operations are explained in "implementation" section 4.2 and 7.2.</p>
<p>Note that even non-lazy ML tools need to be careful about warnings and<br>
tracings: it always needs to be guarded by some flags in the context, to<br>
prevent spamming the user or bombing the system.</p>

<p>Seq.Error and type context_tactic is relatively new -- it is a spin-off<br>
from Eisbach. In principle it allows user-space proof methods to produce<br>
information about failure, but there are presently no applications. This<br>
mechanism is presently only used by the system in certain spots where<br>
proof methods are incorporated into Isar proof commands (e.g. the<br>
outermost steps of 'by').</p>

<p>At some point I wanted to explore that for complex proof methods like<br>
"induct" / "induction", which have many obscure failure points. I have<br>
no idea how well it will work out.</p>
<p>Maybe someone else has tried something similar already.</p>

<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks for the information so far.</p>
<p>To clarify: I am not hoping for a mechanism that gives useful information<br>
when tacticals like + are used. I understand that that would be much to ask<br>
for (e.g., if we have "a | b", and both fail, who's message should we<br>
output).</p>
<p>What I would like (and what I feel would be a very useful mechanism<br>
generally, imagine the rule method actually telling us where in a large<br>
term matching failed!) is the following:</p>
<p>- Inside a tactical (like method+) that would succeed without adding<br>
   error message (i.e., using <a href="http://Seq.fail">Seq.fail</a>) no error message is output. (That's<br>
   also why I don't want to use tracing, this would lead to spam in the output<br>
   window when using tacticals.)</p>
<p>- Inside a tactical that would fail, I don't care what is output (e.g.,<br>
   the error message could be supressed).</p>
<p>- If the method is used alone (i.e., apply method), then the user should<br>
   see the error message.</p>
<p>I have a partial solution for this problem: I create a configuration flag<br>
"method_error". If the user wants to get an explanation why a method fails,<br>
then they use "using[[method_error=true]]", and then the method will fail<br>
with an error. However, when using tacticals, it is important to switch<br>
method_error off again. So it is a bit inconvenient.</p>
<p>The code used for this is simple:</p>
<p>val method_error = Attrib.setup_config_bool @{binding method_error} (K<br>
false)<br>
fun error_ctac msg (ctx,_) = if Config.get ctx method_error<br>
  then Seq.single (Seq.Error msg) else Seq.empty<br>
fun error_tac msg ctx = if Config.get ctx method_error<br>
  then K (raise ERROR(msg ())) else K Seq.empty<br>
fun error_method msg = CONTEXT_METHOD (K (error_ctac msg))</p>
<p>Now a method or tactic can just use error_tac (or error_method) when it<br>
usually would use no_tac.</p>
<p>But the problem is that the user only gets the error messages when<br>
explicitly requesting them.</p>
<p>An alternative solution (that would need changes to Isabelle internals)<br>
would be to use the Seq.Error solution without a flag, and to change the<br>
behavior of tacticals that they filter errors suitably (I assume the logic<br>
would be analogous to what how parser monads handle errors.) Makarius will<br>
probably know best if that's a good idea or not.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>
