<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of time studying how Sledgehammer works with the 25 or <br>
so ATPs that can be enabled.</p>
<p>About the time I decide I'm spending too much time experimenting with <br>
it, I get some new understanding of its feedback in the output panel, <br>
and learn how to use another of its many amazing features.</p>
<p>So I used the "dont_preplay" option, because Sledgehammer was taking <br>
time to replay the proofs that the ATPs had found, to test them for its <br>
own purposes, which takes time, and the proofs it has found were all <br>
working, so I decided it didn't need to test them.</p>
<p>But there was this one metis proof that was staying purple an annoyingly <br>
long time as Isabelle clicked through the proofs of my theory, staying <br>
purple for 2 or 3 seconds. That's a long time when every other proof is <br>
only taking a half a second or less.</p>
<p>The short story is that, not understanding the timing information <br>
Sledgehammer was giving me due to preplay, I had picked the 3 second <br>
proof instead of one of the half second proofs it had offered.</p>
<p>Eventually, I discovered the use of the timing information due to <br>
preplay. Does Sledgehammer return 10 different metis proofs? Now, I <br>
don't just pick the one using the shortest named facts, I look at how <br>
long Sledgehammer took to preplay the proof.</p>
<p>Okay, I've learned to look at more than that. Are there ten proofs <br>
offered? I look at the theorems metis uses and I ask the question, "If I <br>
was going to do a detailed proof using the theorems metis uses, which <br>
different set of facts used would be the most logically appealing, and <br>
require fewer steps?</p>
<p>But due to parallel processing and the timeout setting, there are lots <br>
of differences in the proofs Sledgehammer will find.</p>
<p>Sledgehammer was returning 10 or so metis proofs that were using <br>
numerous facts, and it was offering to minimize them, which is when <br>
Sledgehammer feeds back a proof to the ATP using fewer and fewer facts.</p>
<p>I said, "Hey, manually going through 7 minimize attempts is not what I <br>
call automation, so I'll set 'minimize=true'". But there's always a <br>
trade off.</p>
<p>After going back and running Sledgehammer on theorems with the preplay <br>
option on, for one theorem, it was only finding one proof, rather than <br>
the usual many proofs, and it was remote_z3_tptp that was finding the proof.</p>
<p>This brings up the issue of nuance, one being that, given a certain <br>
timeout setting, sometimes a remote duplicate of a local prover will <br>
return a proof that the local prover doesn't.</p>
<p>I had also started asking the question, "Do I really need z3_tptp in <br>
there?" Well, obviously, yes.</p>
<p>Since I wasn't getting lots of proofs, I disabled "minimize" and used <br>
"dont_preplay". I then got proofs for z3_tptp, remote_z3_tptp, z3, and <br>
remote_z3. The time spent for the 4 provers was like this:</p>
<p>remote_z3_tptp: ATP real CPU time: 2.15 s.<br>
    z3_tptp:               ATP real CPU time: 29.79 s.<br>
    z3                         SMT solver real CPU time: 2.22 s<br>
    remote_z3          SMT solver real CPU time: 5.75 s.</p>
<p>More nuances. Sometimes the remote prover is faster than the local <br>
prover, and sometimes not. Last week, I didn't use remote provers that <br>
are duplicates of local provers, but now I generally do.</p>
<p>There's more for me to tell about how to use Sledgehammer's information <br>
than most people have time to read.</p>
<p>For example, z3_tptp gave me a proof like this:</p>
<p>by (metis extension_equality unordered_pair_axiom ordered_pair_def) <br>
(406 ms)</p>
<p>My extension_equality theorem is merely a biconditional of  my <br>
extension_axiom. I was asking these questions, "Do I really need <br>
extension_equality? Will the proof work using extension_axiom instead, <br>
and will it be slower if it does?"</p>
<p>Well, the Sledgehammer output shows you how to use the "min" option, so <br>
I tried this, not to minimize the number of facts, but to get the timing <br>
information with the axiom substituted for the theorem:</p>
<p>sledgehammer min [z3_tptp, timeout = 90, verbose] (extension_axiom <br>
unordered_pair_axiom ordered_pair_def),</p>
<p>and I got this:</p>
<p>Try this: by  (metis extension_axiom unordered_pair_axiom <br>
ordered_pair_def) (408 ms).</p>
<p>So metis only uses 2 more milliseconds when it uses the axiom directly.</p>
<p>I finish out most of this this email with my maxed out sledgehammer <br>
command, and the reasoning behind it.</p>
<p>With Sledgehammer, you need a good process viewer to see what it's <br>
doing, and a good CPU meter in your task bar to see if your CPUs are <br>
running heavily when they shouldn't be. If you don't do things right, <br>
processes that are taking up 25% of your CPU won't get terminated. Doing <br>
things right is letting Sledgehammer finish normally, or deleting it <br>
before you close jEdit. Sometimes processes just don't get terminated <br>
when you don't let Sledgehammer finish.</p>

<p>My long version is this, and I explain what's not arbitrary about it:</p>
<p>sledgehammer[DEL,dont_preplay,minimize,timeout=90,verbose,max_relevant=smart,provers="<br>
     metis remote_vampire e remote_z3 spass_new remote_e_sine z3_tptp<br>
     remote_e_tofof remote_e remote_z3_tptp remote_cvc3 remote_iprover<br>
     remote_iprover_eq remote_waldmeister satallax z3 cvc3 yices"]</p>
<p>1) I use a macro to insert it, and I put the DEL in to cause an error so <br>
it won't run. The "DEL,dont_preplay," is highlighted, and I press the <br>
backspace key to delete it, after which Sledgehammer starts running.</p>
<p>2) I want "preplay" to get the timing information, but I could decide to <br>
not to do "preplay" so that Sledgehammer is devoting more time to only <br>
finding proofs, in case it has been timing out and not getting many proofs.</p>
<p>3) I normally want to automate "minimize", but if it's timing out and <br>
not getting many proofs, I'll delete it before I run Sledgehammer.</p>
<p>4) I could set "max_relevant=1000" so that Sledgehammer is feeding the <br>
ATPs massive facts, but I've learned that if the ATPs have to work too <br>
hard, then I'm trying to prove a false statement, or I need to add some <br>
preliminary lemmas. Quite possibly, a proof that takes an ATP a long <br>
time to find will cause the Isabelle prover to work way too hard and <br>
long once it's given the proof.</p>
<p>5) Only a maximum of 4 provers will run in parallel, and they run in the <br>
order given, so I put the 7 better provers first, and I have a <br>
reasonable timeout set so that the first 4 provers don't hold everything <br>
else up too long. Many times the first four will finish fast anyway, and <br>
again, if a particular prover isn't proving anything reasonably fast, <br>
then it won't or it won't find a decently fast proof.</p>
<p>6) metis is first, because though it can get overloaded and kick out <br>
fast, it can also return proofs very fast; metis is run directly by <br>
poly.exe.</p>
<p>7) The vampire binary is hard to get, the Windows version doesn't run <br>
right, and the remote_vampire is twice as fast as my Linux vampire, but <br>
vampire one of the best of the best, so I put it second.</p>
<p>8) "e" is an execllent prover, so I put the local e in the first group. <br>
I also put remote_e in with the remote group of provers. Processing <br>
nuances could result in remote_e returning a proof that the local e <br>
doesn't. Local provers can fail to return proofs that remote provers <br>
return because parallel processing is never the same, especially when <br>
the options and provers listed are different. But I try these 20 or so <br>
provers on the first try to try and save time; different provers find <br>
proofs for different theorems, and always because they weren't given <br>
enough time. If I don't get such good results on this massive try, then <br>
I can start tweaking options.</p>
<p>9) remote_z3 is before z3 because z3, when used directly, won't run in <br>
parallel. It will only run after all other provers listed before it have <br>
finished. However, it's an execellent prover, which is why I want <br>
remote_z3 to start running in the first 4. Additionally, I leave out the <br>
"smt" prover; smt calls z3, and z3 used directly finds better proofs, <br>
and finds them just as fast.</p>
<p>10) "z3_tptp" uses the z3-prover.exe just like z3, but it's not used the <br>
same, so it finds proofs when the others don't, as shown by my example <br>
above.</p>
<p>11) I then let Sledgehammer go through all the other remote provers, <br>
other than remote_leo2 and remote_satallax. These are HOL provers, and <br>
I'm almost exclusively doing FOL. I wonder about leaving remote_iprover <br>
and remote_iprover_eq in. They don't prove a lot, but I leave them in.</p>
<p>12) I then do the local satallax. Maybe it's faster or slower at <br>
finishing than the remote_satallax, but remote provers can sometimes <br>
hold things up; a 60 second timeout might get processed remotely over a <br>
period of much more than 60 seconds.</p>
<p>13) z3, cvc3, and yices won't run in parallel with other provers, so I <br>
put them last, not that it would matter. If I put them first, they still <br>
won't start until the other provers are finished. I put z3 first, <br>
because they will run in the order listed.</p>
