<p>From: Daniel Raggi &lt;<a href="mailto:danielraggi@gmail.com">danielraggi@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear transfer/lifting experts,</p>
<p>I've been experimenting with transfer and lifting and there is something<br>
that I just haven't managed to understand.<br>
I didn't have this problem before I upgraded from Isabelle2013 to<br>
Isabelle2013-2 (and I suspect I would have also had it with Isabelle2013-1,<br>
but I never used it)</p>
<p>Things similar to what I'm about to describe happen every time I define a<br>
new type using quotient_type or typedef. I'll give a concrete example with<br>
quotient_type (a type with two elements, as a quotient from integers):</p>
<p>quotient_type bin = int / "(λx y. [x = y] (mod 2))"<br>
   &lt;proof&gt;</p>
<p>Then I instantiate bin to the numeral class successfully and prove the<br>
transfer rule that lets one transfer every int numeral to the 'same' bin<br>
numeral:</p>
<p>lemma cr_bin_numeral [transfer_rule]: "cr_bin (numeral x) (numeral x)".</p>
<p>As far as I understand, this should be enough to do:</p>
<p>lemma "2 = (4::bin)"<br>
  apply transfer</p>
<p>to get subgoal  "[2 = (4::int)] (mod 2)".<br>
However, I get:</p>
<ol>
<li>?a5  (2::int)  (4::int)</li>
<li>Transfer.Rel (cr_bin ===&gt; cr_bin ===&gt; op =)  ?a5  op =</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, the obvious value for  ?a5  is the relation  "λx y. [x = y] (mod 2)",<br>
and actually this is by default with every quotient type definition, so I<br>
don't understand why the transfer rule was not generated automatically in<br>
the first place when I defined the new type. I thought it was already<br>
automatic in Isabelle2013, and my theories actually broke down once I tried<br>
running them on Isabelle2013-2 because of this issue.</p>
<p>The issue doesn't stop here, because even if I define the transfer rule<br>
 (cr_bin ===&gt; cr_bin ===&gt; op =)  (λx y. [x = y] (mod 2)) op =<br>
by hand I still get a problem when I try:</p>
<p>lemma "1 = (3::bin)"<br>
  apply transfer</p>
<p>What I get is</p>
<ol>
<li>?a5  1  3</li>
<li>Transfer.Rel (*pcr_bin *===&gt; cr_bin ===&gt; op =)  ?a5  op =</li>
</ol>
<p>This is because 1 was actually lifted so that I could instantiate bin in<br>
the numeral class, so it's transfer rule is generated differently. I'm not<br>
familiar with the  pcr_  thing. Can anyone explain this?</p>
<p>So, If I wanted to write the transfer rules for equality manually I would<br>
have to make four rules:</p>
<p>(cr_bin ===&gt; cr_bin ===&gt; op =)  (λx y. [x = y] (mod 2)) op =<br>
(pcr_bin ===&gt; cr_bin ===&gt; op =)  (λx y. [x = y] (mod 2)) op =<br>
(cr_bin ===&gt; pcr_bin ===&gt; op =)  (λx y. [x = y] (mod 2)) op =<br>
(pcr_bin ===&gt; pcr_bin ===&gt; op =)  (λx y. [x = y] (mod 2)) op =</p>
<p>I keep thinking that there's something essential I'm not understanding, but<br>
maybe it's not me. I would greatly benefit from your feedback. I'm<br>
attaching a test file with this experiment, if anyone wants to have a look.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Daniel<br>

Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>the pcr_... relations generalise the cr_... relations. For types with type variables, they <br>
allow other relations than equality for the type variables. If there is no type variable <br>
(as in your example), pcr_... and cr_... are logically equivalent (theorem bin.pcr_cr_eq). <br>
But since Isabelle2013-1, the lifting package expects that you use pcr_... in your custom <br>
transfer rules rather than cr_... If you replace cr_... with pcr_... in your theory file, <br>
transfer should work as you expect.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

Hi Daniel,<br>
sorry for the inconvenience.<br>
There is an easy fix: Rename cr_bin in your user-provided transfer rules <br>
to pcr_bin.</p>
<p>Long answer: The transfer relation that is used in rules that are <br>
generated by the Lifting package is now called pcr_T, which is a <br>
generalization of cr_T and uses cr_T internally. You can prove "pcr_bin <br>
= cr_bin" (thm bin.pcr_cr_eq) for your type bin because bin is not a <br>
polymorphic type. In general pcr_T op= ... op= = cr_t. So what is pcr_T? <br>
It's a relation that allows you to change the polymorphic argument of <br>
your type (if there is one). E.g., consider 'a fset defined in <br>
HOL/Library/FSet. Here cr_fset :: 'a set =&gt; 'a fset =&gt; bool, whereas <br>
pcr_fset :: ('a =&gt; 'b =&gt; bool) =&gt; 'a set =&gt; 'b fset =&gt; bool. And <br>
pcr_fset op= = cr_fset.</p>
<p>Btw, you don't have to import HOL/Library/Quotient_List since the <br>
content of this file that is relevant for Lifting and Transfer has been <br>
moved to Main. The syntax for Lifting (===&gt; and ---&gt;) is now also local <br>
and can be reintroduced by this trick:</p>
<p>context<br>
begin<br>
   interpretation lifting_syntax .</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br>
Ondrej</p>

Thank you, Andreas and Ondřej. It works now! I didn't understand why I was<br>
getting both cr_T and pcr_T in different places. Now I see that cr appeared<br>
because I had introduced it myself with my user defined transfer rules, and<br>
pcr appeared because that's the way the transfer method works now. By<br>
changing cr to pcr things work smoothly. Thanks!</p>
<p>Daniel</p>
