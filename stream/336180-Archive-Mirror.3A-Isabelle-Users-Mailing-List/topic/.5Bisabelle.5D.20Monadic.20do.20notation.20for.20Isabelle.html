<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:christian.sternagel@uibk.ac.at">christian.sternagel@uibk.ac.at</a>&gt;<br>
Hi there,</p>
<p>I wrote a theory (plus accompanying ML file) that allows to use <br>
do-notation (as in Haskell and where braces and semicolons are <br>
mandatory) for arbitrary monads (in this case, arbitrary bind- and <br>
then-functions), after a setup via:</p>
<p>setup {*<br>
   add_monad "List" {<br>
     monad_bind = @{term "%xs f. concat (map f xs)"},<br>
     monad_then = NONE<br>
   }<br>
*}</p>
<p>(Here "monad_then = NONE" means that "bind m (%_. n)" is used instead of <br>
"then m n".)</p>
<p>setup {* use_monad "List" *}</p>
<p>Now, we can write, e.g.,</p>
<p>do {<br>
   let xs = [0..2];<br>
   x &lt;- xs;<br>
   y &lt;- xs;<br>
   [(x, y)]<br>
}</p>
<p>to obtain the list [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), ..., (2, 2)].</p>
<p>So far so good :). In this setup it is not possible to combine different <br>
monads. Consider for example the following option monad:</p>
<p>setup {*<br>
   add_monad "Option" {<br>
     monad_bind = @{term "%m f. <a href="http://Option.map">Option.map</a> f m"},<br>
     monad_then = NONE<br>
   }<br>
*}</p>
<p>I would like to be able to write, e.g.,</p>
<p>do {<br>
   let xs = [Some 0, Some 1, None];<br>
   x &lt;- xs;<br>
   y &lt;- xs;<br>
   let r = do {<br>
     m &lt;- x;<br>
     n &lt;- y;<br>
     Some (x + y)<br>
   };<br>
   return [r]<br>
}</p>
<p>which is an admittedly contrived example. My first thought, was to give <br>
"do" an optional argument (the name of the monad that should be used), as in</p>
<p>do List { ... do Option { ... } ... }</p>
<p>This brings me to my actual question ;)</p>
<p>If I would use Theory_Data to store the "current monad", my <br>
parse_translations would have to modify the current theory. I assume, <br>
this is bad (furthermore, I have no clue how to do this :)). Would it be <br>
okay to use a reference for this? What about potential problems?</p>
<p>cheers</p>

Hi Christian,</p>
<p>I can see that your parse_translation might need to read information<br>
from the current theory, but I don't see why it would have to <em>modify</em><br>
the current theory. The parse_translation for case syntax (function<br>
case_tr in HOL/Tools/Datatype/datatype_case.ML) probably uses all the<br>
relevant techniques that you would need to implement your generic<br>
monadic syntax: it reads information about constructors from theory<br>
data, and translates the case branches (built with the "_case1" and<br>
"_case2" syntactic constructors) into the appropriate case<br>
combinators. It does not modify any theory data during parsing.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how your current parse_translation is implemented, but<br>
here's the approach I would take: First, define some syntactic<br>
constructors for the do-syntax, similar to how the case syntax is<br>
defined in HOL.thy:</p>
<p>nonterminals dobinds</p>
<p>syntax<br>
  "_do1" :: "'a =&gt; dobinds" ("_")<br>
  "_do2" :: "[pttrn, 'a, dobinds] =&gt; dobinds" ("_ &lt;- _;/ _")<br>
  "_do_syntax" :: "[string, dobinds] =&gt; 'a" ("do _ {_}")</p>
<p>Then define a parse_translation for "_do_syntax" that would parse the<br>
list of "_do2" and "_do1" constructors, then choose an appropriate<br>
monad instance based on the value of the string argument (obtaining<br>
the table of monad instances from the theory data).</p>
<p>Alternatively you could omit the "string" argument to "_do_syntax" and<br>
look up the monad instance based on the type of the last statement of<br>
the do-block (except I'm not sure whether the type information would<br>
be available yet). Or you could do a lookup based on what the<br>
top-level constant of the last statement is, e.g. a term of the form<br>
[_] indicates the list monad, and Some _ indicates the option monad.</p>

This is going in the right direction.</p>
<p>Also note that Scala "for" comprehensions are officially explained as a <br>
certain syntax translation on untyped expressions, which are later run <br>
through the regular type-inference.</p>
<p>If it turns out that you do need type information for your tanslation you <br>
can organize it like that:</p>
<p>* The translation functions (advanced parse translations etc.) only take<br>
     care of producing proper binders.</p>
<p>* Further transformations within the type-checking phase are done by<br>
     your own "check" operation, which is installed via Syntax.add_term_check</p>
<p>The latter gives you an opportunity to participate in a simultaneous <br>
process to infer full type information.  The regular Hindley-Milner type <br>
inference is only one part of that.  This relatively new and advanced <br>
abstract syntax technology is still not use very much, but could open a <br>
chance to get things really right that did not work so well with plain old <br>
macros (aka translations).</p>

Hi Chris,</p>
<p>I am not a syntax wizard, so I cannot help much with the actual task, <br>
but note that there are two monads in the library already, each with its <br>
own syntax setup for do notation:</p>
<p>HOL/Library/State_Monad.thy<br>
HOL/Imperative_HOL/Heap_Monad.thy</p>
<p>You might want to look at them if you haven't already. In the AFP there <br>
is also MiniML/Maybe.thy, but with a rather basic syntax.</p>
<p>If you manage to unify all this somehow, this would be a really cool thing.</p>

<p>Each check or uncheck operation operates on the whole textual situation, <br>
i.e. a context and a collection of terms to be treated simultaneously. <br>
Thus you do not only get the root of a single term, but the full chunk of <br>
text to be processed, i.e. the super-root.  You can also keep information <br>
in the result context for later -- in the very end it is discarded, <br>
though.</p>
<p>Stages progress from smaller to larger integer values for check, and <br>
reverse for uncheck.  At stage 0 there are the "standard" check/uncheck <br>
phases, there is also a final "fixate" check at stage 100 to finalize <br>
type-inference parameters that are left over. Anything else can be defined <br>
in the user context, and arbitrary things can be done here, i.e. this <br>
powerful mechanism needs to be used with some care.</p>
<p>Since the whole process iterates repeatedly over all stages, your part <br>
might get invoked multiple times, until a global fixed-point is reached <br>
(if it ever happens). This is a bit like a simplifier on abstract syntax, <br>
but without any builtin strategy to traverse the terms.</p>

<p>Somehow the standard type checking at phase 0 is special: it takes raw <br>
parser output (where all names and binder scopes are already resolved, but <br>
lacks type information apart from constraints that happen to be in the <br>
input), and produces fully types terms according to the usual <br>
Hindley-Milner scheme.  If you act before, you won't get proper type <br>
information, but afterwards most of it is already finished.  Typically, <br>
later check phases merely "improve" inferred types by specializing them, <br>
as is usually done in advanced Haskell-style systems.</p>
<p>Case 1: You operate after stage 0.  This means that your concrete syntax <br>
needs to be mapped to auxiliary combinators etc. that will be accepted by <br>
the standard type check.  That result can then be expanded to suitable <br>
logical constants by your function. In other words you need to be able to <br>
model your monad language using simply-typed higher-order abstract syntax.</p>
<p>Case 2: You operate before stage 0.  This means you merely rearrange the <br>
user input schematically such that the later stages will synthesize just <br>
the right types accidentally.  This is a bit like "for" in Scala, where <br>
the compiler expands nested comprehensions to certain combinators in an <br>
untyped fashion.  (Maybe they now have some papers on the details, I did <br>
not find any 1-2 years ago.  There are some basic explanations in the <br>
Scala book by Odersky-et-al.)</p>

<p>(Here, more_err () just tells the user that more type constraints are <br>
needed in order to infer the current monad type.)</p>
<p>I) Currently I'm going for Case 2 (of makarius suggestion) and <br>
registered the check function at stage 0. When I add a type contraint <br>
around a do block, this does always work, however I am not pleased with <br>
the few examples that work without any type constraints.</p>
<p>The tricky part is "bindM" (and "thenM" is analogeous). Here I know that <br>
the arguments m and f (which are of type "'a m" and "'a =&gt; 'b m" for <br>
some monad type "m") are already checked. Now, I want to find out, which <br>
actual bind method I should use instead of "bindM" (the function <br>
get_bind returns the corresponding constant for a given type in a given <br>
context).</p>
<p>The choice is based on the functions "add_monad_type" (for m) and <br>
"add_monad_fun_type" (for f).</p>
<p>I have mainly tried 2 versions (which do both not work in all cases):</p>
<p>1) My first try was to collect all types occurring somewhere in a given <br>
term (by folding a function that collects all Type's from a given typ, <br>
over all typs of a term) that are registered as monadic. But then I get <br>
typing problems when more than one monad type occurs inside a term, e.g.,</p>
<p>do {<br>
   x &lt;- map Some [0..2];<br>
   return x<br>
}</p>
<p>assuming that "list" and "option" are registered as monadic, my function<br>
finds "'a option" before "'a list" and hence substitutes "option_bind", <br>
when "list_bind" was needed. It is not immediately clear to me which <br>
strategy I should use for finding monad types.</p>
<p>2) In the other extreme I do just check for the fastype of m and the <br>
range type of the fastype of f to be monadic... but then I cannot handle <br>
cases like, e.g.,</p>
<p>do {<br>
   x &lt;- xs;<br>
   y &lt;- [0..2];<br>
   return (x, y)<br>
}</p>
<p>although, the list monad is the only possibility.</p>
<p>So I would need a better way to check for the current monad type, based <br>
on m and f.</p>
<p>A further problem are cases like</p>
<p>do {<br>
   let xs = [0 .. 2];<br>
   x &lt;- xs;<br>
   y &lt;- ys;<br>
   return (x, y)<br>
}</p>
<p>which is parsed to (using the infix &gt;&gt;= instead of "bindM"):</p>
<p>(%xs. xs &gt;&gt;= (%x. ys &gt;&gt;= (%y. returnM (x, y)))) [0 .. 2]</p>
<p>So at the actual occurrences of &gt;&gt;= I would have to know the type of the <br>
bound variable xs. But I do not know how to handle this in Isabelle <br>
(since bound variables do not contain types).</p>
<p>I do appreciate any comments and/or suggestions.</p>
<p>II) I also have some design questions concerning printing for you :)</p>
<p>I would like to allow both, the combinator notation using &gt;&gt;=, &gt;&gt;, and <br>
return; and the do-notation. As input this is easy: just provide <br>
notation for bindM, thenM, and returnM</p>
<p>notation<br>
   bindM (infixl "&gt;&gt;=" 54) and ...</p>
<p>For printing it would be nice to let the user decide (or do you have <br>
better suggestions?). Can this be handled with 'modes'? Also, return <br>
should only be used when "monad printing" is on, since, seeing "return <br>
x" everywhere instead of "Some x" (for the option monad) or "Inr x" (for <br>
the error monad) does not seem to be nice.</p>
<p>cheers</p>

<p>Stage 0 is perfectly OK, if you really mean to be a peer of the standard <br>
typecheck mechnism, which seems to be the case here.</p>
<p>BTW, the exception raised by Term.range_type is the builtin Match of SML, <br>
not MATCH (which some other modules define internally). It is important to <br>
be hypercritical concerning the naming of any exception with unqualified <br>
name and without argument, because mispelling will result in a dreaded <br>
catch-all pattern.  This would make the meaning of the programm depend on <br>
the weather, since various external events are injected as Interrupt <br>
exception into the regular program executation.</p>

<p>Back again to this part of inventing locally fresh names, which is <br>
suprisingly hard to get right in many practical situations.</p>
<p>In fact, the above is technically right, because you merely feed the name <br>
to the Term.lambda function, which will then abstract over v that is not <br>
in the body n.  It is also a bit confusing, because lambda terms work via <br>
de-Bruijn indices, so you do not need to invent names in most situations <br>
-- the pretty printer will take care of the renaming if required.</p>
<p>Above you merely do a dummy abstraction, which usually works by <br>
incrementing "loose bounds" in the body and adding an Abs constructor on <br>
top, with a "comment" for the bound variable as you like, e.g. "x". The <br>
incrementing can be skipped if the term is "closed", which is actually a <br>
precondition for the lambda function.  Your subterms seem to be indeed <br>
closed like that, because you operate as a plugin to Pattern.rewrite_term <br>
which strips off abstractions before entering the body.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Pattern.rewrite_term invents auxiliary free variables only <br>
by looking at the visible term material.  This means there is an implicit <br>
assumption that the rewrite process will not introduce other fixed <br>
variables from the surrounding context.</p>
<p>Anyway, to cut a long story short, you can just use Term.abs_dummy above <br>
without your own inventing of variables.  Like lambda it assumes a closed <br>
body.</p>
