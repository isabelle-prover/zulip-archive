<p>From: "John F. Hughes" &lt;<a href="mailto:jfh@cs.brown.edu">jfh@cs.brown.edu</a>&gt;<br>
[Apologies for previous incomplete message]<br>
Again, I'm trying to work with affine geometries. It seemed that proving<br>
things about general affine geometries might be like proving things about<br>
general groups, or modules, or other things like that...but because I seem<br>
to have two type-parameters, the "class" approach used in<br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/library/HOL/HOL-Isar_Examples/Group.html">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/library/HOL/HOL-Isar_Examples/Group.html</a><br>
won't work. So I went back to locales. I wanted to say that in a geometry,<br>
there are "points" and "lines", and that a point may or may not be on a<br>
line. An initial version of this said that Points was an 'a set, and Lines<br>
was an 'a set set, but then when I wanted to define "parallel" as a<br>
predicate on pairs of lines, I ended up with a predicate on pairs of 'a<br>
sets (not all of which are lines). So I backed off and said that point and<br>
line are types, and there's a predicate, "meets P l" that tells whether a<br>
point P is on the line l. That seemed to work OK (see the first part of the<br>
code below).</p>
<p>But then I wanted to extend that to include some of the axioms of an affine<br>
geometry (see the second locale below).</p>
<p>I initially wrote axiom a1b, for which I got a "unification failed" error.<br>
Then I wrote a1a, which worked. My questions are, "Why did Isabelle decide<br>
that the names 'a and 'b were better than the ones that I chose, and can I<br>
prevent this, so that the rest of my work is more readable?"</p>
<p>--John</p>
<p>My minimal example follows.</p>
<p>section ‹Basic affine geometries›</p>
<p>theory Affine1<br>
  imports Main<br>
begin</p>
<p>locale affine_plane_basics =<br>
  fixes<br>
    meets :: "'point ⇒ 'line ⇒ bool"</p>
<p>locale affine_plane = affine_plane_basics +<br>
  assumes<br>
    a1a: "⟦ (P::'a) ≠ Q ⟧ ⟹  (∃! (l::'b). meets P l ∧ meets Q  l)"<br>
    (* This version fails:<br>
    a1b: "⟦ (P::'point) ≠ Q ⟧ ⟹  (∃! (l::'line). meets P l ∧ meets Q  l)"<br>
    *)</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>Note that Isabelle sources are formal proof documents, not "code". This<br>
is formal mathematics, not programming. (Our would you call this mail<br>
text "code", because it was processed on a computer in fixed-width font?).</p>

<p>This is due to standard policies of Hindley-Milner type inference. There<br>
are certain rules for implicit scopes of type variables: sometimes they<br>
are fixed, sometimes arbitrary. Referring to things with arbitrary types<br>
in a different context produces most general canonical types,<br>
enumeration of fresh variable names like 'a, 'b, 'c, ...</p>
<p>If you want different type names, you can put explicit type constraints<br>
just in the right spot, e.g. like this:</p>
<p>locale affine_plane_basics =<br>
  fixes meets :: "'point ⇒ 'line ⇒ bool"</p>
<p>locale affine_plane =<br>
  affine_plane_basics meets for meets :: "'point ⇒ 'line ⇒ bool" +<br>
  assumes a1b: "P ≠ Q ⟹ ∃!l. meets P l ∧ meets Q l"</p>
<p>Note that I have removed the pointless type-constraints from the a1b<br>
proposition.</p>
<p>Quite often it is better not to want different type variable names, but<br>
let the type inference do its business unhindered.</p>
<p>There is a certain art to work with type-inference such that it does the<br>
right thing most of the time, without further ado.</p>
