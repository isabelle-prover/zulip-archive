<p>From: Rafal Kolanski &lt;<a href="mailto:rafalk@cse.unsw.edu.au">rafalk@cse.unsw.edu.au</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle Gurus,</p>
<p>After porting my development from slightly pre-2009 to 2009-1, I've <br>
noticed that I need to help isabelle out by using '-' more than I used <br>
to, for example:</p>
<p>case (Cons x xs)<br>
   hence a: "blah"<br>
     and a': "blah2"<br>
     and IH: "someIH"</p>
<p>this used to go away by simp or blast, but now I need to say:<br>
   by - simp<br>
or<br>
   by - blast</p>
<p>I expect this for "by - assumption" as assumption doesn't chain in the <br>
assumptions, but I find it a little strange that simp no longer does. As <br>
this looks intentional, can anyone tell me why this has changed?</p>
<p>Also, in my proofs when using force and auto, I've found I need to put <br>
in a lot more '!', especially on dest: and intro: arguments, and nearly <br>
always when saying "intro: ext". Once again, does anyone remember why <br>
this might be?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rafal Kolanski.</p>

Hi Rafal,</p>
<p>This sounds indeed strange.  Somehow erratic proof failures could always<br>
occur due to changes in default rules (esp. for classical reasoning),<br>
but your description sounds like a "systematic change".  Can you provide<br>
me more explicit proof text=</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>

Hi Rafal,</p>
<p>The "prems" are, roughly, the accumulated facts within a proof, which as<br>
a historical accident have been used implicitly by certain proof methods<br>
-- which, following the rule of thumb "explicit is better than<br>
implicit", turned out as a bad idea.  You can recover this behaviour by<br>
using prems explicitly, e.g. "using prems by ..." or "by (auto simp add:<br>
prems)" etc.  Best practice is to refer to used facts implicitly;<br>
recall that you can quote facts by proposition using backticks ``.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Many years ago (around 1999) the "prems" were indeed somehow correlated to <br>
local facts within a proof, in emulation of the old-style goal <br>
representation that lacks genuine facts (cf. the "insert" method).</p>
<p>Later (still in 1999, or maybe in 2000) the distinction between a proof <br>
context and a goal state became much clearer, and also more scalable -- <br>
both for users who need to read state information and tools that need to <br>
operate on them.  Ever since, local facts required for a proof step should <br>
have been indicated explicitly, but only in recent years I've made some <br>
effort to remove these early mistakes from the system.</p>
<p>Further note that the later introduction of locales (and arbitrary target <br>
contexts), as well as derived assumption elements such as 'obtain' <br>
rendered the "prems" register of the Isar machinery just an arbitrary <br>
collection of theorems that happen to have a certain foundational role. <br>
In user space it is meaningless and should not be used anymore -- the <br>
Proof General hilighting scheme also indicates this.</p>

Hi Rafal,</p>
<p>This indeed might be due to changes in the defaults for classical rules.<br>
 My own experience is that is usually preferable to use "auto ... simp<br>
add: expand_fun_eq" than "auto ... intro[!]: ext", which also makes<br>
these two proofs easier.</p>

<p>First of all, we need to be careful about different roles of "!".  IIRC, <br>

<p>Everything around "prems" causes lots misunderstanding, this mail thread <br>
already proves it (and there are older threads related to the same issue).</p>
<p>When you see "Legacy feature! Implicit use of prems in assumption proof" <br>
(in Isabelle2008) it means that "by auto" (or similar) has left over some <br>
pending subgoals, but these were closed by applying some arbitrary facts <br>
that happen to be connected to low-level assumptions for foundational <br>
reasons.  This is not really intuitive for two main reasons:</p>
<p>* Foundation via assimptions is an implementation detail, nothing the<br>
     user should care about.  For example, assume / presume / obtain /<br>
     guess / case / def produce such prems right now, but have / show do<br>
     not. Moreover, 'assumes' in locale expressions produce prems in<br>
     certain intermediate situations, but later it changes into a predicate<br>
     that is assumed and the rest is derived.  Various local theory targets<br>
     also have their own idea of introducing prems intermediately.</p>
<p>* Structurally, it is unclear which facts actually solve the<br>
     situation.  Referring to "prems" is somehow non-local.  You just need<br>
     to inspect the situations were the system emits the above "Legacy<br>
     feature! ..." message, and replace "by method" by "apply method" and<br>
     then look at the remaining goal state.  Usually it will take quite<br>
     some time to figure out how the goal was actually solved, but<br>
     information this is then easily added to the 'from' or 'using' part of<br>
     the invocation.  (I've done these cleanups many times, and often there<br>
     were even some errors in the proof text which facts really contribute<br>
     to the result.)</p>

local facts within a tactical proof.  (Back to field 1 of the game.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as that will not solve the pending goal. These, though, will:<br>
       by auto<br>
       by - assumption<br>
       by - simp<br>
       by - blast<br>
So auto is somehow special. However, simp and blast don't do this, thought <br>
they used to, because that feature is deprecated. What's the reasoning behind <br>
this? How come auto gets to chain without error or a legacy feature warning, <br>
but the other proof methods do not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are 3 different kinds of methods here:</p>
<p>* assumption is a single-step method (like "rule", "this") and is very<br>
     picky about the "using" part -- it will try to use these facts<br>
     simultaneously, which practically only works for 0 or 1 such facts.</p>
<p>"by - assumption" should hardly ever be useful in a proof; the<br>
     implicit ending of 'by' already includes "assumption" for all<br>
     remaining subgoals.</p>
<p>* auto: "simple method" that addresses multiple goals.  This means the<br>
     using part is first inserted into all subgoals and the internal<br>
     auto_tac operates on all of that.</p>
<p>* simp/blast: "simple method" that addresses the first goal.  The using<br>
     part is only inserted into the single subgoal where the internal<br>
     tactic operates.</p>
<p>Since you have multiple subgoals initially, plain "simp" and "blast" only ever <br>
operate on the first one.  (There is some chance that the old-style implicit <br>
use of prems happened to solve the second one without further notice -- Now <br>
call this "intuitive".)</p>
<p>BTW, the "-" method inserts used facts into all goals as well, which is the <br>
reason why the "by - method" form sometimes does a bit more than "by method". <br>
(I do not recommend to use "-" in this form, though.)</p>
<p>I reckon the following will work in your case:</p>
<p>by simp_all  -- "solve all goals uniformly (last to first)"<br>
   by blast+    -- "solve all goals iteratively (first to last)"</p>
<p>In general simp+ will <em>not</em> work as expected, because simp does not need to <br>
solve the subgoal it is applied to; blast/fast/force are all the same in <br>
solve-or-fail behaviour, so plain iteration does the job.  (This is the deeper <br>
reason why there is "simp_all" but no "blast_all" etc.)</p>
<p>The "auto" method is always in this "all" mode, but the [] method combinator <br>
explained in the isar-ref manual allows to restrict its effect on a selection <br>
of subgoals as well.</p>
