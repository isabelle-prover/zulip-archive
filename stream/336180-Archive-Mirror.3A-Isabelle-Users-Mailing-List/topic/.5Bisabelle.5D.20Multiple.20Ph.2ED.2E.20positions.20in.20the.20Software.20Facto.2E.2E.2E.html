<p>TU Darmstadt in Germany is offering multiple Ph.D. positions in the<br>
Software Factory 4.0 project coordinated by Prof. Dr. Heiko Mantel.</p>
<p>The Project</p>
<hr>
<p>You will be working on the LOEWE project "Software-Factory 4.0" (SF4.0),<br>
funded by the German State of Hesse.</p>
<p>The goal of "Software-Factory 4.0" is to enable legacy software systems <br>
(as used for high performance computing and cyber-physical production<br>
systems) to keep up with the rapid technological advances made in the <br>
development of new hardware and middleware platforms. Existing software <br>
must be retrofitted to fully exploit the potential provided by technological <br>
progress. Complete re-development of the existing stock of production<br>
software is infeasible. At the same time, superficially adapted legacy<br>
software prevents optimal hardware usage. This is known as the<br>
"software gap".</p>
<p>SF4.0 aims to create methods and tools that enable continuous and largely<br>
automated re-engineering of software to meet changed requirements and<br>
technological constraints. Re-engineering keeps software development costs<br>
manageable and allows one to preserve expert domain knowledge inherent to<br>
legacy software. In SF4.0, special emphasis will be put on the reliability<br>
of the resulting software. Formal methods and semantics will be applied<br>
for this purpose.</p>
<p>The two main application areas to be explored in SF4.0 are "High<br>
Performance Computing" (HPC) and "Industrie 4.0". In the former, <br>
parallelization of existing software is the main driving force, while the latter <br>
focuses on the variability aspects of cyber-physical production systems and<br>
the development of digital twins.</p>
<p>SF4.0 consists of eight part projects, each of which offers 1-2 Ph.D.<br>
positions in the areas of computer science and mechanical engineering. A<br>
selection of the specific areas includes: concurrency semantics, cyber-physical<br>
productioncsystems, formal methods, parallel and distributed computing,<br>
software-aided construction, software engineering, and static program analysis.</p>
<p>Your Profile</p>
<hr>
<p>You are enthusiastic about applied and/or theoretical research and you<br>
have a strong background and demonstrable interest in one or more of the areas<br>
mentioned above.</p>
<p>We are looking for researchers with an independent mind who are willing to<br>
cooperate in our international team. We expect good communicative and social<br>
skills. Candidates should be prepared to prove their English language skills.</p>
<p>As a research outcome we expect publications, software tools,<br>
and a Ph.D. thesis.</p>
<p>What We Offer</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>starting date of the position: from January 2018</li>
<li>a highly stimulating, dynamic, international scientific environment</li>
<li>
<p>the chance to participate in a highly visible, economically relevant research <br>
project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>full status as an employee at TU Darmstadt, including pension and health care<br>
benefits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>excellent facilities for professional and personal development</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Further Information and How to Apply:</p>
<hr>
<p>Applications should arrive before December 6, 2017. The application<br>
process will be available until all positions are filled.</p>
<p>An electronic application form and a description of the different part<br>
projects is available at the SF4.0 application portal:<br>
