Hi guys'n gals,</p>
<p>I feel ashamed now, while I feel it's so funny as much as useful enough to  <br>
be narrated, I'm telling the story here.</p>
<p>Say I had a local with “assumes A and B”. The most important stuff was in  <br>
A, so I was mainly busy proving theorems derived from A. One of those was  <br>
hard to me (I'm not a guru, and I'm as slow as a snail), and I multiple  <br>
times requested the help of Try/Sledgehammer and others. I was never happy  <br>
with the produced Isar proof, and to make it more clear, I wanted to  <br>
understand one I picked, expecting to make it more readable.</p>
<p>I was astonished to noticed one of the intermediate goal generated by  <br>
Sledgehammer, should have been impossible to prove according to my intents  <br>
and interpretations of A and B. I forked my investigations toward this new  <br>
case, and discovered I could both prove this goal and disprove it. Yes, I  <br>
could prove P and ¬ P! You guess I was rather frightened, while not  <br>
willing to believe in an Isabelle bug.</p>
<p>I finally understood: you could only prove ¬ P if you used A and B from  <br>
the locale's premisses and you could only prove P if you used only A and  <br>
don't bother about B; and as you could either bother or not about B, you  <br>
could prove both P and ¬ P one next to the other. So I changed the  <br>
locale's premisses into “assumes B and B ⟹ A” instead of “assumes A and  <br>
B”. I also have to add “using B” in most proofs about A targeting that  <br>
locale.</p>
<p>I was doing as if B was implicitly there everywhere; but it's not.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: don't forget the premisses, it's not enough to have it  <br>
in the locale's “assumes”, it probably also have to be there at the left  <br>
of an ⟹, in some propositions of the “assumes” section.</p>
<p>By the way, a question aside: is there a way to refer to a proposition  <br>
 from another proposition? I mean so that I would not have to copy/paste  <br>
the premiss of “(text of B) ⟹ (text of A)” and just refer to B, as “B ⟹  <br>
(text of A)” instead of the latter.</p>

Hi.</p>
<p>Already years ago, I got used to always provide some model for any<br>
locale that contains "final results" of my formalization, just to make<br>
sure that I have not introduced inconsistent assumptions by mistake. And<br>
this is, unfortunately, easier than one may think. E.g., a simple typo<br>
is already enough:</p>
<p>definition P :: "nat =&gt; bool" [...]</p>
<p>locale foo = assumes A: "j&gt;0 ==&gt; p j" (* &lt;-- note the lower-case typo<br>
here, p is actually a free variable! *)</p>
<p>inside the locale, you can prove everything you expect with A (and much<br>
more ;) ). Only when interpreting the locale you will realize the<br>
mistake. </p>
<p>Best,<br>
  Peter</p>

Hello Johannes,</p>
<p>I already tried this one. It seems to be allowed by Isar‑Ref, but Isabelle  <br>
reject it with this message: “Illegal term bindings in context element”.</p>

That's what I would like to avoid, as I would like to be able to predict  <br>
such issues. I'm still investigating the case, as the problem finally  <br>
remains unsolved: adding the premiss directly in the proposition did not  <br>
solve everything.</p>
<p>Some sanity theorems may help (successful in one case at least), but I  <br>
don't know any kind of general theorem which could assert there is no  <br>
possible contradictions. I guess this is feasible, as that must be  <br>
something close people do when they check a logic is sound and claim they  <br>
proved it.</p>

I was wrong, Isar‑Ref disallows it. Printed page 89 it says:</p>
<p>“Note that "(is p 1 . . . p n )" patterns given in the syntax of<br>
      assumes and defines above are illegal in locale definitions.”</p>
