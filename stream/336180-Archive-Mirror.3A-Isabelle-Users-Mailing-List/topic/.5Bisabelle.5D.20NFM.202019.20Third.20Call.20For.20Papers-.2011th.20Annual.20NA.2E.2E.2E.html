<p>The Eleventh NASA Formal Methods Symposium</p>
<p><a href="https://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/R2/pages/nfm2019.html">https://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/R2/pages/nfm2019.html</a></p>
<p>7 - 9 May 2019<br>
         Rice University, Houston, Texas, USA</p>
<hr>
<p>Theme of the Symposium:</p>
<hr>
<p>The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission-critical and <br>
safety-critical systems at NASA and in the aerospace industry require <br>
advanced techniques that address these systems' specification, design, <br>
verification, validation, and certification requirements. The NASA <br>
Formal Methods Symposium (NFM) is a forum to foster collaboration <br>
between theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, academia, and <br>
industry. NFM's goals are to identify challenges and to provide <br>
solutions for achieving assurance for such critical systems.</p>
<p>New developments and emerging applications like autonomous software for <br>
uncrewed deep space human habitats, caretaker robotics, Unmanned Aerial <br>
Systems (UAS), UAS Traffic Management (UTM), and the need for <br>
system-wide fault detection, diagnosis, and prognostics provide new <br>
challenges for system specification, development, and verification <br>
approaches. The focus of these symposiums are on formal techniques and <br>
other approaches for software assurance, including their theory, current <br>
capabilities and limitations, as well as their potential application to <br>
aerospace, robotics, and other NASA-relevant safety-critical systems <br>
during all stages of the software life-cycle.</p>
<p>The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is an annual event organized by the <br>
NASA Formal Methods (NFM) Steering Committee, comprised of researchers <br>
spanning several NASA centers. NFM 2019 <br>
(<a href="https://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/R2/pages/nfm2019.html">https://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/R2/pages/nfm2019.html</a>) is being <br>
co-organized by Rice University and NASA- Johnson Space Center in <br>
Houston, TX.</p>
<p>Topics of Interest:</p>
<hr>
<p>We encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches that bring together <br>
formal methods and techniques from other domains such as probabilistic <br>
reasoning, machine learning, control theory, robotics, and quantum <br>
computing among others.<br>
     * Formal verification, including theorem proving, model checking, <br>
and static analysis<br>
     * Advances in automated theorem proving including SAT and SMT solving<br>
     * Use of formal methods in software and system testing<br>
     * Run-time verification<br>
     * Techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods, such as <br>
abstraction and symbolic methods, compositional techniques, as well as <br>
parallel and/or distributed techniques<br>
     * Code generation from formally verified models<br>
     * Safety cases and system safety<br>
     * Formal approaches to fault tolerance<br>
     * Theoretical advances and empirical evaluations of formal methods <br>
techniques for safety-critical systems, including hybrid and embedded <br>
systems<br>
     * Formal methods in systems engineering and model-based development<br>
     * Correct-by-design controller synthesis<br>
     * Formal assurance methods to handle adaptive systems</p>

<p>Abstract Submission:  7 Dec 2018<br>
Paper Submission:    14 Dec 2018<br>
Paper Notifications: 22 Feb 2019<br>
Camera-ready Papers: 22 Mar 2019<br>
Symposium:          7-9 May 2019</p>
<p>Location &amp; Cost:</p>
<hr>
<p>The symposium will take place in the McMurtry Auditorium, Rice <br>
University, Houston, Texas, USA, May 7--9, 2019.</p>
<p>There will be no registration fee for participants. All interested <br>
individuals, including non-US citizens, are welcome to attend, to listen <br>
to the talks, and to participate in discussions; however, all attendees <br>
must register.</p>
<p>Submission Details:</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two categories of submissions:</p>
<p>1. Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete <br>
results (15 pages + references)<br>
    2. Two categories of short papers: (6 pages + references)<br>
    (a) Tool Papers describing novel, publicly-available tools<br>
    (b) Case Studies detailing complete applications of formal methods <br>
to real systems with publicly-available artifacts, or substantial <br>
work-in-progress describing results from designing a new technique for a <br>
new application, with appropriate available artifacts</p>
<p>All papers should be in English and describe original work that has not <br>
been published or submitted elsewhere. All submissions will be fully <br>
reviewed by members of the Programme Committee. Papers will appear in a <br>
volume of Springer's Lecture Notes on Computer Science (LNCS), and must <br>
use LNCS style formatting.</p>
<p>Artifacts enabling reproducibility of the paper's major contributions <br>
are strongly encouraged and will be considered in PC evaluations. <br>
Appendices are allowed but will be read at the discretion of the PC. <br>
Websites with additional artifacts, e.g., for reproducibility or <br>
additional correctness proofs, are encouraged. Papers should be <br>
submitted in PDF format here: <br>
