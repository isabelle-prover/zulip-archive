Hi,</p>
<p>I see that Named_Target.reinit is gone in 2014-rc0. It seems that it is<br>
equivalent to leaving to a theory and then entering the target again.<br>
What was its purpose and what is the right way to replace it?</p>
<p>It seems that it is sometimes necessary to perform these steps to get<br>
the simpset updated after changing it in the background theory with<br>
Local_Theory.background_theory_result.</p>

<p>This belongs to the system infrastructure -- user-space tools in <br>
Isabelle/ML should not be affected by the change.</p>

<p>This sounds a bit odd, maybe some formerly global-theory tool that was <br>
updated a bit too quickly, without really leaving the old ways behind.</p>
<p>Declarations with the "simp" attribute may be done like in Isar source, <br>
using the ML antiquotation @{attributes [simp]} with Local_Theory.note, <br>
for example.  (Just hypersearch the sources for examples.)</p>
<p>If the simpset update is some other ML function, not an attribute, you may <br>
use Simplifier.map_ss with Local_Theory.declaration, which also allows to <br>
insist in a pervasive scope, such that the declaration affects the global <br>
theory as well.</p>

<p>From: Florian Haftmann &lt;<a href="mailto:florian.haftmann@informatik.tu-muenchen.de">florian.haftmann@informatik.tu-muenchen.de</a>&gt;<br>
This is a good opportunity to describe the rationale behind the local<br>
theory / target / named target matter in more detail »as it is by now«.</p>
<p>The fundamental ideas have been presented in »Local Theory<br>
Specifications in Isabelle/Isar« by Haftmann/Wenzel; as usual, the<br>
implementation is a little bit more involved, and also some extensions<br>
have appeared since then, notably nested target contexts and confined<br>
interpretation.</p>
<p>What is a <em>local theory</em>? The extension of a proof context with an<br>
abstract signature to allow definitional extensions (most prominently,<br>
<em>define</em> and <em>note</em> – the actual interface can be found as *type<br>
operations* in Pure/Isar/local_theory.ML).</p>
<p>A <em>target</em> is a particular implementation of the local theory signature.</p>
<p>The picture is a little complicated by the possibility to stack<br>
arbitrary many auxiliary contexts on top a target (»context fixes …<br>
assumes … begin … end« in Isar). However, these merely add variables and<br>
assumptions in a canonical way; the target at the bottom of this stack,<br>
the <em>bottom target,</em> is not really affected by this. So, if we speak<br>
about target, we most times refer to a particular bottom target with a<br>
(possibly empty) stack auf axuiliary contexts on top of it.</p>
<p>Conceptually, there are two main targets: the theory target and the<br>
locale target, which can be seen as the most generic targets possible.</p>
<p>A slight variant of the locale target is the class target, which adds a<br>
canonical interpretation on the theory level. An important class of<br>
targets are <em>theory-like targets</em>, which behave almost like the theory<br>
target, but feature slight modifications like additional syntax and a<br>
consistency check before leaving the local theory. The overloading and<br>
instantiation targets are prominent examples.</p>
<p>Concerning the concept of *named target. *Each type class and locale in<br>
a theory can be referred to by a string s; if we identify the empty<br>
string with the theory itself, Named_Target.init s opens a local theory<br>
for the theory / locale / class with the appropriate theory / locale /<br>
class target. This »selection by name« manifests in the Isar toplevel<br>
also (»context s begin … end«), and hence the prominent status of these<br>
named targets in the system infrastructure.</p>
<p>An important consequence of the abstract nature of local theories is<br>
that only target implementations are allowed to break their abstraction;<br>
client code is expected to operate on any kind of local theory<br>
regardless of the particular (bottom) target. In the Isabelle<br>
distribution, there are currently (Isabelle2014-RC0) four spots which<br>
are candidates for a violation of this principle:</p>
<p>./Pure/Isar/class_declaration.ML:349:    val proto_sub = case<br>
Named_Target.class_of lthy of<br>
./Pure/Isar/expression.ML:925:  if Named_Target.is_theory lthy<br>
./Pure/Isar/expression.ML:932:      if Named_Target.is_theory lthy<br>
./Tools/quickcheck.ML:365:    val some_locale =<br>
Named_Target.bottom_locale_of lthy;</p>
<p>The first one is sane since the class target is allowed to break its own<br>
abstraction. Number two and three are similar. The last one is indeed a<br>
little bit odd, but since its is some kind of diagnostic device, it is<br>
maybe ok.</p>
<p>Generally, user space tools should refrain from using those<br>
abstraction-breaking query operations in Named_Target. The same holds<br>
for the Named_Target.switch (or its earlier predecessor,<br>
Named_Target.reinit) which is a device to master the following situation<br>
with an ad-hoc local theory switch which is currently allowed in Isar:</p>
<p>context s<br>
begin</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>definition (in t):<br>
  …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>If client code implements its own target, in most cases it will be a<br>
theory-like target. There are two possibilites to approach it:</p>
<p>a) Something like<br>
    |&gt; Local_Theory.init naming<br>
       {define = Generic_Target.define …,<br>
        notes = Generic_Target.notes Generic_Target.theory_notes,<br>
        abbrev = Generic_Target.abbrev Generic_Target.theory_abbrev,<br>
        declaration = K Generic_Target.theory_declaration,<br>
        subscription = Generic_Target.theory_registration,<br>
        pretty = …,<br>
        exit = … #&gt; Local_Theory.target_of #&gt; Sign.change_end_local}<br>
(cf. Pure/Isar/class.ML) See how Generic_Target provides everything<br>
needed to plug together implementations of local theory operations on<br>
the spot.</p>
<p>b) If the target only adds a check or something similar before leaving<br>
the local theory, it can also be setup using Named_Target.theory_like_init.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
    Florian<br>
