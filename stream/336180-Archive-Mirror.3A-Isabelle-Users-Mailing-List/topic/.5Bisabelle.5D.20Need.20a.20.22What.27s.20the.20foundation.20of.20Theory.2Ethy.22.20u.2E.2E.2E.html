Hi,</p>
<p>I don't need this now, but in a year or two, I'd like to have a Isabelle <br>
utility that I run on a theory which tells me what the "foundation" is, <br>
and that also can take a Thy1.thy as the base "foundation", and given <br>
Thy2.thy, the utility reports what additional "foundation" Thy2.thy adds <br>
to Thy1.thy.</p>
<p>The foundation would be anything in a theory which would be axiomatic in <br>
nature, and maybe some kind of checksum on things.</p>
<p>Different people are motivated by Isabelle for different reasons. A big <br>
part of my interest in Isabelle is that it's a tool which, at the very <br>
least, replaces the function of peer reviewed journals, to the extent <br>
that it can. That means, at the very least, it's a huge preliminary <br>
vetting of logic in Theory.thy that announces to anyone interested, "The <br>
logic in Theory.thy has been vetted by Isabelle as being correct. It <br>
most likely will not be a waste of anyone's time to wade through 20,000 <br>
lines of source in Theory.thy to figure out what it is, and to find out <br>
if it really is correct."</p>
<p>On a personal level, by all appearances, Isabelle can take the place of <br>
peer reviewed journals, to the extent that it can give you confidence <br>
that you're not producing a bunch of logical nonsense. What Isabelle <br>
doesn't do is solve the "person X is trustworthy and competent" problem <br>
on a community level.</p>
<p>I could dig through the mailing list archives and find where Larry has <br>
said something like, "You have to use Isabelle intelligently." And a <br>
while back, on the HOL4 list, there was a discussion about the <br>
possibilities of people getting proof assistants to do something wrong <br>
for either devious reasons or non-devious reasons. And most recently, on <br>
this very list, Falso was presented as a great logical break through, <br>
where, no doubt, still today, many verifiers, formalizers, and sourcers, <br>
not to be confused with sorcerers, are now full of themselves, mistaking <br>
their own logical prowess with the success that always comes with Falso.</p>

<p>Anyway, a "what's the foundation" utility would allow people to do a 10 <br>
second check on a theory as a first step, to make sure nothing obvious <br>
is wrong, and to increase the trust factor, and even good people mess up <br>
bad some times.</p>
<p>I assume that there are much more complex problems involved in proof <br>
assistants being completely secure from being hacked, or messed up <br>
unintentionally, but I think it would be good for a person to get a <br>

<p>Ramana,</p>
<p>So it seems that, in the future, third-party verification will be a big <br>
part of verifying the verifiers.</p>
<p>There's one big problem, which occurred to me lately. I'm getting <br>
totally locked into Isabelle due to type classes and Isabelle's nifty <br>
type coercion commands. Using those features prevents the possibility of <br>
doing an easy translation to any other member of the HOL family. I <br>
probably would never have the time to port over what I'm doing, but if I <br>
can do something, then I sometimes entertain the idea of doing that <br>
something, so timewise, the limitation ends up being a good thing.</p>
<p>With Open Theory, the last time I was looking at it, I think I saw that <br>
it doesn't allow new axioms. That's good for third-party verification, <br>
but bad if I need new axioms, which I do. With Dedkti, I assume that the <br>
problem of either of or both of type classes and no new axioms rules it <br>
out. For these, if the foundation is fixed, then it solves the problem <br>
of what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>HOL Zero would fall under the "more complex" part of verifying the <br>
verifiers. But even HOL Zero would need a utility to report back what <br>
the foundation is. If it would be as simple as listing the axiom <br>
commands, then it would do that. The idea is for some official utility <br>
to authoritatively tell us exactly what axiomatic foundation is being <br>
used, other than an exploit, rather than us grepping on some files and <br>
us still saying, "I wonder if this is all there is to the axiomatic <br>
foundation?" I'll say more about this in reply to Mark's email.</p>
<p>Thanks for the links.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>From: Ramana Kumar &lt;<a href="mailto:rk436@cam.ac.uk">rk436@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
OpenTheory does allow new axioms. (OpenTheory only checks that some<br>
conclusions follow from some axioms; you're free in the choice of<br>
conclusions and axioms, as long as you provide the proof.)</p>
<p>Dedukti should work both for new axioms and for type classes. It does an<br>
encoding into a rich type theory that should support most logical<br>
features... (I'm not so sure about the details).</p>

<p>Hi Gottfried,</p>
<p>So you are advocating a utility that would reveal the "foundation" in a<br>
theory.  Do you envisage that this utility would have a human aspect to its<br>
usage, reviewing that the reported foundation is good, e.g. that the "+"<br>
operator really is the intended "+" operator, etc? By saying a "10 second<br>
check", it suggests not, although maybe I'm missing your point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark,</p>
<p>No, it's only to list anything that's being used in the theory and <br>
language that's either axiomatic, or might be axiomatic.  Also, it would <br>
do some easy checks to rule out the possibility of a person doing sneaky <br>
things, like doing checksum comparisons on third-party files a person is <br>
distributing with their theory, where the local third-party files would <br>
be obtained from the original source.</p>
<p>If someone writes 100,000 lines of source and at the end claims to prove <br>
the Riemann Conjecture, the first thing you want to know is what's in <br>
their THY that's axiomatic, or can't be determined to be axiomatic. The <br>
utility is to give you that information fast.</p>
<p>If someone's not using anything axiomatic beyond what Complex_Main gives <br>
them in Isabelle, then their doing stupid stuff like trying to fool <br>
people with deceptive notation still  wouldn't allow them to prove <br>
something that's not true. It would just appear to be something <br>
different on the surface. The statement of a theorem after 50,000 lines <br>
of source is always going to take some effort to figure out what it <br>
proves. The utility is to let you know what the limitations there are to <br>
the foundation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, are<br>
you suggesting that the utility would do some form of automated check on the<br>
foundation of a theory, or would it just report what the foundation is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it would just tell me what the axiomatic foundation is for a <br>
particular THY, or what can't be determined in a THY to be axiomatic.</p>
<p>Some things can't be hacked easily. Most people use distribution sources <br>
they've gotten from the official web sites, so you can't hack the <br>
distribution sources and fool anyone but people using local sources. I <br>
do want the utility to tell me what foundation Complex_Main gives me, <br>
but I'd think it's mostly about the utility reporting what people have <br>
done to extend Complex_Main, or done to modify third-party files that <br>
aren't part of the official distribution sources.</p>
<p>The simple part would be listing the axioms used. You might think all I <br>
need to do is grep on "axiomatization", but in Isar, there are more than <br>
"axiomatization". The latest axiomatic command in Isar I've learned <br>
about is "arities". It's not obvious at all it's an axiomatic command.</p>
<p>Right now I'm speculating that when ML is used in Isar, it can't be <br>
determined that the ML does something axiomatic unless you inspect the <br>
ML, but I wouldn't know, which is the purpose of the utility, to get an <br>
official report on what the foundation is.</p>
<p>The purpose is to make it fast, easy, and official what axiomatic <br>
foundation is being used in a THY. For the case where we're not <br>
interested in any logic proved other than what can be proved by <br>
importing Complex_Main, the first thing we would do is run the utility <br>
on a THY to see if that's the case.</p>
<p>I was vague on the details because it's the Isabelle foundation people <br>
who know what possibly can be done axiomatically, but I came up with a <br>
scenario:</p>
<p>1) Person 3 releases Theory3.thy. It's distributed with Theory1.thy and <br>
Theory2.thy, which have been released by Persons 1 and 2.</p>
<p>2) I download Person 3's theory, and I run the Isabelle foundation <br>
utility on it. It does a checksum comparison on Theory1.thy and <br>
Theory2.thy with the original files which I obtained. It tells me <br>
everything that's in Theory3.thy that's axiomatic, or can't be <br>
determined to be axiomatic. Additionally, it tells me what's axiomatic <br>
beyond what's axiomatic in Theory1.thy and Theory2.thy</p>
<p>Now, having obtained all that information in a couple of minutes, I can <br>
make an informed decision about whether I want to look at Theory1.thy. <br>
If I'm a professor, and Person 3 wasn't supposed to add anything <br>
axiomatic, and they  did, they get bad grade. If I'm an employer, and <br>
Person 3 wasn't supposed to use anything axiomatic, and they did, they <br>
get fired.</p>
<p>Some of that I could do myself, but then it's not official, and I don't <br>
know all the details about what can be axiomatic in Isabelle, or what <br>
can't be determined to be axiomatic.</p>
<p>It's not just about checking others, I want the ability to say to <br>
people, "Here's an official report on the foundation I'm using, so you <br>
can know up front what logic my theory is based on."</p>
<p>Like I said to Ramana, even a third-party verifier like yours needs to <br>
be able to give a basic report on what foundation is being used. If all <br>
I'm interested in is standard HOL, then I want to know as fast as <br>
possible whether someone's using standard HOL.</p>

<p>If it's easy, and a single, automated process, then I definitely want to <br>
know about it. But if I have ten theorems in a theory that give me 10 <br>
final results, rather than one final result, then it's not easy if I <br>
have to manually find those 10 theorems, and type in a command, and look <br>
at the results. I like the idea of automation, as we all do.</p>
<p>I keep using the phrase "or can't be determined to be axiomatic". I say <br>
that because I don't assume that with ML used in a THY it's quick and <br>
easy to automate listing any statement in the ML that's axiomatic, but <br>
it could be easy. I try to assume less than more.</p>
<p>What is axiomatic in logic is so important, the first thing that the <br>
software should provide for a THY is what axiomatic statements get used <br>
in the THY, and anything axiomatic that the THY imports. I want to know <br>
what others are getting for free, and I want others to know what I'm <br>
getting for free, and I want it all to be listed by an official utility <br>
so we all know it's legit and official.</p>
<p>I shouldn't have to have any expertise to answer the question, "What's <br>
the axiomatic foundation of Theory.thy?" The software should immediately <br>
be able to tell me, whether I understand what it tells me or not.</p>
<p>When you study a book on axiomatic set theory, you get the axioms up <br>
front. You don't understand them at first, but getting them up front <br>
categorizes the logic you're using. We're not really interested in <br>
ZFC+Falso. It's different. We immediately skip past those theories in <br>
the AFP that tell us Falso is used. When they don't tell us up front <br>
they use Falso, we end up looking at something we're not interested in.</p>
<p>I'm making a request which now sounds like a demand, but I just use <br>
what's available, and a lot is available. On a private level, I don't <br>
need this at all.</p>
<p>What I'm asking for will eventually become a priority. If thousands of <br>
people are using proof assistants, and they're not from some circle of <br>
trusted professionals, if you don't know a person, and you don't know <br>
what's in their THY, you want to know immediately and effortlessly what <br>
they're using axiomatically, and you want the software to tell you that, <br>
and do with automation.</p>

<p>No, it's only to list anything that's being used in the theory and<br>

<p>Some things can't be hacked easily. Most people use distribution sources<br>
they've gotten from the official web sites, so you can't hack the<br>
distribution sources and fool anyone but people using local sources. I do<br>
want the utility to tell me what foundation Complex_Main gives me, but I'd<br>
think it's mostly about the utility reporting what people have done to<br>
extend Complex_Main, or done to modify third-party files that aren't part<br>
of the official distribution sources.</p>
<p>The simple part would be listing the axioms used. You might think all I<br>
need to do is grep on "axiomatization", but in Isar, there are more than<br>
"axiomatization". The latest axiomatic command in Isar I've learned about<br>
is "arities". It's not obvious at all it's an axiomatic command.</p>
<p>Right now I'm speculating that when ML is used in Isar, it can't be<br>
determined that the ML does something axiomatic unless you inspect the ML,<br>
but I wouldn't know, which is the purpose of the utility, to get an<br>
official report on what the foundation is.</p>
<p>The purpose is to make it fast, easy, and official what axiomatic<br>
foundation is being used in a THY. For the case where we're not interested<br>
in any logic proved other than what can be proved by importing<br>
Complex_Main, the first thing we would do is run the utility on a THY to<br>
see if that's the case.</p>
<p>I was vague on the details because it's the Isabelle foundation people who<br>
know what possibly can be done axiomatically, but I came up with a scenario:</p>
<p>1) Person 3 releases Theory3.thy. It's distributed with Theory1.thy and<br>
Theory2.thy, which have been released by Persons 1 and 2.</p>
<p>2) I download Person 3's theory, and I run the Isabelle foundation utility<br>
on it. It does a checksum comparison on Theory1.thy and Theory2.thy with<br>
the original files which I obtained. It tells me everything that's in<br>
Theory3.thy that's axiomatic, or can't be determined to be axiomatic.<br>
Additionally, it tells me what's axiomatic beyond what's axiomatic in<br>
Theory1.thy and Theory2.thy</p>
<p>Now, having obtained all that information in a couple of minutes, I can<br>
make an informed decision about whether I want to look at Theory1.thy. If<br>
I'm a professor, and Person 3 wasn't supposed to add anything axiomatic,<br>
and they  did, they get bad grade. If I'm an employer, and Person 3 wasn't<br>
supposed to use anything axiomatic, and they did, they get fired.</p>
<p>Some of that I could do myself, but then it's not official, and I don't<br>
know all the details about what can be axiomatic in Isabelle, or what can't<br>
be determined to be axiomatic.</p>
<p>It's not just about checking others, I want the ability to say to people,<br>
"Here's an official report on the foundation I'm using, so you can know up<br>
front what logic my theory is based on."</p>
<p>Like I said to Ramana, even a third-party verifier like yours needs to be<br>
able to give a basic report on what foundation is being used. If all I'm<br>
interested in is standard HOL, then I want to know as fast as possible<br>
whether someone's using standard HOL.</p>

just HOL axioms (i.e. the completely unrestricted form of HOL assertion)?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where I'm not the one who's supposed to be deciding on <br>
everything in Isabelle/HOL, Isabelle/Isar, Isabelle/ML, and <br>
Isabelle/Pure that deserves to be labeled "axiomatic".</p>
<p>I never made any real progress in HOL4, but it appears that what is <br>
axiomatic in HOL4 is more straightforward and obvious than what's <br>
axiomatic in Isabelle/ML, Isabelle/Pure, and Isabelle/Isar.</p>
<p>At the easiest level, it's keywords in Isar that are axiomatic, two of <br>
those keywords being "arities" and "axiomatization".</p>
<p>I'm under the impression that Isar constants aren't axiomatic, that they <br>
don't allow you to prove anything other than they exist, or that they <br>
always return a value because HOL functions are total. There is the <br>
undefined constant in HOL.thy "axiomatization undefined :: 'a", line <br>
195, which Lars pointed out, so it looks like constants alone don't give <br>
us anything axiomatic.</p>
<p>As far as types, there is this statement in isar-ref.pdf:</p>
<p>If you introduce a new type axiomatically, i.e. via typedecl and<br>
    axiomatization, the minimum requirement is that it has a non-empty<br>
    model, to avoid immediate collapse of the HOL logic.</p>
<p>What does that mean in the context of what in Theory.thy is the <br>
foundation? I don't know completely, but I do know that I used <br>
"typedecl" and left the HOL function "eq" undefined for my new type, and <br>
after I stated an axiom, my logic was inconsistent because "eq" wasn't <br>
defined for my new type. So, apparently, typedecl qualifies as being <br>
listed in "the foundation".</p>
<p>To summarize, the utility is supposed to tell me what's axiomatic in a <br>
THY, so I can then tell you what's axiomatic in a THY.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't you mean "yes" as the answer to my quesion?  Surely whatever<br>
foundation is being printed out by the utility needs to be examined in<br>
detail, with all its subtlety, by a human to make sure it's good foundation<br>
rather than nonsense.  This is not a 10 seconds exercise, even with the most<br>
user-friendly utility imaginable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, other than the utility reporting that the logic is inconsistent. If <br>
someone puts in an axiom that will give them the Riemann Hypothesis, but <br>
which isn't the Riemann Hypothesis, how is the software supposed to know <br>
that it's nonsense, unless it makes the logic inconsistent?</p>
<p>You could have a black list of bogus axioms, but that's no great <br>
feature. Most likely, if a crackpot published a THY with 10,000 lines of <br>
source claiming to prove the Riemann Hypothesis, there would only be a <br>
few axiomatic statements in it. What's important is that the utility <br>
tells me that on line 4500 "axiomatization" is used, and what the axiom <br>
is. Or maybe "arities" is used in a clever way to get the result, but it <br>
tells me about it, and it's my job to judge whether it's valid.</p>
<p>For most people using Isabelle/HOL, it's not about whether additional <br>
axioms are nonsense or not, it's that Isabelle/HOL shouldn't be extended <br>
axiomatically in any way. The foundation to check any THY against is <br>
Complex_Main.thy, and mostly, people don't want anything axiomatic <br>
beyond that.</p>
<p>The nature of logic is I'm free to start with whatever axioms I want. <br>
The main thing is to clearly know what the foundation is, not to have <br>
someone tell you that it's nonsense. What I'm asking for is a 1 day or a <br>
1 week job. If I ask for more, no one has the time to do it.</p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The utility doing a checksum on a file using a known good checksum would <br>
be a secondary feature. This falls under "easy integrity check" rather <br>
than "axiomatic declaration in the language".</p>
<p>The idea is that Trusted Person has released Hol_Extension.thy and it <br>
has become a standard extension of HOL, but it's not part of the <br>
Isabelle2013 distribution, and people are distributing it with their own <br>
theories. I give the utility a MD5 checksum that Hol_Extension.thy is <br>
supposed to match when a checksum is run on the file. If it doesn't <br>
match, then the person is not distributing the right file, and maybe <br>
they edited it.</p>
<p>Okay, but if I have the known good  Hol_Extension.thy, then can't I just <br>
copy it over the one distributed? So maybe the purpose is just to try <br>
and bust amateur  deceivers who are trying to do easy hacks.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You would have to tell me what proof auditing is, but I don't classify <br>
it as proof auditing. "Proof auditing" implies that proofs need to be <br>
checked because there's the possibility that the underlying software is <br>
being exploited or has bugs.</p>
<p>I use the phrase "or can't be determined to be axiomatic," but I'm only <br>
speculating that a person might need to look at a block of ML to <br>
determine whether it declares something axiomatic. The utility would <br>
report on ML that's used which needs to be inspected by a human, and a <br>
person who knows enough could decisively determine whether the ML is <br>
axiomatic. That's what I was talking about, and just knowing about <br>
anything that's axiomatic.</p>
<p>If I state a axiom that gives me a proof of the Riemann Conjecture, <br>
there's nothing that needs to audited. The proof is correct, given the <br>
axiom. Logically, there's no problem with the proof.</p>
