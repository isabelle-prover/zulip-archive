<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear AFP users,</p>
<p>AFP abstracts may now contain LaTeX formulae (both inline and display).<br>
Rendering is done with MathJax and should work smoothly and consistently<br>
in any remotely recent browser.</p>
<p>Formulae can simply be embedded using $…$ or <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>…</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">…</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.123em;"></span><span class="minner">…</span></span></span></span> and most basic LaTeX<br>
maths commands are supported.</p>
<p>An example can be found in the example submission:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Example-Submission.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Example-Submission.html</a></p>
<p>For more information on this, see the submission guidelines:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/submitting.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/submitting.html</a></p>
<p>Should there be any issues, please let me know.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

That is certainly an improvement.</p>
<p>At some point the standard Isabelle document output for HTML needs to be<br>
improved analogously, but the underlying web technologies are still unclear to me.</p>
<p>Instead of old-fashioned MathJax, I've seen more and more activity around<br>
KaTeX in recent years, but these guys are very modest in there version<br>

<p>Absolutely. I personally find those PDF documents that we produce at the<br>
moment completely useless. They are not very readable and the arbitrary<br>
restriction to A4 PDFs introduces arbitrary and nonpredictable line<br>
breaks that make this even worse.</p>
<p>Ideally, I think, we would have heavily hyperlinked HTML where you can<br>

<p>I also have been wondering for a while whether we should have something<br>
like an optional "handwavy output mode", where things are printed in<br>
more casual notation (e.g. integrals are just printed as integrals) with<br>
no regard for ambiguities or lost detail – just to give the user a<br>
better impression of what the "real" content of the statement is. This<br>
might also make big goals more readable.</p>
<p>But setting this sort of thing up properly is going to be a lot of work,<br>
and we would first need more sophisticated output options in<br>
Isabelle/jEdit (which is probably also a lot of work).</p>

<p>I don't really see what the big advantage of KaTeX is. Yes, it is<br>
perhaps slightly faster, but not enough to make a big difference, in my<br>
impression. Perhaps it becomes more pronounced if you really have a huge<br>
number of formulae (as would be the case for HTML export). I also got<br>
the impression that KaTeX is still somewhat experimental and does not<br>
support everything that MathJax does.</p>
<p>Switching MathJax for KaTeX or whatever in the AFP should be fairly easy<br>
if we should decide to do so in the future.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that all these JavaScript-based solutions are<br>
suboptimal because 1. they rely on JavaScript and 2. it takes a while<br>
for the formulae to be rendered. A much better option would be<br>
delivering them as MathML directly (which the AFP sitegen could produce<br>
from the LaTeX statically), but unfortunately, very few browsers support<br>
MathML well. So I fear MathJax etc. is the best solution for now.</p>

MathML is one of these technologies that "are continuously coming" and never<br>
arrive. I still remember it from approx. 1992:<br>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Amaya/MathExamples.html">https://www.w3.org/Amaya/MathExamples.html</a></p>
<p>I wonder if there is a framework for mathematical documents that is a bit more<br>
high-level, that we don't have to it again from basic principles.</p>
<p>Recently, someone pointed at <a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML">https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML</a> but it looks fairly<br>
old-school at first sight.</p>
<p>In contrast, the really fancy things appear to be mostly based on JavaScript<br>
frameworks.</p>

My impression was that it's already there. Firefox supports it extremely<br>
well (that's why MathJax outputs MathML for Firefox). Safari's support<br>
on the other hand is still not great, last I heard.</p>
<p>The other two big players, Google and Microsoft, decided not to support<br>
it at all. Presumably such small companies simply do not have the<br>
resources for such an endeavour.</p>
<p>As always, the best standards are useless if the dominant players<br>
(Google especially) are against them.</p>
<p>(MathML is of course extremely verbose and can hardly be considered an<br>
input format. But that's not really an issue, given that you can compile<br>
to it – which is what MathJax already does. I just think it should<br>
happen statically and not on the client every time you load the web page.)</p>

I am myself an old-fashioned Firefox user, although we see a gradual<br>
monopolization towards Chromium.</p>
<p>Even MicroSoft Edge is following that:<br>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4501095/download-the-new-microsoft-edge-based-on-chromium">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4501095/download-the-new-microsoft-edge-based-on-chromium</a></p>
<p>VSCode already has Chromium at the bottom.</p>
<p>The java-cef project promises to embed Chromium into a regular Java GUI<br>
environment: <a href="https://github.com/chromiumembedded/java-cef">https://github.com/chromiumembedded/java-cef</a></p>
<p>So there might be an indication, that everything could converge to the<br>
Chromium rendering platform rather soon. But as usual, it requires careful<br>
research of the technology / sociology / ideology.</p>

Indeed. I link the source code of my projects in a very primitive way <br>
(by modifying the produced HTMLs, for example in here <br>
&lt;<a href="https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/forcing/Forcing/html/Forcing_Notions.html">https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/forcing/Forcing/html/Forcing_Notions.html</a>&gt;). <br>
This also alleviates the "pink screen" phenomenon (that you can't <br>
Crtl-click on a definition of sources of the current running logic).</p>
<p>I also have been wondering for a while whether we should have something<br>
like an optional "handwavy output mode", where things are printed in<br>
more casual notation (e.g. integrals are just printed as integrals) with<br>
no regard for ambiguities or lost detail – just to give the user a<br>
better impression of what the "real" content of the statement is. This<br>
might also make big goals more readable.</p>
<p>Another nice feature would be (un)folding sections. If you are writing a <br>
sensible proof document (especially math), it would be desirable to be <br>
presented with an "eagle's eye" view of proofs, understandable/palatable <br>
by specialists, and with the possibility of diving into details by <br>
unfolding. Actually, I do not know if Isabelle documenting capabilities <br>
allow to select what depth of an argument is to be shown.</p>
