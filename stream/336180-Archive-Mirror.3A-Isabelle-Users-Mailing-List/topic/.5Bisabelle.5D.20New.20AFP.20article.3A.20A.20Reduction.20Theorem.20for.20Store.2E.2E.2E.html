A Reduction Theorem for Store Buffers<br>
Ernie Cohen and Norbert Schirmer</p>
<p>When verifying a concurrent program, it is usual to assume that memory is <br>
sequentially consistent. However, most modern multiprocessors depend on store <br>
buffering for efficiency, and provide native sequential consistency only at a <br>
substantial performance penalty. To regain sequential consistency, a programmer <br>
has to follow an appropriate programming discipline. However, na\"ive <br>
disciplines, such as protecting all shared accesses with locks, are not flexible <br>
enough for building high-performance multiprocessor software. We present a new <br>
discipline for concurrent programming under TSO (total store order, with store <br>
buffer forwarding). It does not depend on concurrency primitives, such as locks. <br>
Instead, threads use ghost operations to acquire and release ownership of memory <br>
addresses. A thread can write to an address only if no other thread owns it, and <br>
can read from an address only if it owns it or it is shared and the thread has <br>
flushed its store buffer since it last wrote to an address it did not own. This <br>
discipline covers both coarse-grained concurrency (where data is protected by <br>
locks) as well as fine-grained concurrency (where atomic operations race to <br>
memory). We formalize this discipline in Isabelle/HOL, and prove that if every <br>
execution of a program in a system without store buffers follows the discipline, <br>
then every execution of the program with store buffers is sequentially <br>
consistent. Thus, we can show sequential consistency under TSO by ordinary <br>
assertional reasoning about the program, without having to consider store <br>
buffers at all.</p>
