<p>From: David Trachtenherz &lt;<a href="mailto:trachten@in.tum.de">trachten@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
An additional remark on infinite lists in my entry: I designed them very <br>
pragmatically; the definitions and lemmas are named similar to those for <br>
finite lists and also work similar, also w. r. t. lemmas added to the <br>
simpset. Some lemmas work even simpler because infinite lists naturally <br>
don't need assumptions of the form "i &lt; length xs" or "length xs = <br>
length ys". So I do hope that everybody used to work with finite lists <br>
will also be comfortable with this formalization of infinite lists.</p>
<p>Additionally, the relation and transition between infinite and finite <br>
lists is very direct: truncating an infinite list returns a finite list, <br>
appending an infinite list to a finite list returns an infinite list, <br>
and finite lists can also be prefixes of infinite lists. (For example, I <br>
used this direct relation in my other entry, AutoFocus-Stream, which <br>
formalizes AutoFocus stream processing: the computation of an AutoFocus <br>
component/model/system is an infinite stream of results delivered for an <br>
infinite stream of input messages, represented by infinite lists; this <br>
way we can reason about AutoFocus computations. When truncating the <br>
infinite input stream/list, we obtain a finite input stream, represented <br>
by a finite list, and can not only reason about the resulting finite <br>
computation, but also operationally simulate it using the Isabelle <br>
evaluation function "value" with the finite input stream/list.)</p>

Dear David,</p>
<p>my point was not to criticize your work. I merely wanted to point out that at <br>
present, any user has to buy into one of the three versions. Switching from one <br>
to the other might be difficult because of the small differences, in particular <br>
different names for constants and lemmas and types of constants. Like you, I <br>
have tried to stay close to HOL/List for Coinductive, too. In fact, many <br>
definitions of yours and mine are equivalent. So I wondered whether there is any <br>
interest in combining the formalisations into one - and how that would be done.</p>

Dear Andreas,</p>
<blockquote>

one of the three versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why I've written the previous mail. I just wanted to point out <br>
the options provided (and not provided) in my version of infinite lists <br>
in the ListInf theory, and why I've made the infinite lists like this. <br>
What I wanted to do was embedding infinite lists into the already <br>
available frame of the finite list theory, in fact I didn't even <br>
introduce new data types for infinite lists but just operator <br>
definitions and/or abbreviations (especially: types 'a ilist = "nat =&gt; <br>
'a"); the only new data type was the one for generalized lists capable <br>
of taking both finite and infinite lists (datatype 'a glist = FL "'a <br>
list" | IL "'a ilist").</p>
<p>As far as I've understood from a first glimpse at your theory (so, <br>
please correct me where necessary) you went the way of defining the new <br>
data type llist suitable for both finite and infinite lists, and using <br>
conversion operators between "standard" finite lists and llist. <br>
Therefore, I see some (limited) similarity between llist and glist in my <br>
ListInf, as glist is the only new data type in ListInf and takes both <br>
finite and infinite lists; notably I have defined it first of all for <br>
the sake of completeness; in fact I used only the pure finite and <br>
infinite lists in my other theories (also in the unpublished ones). So <br>
if I get it right, you have established an elaborate framework for the <br>
llist data type with special attention to coinduction, while I have <br>
(intentionally) taken the way of making as few as possible new data type <br>
definitions and rather adding operations and/or lemmas for interpreting <br>
functions "nat =&gt; 'a" as infinite lists in a manner making there usage <br>
as similar as possible to finite lists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, both Coinductive and Infinite Lists contain additions to <br>
Nat_Infinity in HOL/Library (theories Coinductive_Nat and Util_NatInf, <br>
resp.). Interestingly, both of them instantiate the type class minus <br>
for inat in exactly same way. Alas, no Isabelle session can import <br>
both because that type classes can be instantiated only once. As <br>
Util_NatInf's setup for arithmetic is more elaborate than <br>
Coinductive_Nat's, I suggest to move this to Nat_Infinity in <br>
Isabelle's library. Is there anyone using Nat_Infinity with other type <br>
class instantiations, which would break then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be a pity if the instantiation of the type class minus would <br>
prevent using both theories simultaneously, because I see absolutely no <br>
reason why not employing both where useful. If the Isabelle developers <br>
team would opt for moving any of the theories from List-Infinite (be it <br>
concerning arithmetics, sets, or anything else) to the Isabelle Library, <br>
no matter whether partially, fully and/or adjusted, I certainly wouldn't <br>
mind.</p>

<p>It's great to see that people are working with infinite data <br>
structures.<br>
However, there are now three different formalisations of (possibly) <br>
infinite lists in the AFP: Lazy Lists II by Stefan Friedrich, <br>
Infinite Lists by David Trachtenherz and Coinductive by myself. At <br>
present, they are pairwise incompatible, and each of them has a <br>
different focus: Lazy Lists II focuses on lists over alphabets, <br>
Infinite Lists on infinite lists, and Coinductive on coinductive <br>
definitions and proofs.<br>
I think it would be great if there was just one theory similar to <br>
HOL/List that unified these three as far as possible such that <br>
future users do not have to pick one (or reinvent their own) and <br>
relinquish the other developments.</p>
<p>Moreover, both Coinductive and Infinite Lists contain additions to <br>
