A related issue: we have to encourage ourselves to factor out generic<br>
formalisations from applications, as Tobias pointed out.  From my<br>
perspective the four major obstacles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>little reputation in the strictly scientific sense;</li>
<li>no real user interface support for refactoring activities;</li>
<li>
<p>difficult to tinker with the bootstrap theories above Main.thy, even<br>
for developers (a typical candidate would be List.thy);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incoherence and duplication in existing theories themselves, which<br>
make it difficult to decide what "the" way for contributed things<br>
actually is.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But this leaves still room for contributions to HOL/Library or separate<br>
AFP articles.  It would be interesting to hear experiences and comments<br>
from users who have tried to factor out library theories from their<br>
applications -- successes and failures.</p>

Well, I did give it a high priority, but it is technically very difficult. <br>
In principle we already have sufficient infrastructure to control <br>
visibility, or limit all kinds of "declarations" (syntax, hints to proof <br>
tools) to a certain scope.  It is all part of the "local theory" <br>
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are still stuck halfway in localizing everything -- this <br>
refers to specification packages in the main library (datatype, <br>
nominal_datatype etc.).  Then the toplevel theory context can be treated <br>
as just another local theory target, and benefit from additional control <br>
over when and where declarations actually hit the user context.</p>
<p>I am in the middle of a major effort to work towards that again. <br>
Nonetheless, it will take several more rounds to get there eventually. <br>
Even worse, I recently see tendencies in user tools to forget about proper <br>
locality and go back to global operations on the bare metal of the raw <br>
theory context.</p>

There are already well-established concepts of long names, name bindings, <br>
naming context, name spaces, which are used everywhere except for the <br>
theory database.  So one merely needs to make theories conform to the <br>
established scheme, and somehow link up with the theory loader.</p>
<p>All of this is completely non-trivial.</p>

<p>I see that as a fairly orthogonal problem (not that it shouldn't be addressed at some point). The sessions really only govern what theories get loaded when. All actual dependencies and data are tracked on the theory level by Isabelle already anyway. I'd rate proper name spaces a much higher priority.</p>

<p>In terms of name space handling, I so far like the Haskell model best. This is something that can easily be discussed and tweaked, though (almost as hard as concrete syntax ;-))). The real problem will be down at the technical end as Makarius writes.</p>

<p>Above I have intentionally not used the word "article" but "theory" to<br>
emphasize that this is a small contribution (a single theory of modest<br>
size) - but a reusable one! I would like to use this opportunity to<br>
remind readers of this list of the purpose of the AFP:</p>
<p>"The Archive of Formal Proofs is a collection of proof libraries,<br>
examples, and larger scientific developments."</p>
<p>At the moment the majority of contributions are large (sometimes<br>
impressively so), monolithic developments. Very rarely are parts of such<br>
developments reused elsewhere. That is, the library aspect is<br>
underdeveloped. The above theory "List Index" used to be hidden in the<br>
article "Jinja is not Java" and I have (after 5 years!) finally gotten<br>
around to making it a separate contribution.</p>
<p>This is a call for reusable AFP entries. I am sure many of you have such<br>
theories hidden away in their drawers (or their AFP entries): Do take<br>
the time to polish and submit them to the AFP (or refactor some existing<br>
AFP article), for the benefit of the whole community (and your fame).</p>
<p>Don't think publication, think reuse!</p>

reused.</p>
<p>But you are quite right: Hackage offers some things worth emulating:</p>

Perhaps a useful model to emulate is Hackage.  For those who don't know, <br>
hackage is a website (similar to the AFP) for hosting haskell packages.  One thing that <br>
makes it so useful is the cabal utility --- somewhat like debian's apt tool --- which<br>
allows you to download a package and all its dependencies automatically.  This seems <br>
to encourage both reuse and participation.</p>
<p>Whether or not this would work for the Isabelle community is debatable --- the <br>
the haskell community is much larger.  Having said that, we might be able to co-opt <br>
some of the tech used in cabal and hackage ...</p>

If users want hierarchical module names, why don't we (the Isabelle<br>
developers) just implement that feature?</p>
<p>The implementation wouldn't involve much:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make the dot "." a legal character in module names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define a new mapping from module names to filepaths, so that<br>
"imports A.B.C" makes Isabelle load the file "~/A/B/C.thy", where "~"<br>
is filled in with some directory from the search path.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The hard part would be social, rather than technical: Deciding how to<br>
organize and populate the hierarchy. But we wouldn't have to switch<br>
over everything at once---we could flesh out the hierarchy gradually,<br>
with input from the user community, and move libraries to their new<br>
places in the namespace one at a time. I think this would work, and<br>
solving the problem of module name clashes would remove one big<br>
obstacle to sharing Isabelle libraries.</p>

<p>From: Brian Huffman &lt;<a href="mailto:brianh@cs.pdx.edu">brianh@cs.pdx.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Yes!</p>
<p>Besides the flat module namespace, I think that syntax clashes are the<br>
other big obstacle to sharing Isabelle libraries. I have experienced<br>
this problem from both sides.</p>
<p>As a user importing other Isabelle libraries, I have often been<br>
constrained in the choice of syntax to use for my own theories,<br>
because so many useful bits of syntax are already taken by something<br>
in Isabelle/HOL. For example, if I use "_ [_ / _]" as a notation for<br>
substitution in one of my own theories, this causes ambiguous parse<br>
warnings, due to clashes with the List library. This is especially<br>
annoying when my theory does not use lists at all!</p>
<p>As an implementer of Isabelle libraries, adding special syntax for<br>
constants is quite worrisome: What if the end-user of this library is<br>
already using the same syntax for something else? This is the reason<br>
why RealVector.thy doesn't define the standard "||x||" syntax for<br>
"norm x" (I tried adding it once, but it clashed with another<br>
library), and Library/Inner_Product.thy doesn't define an infix-dot<br>
notation for the inner product.</p>
<p>Of course, I can always define nice syntax to use within the library<br>
itself, and then use "no_syntax" at the end to avoid potential clashes<br>
with user theories. But some users might actually want to use my<br>
syntax! It seems silly to have the <em>library</em> decide for all users<br>
whether or not some bit of syntax will be visible to them. Obviously,<br>
