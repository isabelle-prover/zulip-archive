New Ph.D. Student Positions</p>
<p>ULTRA group (Useful Logics, Types, Rewriting, and their Automation)<br>
                          Computer Science Department<br>
                 School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences<br>
                            Heriot-Watt University<br>

<p>Description of the Positions</p>
<p>Changes since our announcement earlier this year: (1) Additional<br>
    positions have become available.  (2) Additional possible research<br>
    topics have been included.</p>
<p>Several new Ph.D. student positions are available in areas involving<br>
    research into the theories of logics, types, and rewriting and their<br>
    applications in reasoning about computer systems and mathematics.  The<br>
    positions are at Heriot-Watt University[1] in the ULTRA (Useful<br>
    Logics, Types, Rewriting, and their Automation) group[2] in the<br>
    Computer Science Department[3] in the School of Mathematical and<br>
    Computer Sciences[4] at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh[5], the<br>
    capital of Scotland[6].  The Ph.D. supervisors will be either Fairouz<br>
    Kamareddine[7] and/or Joe Wells[8].</p>
<p>Available research topics include work on any of the following:</p>
<p>* The Poly*[9] polymorphic retargetable type system for process and<br>
        mobility calculi, aimed at the goal of supporting modular reasoning<br>
        and compositional analysis for systems involving mobility and<br>
        concurrency (such systems can include combinations of hardware,<br>
        software, people, etc.).</p>
<p>* The MathLang[10] framework for computerizing mathematical text.<br>
        MathLang tries to keep the computerization as close as possible to<br>
        the mathematician's text while at the same time providing a formal<br>
        structure supporting mathematical software systems (e.g., computer<br>
        algebra systems, theorem provers, etc.).  Possible MathLang work<br>
        includes:</p>
<p>+ Building libraries of computerized books of mathematics.<br>
           + Developing bridges between MathLang and proof checkers (e.g.,<br>
             Coq, Mizar, Isabelle, OMEGA, etc.).</p>
<p>* The idea of Expansion[11] as a fundamental organizing principle for<br>
        obtaining flexible and compositional polymorphic type inference for<br>
        computer software.</p>
<p>* The use of Type Error Slicing[12] as a superior user interface for<br>
        explaining type errors to users of new programming languages with<br>
        advanced (and complicated!) type systems.</p>
<p>* Any other reasonable idea which builds on work we have already<br>
        started, including both theory and implementation.  In general, we<br>
        are interested in the design and implementation of useful and<br>
        elegant type systems and logics which can reason about or extend<br>
        existing programming languages and theorem provers.</p>
<p>It will be helpful to have interests (or possibly even competence) in 1<br>
    or more of the following background knowledge areas:</p>
<p>* Formal calculi for reasoning about the meaning of systems<br>
        (including computer programs) such as the lambda calculus, the pi<br>
        calculus, and the numerous other calculi they have inspired that<br>
        deal with aspects of concurrency, mobility, modules, components,<br>
        linking &amp; loading, resource usage, staged compilation, classes &amp;<br>
        objects, etc.</p>
<p>* Methods for analyzing specific systems (e.g., specific computer<br>
        programs) represented by individual terms of such formal calculi.</p>
<p>* Formal calculi for representing mathematical texts, including those<br>
        aspects related to how actual practicing mathematicians (i.e., not<br>
        mathematical logicians) construct and present mathematics.</p>
<p>* Type systems for the kinds of formal calculi mentioned above,<br>
        especially those with features similar to intersection, union,<br>
        dependent, and singleton types.</p>
<p>* Rewriting theories, especially those with higher-order features,<br>
        such as the lambda calculus, higher-order rewriting (HOR), systems<br>
        with explicit substitutions, higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS),<br>
        combinators, etc.</p>
<p>* Constraint solving and unification.<br>
      * Theorem provers and mathematical reasoning tools.<br>
      * Programming languages especially suitable for use for any of the<br>
        above.</p>
<p>The usual duration of Ph.D. studentships in the UK is 3 years.  The<br>
    positions are available immediately.</p>
<p>The Ph.D. students will probably collaborate on 1 or more of the<br>
    following activities.  The specific activities will be matched to their<br>
    strengths.</p>
<p>* Designing languages/calculi for representing various aspects of<br>
        such things as computer programs, concurrent systems, mathematical<br>
        texts, etc.</p>
<p>* Developing theories for reasoning about such a calculus as a whole<br>
        as well as individual terms written in the calculus.</p>
<p>* Developing new type systems for such calculi with useful<br>
        properties.</p>
<p>* Developing analysis algorithms for the new type systems.<br>
      * Proving various properties of the above items.<br>
      * Making software systems incorporating the new calculi, theories,<br>
        type systems, and algorithms.</p>
<p>* Publishing scientific reports on the work done.</p>

<p>Applying for the Positions</p>
<p>Please contact Fairouz Kamareddine and Joe Wells for full details on<br>
    how to apply.  We will want to see your curriculum vitae, as well as 2<br>
    (or even 3 if possible) recommendation letters (preferably written by<br>
    people familiar with your academic and research abilities, but a letter<br>
    from an industry source is better than no letter at all).  We will<br>
    expect recommendation letters to be sent directly by their authors and<br>
    will need contact details for the letter authors.  You should probably<br>
    already have a master's degree or equivalent experience.  It can be<br>
    helpful to write a brief statement about why your research interests<br>
    are a good match for the ULTRA group.  If you already have research<br>
    publications (this is not required), it can be helpful to send 1 (or<br>
    even 2) of them.  There will also be official Heriot-Watt application<br>
    forms to fill out.  Please convert Microsoft Word documents to a public,<br>
    standard, and non-proprietary format.  PDF is good, plain text is good,<br>
    LaTeX is okay (if using only standard packages), HTML is okay (if not<br>
    generated by Microsoft Word), PostScript is sometimes okay, Open<br>
    Document format is undesirable, Microsoft Word format will not be<br>
    accepted.</p>
<p>For your information, it is helpful if writers of recommendation<br>
    letters provide details of:</p>
<p>* the capacity in which they know the candidate,<br>
      * the candidate's skills, abilities and performance in relation to<br>
        the post applied for,</p>
<p>* the candidate's record including details of the candidate's role(s)<br>
        and service dates,</p>
<p>* their view of the candidate's suitability for the post as a whole,<br>
        in light of the attached details and their knowledge of the<br>
        candidate's experience and abilities,</p>
<p>* any further relevant information which would assist us in choosing<br>
        the right candidate.</p>
