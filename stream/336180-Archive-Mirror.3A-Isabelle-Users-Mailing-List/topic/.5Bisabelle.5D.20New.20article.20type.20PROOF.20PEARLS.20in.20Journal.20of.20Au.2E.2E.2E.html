<p>From: Tobias Nipkow &lt;<a href="mailto:nipkow@in.tum.de">nipkow@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Journal of Automated Reasoning is very happy to announce the new article <br>
type of</p>
<p><em>Proof Pearls</em>.</p>
<p>The goal of <em>Proof Pearls</em> is to disseminate insights gleaned from the <br>
growing body of machine-checked formalizations and proofs, obtained <br>
using both interactive and automated methods. Application areas include <br>
the full range from pure mathematics and logic to software and hardware <br>
verification. Proof pearls should be short communications that focus on <br>
a few central ideas rather than extended research reports. Contributions <br>
may include:</p>
<p>o a short, elegant proof of a self-standing result</p>
<p>o a novel way of defining a fundamental concept</p>
<p>o a notable approach to proving a key lemma in a larger development</p>
<p>o a snippet of verified code, carefully engineered to balance efficiency <br>
with ease of verification</p>
<p>o a clever or impressive application of automated tools in a particular <br>
domain</p>
<p><em>Proof Pearls</em> adapt Jon Bentley's notion of a "programming pearl" to <br>
the verification paradigm. Proof pearls should thus encapsulate <br>
fundamental insights that are adaptable and reusable, while being <br>
elegant and satisfying in their own right. Typical examples could be a <br>
verification of Huffman's algorithm, a perspicuous proof of the <br>
fundamental theorem of algebra, or a novel axiomatization of a <br>
particular algebraic system that was discovered using automated methods.</p>
<p>Submissions will undergo the usual refereeing process, and will be <br>
evaluated according to expository and theoretical merit. Systems and <br>
formalizations should be made available online.</p>
