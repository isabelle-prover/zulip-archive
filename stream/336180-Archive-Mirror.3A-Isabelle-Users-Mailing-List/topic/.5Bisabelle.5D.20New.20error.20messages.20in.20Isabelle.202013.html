Dear Isabelle Users,</p>
<p>Maybe it is just me, but I still get confused by the new error messages in<br>
Isabelle 2013. Of course, it is already<br>
a big improvement over simply "failed to finish proof" from Isabelle 2012.</p>
<p>For instance, the success of establishing a "have" or a "show" is usually<br>
show in the output window<br>
with a message like "have fact"  " show fact ... successful attempt to<br>
solve goal by exported rule"</p>
<p>Now, when there´s a failure, the error message is still prefixed in the<br>
output window by the<br>
very messages we get when we are successful, as mentioned above. Besides in<br>
the error case, the<br>
output window also show after the error message that there are no subgoals<br>
(?).</p>
<p>I attach two images to make my point clearer.<br>
In this particular example, if the error message was not prefixed by<br>
"Successful attempt ...", I think it would<br>
be much better.</p>
<p>Is my confusion justified?</p>
<p>Best!<br>

<p>There are several things being mixed up in the all-inclusive Output <br>

<p>This is great. I did not know that. I am probably being very naive here (to<br>
put it mildly), but what appears in the<br>
window that pops up when you hover over the red squiggles is what I would<br>
expect to appear<br>
in the output window as well (see image attached) .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with Alfio. When I write proofs, I usually do this<br>
incrementally. If, at some point, I type eg<br>
  have foo by auto<br>
and the proof method fails unexpectedly, I would like to immediately see<br>
why, without moving my arm from the keyboard to the mouse, hover the<br>
mouse over the text and wait for the popup.</p>
<p>Still, this feature is better than what we have in the 2012-version,<br>
where you had to go back to the "by" and change it to an apply, just in<br>
order to see the remaining subgoals in the output buffer.</p>

Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>I have sent this already in a message previous to this one. The question is<br>
simple:<br>
I (as many other Isabelle users, I suppose) depend very much on the output<br>
window to work with<br>
Isabelle even though I work essentially with Isar structured proofs. The<br>
hover-over-the-scribbles<br>
feature is nice, but the output window is better and faster.</p>
<p>The problem is that, in case of a problem in establishing a fact or a<br>
pending goal,<br>
the  output window is now displaying messages<br>
that show both success and failure (jedit-proof-failure) of applying a<br>
given proof method , and<br>
I think this should be avoided at all costs. If it is not possible in<br>
Isabelle 2013, then maybe in Isabelle<br>
2014. In the case of the error message, the output window should display<br>
only<br>
the message that appear in the image hover-error message, and not an<br>
ambiguous message as<br>
shown  in the jedit-proof-failure image. See attachments.</p>
<p>best!<br>

<p>I would hate to see the output panel ever go away for proof goals. If <br>
anything, I'd like to see information generated there when I click on a <br>

"abbreviation", and get any useful information that the prover engine is <br>

   declare[[names_unique=true]]   declare[[show_consts=true]]</p>

<p>There's a lot of visual information that automatically gets generated, <br>
like an error icon in the gutter on the right, or the vertical bar going <br>
purple on the left, and the squiggly lines of different colors, and all <br>
that is good.</p>
<p>However, I would say that windows popping up to notify me of something <br>
on a frequent basis is overall a bad thing. I say more below.</p>

<p>I wouldn't put the output panel in the category of being old-style. It's <br>
a left, right, or bottom dockable window that's part of a modern, GUI <br>
editor. Being able to look at both the edit buffer and the output panel <br>
at the same time at least gives it a dual focus ability.</p>
<p>It comes down to personal preference, but I put a lot of effort into <br>
getting my windows all set up. With jEdit, I use a three panel view: <br>
edit buffer, left panel, and bottom panel.</p>
<p>It all looks nice. The popup windows are sort of ugly.</p>
<p>And when a window pops up I wasn't expecting that tries to help me out, <br>
when I don't want any help, because I don't care about the error, I <br>
don't really like that, and I make sure I keep a proper perspective on <br>
how powerful the Isabelle software is.</p>
<p>If I hover over something to intentionally get the popup window, I like <br>
that, especially when it gives me useful information.</p>
<p>The popup windows are a good addition, but I also like to control where <br>
my main "information" windows are, which, with jEdit, is docking them in <br>
a fixed location I want them to be.</p>

<p>I have worked very hard to eliminate the need for these in most practical <br>
situations.  You don't need this information all the time, only when <br>
something is wrong.  Then you use CTRL-hover etc. to look what is there.</p>

<p>There is an option for "tooltip margin" to control the window width in a <br>
soft manner.  The location is determined by the location of the <br>
information in the source text.  This is a very important principle of the <br>
Prover IDE, and the direction where it is moving for several years <br>
already.</p>

<p>This sounds more like a variation of platform-specific focus handling. <br>
Error message popups only show up for red squiggles in the text.  Maybe <br>
you have the mouse pointer in the way, or maybe there is some Windows snag <br>
behind it (I am more used to Linux and Mac OS X snags in that respect).</p>

<p>See the option tooltip for what this is for.  Tooltip timing is determined <br>

<p>I have decided that this can be categorized under "floating vs. docked <br>
window preference".</p>
<p>Suppose the need was eliminated to display any of the proof step <br>
information in the output panel. I forsee in the future that someone <br>
would make a request like this: "Makarius, you know those different <br>
kinds of popup windows that give us information? Can you make it where <br>
we can choose for them to be either floating or dockable? You might have <br>
an options button which allows us to select or deselect error info, <br>
proof info, term info, etc. "</p>
<p>Here, I use the specific example of Sledgehammer and Nitpick. You have <br>
it now where we can get the output in two different places, the output <br>
panel or by hovering the mouse over the command.</p>
<p>But if I know I always want to see the output, and I want to see the <br>
output as the command is running, then what I want is a panel, docked or <br>
floating, that's specifically displayed for that purpose. I also want it <br>
fixed in size and location.</p>
<p>There's more info to be seen than can be displayed, so I like the jEdit <br>
plugin model. You can display or not display a window for a plugin. You <br>
can dock or not dock a window you display. You can dock a window in 4 <br>
different places. That's a lot of options on how to display information.</p>
<p>Old skool with improvements, along with completely new features is <br>
sometimes the best way to go. But that's easy for me to say, and I don't <br>

I am still confused about this confusion.  Taking the above specification <br>
in isolation, it is already what happens in Isabelle2013-RC2: you see the <br>
error "immediately" in the output of the by command, assuming that window <br>
is open in the old-fashioned manner; it also works Proof General.  If you <br>
don't have output open, then pointing at the red squiggles of "auto" gives <br>
the error more quickly.</p>
<p>If this does not work for you, it might be a remaining problem timing <br>
problem, platform-specific window update problem etc.</p>

It works better if you disable show_types and show_sorts by default. <br>
Isabelle2013 will then add the annotations to <em>all</em> possible positions as <br>
markup to the output, and you can hover over it to see what is there and <br>
what is wrong.  If show_types / show_sorts are enabled, you get the old <br>
behaviour of partial printing directly in the text.</p>
<p>The ambition in Isabelle2013 was to eliminate then need for show_types / <br>
show_sorts altogether -- I've got too many complaints about such options <br>
missing in the "menu".  Lets see how far it is now from 0.00001 relevance.</p>

<p>This sounds more like an aspect of the dockable window manager in jEdit. <br>
It is nice for what it does, but could be improved.  Unfortunetely, there <br>
are extremely few people now picking up the challenge to make real <br>

<p>It is merely a technical snag that the tooltip popups are not dynamically <br>

<p>Looking at the bigger picture, the command + output mode of Sledgehammer <br>
and Nitpick is just a historical accident.  The long-standing plan is to <br>
provide more direct support for "asynchronous agents" in the Prover IDE to <br>
produce feedback on the text as you write it.  Such an agent would have <br>
its own panel somewhere to control it, although the feedback is more <br>
likely to appear around the text itsel, like a spell-checker; or as some <br>
icons or bubbles indicating suggestions to the user.</p>

<p>Note that in jEdit "plugin" is just some Java module loaded in a certain <br>
way.  You probably mean "dockable window", the thing that is managed by <br>
the "dockable window manager".  The Isabelle plugin provides several <br>
dockable windows: Output, Symbols, Theories etc.</p>
<p>4 different places for docking are nice, but I can imagine much more <br>
sophistication.  Someone made an alternative dockable window manager for <br>
jEidt called "MyDoggy", but it now looks unmaintained and outdated.  One <br>
could invest more here, but I am certainy not doing it myself.</p>

I would like the output panel to remain, if at all possible. Having to click on something to see the current state is cumbersome, and if I understand your comment, it is only available for errors and not for inspection of an arbitrary intermediate proof state. But that's what I often want to do. Moreover, the pop-up windows are quite small and will typically need resizing.<br>

When you say "the editing focus" and "directly" it already has a strong <br>
bias towards the TTY model.  Isabelle/jEdit is moving more and more away <br>
from that, as far as it becomes feasible.  I am especially interested to <br>
see decent Isar proof editing facilities, without the TTY side-conditions.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the Output panel of Isabelle/jEdit will just <br>
disappear in the next release.  There are applications where you do need <br>
free-form output from commands.</p>
<p>There are important special cases though:</p>
<p>(1) proof development, especially structured proof development</p>
<p>(2) feedback from ATPs via sledgehammer etc.</p>
<p>Here I can imagine more direct user interface support than the old TTY <br>
loop.</p>

Did you try adjusting the various tooltip options in the Plugin Options / <br>
Isabelle panel of jEdit?  It is basically a menu, were you can see what is <br>
there, and look at the tooltips to guess what is the purpose.</p>

<p>The Isabelle/Isar proof state consists of more than just goals.  For <br>
example, you don't want to see the goal again after 'then', 'from', 'with' <br>
etc. because they don't change it.  You might want to have some editor <br>
support to rearrange such indications of 'using' facts.</p>

<p>"what goals does 'induction' give" ...).</p>

<p>That is in fact the standard example where you can see the limitations of <br>
the hybrid model from 2000, which is still used often today.  The "induct" <br>
proof method knows much more about the structure of the proof than just <br>
the new subgoals than happen to pop out after it.  It could propose a <br>
canonical proof outline for the induction pattern straight away, with <br>
placeholders for typical "by auto" proofs to finish the cases.  You don't <br>
need funny print_cases commands and its output for that, just a tiny <br>
little more progress in Prover IDE technology.</p>
<p>Another example where the state output is bad are calculation proofs in <br>
Isar.  This is a very simple and basic concept, but it becomes slightly <br>
awkward to manage with the step-by-step approach from the old times.</p>

<p>Just to repeat canonical Isabelle terminology: "old-fashioned" -&gt; "legacy" <br>
-&gt; "eliminated".  The present state of the output window (for goal states) <br>
is "old-fashioned", and there are still more situations than I would like <br>
to see, where it is actually needed.  It is unlikely to become legacy or <br>
eliminated in general, because some tools might always need to print <br>
things out of order.</p>

<p>Apply proof scripts are essential for proof exploration and also as <br>

<p>Back to the very start of this thread.  The "more informative error <br>
messages for Isar proof commands" from NEWS means that is now easier to <br>
write certain structured proofs without peeking at machine states all the <br>
time.  I did that in practice, when preparing the Isabelle/Isar course at <br>
Orleans last October.  It worked approx. 90% in these examples.  But the <br>
participants then had to do it in Isabelle2012 without this convenience of <br>
Isabelle2013.</p>

The Output panel gives you a full record of all messages emitted by some <br>
command transaction, essentially as a fall-back for the traditional model, <br>
to avoid surprises that some tools don't get their information through.</p>
<p>This also explains its redundancy for this "by" step that concludes a <br>
"show":</p>
<p>* "Succesful attempt ..."</p>
<p>* Succesful proof state after it</p>
<p>* Unsuccessful proof state from the forked proof</p>
<p>Attaching more messages to the place where they belong statically, not <br>
dynamically should clarify this further.</p>
<p>Mentally, it might help to understand "Output is machine state", and be <br>
tolerant for more internal tracing happening there than in the document <br>
model as visualized in the source.</p>
<p>It seems that in this situation the slight reforms of the Prover IDE were <br>
not going far enough, but such things cannot be changed in a rash manner.</p>

<p>Makarius, your argument is often ideological and not ergonomic. Whenever<br>
somebody mentions anything reminiscent of PG or TTY, it is bad per se for you<br>
and must be abondoned. Unfortunately, some of the points, like an editing focus<br>
and not just "legacy" but have to do something with our cognitive apparatus.<br>
When you are working hard on a particular goal, that is your mental focus, and<br>
you want zero distraction from it. (And you want a quick way to get back to it<br>
when you went somewhere else.)</p>
<p>Here are some distracting features of Isabelle jedit: When I type a proof, the<br>
buffer is constantly reprocessed which leads to a lot of flashing, with red<br>
signs coming on, which makes it harder to think about the problem. When I have<br>
mistyped a formula, it is given a pink background with grey frames around<br>
tokens(?). This makes the formula harder to read and correct (eg the red<br>
squiggle is harder to see). It is a bit like talking to somebody who keeps<br>
interrupting you in the middle of a sentence whenever you pause to breathe. What<br>
I do now is to shut that other person up with the help of one of the macros<br>
provided here <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community/Extending_Isabelle/jEdit">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community/Extending_Isabelle/jEdit</a><br>
until I am finished thinking and saying what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>Note that my argument is a cognitive one, not based on old vs new. Or, as the<br>
Mizar guys say: Experience, not only doctrine.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the Output panel of Isabelle/jEdit will just disappear<br>

It was David Aspinall and myself who made these things work many years <br>
ago, and we knew about the possibilities and technical side-conditions. <br>
It was a big thing back then, and definitely not bad.  But times are <br>
changing, and side-conditions what can be done.</p>
<p>The Isabelle/jEdit document model is not so exotic, it is just <br>
Isabelle/Isar transferred into what you see in many maintstream IDEs now, <br>
and none of them resembles Emacs or TTY-style proof checking.  E.g. see <br>
<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/</a></p>
<p>Isar proofs are not scripts.  Even in 1999 they were called documents <br>
already, despite Proof General having a "scripting" mode only.</p>
<p>When I started the Prover IDE project some years ago, I made clear from <br>
the beginning that it is not going to be a clone of Proof General, but an <br>
exploration of what can be done beyond the accidental side-conditions of a <br>
certain time.</p>
<p>I pointed out many times, that everyone who is strongly attached to Proof <br>
General is welcome to continue its maintenance.  I am even ready to give <br>
some tips what needs to be done, but nothing has happened since<br>
October 2011.</p>
<p>People who are getting uneasy about too many things changing, could get <br>
active and do some Proof General maintenance instead.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Makarius,</p>
<p>I put in "declare[[show_types=false]] declare[[show_sorts=false]]", and <br>
I didn't see anything extra, but I'll experiment with changing <br>
"show_types" back and forth and see what happens.</p>
<p>As far as features and ways of doing things, after I get worked up, I <br>
then remind myself that the ideas for all of this started many years <br>
ago, and it's not the result of ideas I have about it today. I then stop <br>
worrying/caring, and start trying to get some work done with however it <br>
works. Speaking of "many years ago", I also keep in mind the "engine <br>
work" that started over 40 years ago.</p>
<p>However, I make one last point, for the time being.</p>
<p>Trying to go with the new flow, I start CNTRL+hovering. However, this <br>
brings up the final point: the human brain can process a massive amount <br>
of information very fast sometimes.</p>
<p>So when I start hovering over the formula of a theorem, I get <br>
information about, I'd say, ten times slower than what I can process the <br>
information, and I don't think I'm exaggerating, and I don't think I'm <br>
outside the norm.</p>
<p>I have a formula that's four lines long, and it has about 15 items per <br>
line in it that can be hovered over. I start from left to right on a <br>
line, and I drag my mouse over the items, but nothing happens other than <br>
they turn grey, because the tooltip doesn't respond fast enough.</p>
<p>Well, if I'm going to drag my mouse over 45 items, then if I was writing <br>
the software, I would give myself the ability to hover over one item and <br>
get a massive amount of information about all of those 45 items, where <br>
many of those items are duplicates, though seeing what is a a <br>
duplication is not actually always quickly apparent.</p>
<p>I'm not writing the software, so, today, I care more about trying to use <br>
the software as it is to get something done.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
So lets take my favourite example:</p>
<p>term "x = x"</p>
<p>Here we ask the system to accept a given term formally, and produce formal <br>
output and markup.  The output is the tip of the iceberg that you see <br>
directly, the markup is what you explore by other means, such<br>
color schemes, formal tooltips etc.</p>
<p>Note that markup is both attached to the input you give and the output <br>
that the system produces, but not in a fully symmetric manner.</p>
<p>So the above will give you information about the type of variable x, which <br>
is 'a, and its sort, which is "type".  You can hover over the "type" to <br>
have the system explain to you that it is in fact class "HOL.type", and <br>
then you jump to its definition following the implicit hyperlink.</p>
<p>This means you can explore that recursively by hovering over formal input <br>
and output -- this is now mostly uniform in Isabelle2013.  This unfolds a <br>
massive tree of information, or rather a large forest, by walking a few <br>
steps into some of its paths.</p>
<p>Instead, if you say:</p>
<p>declare [[show_types, show_sorts]]<br>
   term "x = x"</p>
<p>the system will interpret this as insisting in the old way: partial <br>
annotations for some of the term positions.  There is no markup, so you <br>
can't explore the types, sorts.</p>
<p>Of course, there are endless possibilities to refine this further.  An <br>
obvious question is: What is a succinct "digest" (as output text) to give <br>
you a types / sorts environment for some formal output.  Old show_types / <br>
show_sorts are traditionally very crude here.  This is only a starting <br>
point for further reworking of these ancient mechanisms.  In particular, I <br>
hope to see certain improvements done for current sledgehammer isar_proofs <br>
output to be taken into account as well.</p>

<p>Thanks for the explanation. And we all know how much we love hyperlinks. <br>
This is definitely a "friendly IDE" feature you've added. It's good when <br>
information comes to me via hyperlinks, rather than me having to go to <br>
the information.</p>
<p>In case others might not have noticed yet, the hyperlinks are grey boxes <br>
with a line around them, rather than just grey boxes.</p>
<p>But the way it works is that some people don't forgo the old for the <br>
new, they keep the old and use the new also. But it may be the economics <br>
of IDEs, that the old has to be sacrificed for the new. And that's why <br>
there's a thriving software utility market. Microsoft gets rid of the <br>
taskbar and start button in Windows 8, and someone produces a utility to <br>
put it all back.</p>
