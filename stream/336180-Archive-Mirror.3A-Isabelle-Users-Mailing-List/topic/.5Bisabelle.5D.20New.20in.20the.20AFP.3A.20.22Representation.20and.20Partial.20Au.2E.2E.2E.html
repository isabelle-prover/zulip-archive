Representation and Partial Automation of the Principia Logico-Metaphysica in<br>
Isabelle/HOL </p>
<p>by Daniel Kirchner</p>
<p>We present an embedding of the second-order fragment of the Theory of Abstract<br>
Objects as described in Edward Zalta's upcoming work Principia<br>
Logico-Metaphysica (PLM) in the automated reasoning framework Isabelle/HOL.<br>
The Theory of Abstract Objects is a metaphysical theory that reifies property<br>
patterns, as they for example occur in the abstract reasoning of mathematics,<br>
as abstract objects and provides an axiomatic framework that allows to reason<br>
about these objects. It thereby serves as a fundamental metaphysical theory<br>
that can be used to axiomatize and describe a wide range of philosophical<br>
objects, such as Platonic forms or Leibniz' concepts, and has the ambition to<br>
function as a foundational theory of mathematics. The target theory of our<br>
embedding as described in chapters 7-9 of PLM employs a modal relational type<br>
theory as logical foundation for which a representation in functional type<br>
theory is known to be challenging.</p>
<p>Nevertheless we arrive at a functioning representation of the theory in the<br>
functional logic of Isabelle/HOL based on a semantical representation of an<br>
Aczel-model of the theory. Based on this representation we construct an<br>
implementation of the deductive system of PLM which allows to automatically<br>
and interactively find and verify theorems of PLM.</p>
<p>Our work thereby supports the concept of shallow semantical embeddings of<br>
logical systems in HOL as a universal tool for logical reasoning as promoted<br>
by Christoph Benzmüller.</p>
<p>The most notable result of the presented work is the discovery of a previously<br>
unknown paradox in the formulation of the Theory of Abstract Objects. The<br>
embedding of the theory in Isabelle/HOL played a vital part in this discovery.<br>
Furthermore it was possible to immediately offer several options to modify the<br>
theory to guarantee its consistency. Thereby our work could provide a<br>
significant contribution to the development of a proper grounding for object<br>
theory.</p>
