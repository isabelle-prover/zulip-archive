A Formal Development of a Polychronous Polytimed Coordination Language<br>
  by Hai Nguyen Van, Frédéric Boulanger and Burkhart Wolff</p>
<p>The design of complex systems involves different formalisms for modeling their<br>
different parts or aspects. The global model of a system may therefore consist<br>
of a coordination of concurrent sub-models that use different paradigms. We<br>
develop here a theory for a language used to specify the timed coordination of<br>
such heterogeneous subsystems by addressing the following issues:<br>
  • the behavior of the sub-systems is observed only at a series of discrete<br>
    instants,<br>
  • events may occur in different sub-systems at unrelated times, leading to<br>
    polychronous systems, which do not necessarily have a common base clock,<br>
  • coordination between subsystems involves causality, so the occurrence of an<br>
    event may enforce the occurrence of other events, possibly after a certain<br>
    duration has elapsed or an event has occurred a given number of times,<br>
  • the domain of time (discrete, rational, continuous...) may be different in<br>
    the subsystems, leading to polytimed systems,<br>
  • the time frames of different sub-systems may be related (for instance, time<br>
    in a GPS satellite and in a GPS receiver on Earth are related although they<br>
    are not the same).<br>
Firstly, a denotational semantics of the language is defined. Then, in order to<br>
be able to incrementally check the behavior of systems, an operational semantics<br>
is given, with proofs of progress, soundness and completeness with regard to the<br>
denotational semantics. These proofs are made according to a setup that can<br>
scale up when new operators are added to the language. In order for<br>
specifications to be composed in a clean way, the language should be invariant<br>
by stuttering (i.e., adding observation instants at which nothing happens). The<br>
proof of this invariance is also given.</p>
