I’m happy to announce yet another new AFP entry:</p>
<p>Closest Pair of Points Algorithms, by Martin Rau and Tobias Nipkow</p>
<p>This entry provides two related verified divide-and-conquer algorithms solving the fundamental Closest Pair of Points problem in Computational Geometry. Functional correctness and the optimal running time of O(n log n) are proved. Executable code is generated which is empirically competitive with handwritten reference implementations.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>sounds interesting, so I had a look how these things are done these<br>
days. But I guess I read more into the abstract than is there (which<br>
may be my fault). Is it correct that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the connection between the algorithm (e.g. <code>combine</code>) and the  <br>
   calculation of the running time (e.g. <code>t_combine</code>) is not <br>
   mechanically verified (and a skeptical reader would have to <br>
   carefully compare the two definitions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it shows that it is in O(n log n), but it does _not_ show <br>
   that this is indeed the optional running time for this task<br>
   (which “optimal running time proved” sounds a bit like).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't want to say that there is dishonesty in the abstract, but it’s<br>
just that I was mostly curious about how to do these two things :-)</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Joachim</p>

<p>Correct. We say so in an accompanying paper which is not online yet and of which <br>
this is the abstract. There we also refer to a monadic approach where the result <br>
and the running time are defined simultaneously and that we could have used to <br>
increasew confidence in our t_ functions:<br>

<p>We do not show that the running time is optimal and the grammar is clear: "the <br>
optimal running time is proved" is not the same as "that the running time is <br>
optimal is proved".</p>
