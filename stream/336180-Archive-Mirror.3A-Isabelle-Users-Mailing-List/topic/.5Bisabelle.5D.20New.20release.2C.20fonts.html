<p>From: "John F. Hughes" &lt;<a href="mailto:jfh@cs.brown.edu">jfh@cs.brown.edu</a>&gt;<br>
TL;DR: Never give a multiple-choice quiz where there's only one answer.</p>
<p>I partly agree with Peter and Eugene here (about the new fonts). I'm using<br>
a QHD-wide "27 inch" display, and the new fonts look blurry, and also look<br>
as if they're mostly bold; almost all text resembles the old bolded-keyword<br>
look. Just to be sure it wasn't merely the display, I looked at the same<br>
thing on my MacBook's 15" display --- same results.) The new bold keywords<br>
are even more bold, but appear blurrier to me (and my eyesight isn't that<br>
great -- for someone with clear vision, I'd expect this to be even more of<br>
a problem). By contrast, the old ones look crisp (esp. for the material<br>
within double-quotes). I far prefer them.</p>
<p>I did a screen grab of the two, side-by-side, and dropped it here:<br>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/3htvAfu">https://imgur.com/a/3htvAfu</a>; if you zoom in a bit and look at, for<br>
instance, 'a, you'll see that the quote mark is far more blurry; look at<br>
the "n" in "fun" and notice the blurry right-hand side. That certainly<br>
explains what I was seeing/feeling. I love me some antialiasing, but ...<br>
sometimes the results are unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Is this a drop-dead issue for me the way it is for Eugene? Probably not.<br>
But I think you should consider what Eugene and Peter say, not spend time<br>
explaining why the technology is the way it is. (FYA, see<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEP7aEyTOf0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEP7aEyTOf0</a>, 0:34 - 0:55).</p>
<div class="youtube-video message_inline_image"><a data-id="dEP7aEyTOf0" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEP7aEyTOf0"><img src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/5e34db9b7334254df011d3f13cdb59c671848320/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f64455037614579544f66302f64656661756c742e6a7067"></a></div><p>As for "old technology", if you go look for monitors on Amazon or similar<br>
places, you'll find that most high-end screens are about 100 DPI which, for<br>
displays at comparable distances, is really the relevant measure. My "27<br>
inch" display (23 inches wide) is 2560 pixels; the top-rated UHD display on<br>
Amazon is about 33 inches wide and 3340 pixels. (To be fair, also top-rated<br>
is a 25 inch display with 3340 pixels -- about 5/4 the DPI of my display.)<br>
So what Eugene is describing is hardly old-school in terms of actual size<br>
of pixels-at-the-cornea (assuming that like most folks I know, Eugene has<br>
the display about 24-30" inches away, and has had it that way through<br>
multiple generations of resolution-improvement).</p>
<p>The sidekick is an interesting case; I can't figure out how to make the<br>
font larger in I2018, so it's not a fair comparison, but with the default<br>
install of I2019 on my Mac, the wide-bold does lead to some serious<br>
ugliness. Look at the space between "<em>theory</em>" and "Seq": in the old<br>
sidekick, it's clearly a blank space. In the new one, it's much narrower<br>
and harder to recognize. It's also not clear why, among the main-text<br>
panel, the upper sidekick panel, and the lower sidekick panel, this one<br>
alone has a non-fixed-width font.</p>
<p>There's one place where I feel the new is a definite improvement on the<br>
old: opening and closing parentheses. You can see this in the comment in<br>
the first two lines. The old one looks threadbare, while the new appears<br>
more like a uniform-thickness stroke.</p>
<p>If your chosen font/renderer makes things appear ugly to folks, and they<br>
tell you so, then your pre-release testing is a <em>success</em>: you're getting<br>
useful feedback (which is a precious resource). As someone with a bit of<br>
experience in graphics and UIs, I'd advise you to not ignore or dismiss it<br>
<em>if</em> you care about the graphics and UI. Feel free, of course, to ignore<br>
me. I suspect that this is not your top concern in an otherwise very<br>
impressive project.</p>

The "your" cannot mean me, because I am neither responsible for the Java<br>
font-renderer nor for the DejaVu fonts.</p>
<p>I am merely responsible for selecting the best non-legacy technologies<br>
that I could find. If there are even better ones, I will pick them.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
These obersvations are explained in Isabelle2019-RC0/NEWS as follows:</p>
<p>"""</p>
<ul>
<li>The font collection "Isabelle DejaVu" is systematically derived from<br>
the existing "DejaVu" fonts ...<br>
The line metrics and overall rendering quality is closer to original DejaVu.<br>
"""</li>
</ul>
<p>The old Java renderer produced fonts that were too thin, with the<br>
notable exception for 18px. The new one is much better in that respect:<br>
even 12, 14, 16 etc. come out as intended by the DejaVu designers.</p>
