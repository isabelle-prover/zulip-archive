<p>Lars already mentioned the use of proof-blocks. But in this specific<br>
case it should also be possible to use</p>
<p>by (rule nn_integral_monotone_convergence_SUP_AE_incseq)</p>
<p>directly to prove the last have. "force" needs to find the instantiation<br>
for the theorem provided by using, which gets difficult for big<br>
terms ?f.</p>
<p>The proof block has one advantage: you can concentrate on the<br>
non-automatic part and hope that everything else works automatic.<br>
nn_integral_monotone_convergence_SUP_AE_incseq is a good example:<br>
usually 0 &lt;= f x and the measurability proof work automatic (the later<br>
hopefully when the measurability assumptions are annotated with<br>
[measurable]). Then you can write:</p>
<p>have "(∫⇧+ x. (SUP i. ?f i x) ∂M) = (SUP i. integral⇧N M (?f i))"<br>

<p>Yes, this is very unfortunate. In my experience for analysis simple<br>
inductive definitions are not enough (i.e. the rec_nat or rec_list etc<br>
mentioned by others). For more complicated constructions there are also<br>
the choice theorems: choice, dependent_nat_choice, or<br>
dependendent_wf_choice (for a well-founded definition).</p>

<p>From: Esseger &lt;<a href="mailto:esseger@free.fr">esseger@free.fr</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle users,</p>
<p>I played recently with Isabelle/HOL, to see if it was possible to <br>
formally prove a nice mathematical theorem I have recently established. <br>
My conclusion is that the system is excellent, since mathematicians with <br>
almost no computer science background can use it, but there are still <br>
too many missing mathematical bricks (which, hopefully, will be covered <br>
with time) for research mathematics. In any case, it was a lot of fun, <br>
and very interesting. I will certainly come back later to it, to add <br>
more results to what I have already proved.</p>
<p>Along the way, I stumbled across some difficulties. I solved them in a <br>
non-satisfactory way, so I wanted to ask if there are better practices:</p>
<p>1) In the middle of proofs, I often needed to prove statements of the <br>
form "!!n. P n", by induction, or by case analysis.<br>
I proved them as follows:</p>
<p>have "!!n. P n"<br>
proof -<br>
   fix n<br>
   show "P n"<br>
   proof (induction n)<br>
     ...<br>
   qed<br>
qed</p>
<p>This looks like too much boilerplate, and from the mathematical point of <br>
view it is definitely not the right thing to fix n before doing an <br>
induction (in which n is varying). So, is there a better way? Something like</p>
<p>have "!!n. P n"<br>
proof (?????, induction n)<br>
   ...<br>
qed</p>
<p>2) In the middle of proofs, once a lot of context was fixed, I needed to <br>
do inductive constructs. But I did not find how to define recursive <br>
functions in the middle of a proof, so I had to define a helper function <br>
outside of the body of the proof. This is not satisfactory since this <br>
helper function is completely useless (and impossible to understand) <br>
outside of the context of the proof, and should really not be in the <br>
global namespace.</p>
<p>So, is there a way to define recursive functions inside a proof?</p>
<p>3) In an Isar proof, is there a way to refer to previous statements in <br>
an OF clause? More specifically, consider</p>
<p>have *: "P" by auto<br>
have "Q" using foo[OF *] by auto</p>
<p>where P is some complicated statement. I would like to write this as</p>
<p>have "P" by auto<br>
then have "Q" using foo[OF this] by auto</p>
<p>But this fails. Is there a way to make it work, replacing "this" by <br>
something else?</p>
<p>Same thing with "moreover" statements: is it possible to write something <br>
like:</p>
<p>have "P1" by auto<br>
moreover have "P2" by auto<br>
moreover have "P3" by auto<br>
ultimately have "Q" using foo[OF this-1, OF this-2, OF this-3] by auto</p>
<p>Two additional comments:</p>
<p>4) "theorem", "lemma" and "corollary" are available, but it seems that <br>
most theories use "lemma" 99% of the time. Maybe adding "proposition" <br>
(and maybe "example") would help a little bit to have a bigger scale of <br>
statements, for more expressiveness.</p>
<p>5) When I knew that some statement foo would be helpful to prove a <br>
property P, I would write<br>
have "P" using foo<br>
and then call sledgehammer on it. Very often, I would get results of the <br>
form:<br>
proof reconstruction failed: "by (metis bar)"</p>
<p>Most of the time, "by (metis foo bar)" would do the job, so I guess the <br>
problem is an excessive minimization, assuming wrongly that "using foo <br>
by (metis bar)" is the same as "by (metis foo bar)"...</p>
<p>Any comment welcome!<br>
Esseger</p>

<p>From: Larry Paulson &lt;<a href="mailto:lp15@cam.ac.uk">lp15@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Quite a lot in your question! But to answer this bit, you can refer to the theorem P as <code>P</code>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I also vote for “proposition”. I gather that to a mathematician, a proposition is a routine but interesting result, while a lemma is a stepping-stone that is of no interest in its own right.</p>

<p>that is nice to hear! The community is always interested in use cases and<br>
feedback from non-computer-scientists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) In the middle of proofs, I often needed to prove statements of the<br>
form "!!n. P n", by induction, or by case analysis.<br>

<p>Try this instead:</p>
<p>{<br>
    fix n<br>
    show "P n"<br>
      proof (induction n)<br>
        ...<br>
      qed<br>
  }</p>
<p>The effect will be the roughly same: You will have proven the predicate<br>
"P" for all arguments. As a general rule of thumb: Avoid the "!!"<br>
quantifier on the right-hand side of an implication.</p>
<p>(The formal description of these "proof blocks" is in Sec 6.1.2 of<br>
&lt;<a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2015/doc/isar-ref.pdf">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2015/doc/isar-ref.pdf</a>&gt;.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think your intuition about what the phrase "fix a variable" means in<br>
Isabelle is not accurate. In this example, you merely introduce a variable<br>
into the scope, so that the system knows about it. You could also leave<br>
the "fix n" off, which will make Isabelle/jEdit render the variable<br>
distinctly to alert you that you're using something unknown.</p>

<p>So, is there a way to define recursive functions inside a proof?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, but there's a different solution. You can write it like this:</p>
<p>context begin</p>
<p>private fun helper where ...</p>
<p>lemma bla<br>
    ... use helper ...</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>After the end of the context block, the "helper" function is inaccessible.<br>
See also Sec 5.2 of the aforementioned manual.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.<br>

<p>Thanks a lot for the feedback! May I ask what you used as learning<br>

<p>If you want to build on some missing result, which you do want to<br>
formalize, it is sometimes an option to just assume the result (using a<br>
locale).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you cannot use primrec or fun inside a proof. If you want<br>
primitive recursion on datatypes, you can use the recursion function<br>
defined by the datatype package. E.g., for a list datatype defined as</p>
<p>datatype 'a mylist = My_Nil | My_Cons 'a "'a mylist"</p>
<p>you could use</p>
<p>def mylen == "rec_mylist 0 (λx' xs' rec. rec + 1)"</p>
<p>to define a recursive length function inside a proof. There is also the<br>
whileOption combinator (from ~~/src/HOL/Library/While_Combinator).</p>

<p>In most cases, I would use the \&lt;open&gt;P\&lt;close&gt; syntax suggested by<br>

<p>have "P" by auto<br>
with foo[OF this] have "Q" by auto</p>
<p>(keep in mind that "then" abbreviates "from this" and "with ..."<br>
abbreviates "from ... this".</p>

<p>I don't know a nice syntax for this. For me this is not an<br>
often-occurring situation, so I wonder if writing the proof differently<br>
would help. Do you have an example?</p>
<p>Note that many proof tools work better if lemmas are used in a more<br>

<p>Indeed, there are some subtle differences between these two statements,<br>

As other people have already said here: no. You can, however, define a<br>
recursive function within a locale that has the same fixes as the place<br>
in your proof where you want to define the function and the assumes the<br>
relevant facts. You can then just interpret that locale in your proof.</p>

<p>"Programming and Proving in Isabelle/HOL" was invaluable to start. The <br>
tutorial on locales was also very useful.<br>
 On the other hand, the <br>
Isabelle/Isar Reference Manual was essentially of no use to me (too many <br>
informations, probably). But I mostly understood things by looking at <br>
code in the HOL library, and HOL-Multivariate_Analysis.</p>

<p>I would say the main problem is precisely to formalize the results (say, <br>
a little bit of functional analysis and spectral theory...)</p>

<p>have "P" by auto<br>
then have "Q" using foo[OF this] by auto</p>
<p>But this fails. Is there a way to make it work, replacing "this" by<br>
something else?</p>

<p>In most cases, I would use the \&lt;open&gt;P\&lt;close&gt; syntax suggested by<br>
Larry. "this" is only bound before the have, you could write</p>
<p>have "P" by auto<br>
with foo[OF this] have "Q" by auto</p>
</blockquote>
<p>nice, thanks. The problem with <code>P</code> is when P is really complicated. Then <br>
it is more efficient to give a name to "P", say:<br>
have i: "P"<br>
have "Q" using foo[OF i] by auto</p>
<p>But I don't like giving names to equations if it is not necessary, as <br>
more notations are always a burden on the reader.</p>

<p>Same thing with "moreover" statements: is it possible to write something<br>

ultimately have "Q" using foo[OF this-1, OF this-2, OF this-3] by auto</p>

<p>I don't know a nice syntax for this. For me this is not an<br>
often-occurring situation, so I wonder if writing the proof differently<br>
would help. Do you have an example?</p>

<p>Take for instance the following lemma (from <br>
Probability/Nonnegative_Lebesgue_Integration.thy):</p>
<p>lemma nn_integral_monotone_convergence_SUP_AE_incseq:<br>
   assumes f: "incseq f" "⋀i. AE x in M. 0 ≤ f i x" and borel: "⋀i. f i <br>
∈ borel_measurable M"<br>
   shows "(∫⇧+ x. (SUP i. f i x) ∂M) = (SUP i. integral⇧N M (f i))"</p>
<p>To use this lemma, you typically need to check his three assumptions, <br>
and all of them are nontrivial. If ?f is some complicated expression to <br>
which I want to apply the above lemma, I will typically do:</p>
<p>have i: "incseq ?f" by ...<br>
have ii: "⋀i. AE x in M. 0 ≤ ?f i x" by ...<br>
have iii: "⋀i. ?f i ∈ borel_measurable M" by ...<br>
have "(∫⇧+ x. (SUP i. ?f i x) ∂M) = (SUP i. integral⇧N M (?f i))" by <br>
(rule nn_integral_monotone_convergence_SUP_AE_incseq[OF i, OF ii, OF iii])</p>
<p>I don't really like this syntax because I have to give names to <br>
equations (more notations are always more confusing), and because it <br>
does not illustrate directly that the last statement is deduced from the <br>
previous ones.</p>
<p>If ?f is simple enough, it suffices to do</p>
<p>have "incseq ?f" by ...<br>
moreover have "⋀i. AE x in M. 0 ≤ ?f i x" by ...<br>
moreover have "⋀i. ?f i ∈ borel_measurable M" by ...<br>
ultimately have "(∫⇧+ x. (SUP i. ?f i x) ∂M) = (SUP i. integral⇧N M (?f <br>
i))" using nn_integral_monotone_convergence_SUP_AE_incseq by force</p>
<p>which has no need for additional notations, and in which the flow of <br>
ideas is clear. Unfortunately, when ?f starts being complicated, force <br>
does not succeed.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Esseger</p>

<p>From: Lars Hupel &lt;<a href="mailto:hupel@in.tum.de">hupel@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
In these cases I usually employ a subproof:</p>
<p>have "(∫⇧+ x. (SUP i. ?f i x) ∂M) = (SUP i. integral⇧N M (?f i))"<br>
  proof (rule nn_integral_monotone_convergence_SUP_AE_incseq)<br>
    show "incseq ?f" by ...<br>
  next<br>
    ...<br>
  qed</p>
<p>However, this is largely a matter of taste.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>

A lot is missing, for sure. More complex analysis is on the way for the next release, along with the Stone-Weierstraß theorem, etc. Contributions definitely welcome!</p>
