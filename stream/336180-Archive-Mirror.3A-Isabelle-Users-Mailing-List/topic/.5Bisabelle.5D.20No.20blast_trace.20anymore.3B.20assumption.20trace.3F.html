<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>It was using "declare[[blast_trace=false]]" and <br>
"declare[[blast_stats=false]]" with Isabelle2013 that showed me that <br>
auto sometimes calls blast, but those traces cause an error now. Did <br>
anything replace them?</p>
<p>I use that as an excuse to point out that these traces can help educate <br>
a man, and I ask here if there's some kind of trace that will give me <br>
some details about what the "assumption" method is doing.</p>
<p>I give here two proofs of the same statement:</p>
<p>(<em>1</em>)<br>
theorem "(P ==&gt; (Q ==&gt; ((P ==&gt; (Q ==&gt; (!!(P::prop). PROP P))) ==&gt; <br>
(!!(P::prop). PROP P))))"<br>
   by(assumption)<br>
(<em>2</em>)<br>
theorem "(P ==&gt; (Q ==&gt; ((P ==&gt; (Q ==&gt; (!!(P::prop). PROP P))) ==&gt; <br>
(!!(P::prop). PROP P))))"<br>
   apply(simp del: True_implies_equals)<br>
   by(simp only: True_implies_equals)<br>
   (* lemma True_implies_equals: "(True ==&gt; PROP P) == PROP P"  *)</p>
<p>The formula "(P ==&gt; (Q ==&gt; (!!(P::prop). PROP P))) ==&gt; (!!(P::prop). <br>
PROP P)))" is a conjunction, and I'm having to work hard to try and <br>
prevent the automatic proof methods from proving things using too much HOL.</p>
<p>The proof for (<em>2</em>) is undesirable, but the proof for (<em>1</em>) seems okay <br>
because it doesn't look like it's resorting to any HOL other than some <br>
Trueprop coercion.</p>
<p>However, I don't know the details of what's happening, so I could be wrong.</p>
<p>What I'm guessing is something like this:</p>
<p>There's 3 assumptions: P, Q, and "(P ==&gt; (Q ==&gt; (!!(P::prop). PROP <br>
P)))". The assumption method starts by using P and Q to reduce the third <br>
assumption to "(!!(P::prop). PROP P))", which can then be used as an <br>
assumption for the final conclusion.</p>
<p>If I had a trace to tell me what the assumption method is doing, I might <br>
could stare at it a long time, and figure out what "assumption" is <br>
doing, and also do that with future problems.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

I'll state the obvious again, but the more traces the better, though <br>
there's already a lot of tools to give feedback.</p>
<p>blast_trace looked like it was going to be useful to me. It's main use <br>
was that it was telling me when auto was resorting to something more <br>
than simplification, but I would try some to understand the details it <br>
was returning.</p>
<p>I've searched in NEWS and in isar-ref.pdf, but I didn't find anything <br>
about what would replace blast_trace.</p>
<p>Doing these simple exercises can help make obvious simple things that <br>
aren't obvious at first, and it's the feedback tools that help out. <br>
Talking to myself is fine when I have tools to eventually lead me to the <br>
answers.</p>
<p>In the proof of (<em>2</em>) that I gave, the simp trace was doing some <br>
substitution of "True", and that contributed to my impression that my <br>
false, "(!!(P::prop). PROP P)" was actually important. But then when I <br>
used "assumption", it eventually became clear that I was simply doing:</p>
<p>theorem "(P ==&gt; (Q ==&gt; ((P ==&gt; (Q ==&gt; R)) ==&gt; R)))"</p>
<p>Modus ponens came to mind, and "Auto solve_direct", for the unexpanded <br>
formula, says "meta_impE" can be used, which is based on "meta_mp", but <br>
not quite the same, because of "meta_impE = meta_mp [elim_format]".</p>
<p>All that to say, one thing leads to another, and all the different <br>
routes can lead to a better understanding. I could assume I know what <br>
"assumption" is doing, but assuming I know the details when I don't, <br>
even with something simple, leads to being wrong a significant number of <br>
times.</p>
<p>I guess it's not a big deal, but the more access we have to the <br>
low-level details, to try and understand them and verify what we think <br>
is happening, the better. As I said, there's already a lot of feedback.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

These options are a leftover when Larry implemented the tool, and were not <br>
meant for end-user consumption, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>In Isabelle2013-1-RC2 you can refer to them nonetheless, using regular ML <br>
operations for configuration options:</p>
<p>setup "Config.put_global Blast.trace true"</p>
<p>That is a rather indirect way to see when blast happens to be invoked by <br>
other proof tools.  Generally, producing a meaningful trace is very <br>
difficult for anything non-trivial.</p>
