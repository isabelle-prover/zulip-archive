Hi,</p>
<p>I have a small feature request: I have a large list of theorems that I'm giving to blast. To simplify blast's search space, I want to fix all of the variables in my theorem list. However, some of the theorems contain only a proper subset of the variables I'm fixing. This causes Isabelle to report a "no such variable" error, even though all of the variables I'm fixing occur in at least one of the theorems.</p>
<p>Below is a simplified example of the error I'm hitting:</p>
<p>theory NoSuchVar</p>
<p>imports Main</p>
<p>begin</p>
<p>lemma L1: "x = x" by auto</p>
<p>lemma L2: "y = y" by auto</p>
<p>lemmas both = L1 L2</p>
<p>thm both[where x=x and y=y] -- {* reports "no such variable" error *}</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Could this behavior be changed such that the error is reported only when a variable occurs in none of the theorems?</p>
<p>I'm using Isabelle2011-1.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>Unfortunately not.  The fact notation with attribute application is <br>

its argument.  This was done consciously many years ago to keep things as <br>
simple as possible (which was only partly successful, because attributes <br>

<p>Note that no_vars is a bit odd in introducing locally fixed variables, <br>
without propagating the extended context.  This results in undeclared <br>
frees occurring in the resulting theorem.  The Prover IDE (even Proof <br>
General) prints those with a warning color markup, but the main use of <br>
no_vars is for LaTeX documents.</p>
<p>You can easily make your own attribute along the same lines.  But I can't <br>
say on the spot what happens when you do propagate the extended context <br>
with the new fixes declared.  In all these years the question was left <br>
open if attributes are allowed to change the "axiomatic basis" <br>
(fixes/assumes) of the context; some advanced locale interpretation stuff <br>
might fail if that is done.</p>

Ah, I'd forgotten about no_vars. Thanks.</p>
