Hi Andreas,</p>

<p>exhaustive in the sense that the number of discriminators must be<br>
<em>equal</em> to the number of constructors (in the sense of the code generator).</p>

<p>True.  The implementation however is not so general since in my mind I<br>
could never imagine a user case which would make it necessary to provide<br>
anything beyond the internal foundational case certificates as a kind of<br>
protocol between the datatype package and the code generator.  This is<br>
the reason why there is no full-blown user interface for case<br>
certificates (yet).  Indeed two years ago I was thinking about that but<br>
put it aside since it did not seem worth the effort.</p>
<p>The best documentation for case certificates available is indeed if you<br>
follow the implementation of Code.add_case.</p>
<p>What is your application?  Does it go beyond pure esthetic concerns?  I<br>
would be relucant to touch the trusted code base of code.ML if there is<br>
not a striking reason (neglecting questions of effort estimation at the<br>
moment).</p>

<p>Note that I do not ask about a full-blown user interface for case certificates. <br>
I just plan to generate and register them on the ML level. All I need is that <br>
the case operator is allowed to take extra variables that do not appear in any <br>
conclusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does it go beyond pure esthetic concerns?<br>
In principle, case certificates are <em>always</em> esthetic because they do not <br>
enhance the expressivity of the code generator. One could always replace any <br>
case expression by a definition of a specialised constant via pattern matching <br>
and then hope that the ML or Haskell compiler inlines the artificial function as <br>
a case expression again. Nevertheless, they do exist in their present form, <br>
because it is much nicer to use case expressions in code equations than to <br>
define a separate constant for each occurrence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is your application?<br>
I am currently working on the problem that you cannot use different <br>
implementations for 'a set or ('a, 'b) mapping in a single application without <br>
getting into trouble with sort constraints. To get an extensible solution to <br>
that, I define extensible enumerations, i.e., something like</p>
</blockquote>
<p>datatype enum = A | B | C</p>
<p>but with the possibility to add further constructors to enum later on. With <br>
this, one of course loses exhaustiveness theorems, but it seems to work for my <br>
application. Nevertheless, I would like to do case distinctions on enum in code <br>
equations using a case expression like</p>
<p>my_fun q = (case ... of A =&gt; ... | B =&gt; ... | C =&gt; ... | other =&gt; my_fun q)</p>
<p>where the new case "other" represents all constructors that have not yet been <br>
been added to enum. Due to reflexivity of =, this equation is provable if the <br>
cases for the existing constructors A, B, and C are provable. Now, I would like <br>
the generated code to be something like</p>
<p>fun my_fun q = (case ... of A =&gt; ... | B =&gt; ... | C =&gt; ...)</p>
<p>and not</p>
<p>fun enum_case a _ _ _ A = a<br>
   | enum_case _ b _ _ B = b<br>
   | enum_case _ _ c _ C = c</p>
<p>fun my_fun q = enum_case ... ... ... (my_fun q) ...</p>
<p>because that would loop and evaluate all cases before deciding.</p>

<p>OK, convinced.</p>
<p>Indeed, when looking at the code in code.ML (functions case_certificate<br>
and add_cert), it does not seem so difficult to extend it in a manner<br>
that arguments to a case combinator can be ignored.  However it would<br>
require some generalization which I personally do not have resources<br>
now.  Maybe you would like to give it a try?  The first step would be to<br>
extend code.ML accordingly and then look what consequences this has for<br>
the derived modules in src/Tools/Code.</p>

<p>Not wholly.  It is also a matter of evaluation order.  This is the<br>
reason why e.g. NBE generated explicit cases.</p>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu">andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>suppose I have a type with a number of constructors, but only some of them are <br>
meant to be used for code generation. For example:</p>
<p>datatype foo = A | B | C | D<br>
definition test<br>
   where "test x = 4 + (case x of A =&gt; 0 | B =&gt; 1 | C =&gt; 2 | D =&gt; 3)"</p>
<p>In the exported code for test, the case expression is translated into a case <br>
expression of the target language. In particular, it does not use foo_case.<br>
However, when I restrict foo to some subset of constructors, say</p>
<p>code_datatype A B C</p>
<p>then export_code on test generates the error message</p>
<p>*** "Test.foo.D" is not a constructor, on left hand side of equation:<br>
*** case D of A =&gt; ?f1.0 | B =&gt; ?f2.0 | C =&gt; ?f3.0 | D =&gt; ?f4.0 == ?f4.0<br>
*** At command "export_code"</p>
<p>This error message seems to stem from the case certificate that the datatype <br>
declaration registered in the code generator. I'd like to replace that after the <br>
code_datatype declaration with something like</p>
<p>lemma new_foo_case_cert:<br>
   assumes "CASE == foo_case a b c d"<br>
   shows "(CASE A == a) &amp;&amp;&amp; (CASE B == b) &amp;&amp;&amp; (CASE C == c)"<br>
using assms by auto<br>
setup {*<br>
   Code.add_case @{thm new_foo_case_cert}<br>
*}</p>
<p>This version raises the exception option, other variations yield "bad case <br>
certificate". How do I need to phrase the case certificate such that the code <br>
generator accepts it?</p>
<p>If this is impossible, I'd like to know why. If it is just a matter of adapting <br>
the code generator implementation, I'd be happy to assist in implementing this.</p>
<p>Andreas</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with the case certificate, but stems from the <br>
code equations for »foo_case«.  The case certificate should be thrown <br>
away on »code_datatype«, so code generation falls back on the <br>
corresponding code equations.</p>
<p>So do something like:</p>
<p>lemma [code, code del]:<br>
   "foo_case = foo_case" ..</p>
<p>lemma [code]:<br>
   "foo_case … = …"<br>
   "foo_case … = …"<br>
   "foo_case … = …"<br>
   …<br>
   "foo_case … = …"</p>
<p>If you still want proper case expressions, add a case certificate manually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma new_foo_case_cert:<br>
assumes "CASE == foo_case a b c d"<br>
shows "(CASE A == a) &amp;&amp;&amp; (CASE B == b) &amp;&amp;&amp; (CASE C == c)"<br>
using assms by auto<br>
setup {*<br>
Code.add_case @{thm new_foo_case_cert}<br>
*}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is suspicicious is that »d« never occurs in the conclusion.  I <br>
guess they should read »a d« etc.</p>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu">andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Florian,</p>
<p>thanks for the clarifiction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you still want proper case expressions, add a case certificate manually.<br>
Yes, I do want them, because otherwise ML evaluates all parameters too foo_case, <br>
which might raise an exception. And I do not want to add closures everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Case certificates must always be exhaustive!<br>
Exhaustive with respect to what? The lemma below is exhaustive with respect to <br>
the code generator setup -- there are three code_datatype constructors and there <br>
is one conclusion for each). I do not see why code certificates need to be <br>
exhaustive with respect to the logic other than restrictions in the code <br>
generator implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma new_foo_case_cert:<br>
assumes "CASE == foo_case a b c d"<br>
shows "(CASE A == a) &amp;&amp;&amp; (CASE B == b) &amp;&amp;&amp; (CASE C == c)"<br>
using assms by auto<br>
setup {*<br>
Code.add_case @{thm new_foo_case_cert}<br>
*}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is suspicicious is that »d« never occurs in the conclusion. I guess they<br>
should read »a d« etc.<br>
I do not fully understand your remark, but let me explain in a bit more detail:<br>
foo_case is not changed by the code_datatype command. Logically, type foo still <br>
has 4 constructors, so the case combinator needs to have 4 parameters for the <br>
cases, which are a, b, c, and d in the above lemma. However, the code generator <br>
only knows about three constructors A, B, and C. As soon as I try to prove a <br>
case certificate with 4 conclusions, I get a "bad case certificate" error. For <br>
example:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>lemma new_foo_case_cert:<br>
   assumes "CASE == foo_case a b c d"<br>
   shows "(CASE A == a) &amp;&amp;&amp; (CASE B == b) &amp;&amp;&amp; (CASE C == c) &amp;&amp;&amp; (CASE D = d)"<br>
   using assms by auto<br>
setup {* Code.add_case @{thm new_foo_case_cert} *}</p>
<p>I also tried the following version without success:</p>
<p>lemma new_foo_case_cert:<br>
   assumes "CASE == foo_case a b c"<br>
   shows "(CASE d A == a) &amp;&amp;&amp; (CASE d B == b) &amp;&amp;&amp; (CASE d C == c)"</p>
<p>So what is the right form of the certificate?</p>
<p>Note that I cannot define a specialised case combinator such as</p>
<p>foo_case' a b c = foo_case a b c 3</p>
<p>and use the symmetric equation as code_unfold, because other constants might <br>
need different specialised case combinators and the code generator supports only <br>
one.</p>
<p>Andreas</p>
