<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
This is one for our datatype experts:</p>
<p>I just noticed that theorems like</p>
<p>Cons x xs ≠ xs</p>
<p>are not automatically provided by the datatype package although they<br>
should clearly hold for any datatype. To be more precise, I am talking<br>
about theorems of the form</p>
<p>C x1 … xn ≠ x1<br>
…<br>
C x1 … xn ≠ xn</p>
<p>for any n-ary datatype constructor C (and of course also the flipped<br>
variant).</p>
<p>I'm not sure how useful something like this is in practice and it's<br>
fairly easy to prove these by hand when needed. I just ran into a<br>
situation where I had an assumption of the form "C a b ≠ b" and was<br>
surprised that the simplifier didn't take care of it automatically.</p>
<p>I realise that the datatype package already provides an absurd number of<br>
theorems and one should be careful to blow it up even more, but seeing<br>
as the number of theorems to be generated is linear in the number of<br>
constructors and they're probably very easy to prove, one could consider<br>
it. Or perhaps at least as an optional plugin or standalone tool.</p>

I do think such rules are useful, esp if they are there by default. I suggest  <br>
they are best handled by a simproc that is triggered by any "(=)" but that  <br>
checks immediately if the two argumenst are of the appropriate type and form.  <br>
That can be done very quickly (there are similar simprocs already). The simproc  <br>
should work for any datatype and any degree of nesting of the constructors.</p>

That sounds like a good idea.</p>
<p>However, if such a simproc is to work for any nesting of<br>
constructors,having pre-proven theorems for every constructor will not<br>
be enough.Instead, I suppose one would have to introduce a<br>
"proper-subexpression"relation for datatypes (e.g. xs &lt; Cons x xs) along<br>
with a proof thatthis relation has the obvious properties (irreflexive,<br>
asymmetric,transitive).</p>
<p>I guess that is something that only a datatype package plugin similar<br>
tothe one for the "size" function could provide. Having looked at the<br>
codebriefly, I think only the people who wrote the BNF package could (or<br>
atleast should) implement that.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one could just use the size function (as someone<br>
alreadysuggested in this thread) to get pretty much the same thing,<br>
except thatit won't work for all datatypes (e.g. infinitely branching ones).</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Unfortunately, the simproc breaks a few things in the AFP.</p>
<p>One of them is the proof of viewL_correct in Finger-Trees.FingerTree,<br>
where a call to "auto" loops (it also loops when changing it to "simp").</p>
<p>It's not an implementation problem of my simproc either. When I disable<br>
the simproc and add the theorems</p>
<p>"Node3 a b c d ≠ b" "Node3 a b c d ≠ c" "Node3 a b c d ≠ d"</p>
<p>to the simpset instead, it also loops.</p>
<p>These rules look perfectly harmless to me, so my suspicion would be that<br>
the simpset in this theory was fragile all this time and these new rules<br>
simply exposed that. However, I couldn't find any problematic-looking<br>
simp rules either, so perhaps it's some premise that the simplifier adds<br>
to the simpset itself.</p>
<p>After inspecting the trace, it seems that the simplifier tries to apply<br>
the following rule over and over again:</p>
<p>[1]Adding rewrite rule "??.unknown":<br>
nodeToList nd2 = [] ∧ nodeToList nd3 = [] ⟹<br>
False ⟹<br>
undefined = n_unwrap nd1 ⟹<br>
is_leveln_node 0 nd1 ⟹ is_measured_node nd1 ⟹ nodeToList nd1 ≡ [undefined]</p>
<p>(plus a few other variants of this with other permutations of nd1, nd2,<br>
nd3, so I guess it loops when trying to rewrite the first premise)</p>
<p>I find this a bit odd. Why does the simplifier add something that has<br>
"False" in its premises to the simpset in the first place? Shouldn't<br>
this entire thing get rewritten to "True" and discarded before that happens?</p>

Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>while your code works for the examples you show, it does not seem to handle nested recursion. See code below, with your simproc enabled. Also I would register it only for types that belong to the size class, i.e.,</p>
<p>simproc_setup datatype_no_proper_subterm ("(x :: 'a :: size) = y") = ‹K datatype_no_proper_subterm_simproc›</p>
<p>Your retrieval of mutual types looks reasonable to me. As usual with Isabelle/ML, the most reliable documentation is the code.</p>
<p>I am sympathetic to the proposal of having a 'proper subexpression' ordering defined for all datatypes (e.g., via a plugin similarly to size). Its usefulness goes beyond the acyclicity rules which this thread is about. In particular, the 'proper subexpression' ordering can be used for 'strong induction' or to prove termination of functions in cases when size does not exists. (Provided that we also have the fact that this ordering is wellfounded proved.) Something along the following lines:</p>
<p>class subexp =<br>
  fixes subexp :: "'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ bool" (infixl "⊏" 65)<br>
  assumes wf: "wfP subexp"</p>
<p>declare [[typedef_overloaded]]</p>
<p>bnf_axiomatization 'a F [wits: "'a F"]</p>
<p>datatype x = Ctor "x F"</p>
<p>instantiation x :: subexp begin</p>
<p>definition subexp_x :: "x ⇒ x ⇒ bool" where<br>
  "subexp_x = tranclp (λx y. case y of Ctor f ⇒ x ∈ set_F f)"</p>
<p>instance<br>
  apply intro_classes<br>
  apply (unfold subexp_x_def)<br>
  apply (rule wfP_trancl)<br>
  apply (rule wfPUNIVI)<br>
  subgoal premises prems for P x<br>
    apply (induct x)<br>
    apply (rule prems[rule_format])<br>
    apply (simp only: <a href="http://x.case">x.case</a>)<br>
    done<br>
  done</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>But one would like to have some reasonable simp rules for subexp_x (which may be as hard as the original problem that you are trying to solve). In particular, if F is itself a datatype that belongs to the subexp type class, its notion of subexp should be linked to the one of x.</p>

Hello,</p>
<p>we're talking about Isabelle datatypes here, which are always finite<br>
(final algebras is the categorial interpretation). The Haskell<br>
interpretation is actually a codatatype (the final coalgebra) and<br>
calling them "datatypes" is, in my opinion, actually a bit non-standard.<br>
But it makes sense given the lazy semantics of Haskell.</p>

be enough.Instead, I suppose one would have to introduce a<br>
"proper-subexpression"relation for datatypes (e.g. xs &lt; Cons x xs) along<br>
with a proof thatthis relation has the obvious properties (irreflexive,<br>
asymmetric,transitive).</p>
<p>I guess that is something that only a datatype package plugin similar<br>

codebriefly, I think only the people who wrote the BNF package could (or<br>
atleast should) implement that.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one could just use the size function (as someone<br>
alreadysuggested in this thread) to get pretty much the same thing,<br>
except thatit won't work for all datatypes (e.g. infinitely branching<br>
ones).</p>

<p>We store the BNFs that nest recursive occurrences in fp_nesting_bnfs (in fp_sugar). There is also the live_nesting_bnfs for BNFs that nest an occurrence of one of the datatype's (live) type variables. See the following examples:</p>
<p>datatype 'a tree = Node 'a "'a tree list"<br>
datatype ('a, 'b) tree2 = Node "'b ⇒ 'a option" "(('a, 'b) tree2 list × 'a) tree"<br>
ML ‹BNF_FP_Def_Sugar.fp_sugar_of @{context} @{type_name list} |&gt; the |&gt; #fp_nesting_bnfs›<br>

<p>I'm not 100% sure whether you only need the fp_nesting_bnfs or the union of the two. And of course you will need the associated fp_sugars rather than just BNFs (for those types that are in fact datatypes), but these are easy to get once you have the names.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also have no idea how to do 2 properly – the "size" plugin provides<br>
some information with BNF_LFP_Size.size_of, but oddly enough it only<br>
provides the equations for the "regular" size function "size", but not<br>
for the generalised one (e.g. "size_list"), which appear in the size<br>
functions of nested datatypes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jasmin can say more but it is probably due to the fact that the old interface didn't provide the generalized equations either. You could access the equations by name (cf. "List.list.size"), but this is of course a bit fragile. The correct way would be to extend BNF_LFP_Size's interface. The equations should be available internally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that I really do want to do 2, because relying on the simplifier<br>
itself to solve the precondition "size lhs ≠ size rhs" is fragile and<br>
breaks at least in some cases in the AFP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am sympathetic to the proposal of having a 'proper<br>
subexpression' ordering defined for<br>
all datatypes (e.g., via a plugin similarly to size).<br>
Its usefulness goes beyond the<br>
acyclicity rules which this thread is about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely! It's probably no surprise to you when I say that I won't<br>
implement this. But if you (or one of our other datatype experts) ever<br>
does it, do let me know!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I won't promise anything, but will keep this in mind for students looking for theses. :)</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But one would like to have some reasonable simp rules for subexp_x<br>
(which may be as hard as the original problem that you are trying to solve). <br>
In particular, if F is itself a datatype that belongs to the subexp type class, <br>
its notion of subexp should be linked to the one of x.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Already for mutual and nested datatypes, you would probably need an<br>
entire family of relations for each combination of types (e.g. if you<br>
have mutually recursive datatypes A and B, you would probably need<br>
subexpr_A_A, subexpr_A_B, subexpr_B_A, subexpr_B_B).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right, or just one subexpr_(A+B)_(A+B) which is reminiscent of what function does for mutual recursion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess everything gets complicated once you involve nested datatypes…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, no. Because nesting is handled by the virtue of BNFs (more precisely their set function) in this case. See my example, where the recursive occurrence of x was nested in F.</p>

Two quick comments on this.</p>
<p>Firstly, I don't think these theorem is especially useful. You might have planned to add this to the simplifier, but its term net doesn't do any magic here. It will end up checking every term that matches "Cons x xs = ys" for whether "xs" can match "ys". I'm not sure if that matching is equality, alpha-equivalent or unifiable.</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
I cleaned up and optimised my simproc a little bit more [1] and ran some<br>
tests [2]. In particular, I realised that it makes no sense for it to<br>
work on lists since other simprocs already handle the problem there.</p>
<p>Both tests on my machine and on the Testboard seem to indicate that, on<br>
average, the simproc leads to about 0.7% to 1.0% slowdown (both elapsed<br>
time and CPU time).</p>
<p>Tobias and I think the simproc is interesting enough to switch on by<br>
default (it makes trivial and obvious proof obligations go away).</p>
<p>Dmitriy and Jasmin were concerned that it might not be worth the<br>
slowdown and that it should be discussed on the list. Jasmin thinks it<br>
might not be useful often enough to justify a 1% slowdown and should<br>
therefore not be enabled by default.</p>
<p>I on the other hand think that any simproc that is not enabled by<br>
default will simply never be used in practice so that if we don't enable<br>
it by default, we might as well not have it in the first place.</p>
<p>Feel free to weigh in on this, everyone!</p>
