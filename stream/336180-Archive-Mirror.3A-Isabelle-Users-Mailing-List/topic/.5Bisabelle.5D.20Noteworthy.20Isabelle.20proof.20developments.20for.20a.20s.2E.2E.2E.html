<p>From: Talia Ringer &lt;<a href="mailto:tringer@cs.washington.edu">tringer@cs.washington.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>My name is Talia Ringer and I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of<br>
Washington. I'm working on a proof engineering<br>
&lt;<a href="http://proofengineering.org/">http://proofengineering.org/</a>&gt; survey paper. However, I don't have any<br>
Isabelle expertise on the paper, and my community overwhelmingly skews<br>
toward Coq users. To make sure Isabelle gets adequate coverage, I have been<br>
consulting other people.</p>
<p>Right now, I am looking for noteworthy Isabelle proof developments to<br>
include in the paper. The paper focuses mostly on proof engineering for<br>
program verification, but it talks about mathematics and metatheory as<br>
well, so developments in those domains are welcome. I'm aware of the AFP,<br>
but please don't hesitate to link to particular developments within the AFP<br>
if you think they're especially noteworthy. It is OK to send your own work<br>
if you think it is noteworthy and want to make sure it isn't missed.</p>
<p>Also, while not the focus of this email, feel free to send other bits of<br>
Isabelle knowledge besides major proof developments that you think are<br>
essential to a survey paper (to give an idea of what sorts of things are<br>
relevant, we already talk about Isar, the Isabelle style guide, Nominal<br>
Isabelle, Transfer and Lifting, sledgehammer, and Isabelle/jedit, among<br>
other things).</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Talia<br>

<p>The term "proof engineering" is rarely used in the Isabelle community,<br>
although people are probably doing it implicitly all the time. From the<br>
perspective of the prover platform, the strategy has always been to make<br>
it perform sufficiently well, such that high-end applications are easily<br>
processed by it without requiring further adhoc tools.</p>
<p>There has always been a race of system infrastructure vs. applications.<br>
A current snapshot of it is sketched in my presentation at the Isabelle<br>
Workshop 2018: "Further Scaling of Isabelle Technology" (slides and<br>
paper) <a href="https://sketis.net/2018/slides-for-presentations-at-floc-2018-oxford">https://sketis.net/2018/slides-for-presentations-at-floc-2018-oxford</a></p>
<p>The slides classify time scales for processing Isabelle theory sessions<br>
as follows:</p>
<p>* instantaneous: 10 min (Edmund Stoiber constant)<br>
  * online waiting: 45 min (Paris Commuter constant)<br>
  * offline waiting: 2 h (French Lunch time)<br>
  * too long: 8 h (Overnight job)</p>
<p>The best I have seen in recent months is as follows:</p>
<p>1) Intel Xeon 2 * 20 cores with SSD</p>
<p>* 2 min for the Isabelle/HOL image (the "standard prelude"), which is<br>
already quite big</p>
<p>* 6 min for the main Isabelle/HOL libraries, including HOL and the<br>
huge HOL-Analysis session</p>
<p>* 11 min for the full Isabelle distribution (libraries and examples)<br>
  * 36 min for Isabelle + AFP, excluding unusually slow sessions</p>
<p>2) AMD 8 * 8 cores cluster</p>
<p>* 65 min for Isabelle + AFP, including regular slow sessions,<br>
excluding some special very-slow sessions (one of it takes 4-6h)</p>

<p>I see AFP as the main application of Isabelle, and guess that it covers<br>
approx. 60% of the visible Isabelle universe. Already since 2006,<br>
Isabelle technology enhancements are driven by the requirements of AFP.</p>

<p>Note on Isar: well-structured proofs are not only better for the human<br>
reader (and maintainer), but also for overall system performance. People<br>
sometimes think that "declarative proof languages" are expensive<br>
concerning automated proof search, but Isar is not called "declarative"<br>
and its built-in automation is minimal: Isar means "Intelligible<br>
semi-automated reasoning". Consequently, checking well-structured Isar<br>
proofs is much faster than old-style "apply" scripts (this a minority<br>
style in Isabelle applications, but a majority style in Coq applications).</p>
<p>Note on Eisbach: this proof method language has been added in recent<br>
years. Inspired by Ltac, it allows to define Isar proof methods in the<br>
source notation of the proof language. Some Eisbach spin-off concepts<br>
allow to structure old-style apply-scripts, e.g. the 'subgoal' command<br>
(similar to Coq bullets, but leading to parallel proofs). Beyond that it<br>
is easy to define proof methods in Isabelle/ML: unlike Coq with its<br>
separate "plugin" concept, Isabelle tools are defined directly within<br>
the theory source, and subject to the normal interaction model (and<br>
Prover IDE support).</p>
<p>Note on Isabelle/jEdit (in that spelling): this is the main front-end of<br>
Isabelle/PIDE --- the Prover IDE framework --- and the default<br>
user-interface of Isabelle. Another PIDE front-end is Isabelle/VSCode,<br>
which is included in Isabelle2018 at a relatively modest 1.1 version,<br>
but some people have already started using it. Isabelle users<br>
occasionally abuse the name of the "jEdit" text editor for the whole<br>
technology stack behind the Isabelle/jEdit product. Conceptually, the<br>
key things are Isabelle/Scala and Isabelle/PIDE: a hybrid of Scala and<br>
ML modules to support IDE concepts natively in the prover.</p>
<p>In recent years there has been a tendency to integrate more and more<br>
prover technology into the Prover IDE (according to its name and<br>
principle). A notable exception is the "isabelle build" command-line<br>
tool, but it will also move into the IDE eventually.</p>
<p>The build tool understands the syntax of Isabelle theory sessions. This<br>
is important for scaling, and "engineering" of large proof projects: the<br>
system can impose certain policies according to the theory structure.</p>
<p>Taking away the free choice of "make" tools from the user also means<br>
that Isabelle projects can easily build on existing projects, without<br>
having to worry about the underlying project management technology: it<br>
is just standard Isabelle itself.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Non-Bavarians often don't understand the Edmund Stoiber joke above. Here<br>
is the original speech <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY9bIZ9Jn9E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY9bIZ9Jn9E</a> as<br>
representative of the many variations on the theme on Youtube. The<br>
illustrations also help to get the point, despite Stoiber's strange way<br>
of speaking German. (It is about building a high-speed train connection<br>
from Munich main station to Munich airport, in order to get there in<br>
max. 10 min. The project has not materialized so far.)</p>
<div class="youtube-video message_inline_image"><a data-id="VY9bIZ9Jn9E" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY9bIZ9Jn9E"><img src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/1bd27205136b03b4f410dc724b6e5c7318819018/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f56593962495a394a6e39452f64656661756c742e6a7067"></a></div><p>Related to that is the keynote by Peter O'Hearn at FLoC 2018 about<br>
"Continuous Reasoning: Scaling the Impact of Formal Methods"<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/smart-program/FLoC2018/2018-07-09.html">https://easychair.org/smart-program/FLoC2018/2018-07-09.html</a></p>
<p>He was talking about "diff time" of max. 15 min. It is the time you are<br>
ready to invest to study the diff of an incoming changeset, to discuss<br>
it with colleagues, decide to apply it or ignore it. His message to<br>
formal-method tool builders: you need to be quicker than 15 min for<br>
immediate formal analysis, if you want software developers to take your<br>
results into account.</p>
<p>For formal proof checking the situation is analogous, but re-checking of<br>
proofs is not optional, it cannot be ignored. Thus it is important to<br>
have the main libraries and applications build in less than 10-15min in<br>
order to remain productive in continued maintenance of the core system<br>
and libraries.</p>
