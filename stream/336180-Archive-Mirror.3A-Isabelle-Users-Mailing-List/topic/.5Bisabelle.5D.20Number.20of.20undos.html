Hi,</p>
<p>I’m not sure if this is an issue with jEdit or with Isabelle/jEdit, but<br>
I find the default number of 100 undo steps very low, and I occasionally<br>
lose work when some change turned out to be contraproductive and I want<br>
to go back.</p>
<p>Given the resource demands that Isabelle has anyways (16GB RAM was<br>
suggested recently, I think), I don’t believe that there is a problem<br>
raising that limit by an order of magnitude or two.</p>
<p>I know I can change it myself locally, but</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>when upgrading Isabelle my settings are lost, so unless I’m very <br>
   careful I’ll be bitten by the problem at least once per release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other users might learn about the setting the hard way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I suggest to change the default as distributed with Isabelle.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Joachim<br>

I wouldn't recommend using jEdit undo at all, you can't undo undos (as <br>
in emacs) so you live with the illusion you can get back to previous <br>
states while a single edit after an undo can cut of arbitrary parts of <br>
your documents history.</p>

<p>I have never encountered this limit myself in 8 years of using jEdit as my <br>
main editor, as well as a few years of using Isabelle/jEdit as Prover IDE.</p>
<p>After spending 5min with the sources and properties of jEdit, I now see <br>
that there is buffer.undoCount, which can be changed in Global Options / <br>
Editing / Number of undos.  The change is made persistent in <br>
$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/jedit/properties as usual.</p>
<p>It is normal that personal properties accumulate, and require manual <br>
maintenance on Isabelle releases.  The main inconvenience here is the <br>
erratic order of the lines in the file -- something that is worth <br>
improving and submitting to one of the trackers at <br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jedit">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jedit</a></p>
<p>I could add more Isabelle/jEdit default changes to <br>
$ISABELLE_HOME/src/Tools/jEdit/src/jEdit.props, but it needs a minimum <br>
level of significance to diverge further from the defaults.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There is a misunderstanding: Isabelle/jEdit resource requirements are not <br>
very special.  A small machine for small applications (4 GB RAM), a medium <br>
machine for medium applications (8 GB RAM), a slightly bigger machine for <br>
big applications (16 GB).  Really big machines by today's standards have <br>
32-128 GB RAM.</p>
<p>That may sound hilarious, but Proof General with XEmacs required much more <br>
resources in relation to the hardware of its time.  When crafting <br>
Isabelle/jEdit over so many years, I always kept an eye on current <br>
consumer hardware parameters.  One problem that I did not foresee is the <br>
general stagnation of the market: people don't upgrade their machines <br>
anymore as they used to do in the past.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I don't know much about the jEdit undo manager, so I can't tell.  This <br>
discussion is better moved to <br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jedit/mailman/jedit-devel">http://sourceforge.net/p/jedit/mailman/jedit-devel</a></p>
<p>So far I have been mostly alone on that mailing list to represent the <br>
needs of Isabelle/jEdit users.</p>
<p>I need to emphasize once more that Isabelle/jEdit is not a fork of jEdit, <br>
but an application on top of it.  As much required changes as possible <br>
should be handed back to the main project, even though this is some extra <br>
work.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Using Emacs myself over 15 years, I never understood its way of undo or <br>
undo-undo.</p>
<p>jEdit is more standard in that sense: it follows customs from the <br>
1980/1990-ies that are well-established in many applications.  There is <br>
undo and redo to move in the history in the normal way. There might be <br>
questions how the graniularity of history steps is actually determined, <br>
but that is something for regular jEdit user channels.  Myself I just <br>
adopted the mechanics of the existing editor in my editing -- as I did for <br>
other editors in the past.</p>
<p>How about someone opnening a question on stackoverflow with tag "jedit" <br>
(not "isabelle")?  Or posting on some jedit mailing list?</p>

jEdit:</p>

<p>There is an edit stack with an undo pointer, each edit command sets the <br>
undo pointer to the latest element except the undo command which is an <br>
edit command that decrements the undo pointer and reverts the command <br>
pointed to by the undo pointer.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
I still don't quite understand the point. Is this now something for the <br>
mailing list of jEdit or Emacs?</p>
<p>Isabelle/jEdit is the second major prover front-end, after Proof General <br>
Emacs, where I was also involved. The editor substrate at the bottom is <br>
given as-is.  It has strengths and weaknesses. As an editor I've found <br>
jEdit more onvincing than Emacs, which is why I started this insane PIDE <br>
project, but PIDE is actually independent of editors.</p>
<p>There are two main routes to go from here:</p>
<p>* participate in improvements of jEdit on the jEdit mailing lists,<br>
     trackers etc.</p>
<p>* participate in other PIDE implementations, e.g. Isabelle/Eclipse.</p>
