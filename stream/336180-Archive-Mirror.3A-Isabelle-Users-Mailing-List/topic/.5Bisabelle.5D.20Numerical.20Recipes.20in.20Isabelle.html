<p>From: Yann Le Du &lt;<a href="mailto:yledu@free.fr">yledu@free.fr</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>Benjamin Pierce, who suggested I should send the question that follows on<br>
this mailing list, writes, in the introduction to his new book on "Software<br>
Foundations", that "logic is to software engineering what calculus is to<br>
mechanical/civil engineering". Now that caught my attention since, as a<br>
physicist who recently discovered the world of formal methods thanks to<br>
Dijkstra's archives, I believe formal methods (program derivation, proof of<br>
correctness, etc.) can help me in my work in physics for which I code<br>
different kinds of things including simulations and solvers. Now, following<br>
Pierce, how could I "logicize" my coding ?</p>
<p>I'm very ignorant of Isabelle, I just read the back cover blurb, but let me<br>
go to the heart of the matter : is it possible, and advisable if we want to<br>
do things correctly, to code Press et al. "Numerical Recipes" in Isabelle<br>
(if that has any meaning) ? How would a software engineer approach the task<br>
of coding Numerical Recipes ? Since Isabelle, like Coq if I'm not mistaken,<br>
can extract Haskell/OCaml code, then am I right to envision a "proved<br>
correct" Isabelle numerical recipe then extracted to Haskell/Ocaml and<br>
efficiently compiled ?</p>
<p>The answer to that central question determines the fate of many others I<br>
have in store !</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Yann</p>
<p>P.S. I crosspost on the Coq and PVS mailing lists.</p>

<p>From: Tobias Nipkow &lt;<a href="mailto:nipkow@in.tum.de">nipkow@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Yann,</p>
<p>A logical account of Numerical Recipes can take on two distinct forms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You give up on imperative programming, use the prover's built-in<br>
functional language, and extract functional code at the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You write C code and use some C verification tool that generates<br>
proof obligations that you prove with your favourite prover.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 1 seems to be what you have in mind, which is why I will<br>
concentrate on it. It is the most direct approach and usually leads to<br>
simpler proofs.</p>
<p>Note that I have not refered explicitly to any particular prover. Option<br>
1 is viable with Coq, Isabelle and PVS. There are some variations on<br>
this approach, eg in Isabelle you could write your code in Haskell and<br>
import it to Isabelle for verification, which may appeal to the<br>
programmer, but most of the work would still be at the Isabelle level.</p>
<p>Is your task advisable? It should enable you to do some very interesting<br>
research on the theorem proving front. Whether you will convince your<br>
community is another matter. Because, make no mistake, these proofs are<br>
hard to push through any prover. You will not be able to just breeze<br>
through Numerical Recipes and tick off one algorithm after another. For<br>
example, you will often have to establish quite a bit of background<br>
maths first that the prover does not know about. And unless you find<br>
bugs, the response to a successful verification of a well-known<br>
algorithm is likely to be muted on the application front.</p>
<p>How would a software engineer approach the task of coding Numerical<br>
Recipes? He would draw a UML class diagram in his favourite case tool<br>
and generate the code automatically ;-)</p>
<p>Best<br>
Tobias</p>
<p>PS You should also look at HOL Light<br>
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/</a>. It does not directly support<br>
generation of OCaml code (although it could) but has a first-rate<br>
mathematics library (which we are in the process of importing to Isabelle).</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>this is possible in Isabelle, though it might be a little bit harder  <br>
and cumbersome than you might imagine and the resulting code is not as  <br>
efficient as you would like it to be :-) Recently there has been work  <br>
on computing with floating point numbers in Isabelle, and stuff like  <br>
Taylor-approximation is available now, I think (though I do not know  <br>
how accessibly packaged this is).<br>
There is one efficiency problem: To my knowledge sabelle does not  <br>
directly deal with the usual IEEE floats and doubles, but uses a pair  <br>
of arbitrary size integers to encode a float. This and the fact that  <br>
your code will be functional code (as opposed to imperative code) will  <br>
make the compiled code way slower than if coded for example in C.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Very nicely.</p>

<p>Generating code with floats and doubles is not an issue. Of course you<br>
need a theory of IEEE 754 to base your verification on. There are some<br>
in HOL (which would not be hard to port to Isabelle).</p>
<p>You avoided machine floats because you wanted to rely on as few trusted<br>
components as possible (which is the Coq/HOL/Isabelle tradition). But<br>
for Numerical Recipes this would be unnatural and would appear esoteric<br>
to that community.</p>

There is something else you have to beware of: purely functional<br>
languages do not have mutable arrays! Of course you can simulate them by<br>
lists, but the resulting code is very inefficient. Different languages<br>
and provers have different answers to this. The Isabelle answer is the<br>
Haskell answer: you need to write your code in a monadic style, then<br>
Isabelle and later the Haskell compiler can generate code that updates<br>
arrays in place.</p>

<p>From: Amine Chaieb &lt;<a href="mailto:ac638@cam.ac.uk">ac638@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
You might be interested in previous considerations such as described in<br>
this paper:</p>
<p><a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/535034.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/535034.html</a></p>
<p>Theorem provers are not mentioned there though.</p>
<p>Note also that functional programming does not necessarily mean less<br>
efficiency. Purely functional programs are highly parallelizable and if<br>
your target programming language already provides parallel<br>
implementations of some key-functions like map, fold_map etc... then you<br>
can extract parallel code for free. This has been done for ML see for<br>
that e.g. Makarius's latest work<br>
(<a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/papers/parallel-isabelle.pdf">http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/papers/parallel-isabelle.pdf</a>). Haskell<br>
also provides one of the best parallelization architectures, hopefully<br>
Ocaml will follow soon.</p>
<p>One further point worth mentioning here is when it worth the effort to<br>
verify/implement numerical algorithms in a theorem prover? In several<br>
cases, it will just be sufficient to check the results. Take for example<br>
the simple problem of LU decomposition of a matrix. All you need is to<br>
compute <em>somehow</em> L and U, then check that L is upper triangular and U<br>
is lower diagonal (very easy), and that the product is your original<br>
matrix. The algorithm itself need not be verified, just the results (but<br>
here again, each time!!). The same applies to several other problems<br>
like interpolation, root finding (depending on what you want to verify),<br>
Eigenvalues etc...</p>
<p>In some cases you will need to implement and verify the full algorithm<br>
of course. I don't see for instance a simple check for numerical<br>
integration.</p>
