<p>From: Anja Gerbes &lt;<a href="mailto:agerb@gmx.de">agerb@gmx.de</a>&gt;<br>
Good evening, </p>
<p>I am working with Isabelle, but in the following lemmas I cannot solve the problem. Can you tell me how I can complete the proof of the following lemma?</p>
<p>lemma subst_no_occ:<br>
 shows "\&lt;not&gt; occ (Var v) t<br>
     \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; Var v \&lt;noteq&gt; t<br>
     \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; t \&lt;triangleleft&gt; [(v,s)] = t"<br>
   and "\&lt;not&gt; occ_list (Var v) ts<br>
     \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; (\&lt;And&gt;u. u \&lt;in&gt; set ts<br>
       \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; Var v \&lt;noteq&gt; u)<br>
     \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; apply_subst_list ts [(v,s)] = ts"<br>
apply (induct rule: trm.inducts)<br>
apply (simp_all)<br>
...<br>
done</p>
<p>If I would find a solution, how could I prove this lemma in Isabelle, then I could continue working on this and expand the following Lemma:</p>
<p>lemma MGU_Var[intro]: <br>
  assumes no_occ: "\&lt;not&gt;occ (Var v) t"<br>
  shows "MGU [(v,t)] (Var v) t"<br>
proof (intro MGUI exI)<br>
  show "Var v \&lt;triangleleft&gt; [(v,t)] = t \&lt;triangleleft&gt; [(v,t)]" using no_occ<br>
   apply (cases "Var v = t")<br>
   apply (auto simp:subst_no_occ)<br>
proof -<br>
  fix \&lt;theta&gt; assume th: "Var v \&lt;triangleleft&gt; \&lt;theta&gt; = t \&lt;triangleleft&gt; \&lt;theta&gt;" <br>
  then have "\&lt;theta&gt; =\&lt;^sub&gt;s [(v,t)] \&lt;bullet&gt; \&lt;theta&gt;" <br>
  proof -<br>
    fix s  have "s \&lt;triangleleft&gt; \&lt;theta&gt; = s \&lt;triangleleft&gt; [(v,t)] \&lt;bullet&gt; \&lt;theta&gt;" using th <br>
      apply (induct s) <br>
      apply (auto)<br>
  qed<br>
qed<br>
qed</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can not verify that my assumption is correct, because there must first be proved Lemma no_subst_occ for it. It would be very kind of you, if you could help me in this case.</p>
<p>For a better understanding of the unification algorithm and further lemma is stated that I was able to prove already. I can send it to you if you want it.</p>
<p>Greetings Anja</p>

<p>If proofs get more complex, it is often a good idea, to use structured <br>
proofs instead of apply scripts (see the Isar Tutorial for an <br>
introduction, if you've have never worked with structured proofs).</p>
<p>So start your proof with</p>
<p>proof (induct rule: trm.inducts)</p>
<p>You can use Isabelle / Show Me / Cases in Proof General, to see which <br>
cases are there. It turns out, two of them are really easy:</p>
<p>proof (induct rule: trm.inducts)<br>
   case Var then show ?case by simp<br>
next<br>
   case Nil_trm then show ?case by simp<br>
next</p>
<p>Now, the two cases Fn and Cons_trm seem to be harder; neither simp nor <br>
auto can solve these directly; at least, as long as you don't give <br>
additional lemmas. At this point, you have multiple options, amongst others:</p>
<p>- Split the proof into smaller steps, which might be easier to solve<br>
   - Use find_theorems to find a useful lemma, which might already<br>
     exist, but is not known to the various automatic solvers</p>
<p>- Often quite useful: Try sledgehammer to find proofs automatically.<br>
     Often the proof found by sledgehammer can also help you to identify<br>
     lemmas which enable the simplifier to find a proof.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at Cons_trm.</p>
<p>next<br>
   case Cons_term then show ?case<br>
     apply simp</p>
<p>Still some goal left. How can we proceed? Hm, there is an "if" in the <br>
hypotheses:</p>
<p>~(if occ (Var v) trm then True else occ_list (Var v) list)</p>
<p>By default, the simplifier only expands an "if", if it can simplify the <br>
condition to either true or false. So it might help, if we tell Isabelle <br>
to do a case distinction on the condition:</p>
<p>apply (cases "occ (Var v) trm")<br>
     apply simp_all</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No subgoals!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice, that helped. Instead of using cases, We can also tell the <br>
simplifier to split the if and just use</p>
<p>by (simp add: split_if)</p>
<p>instead. Now, how can we solve the last goal? Maybe "split_if" also <br>
helps us here?</p>
<p>next<br>
   case Fn then show ?case<br>
     apply (simp add: split_if)</p>
<p>No, does not seem to suffice. What's left?</p>
<p>⟦(⋀u. u ∈ set list ⟹ Var v ≠ u) ⟹ apply_subst_list list [(v, s)] = list;<br>
      ¬ list_ex (op = (Var v)) list ∧<br>
      (¬ list_ex (op = (Var v)) list ⟶ ¬ occ_list (Var v) list)⟧<br>
     ⟹ apply_subst_list list [(v, s)] = list</p>
<p>Let's try brute force and invoke "sledgehammer". If I run sledgehammer <br>
on my version of Isabelle, it finds the following proof (might be <br>
different in the Isabelle 2011 release):</p>
<p>by (metis (full_types) list_ex_iff)</p>
<p>This is a perfectly valid proof, but often you can gain knowledge about <br>
Isabelle's library, if you take this proof to find a new proof with the <br>
simplifier. So replace the proof we have till now with</p>
<p>by (simp add: list_ex_iff split_if)<br>
qed</p>
<p>We're lucky, it works like a charm! Now, that we have found a proof, we <br>
can turn it into a really compact one: Each of our subgoals was solved <br>
with simp, so we replace the whole proof...qed block by</p>
<p>by (induct rule: trm.inducts) (auto simp: list_ex_iff split_if)</p>
<p>(auto is much like the simplifier, but uses some more techniques and <br>
applies to all goals).</p>
<p>So, we now have found a really compact proof. But such a short, nice <br>
proof is often the result of some lengthy process. If you are proficient <br>
in Isabelle's library, you are considerably faster, but such knowledge <br>
comes only with experience.</p>
<p>And when you request help from others, it really helps, if you narrow <br>
your problem down. Instead of presenting the whole problem, just present <br>
the subgoal you are not able to solve; but provide enough context, that <br>
one can recreate what you have done. Exact questions have a much better <br>
chance to be answered.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If you are sure that a lemma holds but you don't want to prove it right <br>
now, you can use "sorry" to fake a proof (as long as you are in <br>
quick'n'dirty mode). But of course, this always bears the risk that you <br>
build your later work on sand, not on a solid fundament ...</p>
<p>Greetings and HTH, Lars</p>

<p>It should work with<br>
   (simp split: split_if)<br>
i.e. it is not a normal simp rule but added to the splitter.</p>

<p>In this case it also works for the simplifier. Actually, I had to go to <br>
the old HOL manual, to find out, why one would usually use the splitter <br>
for this. In our case, the if is in the assumption, so one would need</p>
<p>(simp split: split_if_asm)</p>
<p>here instead. But I'm quite fuzzy on the semantics of the split <br>
parameter -- why would split_if be applied to the conclusion and <br>
split_if_asm to the hypotheses? Is there somewhere a high-level <br>
description of the splitter?</p>
<p>BTW: Is the isar-ref documentation about the split method correct? It <br>
does not seem (and need) to accept the "(asm)" option?</p>
