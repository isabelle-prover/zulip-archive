<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>Recently, I encountered an issue which I find slightly difficult to<br>
understand. I have already mentioned this issue on the mailing list, but<br>
only as a side remark in a reply to another thread (<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-July/msg00060.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-July/msg00060.html</a>).<br>
As far as I am concerned, the question in the aforementioned thread was<br>
already answered in full and there is no reason to keep the thread alive.<br>
Furthermore, I am slightly worried that most of the regular users who can<br>
easily provide commentary on the remark would not have read it because of<br>
where it was posted (to make matters even worse, I failed to present the<br>
issue in the most comprehensive manner, for which I apologize). Therefore,<br>
I hope it is appropriate to repost the issue as an explicit thread.</p>
<p>Effectively, the issue comes down to establishing the recommended practices<br>
with regard to the use of different types for variables with identical<br>
names/indexnames in a single context/theorem/term in Isabelle/HOL. The<br>
problem is that, on one hand, there is much infrastructure in place to<br>
prevent users from using different types for variables with identical<br>
names/indexnames. Nevertheless, on the other hand, the logic does allow it<br>
and it is not too difficult to introduce theorems (even accidentally) which<br>
use different types for variables with the same name/indexname.</p>
<p>More specifically, I have the following questions, the second being of<br>
certain practical significance:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is introducing theorems that use differing types for variables with the<br>
identical names/indexnames is considered to be a bad style, is it<br>
completely illegal or, perhaps, it is actively exploited by user packages<br>
that I am not aware of?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it acceptable for the user packages to assume that all variables in<br>
the theorems that they receive as inputs from the users do not have any<br>
occurrences of variables with the identical names/indexnames and different<br>
types?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of a theorem that has occurrences of variables with the same<br>
name, but different types:</p>
<p>locale myloc =<br>
  fixes B :: "'b::plus"<br>
  assumes "B ≡ B"<br>
begin</p>
<p>ML ‹</p>
<p>fun mk_eq_thm' lthy =<br>
let<br>
  val T = TFree ("'b", ["HOL.type"])<br>
  val ct = Free ("B", T) |&gt; Thm.cterm_of lthy<br>
  val thm = ct |&gt; Thm.reflexive<br>
  val thm = Thm.implies_intr<br>
    (@{term True} |&gt; HOLogic.mk_Trueprop |&gt; Thm.cterm_of lthy)<br>
    thm<br>
  val lthy = Local_Theory.note ((@{binding mythm'}, []), single thm) lthy<br>
    |&gt; snd<br>
in lthy end</p>
<p>›</p>
<p>local_setup ‹mk_eq_thm'›</p>
<p>definition C where "C = (B = B)"<br>
lemma True_C: "C = True" unfolding C_def by auto</p>
<p>declare [[show_sorts]]<br>
lemmas mythm'' = mythm'[folded True_C, unfolded C_def]<br>
(* theorem mythm'': (B::'b::plus) = B ⟹ B::'b::type ≡ B *)</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I think it’s terrible style, and as your example shows, you have to work quite hard to accomplish this.</p>

<p>I think so.</p>

Dear Lawrence Paulson/All,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I believe that it would be useful to explain what you stated in your email<br>
in the implementation manual. Of course, while it is difficult/impossible<br>
to introduce new theorems that use variables with the same name and<br>
different types using Isar commands only, it is very easy to do so via the<br>
public ML interface, even by mistake. Unless I have missed something, this<br>
issue does not seem to be covered at all (I believe that the manual merely<br>
states that the type inference mechanism rejects such cases). Given that<br>
using the variables with the same name and different types is considered to<br>
be a 'terrible' style, it makes me wonder why the public ML interface<br>
permits it at all... are there any use cases or any plans to exploit this<br>
feature of the logic in the future?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

As a general rule, style is a matter of choice. This particular issue does not seem to arise frequently in practice. It is more common in the HOL world, but even there it doesn’t appear to be a source of controversy.</p>
