<p>From: Tambet &lt;<a href="mailto:qtvali@gmail.com">qtvali@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
I'm still stuck with inductive proofs. I did seek manuals of inductive<br>
functions, searched Google about induction etc., but they all seem to lack<br>
something.</p>
<p>Case 1:<br>
(* If someone would hint, how to make this a subclass of nat so that lemmas<br>
about nat would be used and I could use it in fix part of lemmas, it would<br>
be nice *)<br>
definition cnat :: "nat =&gt; bool"     where "cnat n = (0 &lt; n)"</p>
<p>(* This one is already proven - thanks to Lawrence and Rafal *)<br>
lemma cn_is_cnat: "cnat n ==&gt; cnat (cn n)"</p>
<p>(* This defines the following function - an ordered list, which will go to<br>
infinite cycle at end. This would be nice to have a constructor for list,<br>
which contains those elements, but currently this basic syntax should be<br>
enough? *)<br>
inductive cf :: "nat =&gt; nat =&gt; bool" where<br>
 cnf[intro!]:<br>
  "cnat n ==&gt; cf (cn n) n" |<br>
 cff[intro!]:<br>
  "cf m n ==&gt; cf (cn m) n"</p>
<p>(* This follows directly from cf_def and cn_is_cnat. *)<br>
lemma cf_is_cnat: "cnat n ==&gt; cf m n ==&gt; cnat m"</p>
<p>I did try strategies described in<br>
<a href="http://www.mkm-ig.org/meetings/mkm06/Presentations/Wenzel.pdf">http://www.mkm-ig.org/meetings/mkm06/Presentations/Wenzel.pdf</a></p>
<p>For example, this:<br>
lemma cf_is_cnat:<br>
  assumes "cnat n"<br>
  assumes f: "cf m n"<br>
  shows "cnat m"<br>
using f<br>
proof (induct n fixing: m)</p>
<p>I would read it as that if I fix m, then I can prove general statements,<br>
which hold for any m. Then I could have case with cnf followed by case with<br>
cff and it would be proven.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I get is that I actually could not fix m:<br>
*** method "HOL.induct": bad arguments<br>
***   : m<br>
*** At command "proof".</p>
<p>lemma cf_is_cnat:<br>
  assumes "cnat n"<br>
  assumes "cf m n"<br>
  shows "cnat m"<br>
proof -<br>
  fix x<br>
  show "cf (cn x) x ==&gt; cnat (cn x)"<br>
*** Local statement will fail to refine any pending goal<br>
*** Failed attempt to solve goal by exported rule:<br>
***   cf (cn (?x2::nat)) ?x2 ==&gt; cnat (cn ?x2)<br>
*** At command "show".</p>
<p>Now, how could I extract the cases of definition - first case<br>
(non-inductive) is the case "cf (cn x) x"; second case is the inductive case<br>
"cf (cn y) x", where y is resulting "cn ?" from first or second case. It<br>
should be proven if I show that first case gives me number with property<br>
cnat and inductive case gives me number with property cnat if it's given<br>
number with property cnat.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am unable to close such circle. I am unable to define that these<br>
are the cases and all cases.</p>
<p>This is the pattern from isar-overview I also tried:<br>
lemma cf_is_cnat:<br>
  assumes "cnat n"<br>
  assumes f: "cf m n"<br>
  shows "cnat m"<br>
using f<br>
proof (induct m)<br>
  fix x<br>
  case "cnat n ==&gt; cf (cn n) n"<br>
  case "cnat n"<br>
  case "cn n"<br>
  case cnf</p>
<p>That last list of cases is all kinds of things I tried to use to point out<br>
that I mean the first, noninductive case there.</p>
<p>I can understand that the best way to prove something about recursive<br>
function is:</p>
<p>- Show that the parts of function, which are not recursive ("entry<br>
   points") will be True if values given have property x (and False otherwise).</p>
<p>- Show that the parts of function, which are recursive and call those<br>
   parts will be True if values given have property x (and False otherwise).</p>
<p>This could be extended by having properties x, y and z and paths, which have<br>
this property. This is finite task to create all possible paths from one to<br>
another and show that iff given values have property x, y or z, then all<br>
calls they make have property z, y or x (for example) and thus, all paths<br>
lead to True if input has any of such properties; then to show that some<br>
such property is assumed.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am probably lacking some critical bit of knowledge to actually<br>
create such path and show about those properties ...manuals give this rather<br>
by example, but my current tries to generalize them to my case do not meet<br>
some constraint if any of them is interpreted as meant at all.</p>
<p>How to solve such cases - example for concrete examples would be nice, link<br>
to general manual not needing too much foreknowledge would be also very<br>
nice. Because this is totally critical for me to have such things proven to<br>
continue - I can already handle the simple non-recursive proofs in many<br>
cases, but I do not catch the logic(s?) behind cases.</p>

<p>lemma cf_is_cnat: "cf m n ==&gt; n&gt;0 ==&gt; m&gt;0"<br>
apply(induct rule: cf.induct)<br>
apply (metis cn_is_cnat)<br>
by (metis cn_is_cnat)</p>
<p>You can easily turn into a structured proof.</p>
<p>I have eliminated cnat - I don't see the point of it. More importantly,<br>
your whole approach is overly complicated. You want to iterate function<br>
cn. Well, simply use function iteration: (cn^^k)(n) is the result of the<br>
k-fold application of cn to n. See compower in theory Nat.thy.</p>
