<p>From: Tambet &lt;<a href="mailto:qtvali@gmail.com">qtvali@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
This is a conceptual question - I would need an answer soon, but it's quite<br>
much to optimize my learning paths.</p>
<p>Say that I have a set of mutually recursive functions [A_0..A_n].</p>
<p>Then I make up a set of properties [P_0..P_m], which apply to inputs and<br>
outputs of those functions.</p>
<p>Say that those n and m are natural numbers (so that the sequences are<br>
finite).</p>
<p>For example, this:</p>
<p>- A_0 might return a result or call A_1 with some value and return it's<br>
   result in slightly modified form.</p>
<p>- A_1 might return a result or call A_2 in same way.<br>
   - A_2 might call A_0 or A_1 depending on something.</p>
<p>This makes up somewhat complicated call path.</p>
<p>I want to prove that in case a call to A_2 returns, it's result will have<br>
property P_x iff it's input has property P_y.</p>
<p>Assume that I can prove that:</p>
<p>- In case parameter passed to A_2 has property P_y, it will<br>
      - call A_0 with parameter having property P_0 or<br>
      - call A_0 with parameter having property P_1 or<br>
      - call A_1 with parameter having property P_0<br>
   - In case parameter of call to A_0 has property P_0<br>
      - It will instantly return result, which has property P_1<br>
   - and so on</p>
<p>In case I am able to prove those things about concrete calls, I have made up<br>
a finite call graph, which is basically having very small mathematical<br>
complexity (in terms of O(f(n)), where n is the number of facts I have given<br>
it and f(n) is the number of operations). It would be also nice knowledge<br>
about how to make functions over those properties so that I could show that<br>
return values of them are decreasing to show that function will always<br>
return, but this raises the complexity so much that I better won't ask it<br>
right now - I will ask it later, when I have learnt to handle the more basic<br>
case :)</p>
<p>Second case is about returning in this simple graph. Could I show that for<br>
some property of value, another function will be called with such value that<br>
third function will be called and third will call second one with such<br>
property that it forms a cycle?</p>
