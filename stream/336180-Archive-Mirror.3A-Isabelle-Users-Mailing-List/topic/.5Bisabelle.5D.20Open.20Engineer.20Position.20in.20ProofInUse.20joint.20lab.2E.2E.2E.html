<p>The Joint Laboratory ProofInUse (<a href="https://www.adacore.com/proofinuse">https://www.adacore.com/proofinuse</a>) <br>
hires an experienced R&amp;D engineer (M/F) in the domain of Formal Methods <br>
for Software Engineering:</p>
<p><a href="https://jobs.inria.fr/public/classic/en/offres/2018-01034">https://jobs.inria.fr/public/classic/en/offres/2018-01034</a></p>
<p>ProofInUse originates from the sharing of resources and knowledge <br>
between the Toccata research team (<a href="http://toccata.lri.fr/">http://toccata.lri.fr/</a>), specializing <br>
in techniques for deductive program verification and the SME AdaCore, a <br>
software publisher, specializing in providing software development tools <br>
for critical systems. The SME TrustInSoft (<a href="https://trust-in-soft.com/">https://trust-in-soft.com/</a>), <br>
specialized in advanced static analysis techniques for safety and <br>
security of C/C++ source code, recently joined the ProofInUse Laboratory.</p>
<p>The purpose of ProofInUse is to increase significantly the number of <br>
customers of the SPARK 2014 and the TrustInSoft Analyzer technologies, <br>
by popularizing the use of formal proof techniques. This popularization <br>
requires the resolution of several scientific and technological <br>
challenges. A first axis of work is to design and implement a new <br>
plug-in for deductive verification in the TrustInSoft Analyzer, making <br>
use of the Why3 intermediate (<a href="https://why3.lri.fr/">https://why3.lri.fr/</a>) tool for <br>
verification condition generation, along the guidelines and design <br>
choices previously adopted for SPARK, that include strong restrictions <br>
on the analyzed code regarding the possibility of aliasing in data <br>
structures. This new plug-in must support new techniques for analyzing <br>
bit-level and floating-point codes, as well as new facilities for <br>
providing counterexamples when proofs fail. A second axis of work is to <br>
leverage the former non-aliasing restrictions, via an alias analysis <br>
based on a Rust-style sharing control and borrowing. A third axis is to <br>
actively participate to the development of a formally proved C/C++ <br>
software library.</p>
<p>The recruited engineer will work in close collaboration with the <br>
ProofInUse Research and Development team, to address both the scientific <br>
and the technological challenges presented above. It is expected that <br>
the engineer contributes both to advancing the academic knowledge in <br>
ProofInUse context and to the transfer of this knowledge into the <br>
software products distributed by AdaCore and TrustInSoft. The engineer <br>
will participate actively to the production of scientific publications, <br>
and to the software development of the Why3 tool and the TrustInSoft <br>
Analyzer.</p>
<p>We expect from the candidate some experience with Formal Methods for <br>
Software Engineering in a broad sense, typically the candidate should <br>
have defended a PhD in the domain of Formal Methods. More specifically, <br>
a plus would be some experience in formal logic and proof techniques, in <br>
automated deduction, in Satisfiability Modulo Theory solvers, in Model <br>
Checking or in Abstract Interpretation techniques.</p>
<p>The candidate should have a fair experience in software development, a <br>
plus would be the knowledge of functional programming, and the knowledge <br>
of the programming languages OCaml, C/C++ and/or Rust.</p>
<p>The candidate should be able to write and speak in English fluently.</p>
<p>The job will take place both on Toccata's lab site in building 650 of <br>
University Paris-Sud in Orsay, and at TrustInSoft's site in Paris, France.</p>
<p>The position is to be filled as soon as possible starting from Nov 1st <br>
2018, for a duration of 36 months.</p>
<p>Apply by sending a CV and a motivation letter to the e-mail contact <br>
addresses below, and/or via the URL given at the top of this message.</p>
