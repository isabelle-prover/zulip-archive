Ph.D. Research Project at ETH Zurich on<br>
Formal Methods for Federated Identity Management<br>
Prof. David Basin, ETH Zurich</p>
<p>The Information Security Group carries out research on methods and tools<br>
for the analysis and construction of safe and secure systems. This<br>
includes methods for specifying systems, developing systems in<br>
correctness-preserving ways, and verifying or testing existing systems<br>
and infrastructures. Our goal is not only to build and analyze novel<br>
systems and security solutions, but also to develop better methods and<br>
tools for system engineering and quality assurance activities.</p>
<p>We have an open Ph.D. research position on "Formal Methods for Federated<br>
Identity Management". We seek to hire a researcher who will carry out<br>
research on the formal analysis of federated identity management<br>
systems, like SAML and OAuth 2.0.  The project's main objectives<br>
are to distill requirements and designs for "next generation federated<br>
identity management" and to bring current verification tools, in<br>
particular our Tamarin prover, up to the level where such protocols can<br>
be automatically analyzed on a realistic scale with respect to both<br>
security and privacy properties.</p>
<p>The project, which will be carried out together with partners at Zurich<br>
Kantonal Bank (ZKB), will run for approximately 3 years and provide the<br>
possibility of carrying out a Ph.D. during this period. As part of this<br>
project, the researcher will spend time with ZKB learning about the<br>
systems under consideration and state-of-the-art approaches to their<br>
design and analysis.</p>
<p>The ideal candidate for this position is an enthusiastic, outstanding<br>
researcher with a strong background and interest in one or more of<br>
the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>formal methods or mathematical logic,</li>
<li>information security or cryptography,</li>
<li>automated security protocol verification tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Candidates with a strong theoretical background in related areas are<br>
also encouraged to apply. ETH Zurich regulations require PhD candidates<br>
to hold a Master's or equivalent degree (e.g. Diplom).  The project,<br>
which is funded by the Zurich Information Security Center, and will be<br>
supervised by Prof. David Basin together with Dr. Ralf Sasse.</p>
<p>The Ph.D. student will be a paid employee of ETH Zurich. Salary and<br>
employment conditions are attractive. ETH Zurich regulations require<br>
doctoral students to hold a Master's or equivalent degree (e.g. Diplom).</p>
<p>Zurich is a diverse and multicultural city, which is consistently rated<br>
among the best cities in the world in which to live. We favor the same<br>
sort of diversity that defines Zurich's cultural makeup and encourage<br>
anyone matching the profile above to apply, regardless of where you are<br>
from.</p>
<p>Applications should include a curriculum vitae, a brief description of<br>
research interests, transcripts of grades, 2-3 letters of recommendation<br>
from teachers or employers, and, if possible, the Master's or<br>
Bachelor's thesis and publications. Applications and informal<br>
inquiries should be sent to Ralf Sasse at the following email address:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:infsec.positions@inf.ethz.ch">infsec.positions@inf.ethz.ch</a></p>
<p>ETH Zurich specifically encourages women to apply with a view towards<br>
increasing the proportion of female researchers.</p>
