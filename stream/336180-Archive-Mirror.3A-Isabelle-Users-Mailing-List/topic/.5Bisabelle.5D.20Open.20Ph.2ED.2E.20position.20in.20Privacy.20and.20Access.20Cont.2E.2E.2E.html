<p>Ph.D. Research Project at ETH Zurich on<br>
Privacy, Data Protection, and Access Control<br>
Prof. David Basin, ETH Zurich</p>
<p>We have open Ph.D. research positions in the area of Privacy, Data<br>
Protection, and Access Control.  We seek to hire one or more doctoral<br>
students who will carry out research on the development of novel control and<br>
auditing mechanisms that enhance data protection, e.g., by ensuring that<br>
data is only used for the purposes it is collected.  This will involve<br>
developing and prototyping new access control mechanisms as well as<br>
using code analysis and machine learning methods to extract and<br>
determine "purpose" from code and other system artifacts. In addition and <br>
independent of foundational research on these topics, there will be<br>
the opportunity to work with our industrial partners to evaluate the<br>
developed techniques on realistic large-scale systems.</p>
<p>The ideal candidate for this position is an enthusiastic, outstanding<br>
student with a strong background and interest in one or more of<br>
the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>formal methods </li>
<li>information security or cryptography,</li>
<li>programing language theory and methods and tools for program analysis</li>
<li>machine learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Candidates with a strong theoretical background in related areas are<br>
also encouraged to apply. ETH Zurich regulations require PhD candidates<br>
to hold a Master's or equivalent degree (e.g. Diplom). The Ph.D. student <br>
will be a paid employee of ETH Zurich. Salary and employment conditions <br>
are very attractive. </p>
<p>Applications should include a curriculum vitae, a brief description of<br>
research interests, transcripts of grades, 2-3 letters of recommendation <br>
from teachers or employers, and, if possible, the Master's or<br>
Bachelor's thesis and publications. Applications and informal inquiries <br>
should be sent to Esfandiar Mohammadi at the following email address:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:infsec.positions@inf.ethz.ch">infsec.positions@inf.ethz.ch</a></p>
<p>ETH Zurich specifically encourages women to apply with a view towards<br>
increasing the proportion of female researchers.</p>
<p>Our group:<br>
The Information Security Group carries out research on methods and tools<br>
for the analysis and construction of safe and secure systems. This<br>
includes methods for specifying systems, developing systems in<br>
correctness-preserving ways, and verifying or testing existing systems<br>
and infrastructures. Our goal is not only to build and analyze novel<br>
systems and security solutions, but also to develop better methods and<br>
tools for system engineering and quality assurance activities.</p>
<p>The city of Zurich:<br>
Zurich is a diverse and multicultural city, which is consistently rated<br>
among the best cities in the world in which to live. We favor the same<br>
sort of diversity that defines Zurich's cultural makeup and encourage<br>
anyone matching the profile above to apply, regardless of where you are from.</p>
