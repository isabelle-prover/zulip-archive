<p>From: Dmitriy Traytel &lt;<a href="mailto:traytel@inf.ethz.ch">traytel@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Ph.D. Research Project at ETH Zürich on Big Data Monitoring<br>
Prof. David Basin and Dr. Dmitriy Traytel, ETH Zürich</p>
<p>The Information Security Group carries out research on methods<br>
and tools for the analysis and construction of safe and secure<br>
systems. This includes methods for specifying systems,<br>
developing systems in correctness-preserving ways, and verifying<br>
or testing existing systems and infrastructures. Our goal is not<br>
only to build and analyze novel systems and security solutions,<br>
but also to develop better methods and tools for system<br>
engineering and quality assurance activities.</p>
<p>We have an open Ph.D. research position on "Big Data<br>
Monitoring". The project's main objective is to develop and<br>
implement efficient, parallelized algorithms capable of checking<br>
whether a high-volume and high-velocity stream of events comply<br>
with given rules. The rules are formulated in an input language<br>
that allows users to express temporal and data dependencies<br>
between different events in the data feed in a simple and<br>
intuitive manner. If any of the rules are violated, a compact<br>
output of the data that caused the violation should be produced.</p>
<p>The ideal candidate for this position is an enthusiastic,<br>
outstanding researcher with a strong background and interest in<br>
one or more of the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>formal methods or mathematical logic,</li>
<li>automata theory or model checking or runtime verification,</li>
<li>stream processing or data stream management systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Candidates with a strong theoretical background in related areas<br>
are also encouraged to apply. ETH Zürich regulations require PhD<br>
candidates to hold a Master's or equivalent degree (e.g.<br>
Diplom). The project is funded by the Swiss National Science<br>
Foundation and will be supervised by Prof. David Basin and Dr.<br>
Dmitriy Traytel.</p>
<p>The Ph.D. student will be a paid employee of ETH Zürich. Salary<br>
and employment conditions are attractive. ETH Zürich regulations<br>
require doctoral students to hold a Master's or equivalent<br>
degree (e.g. Diplom).</p>
<p>Zurich is a diverse and multicultural city, which is<br>
consistently rated among the best cities in the world in which<br>
to live. We favor the same sort of diversity that defines<br>
Zurich's cultural makeup and encourage anyone matching the<br>
profile above to apply, regardless of where you are from.</p>
<p>Applications should include a curriculum vitae, a brief<br>
description of research interests, transcripts of grades, 2-3<br>
letters of recommendation from teachers or employers, and, if<br>
possible, the Master's or Bachelor's thesis and publications.<br>
Applications and informal inquiries should be sent to Dmitriy<br>
Traytel at the following email address:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:infsec.positions@inf.ethz.ch">infsec.positions@inf.ethz.ch</a></p>
<p>ETH Zürich specifically encourages women to apply with a view<br>
towards increasing the proportion of female researchers.</p>
