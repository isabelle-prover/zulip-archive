<p>From: Christian Urban &lt;<a href="mailto:urbanc@in.tum.de">urbanc@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Apologies for multiple postings. Please bring this announcement <br>
to the attention of anyone who might be interested.</p>
<p>Postdoctoral researcher in the <br>
             Nominal Methods Group at the TU Munich</p>
<p>We have an open position for a postdoctoral researcher in the<br>
newly formed nominal methods group at the TU Munich. The research<br>
of our group is centered around the nominal datatype package. This <br>
package pushes the state of the art of formalising programming <br>
languages and solving POPLmark-like problems without having to <br>
resort to using de-Bruijn indices and higher-order abstract syntax.<br>
More information about the group can be found under</p>
<p><a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~urbanc/Nominal/">http://www4.in.tum.de/~urbanc/Nominal/</a></p>
<p>The work we are interested in is both theoretical and practical,<br>
in the sense of implementing the tools we design. An ideal candidate <br>
for the position has therefore experience with formalisations and <br>
theorem provers as well as with functional programming. The research <br>
themes for the position are broad including developing novel features<br>
of Isabelle, advancing the nominal logic theory and conducting <br>
case-studies using our tools. </p>
<p>We offer an active and friendly research environment in the Isabelle<br>
group in Munich. We have close ties with many international researchers<br>
working on the POPLmark Challenge. Munich is Germany's most attractive <br>
city - the Alps are very close and local beer and merrymaking are not <br>
frowned upon in Bavaria.</p>
<p>The appointment is for two years initially with possible extensions. <br>
The position is open from September 2006, but slightly earlier or <br>
later starting dates can also be considered. Remuneration will be <br>
in accordance with the German Scale BAT-IIa for researchers. The<br>
salary depends on age and family circumstances; typical numbers<br>
are 2980 Euros per month for a single 25 year old rising to 3200<br>
Euros per month for a single 30 year old.</p>
<p>Informal inquiries about the position may be send to <a href="mailto:urbanc@in.tum.de">urbanc@in.tum.de</a>.<br>
Send applications no later than 26th of May 2006. To apply send your <br>
application (preferably electronically) including a CV, publication <br>
list, contact details of 2 referees and a statement of research to</p>
<p><a href="mailto:urbanc@in.tum.de">urbanc@in.tum.de</a>       or        Dr Christian Urban <br>
                                 Institute for Computer Science I4<br>
                                 TU Munich, <br>
                                 Boltzmannstr. 3, <br>
                                 D-85748 Garching, <br>
                                 Germany.</p>
