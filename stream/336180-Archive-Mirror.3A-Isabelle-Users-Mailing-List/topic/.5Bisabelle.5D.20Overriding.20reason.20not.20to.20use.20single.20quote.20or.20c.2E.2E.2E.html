Hi,</p>
<p>I try not to ask these simple questions when I know so little, but I'd <br>
need to ask this eventually. It's better to ask now, than later with a <br>
couple thousand lines of code.</p>
<p>I've read the style guide in implementation.pdf, so I've read and seen <br>
that the preferred identifier naming scheme uses the underscore <br>
character "_". However, I don't like how it looks, but a bigger issue is <br>
that I have to escape it in Latex. Right now, I'm not using the Isabelle <br>
Latex processing.</p>
<p>I'm kind of settling on a combination of limited camelcase use, and <br>
using the single quote character, ( ' ), to separate words in an identifier.</p>
<p>For example, I have the identifer "emS'is'unique". Below, I include a <br>
very fledgling theory where I don't know what I'm doing. It's to show <br>
some of my identifier naming.</p>
<p>I haven't seen any naming like "emS'is'unique". Is this just a matter of <br>
preference, or would doing a lot of that come back to haunt me? I'm <br>
assuming if I don't get errors in jEdit when doing that kind of thing, <br>
it's not going to come back to haunt me.</p>
<p>(I haven't figured out if the unicode characters in an email like this <br>
show up correctly in other's email readers.)</p>

<p>The Isabelle document preparation system will solve these problems for <br>
you.  What are the reasons for not using it?</p>
<p>Generally, camelCaseWasInventedByPeopleWhoDidNotHaveUnderscoreAvailable<br>
InTheireCharacterSet, probably around 1960/1970, before ASCII became <br>
universally accepted.  Spacing between words improves readability, this <br>
was observed first about 3000 years ago -- the ancient Phoenicians and <br>
early Greek writers did not know it yet.  Classic fonts are also designed <br>
to have capitals in front of words only, not in the middle.  You can see <br>
this especially in the Computer Modern fonts of LaTeX.</p>
<p>Even though our classic (Unix) standard of separating words by underscore <br>
has been there from the beginnings (1980-ies/1990-ies), one reason why it <br>
was made more explicit in recent years might be the advent of good <br>
typographic screen fonts like Bitstream Vera.  Then the rules for proper <br>
typography become more important to screen display.</p>
<p>So why do many younger people still consider camel case as standard?  My <br>
theory on the main historical events is that:</p>
<p>* Xerox PARC that introduced the legendary Xerox Star computer system<br>
     with bitmap display, mouse, object-oriented programming for GUIs in<br>
     the 1970-ies was one of these labs living in the IBM-tradition of not<br>
     having "_" on the keyboard nor in the character set.  So the classic<br>
     workaround to use camelCaseAsAnApproximation was employed.  (You can<br>
     still see that in the "Axiom" programming language, for example, which<br>
     lacks "_" by default.  It is from a genuine IBM lab.)</p>
<p>* Apple copied that to make the Lisa and Macintosch.</p>
<p>* MS copied that to make Windows.</p>
<p>* Almost everybody else copied that as well.</p>
<p>What remains are a few ancient guys like in the Isabelle, Coq, OCaml<br>
communities, who did not submit to that invasion.</p>

<p>I would say that should work out in practice, I am doing it myself all the <br>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Makarius,</p>
<p>First, I have been influenced by your emphatic insistence, spoken in <br>
various ways, that we not use camelcase. Now I'm trying to come up with <br>
a solution for long identifiers that doesn't use underscores. Here, I <br>
resist the temptation to go into a lengthy discussion of my view of the <br>
aesthetics of the underscore. There's a lot of freedom with Isabelle; <br>
having figured that out, I now try to be flexible.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...a bigger issue is that I have to escape it [the underscore] in <br>
Latex. Right now, I'm not using the Isabelle Latex processing.<br>
The Isabelle document preparation system will solve these problems for <br>
you.  What are the reasons for not using it?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Last year, I worked on trying to use Isabelle to produce the PDF docs <br>
from the .thy files. In looking through the source of the tutorial, <br>
prog-prove.pdf, I can see the benefits of doing things your way, such as <br>
being able to put in hidden "oops"s.</p>
<p>However, there's a problem, and there's a complete show-stopper. You <br>
should keep in mind that I'm not willing to live without my Latex <br>
macros, especially for sectioning commands, which I tweak to create <br>
customized bookmarks. I think that in itself isn't/wasn't a problem, but <br>
it complicates things a little. Last year, my solution was to only use <br>
"text{<em>...</em>}", and none of the Isar sectioning commands.</p>
<p>PROBLEM: To be productive with Latex, you need to compile often, and be <br>
able to compile fragments. I don't remember if compile speed for a small <br>
theory was a problem, but to compile a theory fragment now, I'd have to <br>
write scripts to create temporary .thy files for the fragment, and these <br>
would have to import parts of the .thy that I'd be working on, so that <br>
Isabelle wouldn't choke on a logic error. It's just the hassle of <br>
switching over from what I use now, or, possibly, a big hassle.</p>
<p>SHOW-STOPPER: It's vaguely coming back to me, but I'm pretty sure that <br>
the show-stopper was my need for the Verbatim environment. I had to put <br>
it in a "text{<em>...</em>}" command, but "begin{Verbatim}" and "end{Verbatim}" <br>
are picky about what can be on the same line with them. I couldn't get <br>
rid of those errors, that I remember.</p>
<p>Anyway, I gave up and made the Isar subservient to the Latex in a tex <br>
file. I'm now back to making the Latex subservient to the Isar in a thy <br>
file by commenting out all the Latex, so that the file can be directly <br>
loaded into jEdit.</p>
<p>Right now, I can't spend more time on trying to make things look nice, <br>
at least done that way. The harder learning curve is Isabelle, and the <br>
prerequisite knowledge required to use it.</p>
<blockquote>

this was observed first about 3000 years ago...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is the issue that using the underscore for spacing makes a name <br>
longer, but I'm seeing it your way, that spacing is important, and that <br>
capital letters are best used sparingly. And with a little work, I can <br>
probably come up with words that keep the name length down.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm kind of settling on a combination of limited camelcase use, and <br>
using the single quote character, ( ' ), to separate words in an <br>

<p>You can also redefine the default isabelle latex macros to get a <br>
slightly different glyph for the underscore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, I have to get into my opinions about mathematical writing, of <br>
which I'm more of a critique than a producer.</p>
<p>For me, at this point, there are two important driving principles, among <br>
others:<br>
     1) try to follow traditional, mathematical writing convention as <br>
much as possible, and<br>
     2) keep a clear distinction between the syntax and language of <br>
Isar, and the informal<br>
          language of mathematics used to discuss, prove, define, etc..</p>
<p>The good news is that you were thinking about Isar over 10 years ago. <br>
Isar is sympathetic to tradition, with its structured proofs, the <br>
ability to abbreviate structured proofs, and with its standard <br>
mathematical symbols.</p>
<p>The breakdown, as I see it, comes with theorem names, function names, <br>
and constant names; that is, names in general. Formal, compound-word, <br>
long names, aren't a part of mathematical writing. So this requirement <br>
by programming languages that everything have a name doesn't fit with <br>
traditional-looking mathematical language in an unobtrusive way.</p>
<p>To describe the motivation for "emS'is'unique", consider this <br>
hypothetical sentence in my hypothetical book:</p>
<p>My dear reader, please consider what happens when /A/ is bounded by <br>
/b/.</p>
<p>Suppose formally that I've defined a function /is_bounded_by/. As a <br>
quick advertisement, I mention Slawomir's IsarMathLib.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nongnu.org/isarmathlib/">http://www.nongnu.org/isarmathlib/</a></p>
<p>By looking at his document, I saw his use of infix notation such as "A <br>
{is disjoint with} B", which is shown on page 7. Okay. I like the idea, <br>
but I don't like curley braces for non-set use any more than I like <br>
underscores.</p>
<p>Here, I could stop writing and just say, "You know what, there is no <br>
perfect solution to trying to create spacing between words without only <br>
using spaces. Spaces look good when all you want is a simple space. All <br>
these other characters don't".</p>
<p>Well, back to my pontificating.</p>
<p>Alright, so you tell me that I can delay the decision on how to <br>
represent the underscore by using antiquotations such as @{text <br>
foo_bar}, and that I can substitute glyphs, probably very nice looking <br>
glyphs, for the underscore.</p>
<p>There are two problems. If I formally introduce /is_bounded_by/ into my <br>
Isar code, then that's exactly how I want to refer to it anywhere else, <br>
including in an informal discussion. As a total beginner, it was a <br>
source of confusion for me to see identifiers which had hyphens <br>
substituted for underscores. It's a non-issue now, but a 30-second <br>
concept can be a 1-weeker when I'm on my own, especially if I'm only in <br>
a discovery stage to try to determine if I want to go down a certain route.</p>
<p>The other problem is that I should make the "executive decision" now. <br>
There are only a few non-alpha-numeric characters available to use in an <br>
identifiers. Here's a list of me trying to name "is bounded by":</p>
<p>1) is_bounded_by<br>
2) isBoundedBy<br>
3) is'bounded'by</p>
<p>Really, if the phrase "is bounded by" was in a sentence in the middle of <br>
a paragraph, anything done to it would mess it up and break the flow of <br>
the sentence. Even italicizing it would mess it up.</p>
<p>The single ticks aren't looking so good to me at this moment. What I <br>
need to do is put the different names in the middle of a big paragraph, <br>
like in these sentences:</p>
<p>My dear reader, please consider what happens when /A is'bounded'by <br>
b/, or</p>
<p>My dear reader, please consider what happens when /A is_bounded_by b/.</p>
<p>It's like recording music. You get up the next morning, and what you <br>
thought sounded good the night before, doesn't sound so good anymore. <br>
However, I think camelcase is out, for the most part.</p>
<p>Nothing's ever simple, though. What I see in jEdit, which is <br>
emS'is'unique, looks better because jEdit is using a fixed-width font. <br>
Thunderbird here is not using a fixed width font, so the ticks don't <br>
create enough space.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

It 's becoming less vague. I could get rid of the compile errors, but <br>
because one, or the other, or both \begin{Verbatim} and \end{Verbatim} <br>
needed to be on a line with nothing else, I couldn't get rid of the <br>
"<em>}"s, or the "{</em>"s, or the "(<em>"s, or the "</em>)"s. How I was wrapping the <br>
Verbatim begin and end, I don't remember, but stars and delimiters were <br>
cluttering my document.</p>
<p>But that's to be expected, since I was trying to put all of the Isar <br>
code in a verbatim environment, so maybe  beginnings and endings on <br>
lines by themselves were never a real issue. Ah, I was using the <br>
Verbatim gobble feature to gobble up some of the stars and delimiters <br>
that wrapped it, but I couldn't gobble them all up.</p>

<p>can you give a hint for which sake you are using verbatim?  In LaTeX it<br>
mixes up to purposes</p>
<p>a) interpret source more or less literally</p>
<p>b) present result in typewriter</p>
<p>For each of these, there are different possibilities; especially b) can<br>

simple, but there are ways to cope with involving ML (depending how<br>
general it is supposed to be).</p>

<p>If your primary concern is how identifiers appear in natural language,<br>
you can consider using your specific set of antiquotations where you can<br>
modify identifiers programatically, in the extreme case using an<br>
explicit substitution table.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Florian,</p>
<p>Thanks for the interest, but first, please allow me to clarify why I <br>
won't be able to use antiquotations such as @{text foo_bar} at the point <br>
I start using Isabelle to create PDFs.</p>
<p>The limitation is that Acrobat's bookmarks can only predictably take <br>
basic ASCII characters, which I constantly forget until I see "stuff" or <br>
the "lack of stuff" in my PDF bookmarks. The bookmarks for chapter 4 of <br>
functions.pdf demonstrates the problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2012/doc/functions.pdf">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2012/doc/functions.pdf</a></p>
<p>The antiquotation for section 4.2 resulted in numeric trash in the <br>
bookmark. I use the hyperref package, so I know about the problem from <br>
trying to use macros in section titles. My solution is to not get fancy <br>
in section titles; to not have a bookmark made from a complicated Latex <br>
macro, or use something like @{text foo_bar} in the title.</p>
<p>I heavily use PDF bookmarks. I have Latex macros which use the theorem <br>
environment for Isabelle theorems, lemmas, definitions, etc.. These <br>
macros also create a subsection entry into the <br>
bookmarks/table_of_contents using the name of the theorem. Consequently, <br>
I have to hard code the name so I don't get "stuff" or the "lack of <br>
stuff" in the PDF bookmarks. It's not an option to use fancy characters <br>
in the name, or to figure out later what character I want to use to <br>
separate words.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's obvious to me that the Isabelle Latex document processing <br>
is very powerful and should be the Latex tool of choice for most people <br>
producing Isabelle documents. However, for my needs, without having <br>
spent the time to get what I want through Isabelle, I have to stick with <br>
what I'm doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SHOW-STOPPER: It's vaguely coming back to me, but I'm pretty sure that<br>
the show-stopper was my need for the Verbatim environment...</p>
<p>can you give a hint for which sake you are using verbatim?  In LaTeX it<br>
mixes up to purposes</p>
<p>a) interpret source more or less literally</p>
<p>b) present result in typewriter</p>
<p>For each of these, there are different possibilities; especially b) can<br>
be achieved with Isabelle without relying on verbatim.  a) is not so<br>
simple, but there are ways to cope with involving ML (depending how<br>
general it is supposed to be).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In looking at functions.pdf, I can see that Alexander is using a <br>
different font than other documentation PDFs. I guess this would be an <br>
example of your "b)". The italicized roman font hasn't always been to my <br>
liking for the Isar code, though typewriter font isn't all upside <br>
either, but  I could probably find out how to make basic font changes by <br>
looking at the Isabelle Latex packages.</p>
<p>Bullet "a)" kind of represents why I want the Isar in a Verbatim <br>
environment. I'll say a little more below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your primary concern is how identifiers appear in natural language,<br>
you can consider using your specific set of antiquotations where you can<br>
modify identifiers programatically, in the extreme case using an<br>
explicit substitution table.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

</blockquote>
<p>This is an example of where, because of my multiple wants, in <br>
emphasizing one want, I forget another want that has a higher priority.</p>
<p>It's true that I want Isar identifiers to look good when mixed into a <br>
paragraph of natural language, but more importantly, I want Isar to look <br>
extraordinarily mathematical even in its raw form in a Verbatim <br>
environment, or on the jEdit screen. It happens to be that Isar gives me <br>
a good start. Even Latex doesn't guarantee you a good looking document. <br>
To get Latex looking really good, you have to make lots of artistic <br>
decisions, and do lots of builds, and stare at the screen a lot.</p>
<p>As to natural language, using my example "is_bounded_by", I wouldn't <br>
have to use that in an informal discussion, I could just say "is bounded <br>
by" and let the reader make the connection if it was obvious. Function <br>
over form, or form over function? It's always a compromise.</p>
<p>But back to why I want the Isar in a Verbatim environment. It's because, <br>
being in the student mode right now, I'm sympathetic with a student's <br>
needs. Code in a verbatim environment is basically saying, "This is what <br>
the code really looks like in the editor. If you open the source file, <br>
this is almost exactly what you will see. This is to make sure that you, <br>
as a student, don't have any questions about what exactly the code is."</p>
<p>Replacing identifiers with something significantly different is not <br>
something I would do. Clarity is more important to me than traditional <br>
looking language. More levels of abstraction, or more words requiring <br>
interpretation require more work from the reader, and more work to teach <br>
them what the vocabulary means.</p>
<p>Someday I could decide that line numbers in a Verbatim environment are <br>
just noise. What I'm doing will serve its purpose until I switch to <br>
something else.</p>
<p>Learning a little Latex here and there helps out. There's this Latex <br>
package for Fitch style diagrams:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/fitch/">http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/fitch/</a> <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/%7Eselinger/fitch/">http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/%7Eselinger/fitch/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Like most array type environments, it doesn't break well over multiple <br>
pages. I know just enough Latex to where I figured out how to modify it <br>
so that it uses longtable. Now, I can use page after page after page to <br>
do a natural deduction proof using a Fitch diagram.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>
