22nd International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages<br>
(PADL 2020)https://popl20.sigplan.org/home/PADL-2020,20-21 January 2019,<br>
New Orleans, Louisiana, United StatesCo-located with ACM POPL 2020 (<br>

<p><em>Declarative programming languages</em> is an umbrella term for functional,<br>
logic, answer-set and constraint-solving programming paradigms, as well as<br>
a range of verification and theorem proving methods that rely on such<br>
languages. These languages have been successfully applied to many different<br>
real-world situations, ranging from data base management and active<br>
networks to software engineering and decision support systems.</p>
<p>New developments in theory and implementation have opened up new<br>
application areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages<br>
to challenging problems raise new intriguing research questions, such as<br>
scalable design and implementation, language extensions for application<br>
deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications drive the<br>
progress in the theory and implementation of declarative systems, and<br>
benefit from this progress as well.</p>
<p>PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to<br>
present original work emphasising novel applications and implementation<br>
techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional<br>
and logic programming, data-base and constraint programming, theorem<br>
proving. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>- Innovative applications of declarative languages<br>
   - Declarative domain-specific languages and applications<br>
   - Practical applications of theoretical results<br>
   - New language developments and their impact on applications<br>
   - Declarative languages for software engineering<br>
   - Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications<br>
   - Practical experiences and industrial applications<br>
   - Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom<br>
   - Practical languages and extensions such as probabilistic and reactive<br>
   languages</p>
<p>*PADL 2020 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches pertaining to<br>
applications, design and implementation of declarative languages going<br>
beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example database languages<br>
and contract languages.*<br>
Important Dates and Submission Guidelines:</p>
<p>- Abstracts due: 11 October 2019<br>
   - Papers due: 18 October 2019<br>
   - Notification to authors: 18 November 2019<br>
   - Camera-ready: 29 November 2020</p>
<p>Authors should submit an electronic copy of the full paper in PDF using the<br>
Springer LNCS format. The submission will be done through EasyChair<br>
conference system: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=padl2020">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=padl2020</a></p>
<p>All submissions must be original work written in English. Submissions must<br>
be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Work that<br>
already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops<br>
proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program<br>
chair about the place on which it has previously appeared.</p>
<p>PADL 2020 will accept both technical and application papers:</p>
<p><em>Technical papers</em> must describe original, previously unpublished research<br>
results. Technical papers must not exceed 15 pages (plus one page of<br>
references) in Springer LNCS format.</p>
<p><em>Application papers</em> are a mechanism to present important practical<br>
applications of declarative languages that occur in industry or in areas of<br>
research other than Computer Science. Application papers are expected to<br>
describe complex and/or real-world applications that rely on an innovative<br>
use of declarative languages. Application descriptions, engineering<br>
solutions and real-world experiences (both positive and negative) are<br>
solicited. The limit for application papers is 8 pages in Springer LNCS<br>
format but such papers can also point to sites with supplemental<br>
information about the application or the system that they describe.</p>
<p>*The proceedings of PADL 2020 will appear in the LNCS series of Springer<br>
