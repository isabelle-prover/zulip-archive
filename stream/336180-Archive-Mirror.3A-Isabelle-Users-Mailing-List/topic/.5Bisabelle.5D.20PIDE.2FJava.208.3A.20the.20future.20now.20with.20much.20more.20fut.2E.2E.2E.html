<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I thought Java would become the mother of all computing platforms. You <br>
say, "Credentials, please."  Certainly. A copy of my Sun Certified Java <br>
Programming certificate will be coming shortly, unless it doesn't. The <br>
future didn't transpire. Microsoft won. Sun lost. And Java merely became <br>
a major, ubiquitous presence.</p>
<p>Here's the future:</p>
<p>1) Functional programming that keeps you high and safe, unless you want <br>
to work low and dangerous, all in a way that's acceptable to the many.</p>
<p>2) Intermediate languages.</p>
<p>3) Many-core computing.</p>
<p>As a concrete example: Rust, with its foundation in LLVM, where it will <br>
surely tie into any GPGPU platform it pleases, since low-level <br>
programming is at it's heart, like C.</p>
<p>Yes, all things computing can be compared to old-school C. High-level, <br>
but with low-level freedom and power.</p>
<p>With hardware on my mind, for many long months, it has seemed that, for <br>
the future, Java got it wrong with it's stack-based virtual machine, and <br>
LLVM made it right, with its register-based virtual machine.</p>
<p>But all it takes, when it's all wrong, is for capable people to make <br>
what's all wrong all right.</p>
<p>The future, there are parallel paths, with multiple winners when it <br>
comes to intermediate languages and virtual machines.</p>
<p>Java, it's still in the running, with companies like AMD tying it's <br>
stack-based bytecode into a register-based intermediate language.</p>
<p>There is Java 8/Scala, HSA, HSAIL, and Aparapi/Sumatra, to take the JVM <br>
into the same future as Rust and LLVM.</p>

<p><a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/sumatra/">http://openjdk.java.net/projects/sumatra/</a></p>
<p>Watch this, about Aparapi and HSA, and get a warm and fuzzy feeling, to <br>
give you confidence that Java won't leave you behind, crying, shedding <br>
big, Crocodile Dundee crocodile tears. Yea, that guy. He works at NICTA now.</p>

to Java occasionally:</p>

<p>I attach an image of the future now, of jdk-8u25-windows-x64 running the <br>
PIDE. I'm pretty sure it's faster than 64-bit SDK 7, but it could be my <br>
imagination. That it will continue to work, I don't know.</p>
