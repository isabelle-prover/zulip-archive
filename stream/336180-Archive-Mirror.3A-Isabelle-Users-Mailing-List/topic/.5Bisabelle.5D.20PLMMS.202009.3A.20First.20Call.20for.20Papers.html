<p>Munich, Germany; August 21, 2009<br>

<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>The ACM SIGSAM 2009 International Workshop on Programming Languages<br>
for Mechanized Mathematics Systems will be co-located with TPHOLs 2009.</p>
<p>General Information</p>
<p>The scope of this workshop is at the intersection of programming<br>
languages (PL) and mechanized mathematics systems (MMS). The latter<br>
category subsumes present-day computer algebra systems (CAS),<br>
interactive proof assistants (PA), and automated theorem provers<br>
(ATP), all heading towards fully integrated mechanized mathematical<br>
assistants. Areas of interest include all aspects of PL and MMS that<br>
meet in the following topics, but not limited to:</p>
<p>* Dedicated input languages for MMS: covers all aspects of languages<br>
     intended for the user to deploy or extend the system, both<br>
     algorithmic and declarative ones. Typical examples are tactic<br>
     definition languages such as Ltac in Coq, mathematical proof<br>
     languages as in Mizar or Isar, or specialized programming<br>
     languages built into CA systems.</p>
<p>* Mathematical modeling languages used for programming: covers the<br>
     relation of logical descriptions vs. algorithmic content. For<br>
     instance the logic of ACL2 extends a version of Lisp, that of Coq<br>
     is close to Haskell, and some portions of HOL are similar to ML<br>
     and Haskell, while Maple tries to do both simultaneously. Such<br>
     mathematical languages offer rich specification capabilities,<br>
     which are rarely available in regular programming languages. How<br>
     can programming benefit from mathematical concepts, without<br>
     limiting mathematics to the computational world view?</p>
<p>* Programming languages with mathematical specifications: covers<br>
     advanced mathematical concepts in programming languages that<br>
     improve the expressive power of functional specifications, type<br>
     systems, module systems etc. Programming languages with dependent<br>
     types are of particular interest here, as is intentionality vs<br>
     extensionality.</p>
<p>* Language elements for program verification: covers specific means<br>
     built into a language to facilitate correctness proofs using<br>
     MMS. For example, logical annotations within programs may be<br>
     turned into verification conditions to be solved in a proof<br>
     assistant eventually. How need MMS and PL to be improved to make<br>
     this work conveniently and in a mathematically appealing way?</p>
<p>These issues have a very colorful history. Many PL innovations first<br>
appeared in either CA or proof systems first, before migrating into<br>
more mainstream programming languages.  This workshop is an<br>
opportunity  to present the latest innovations in MMS design that may <br>
be relevant to future programming languages, or conversely novel PL <br>
principles that improve upon implementation and deployment of MMS. <br>
Why are all the languages of mainstream CA systems untyped?  Why <br>
are the (strongly typed) proof assistants so much harder to use than <br>
a typical CAS?  What forms of polymorphism exist in mathematics? <br>
What forms of dependent types may be used in mathematical modeling? <br>
How can MMS regain the upper hand on issues of "genericity" and<br>
"modularity"?  What are the biggest barriers to using a more<br>
mainstream language as a host language for a CAS or PA/ATP?</p>
<p>PLMMS 2007 was held as a satellite event of, and PLMMS 2008 was<br>
a CICM 2008 workshop.</p>
