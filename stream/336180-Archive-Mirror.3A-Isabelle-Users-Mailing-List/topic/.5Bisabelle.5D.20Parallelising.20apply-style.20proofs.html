Hello all,</p>
<p>When working in Isabelle/jEdit with parallel proofs set to 2, "by" does not impede progress through<br>
the theory. By which I mean a "by" step can remain purple and being processed while the rest of the<br>
theory proceeds. The same does not seem to be true of a proof with many "apply" steps followed by a<br>
"done." Is there a fundamental reason this doesn't happen or is this just a design decision? It<br>
seems to me that processing could proceed past the proof as soon as the lemma statement itself has<br>
been parsed.</p>
<p>This isn't a complaint as I realise there are several potential work arounds for this like using an<br>
Isar proof or enabling skip proofs. I was just curious why this doesn't happen.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Matt</p>

That is a long-standing omission in PIDE document processing: the prover <br>
merely walks down the sequential arrangement of commands and does only <br>
local forks of diagnistic and 'by' commands.  Conceptually, whole proofs <br>
could be forked recursively, both Isar proof outlines and apply scripts, <br>
as is done in batch mode.</p>
<p>There are various practical reasons why the parallel batch mode and the <br>
PIDE interaction mode did not yet converge in that respect, but it will <br>
happen at some point.</p>
<p>By bringing up this issue, its priority in the pipeline is increased once <br>
again.</p>
