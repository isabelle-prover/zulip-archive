Hey Isabelle users.</p>
<p>I've been playing with Isabelle 2009-1's parallelism features for a <br>
while now, and have come to the conclusion that I can never get quite <br>
what I want from them. There are two problems. On my desktop machine at <br>
work, I can't safely enable parallelism. On my desktop machine at home, <br>
I can't completely disable parallelism.</p>
<p>The first problem is that the L4.verified proof repository I work on is <br>
huge (tens of thousands of lemmas and hundreds of thousands of lines of <br>
proof). This exposes a problem with parallel proof checking. CPU usage <br>
looks good to begin with but then our systems very rapidly run out of <br>
memory and start thrashing. I suspect the problem here is that for every <br>
proof saved for later checking the relevant context needs to saved as <br>
well. Our contexts get quite large, so the theory-parsing thread doesn't <br>
have to get far ahead of the proof-checking threads for memory to run <br>
out. The solution to this is to turn off parallel proof checking.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although Isabelle 2009-1 loads theories in parallel this <br>
does not seem to translate to CPU parallelism. It is clear from the log <br>
chatter that multiple theories are being loaded at once, however, when <br>
parallel proofs are disabled CPU usage remains at one core's worth. <br>
Running UNIX top and showing thread decompositions (press "H") reveals <br>
that there are multiple polyml threads running but their CPU usage <br>
always adds to exactly one core. It looks a lot like there's a lock <br>
somewhere all the threads need to run. This prevents me getting any <br>
parallel execution on my work machine.</p>
<p>Finally, on my machine at home, which seems to act up in the context of <br>
parallelism, I can't disable it. I can turn off parallel proof checking <br>
and set the maximum thread count to 1. UNIX top confirms that this <br>
reduces the number of polyml threads created from 7 to 2, which then <br>
share the CPU between them in exactly the same way. This prevents me <br>
disabling real parallelism on my home machine. I can still run a busy <br>
loop on the other core, which seems to hide the mysterious issues.</p>
<p>Do other users see the same behaviour? Do the developers know what's <br>
going on? Could it be easily fixed?</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
    Thomas.</p>

<p>In a low memory situation, you have two options to play with:</p>
<p>* Multithreading.max_threads (usedir option -M)<br>
   * Goal.parallel_proofs (usedir option -q)</p>
<p>See also section 3.4 in the Isabelle System manual for some further <br>
explanations.  In particulay, -q1 vs. -q2 might sometimes help.</p>
<p>Since your application is rather big, I would say the real solution is to <br>
install more memory.  As a rule of thumb, you need to scale up memory with <br>
the number of cores.  Less than 2 GB per core is unlikely to work here. <br>
Since the total heap size of Poly/ML is limited to 2-3 GB on 32bit, you <br>
might have to switch to 64bit by editing the ML settings accordingly. <br>
There is an example in Isabelle2009-1/etc/settings.  Multiply the memory <br>
by 1.5 or even 2 for 64bit mode.</p>

<p>The degree of parallelism in typical theory development graphs is <br>
surprisingly low.  Nonetheless, you should get some speedup, unless the <br>
graph is all linear.</p>
<p>If CPU usage is really just 100% there might be some ML tools using <br>
something like setmp_CRITICAL internally.  The official Isabelle <br>
distribution is essentially free from such exclusive execution, but maybe <br>
you have your own tools.  Or maybe it is just some critical wrapper around <br>
the main use_thys invocation in ROOT.ML of the session (only relevant for <br>
batch mode).</p>

<p>I have just tried ISABELLE_USEDIR_OPTIONS="-M 1" on my 2-core laptop and <br>
it works as expected: there are only 2 threads, the main ML thread <br>
(typically 80% CPU time) and the GC thread (20% CPU time).  Total CPU <br>
usage is &lt; 50% accounting for the 2 cores, i.e. this is really single-core <br>
mode.  The ML thread and GC thread are alternating each other.</p>
