<p>From: Robert Lamar &lt;<a href="mailto:rlamar@stetson.edu">rlamar@stetson.edu</a>&gt;<br>
I am attempting to develop a theory of rings which features quotients.  So far, I have defined rings through axiomatic classes and ideals through a predicate constant.  There are several approaches to defining the quotient ring which present themselves, but the next step would be to prove that the quotient is an instance of the ring class.  Is there a straightforward way to do this without specifying a particular ideal?  My goal, as I imagine it, is to define a type which is parameterized, essentially, by subsets of "UNIV::('a::ring set)" (or more specifically, by subsets which satisfy my is_ideal predicate).  Is this possible?  Is there a different (better) way to approach this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

Dear Robert,</p>
<p>what you require are dependent types, but these are not supported by <br>
Isabelle.  Instead, we propagate the use of "locales" for <br>
formalisations of algebra.  See the main trunk of session HOL-Algebra.</p>
<p>Quotient rings have not been formalised in this framework (neither have <br>
quotient fields, which you could get also with type classes), so this <br>
would be a welcome contribution.</p>

<p>One possibility would be to prove some theorems with type_definition <br>
predicates as assumptions. In the Isabelle sources, HOLCF/Pcpodef.thy <br>
contains several examples of this, such as:</p>
<p>theorem typedef_cpo:<br>
  fixes Abs :: "'a::cpo =&gt; 'b::po"<br>
  assumes type: "type_definition Rep Abs A"<br>
    and less: "op &lt;&lt; == %x y. Rep x &lt;&lt; Rep y"<br>
    and adm: "adm (%x. x : A)"<br>
  shows "OFCLASS('b, cpo_class)"</p>
<p>Assumption "type" basically says that type 'b is defined as a predicate <br>
subtype of 'a, and is isomorphic to the set A::'a set. An instantiation of <br>
the type_definition predicate is what gets axiomatized whenever you use the <br>
"typedef" command; take a look at HOL/Typedef.thy to see how it is defined. <br>
Assumption "less" says that the overloaded "&lt;&lt;" relation on type 'b is <br>
defined in terms of "&lt;&lt;" on type 'a, and finally "adm" places some <br>
restrictions on the set A. The conclusion is exactly the proposition you <br>
would get as a subgoal if you tried to prove that 'b is an instance of class <br>
"cpo".</p>

<p>In your case, you could prove the following theorem:<br>
theorem typedef_ring:<br>
  fixes Abs :: "'a::ring =&gt; 'b::{zero,plus,times}"<br>
  assumes type: "type_definition Rep Abs A"<br>
    and zero: "0 == Abs 0"<br>
    and plus: "op + == %x y. Abs (Rep x + Rep y)"<br>
    and times: "op * == %x y. Abs (Rep x * Rep y)"<br>
    and ideal: "is_ideal A"<br>
  shows "OFCLASS('b, ring_class)"</p>
<p>You wouldn't get a parameterized type, but you would be able to define new <br>
types one at a time using typedef, and then prove that each new type is in <br>
the ring class using theorem typedef_ring.</p>

<p>The problem with this proof is caused by your usage of the "of" theorem <br>
attribute. Specifically, coset_def [of I s] instantiates coset_def with the <br>
free variables "I" and "s" (on my system Proof General renders these in <br>
blue), where the term you want to replace uses "s" as a bound variable <br>
(rendered in green). Replace this with coset_def [of I] and the proof works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and would like to think that it is a straightforward matter of<br>
substitution.  However, I know that section 5.11 of the tutorial makes it<br>
clear that reasoning about existential operators can be very tricky.  Am I<br>
missing something crucial?</p>
<p>Robert Lamar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you instantiate coset_def with free variables "I" and "s", you get an <br>
assumption that is too weak, since it only asserts the equality for a single <br>
value of "s". For simp to perform a substitution under a quantifier, on a <br>
term containing bound variables, the equality needs to hold for all possible <br>
values of the bound variables. Leaving a variable uninstantiated has the <br>
effect of a universal quantification over that variable, and simp is able to <br>
match it against a bound variable.</p>
<p>It appears that [of I] is still necessary to instantiate the free type <br>
variable in coset_def. Apparently, leaving a type variable uninstantiated <br>
does not have the same effect as an uninstantiated term variable, as far as <br>
simp is concerned; simp cannot match the types and it fails.</p>
<p>As a simpler alternative, you can give coset_def as an argument to simp or <br>
unfold, which avoids the problems with instantiating type variables:</p>
<p>lemma "EX s. S = coset I s ==&gt; EX s. S = {i + s | i. i \&lt;in&gt; I}"<br>
  proof -<br>
    assume "EX s. S = coset I s"<br>
    then show "EX s. S = {i + s | i. i \&lt;in&gt; I}"<br>
    by (unfold coset_def)<br>
