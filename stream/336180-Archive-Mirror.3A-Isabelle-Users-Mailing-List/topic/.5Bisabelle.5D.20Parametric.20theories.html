Hi,</p>
<p>I'm trying to build a theory that is parametric in some types and<br>
would like to know the recommended way for doing that. I realize that<br>
this topic has come up before and that this problem is partially(?)<br>
solved by locales. From what I have read on this list (for example in<br>
[1]), my choices are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use type variables everywhere -- this will get very tiresome very<br>
quickly. Locales don't seem to offer a complete way around that either,<br>
at least the following does not seem to work:</li>
</ol>
<p>locale Foo = fixes x :: "'a"<br>
begin<br>
  type_synonym bar = "'a \times 'a"<br>
end</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use typedecl, consts, and similar commands. This seems ideal apart<br>
from instantiating the theory later. Here I think I have two choices:<br>
Use the AWE tool [2], which seems to do exactly what I want, but was<br>
last updated for Isabelle 2009-1, or a post-hoc axiomatization using<br>
directives like type_definition and axioms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Am I overlooking some possibility, or is that basically it? If so, is<br>
there an up-to-date version of AWE, or does someone know how much work<br>
it would take to update it (I noticed that at least the isar-keywords.el<br>
files of 2011-1 and AWE have diverged, but there are probably more<br>
complicated conflicts than that).</p>
<p>Is there some "convention" on how deal with this issue, as I can imagine<br>
this comes up quite often?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Daniel</p>

<p>It depends what "parameteric on types" shall mean exactly.  Depending on <br>

<p>Normally you just refer to 'a, 'b, 'c in your specifications causally (or <br>

<p>A type_synonym within a local theory context could be made to work, but it <br>
is not so often required in practice to induce significant demands to <br>
implement that.  Other things are more urgent, sich as datatype and record <br>
types within local contexts.</p>

<p>Luckily, just ordinary type parameters are needed in my case.</p>

<p>While I do have only three or four type parameters, I am using<br>
more or less intricate combinations of them quite often, such as<br>
"(('a \&lt;times&gt; 'b) list \&lt;times&gt; ('c \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; 'd)"</p>
<p>Hence I would prefer to have the ability to give these constructs a name<br>
without having to mention the parameters each time again. (I could<br>
construct a type_synonym that needs to be applied to some parameters,<br>
but then I'd still have to write "('a, 'b, 'c, 'd) SomeSynonym").</p>
<p>I guess I'll give using AWE with the current Isabelle version a shot,<br>
and use type_synonyms with parameters if that fails.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your detailed answer!</p>
<p>A related issue I'm curious about: What was the rationale for<br>
introducing typedecl without a straight-forward way to instantiate it?<br>
Being able to define something that has only been declared earlier seems<br>
rather natural to me.</p>

<p>Yes, that's the normal way.  Moreover, you can often suppress type <br>
information in the input, say you write some of the type arguments as "_" <br>
and let type inference take care of the rest.  Or you don't write types at <br>
all.</p>
<p>BTW, most names in Isabelle are normally just lower case like "foo_bar", <br>
including type names.  Capitalization like Foo_Bar is always used for <br>
theory names, datatype constructors, and sometimes for special operators. <br>
Camel-case is generally out of fashion.</p>

<p>The classic canon for axiomatic specifications consists of typedecl, <br>
consts, axioms.  You can do whatever you want here, but there are no <br>
sanity checks.  For example you can first "declare" some types, and then <br>
"define" them -- all axiomatically.  Here is an old example from HOL/Bali <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/Isabelle2011-1/src/HOL/Bali/Example.thy#l66">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/Isabelle2011-1/src/HOL/Bali/Example.thy#l66</a></p>
<p>Historically, Isabelle theories were always axiomatic like that.  Later <br>
the vacous axiomatization of 'consts' followed by a definitional <br>
axiomatization of 'defs' (i.e. 'axioms' with some checks) were called <br>
definitions.</p>
<p>Much later, an actual definitional concept was made the main principle of <br>
the local theory infrastructure that is commonplace today.  It performs <br>
the usual simultaneous declaration-definition of entities seen in most <br>
other provers and in mathematics.  There are also technical and conceptual <br>
reasons for it -- definitions that depend on local contexts work out <br>
better if the RHS is explicitly given.</p>
<p>The surface syntax wraps up these truly definitional primitives as <br>
'definition', 'function', 'induction' etc.  For types, this is still a bit <br>
limited, though.  (Back to start of thread.)</p>
