<p>From: Jesper Bengtson &lt;<a href="mailto:jesper.bengtson@it.uu.se">jesper.bengtson@it.uu.se</a>&gt;<br>
Greetings</p>
<p>I am trying out the new functions package which shipped with Isabelle 2007. The<br>
function I am trying to create a function for parallel substitution where I<br>
want to reason about the domain and range of the substitution at top level,<br>
i.e. I want to be able to write P[xvec:=Tvec] where xvec and Tvec are lists<br>
rather than P[S] where S is a tuple list. The problem with this approach is<br>
that the function is only defined if the lists xvec and Tvec are of the same<br>
length. I tried writing the following function:</p>
<p>function (domintros) substName :: "name =&gt; name list =&gt; trm list =&gt; trm"<br>
("_[_:=_]" [100, 100, 100] 100)<br>
where<br>
  "substName a [] [] = (Name a)"<br>
| "length xs = length Ts ==&gt; substName a (x#xs) (T#Ts) = (if a = x then T else<br>
(substName a xs Ts))"</p>
<p>But at the top of the proof obligations I get a goal which seems pretty<br>
unsolvable to me:</p>
<p>/\P x. [|a. x = (a, [], []) ==&gt; P;<br>
         /\xs Ts a xa T. [|length xs = length Ts;<br>
                           x = (a, xa # xs, T # Ts)|] ==&gt; P|]<br>
       ==&gt; P</p>
<p>It seems to be some sort of completeness condition for the function.</p>
<p>I've read through the guide of the function package and it is a bit unclear if<br>
it is possible to do what I'm trying to do. There are of course work arounds,<br>
but this would be nicer.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>/Jesper</p>

<p>This is not partiality in the sense of the function package. The special <br>
support with domain predicate, domintros and all that is for functions <br>
which have a possibly nonterminating recursion. Here, you simply want to <br>
omit some cases and leave them undefined in some sense.</p>
<p>What you would do is simply</p>
<p>function (sequential) substName :: "name =&gt; name list =&gt; trm list =&gt; trm"<br>
  ("_[_:=_]" [100, 100, 100] 100)<br>
where<br>
   "substName a [] [] = (Name a)"<br>
| "substName a (x#xs) (T#Ts) =<br>
     (if a = x then T else (substName a xs Ts))"</p>
<p>The (sequential) option will add the missing cases and map them to the <br>
unspecified constant "undefined".</p>
<p>You would only need section 7 from the function tutorial if you function <br>
had a recursion that could fail to terminate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But at the top of the proof obligations I get a goal which seems pretty<br>
unsolvable to me:</p>
<p>/\P x. [|a. x = (a, [], []) ==&gt; P;<br>
         /\xs Ts a xa T. [|length xs = length Ts;<br>
                           x = (a, xa # xs, T # Ts)|] ==&gt; P|]<br>
       ==&gt; P</p>
<p>It seems to be some sort of completeness condition for the function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. And it is unsolvable, because your equations are incomplete. The <br>
(sequential) option will add the remaining patterns, and you get a <br>
better proof obligation. (solvable with the usual "by pat_completeness <br>
auto"). Or, you simply use "fun", which has (sequential) implicit and <br>
does all proofs for you...</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

<p>From: "Roger H." &lt;<a href="mailto:s57076@hotmail.com">s57076@hotmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hallo,</p>
<p>i want to create a datatype that allows me to write functions from a nat subset to another nat subset.<br>
for example i wanna be able to write: </p>
<p>definition f: {1,2,3} =&gt; {4,5} <br>
                     1 --&gt;4,  2--&gt;4, 3--&gt;5</p>
<p>or another one:     </p>
<p>definition g : {6,8} =&gt; {2,3,4}</p>
<p>So the thing i want to somehow parametrize is  "which subset of the nat im using each time as domain and range" ,</p>
<p>I thought about creating a new datatype :    'a nat <br>
The problem with this is that 'a  is instantiated with datatypes, and not sets like {1,2,3}.</p>
<p>Following solutions are bad:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Everytime i want declare a new function, i have to declare by "typedef" the nat subsets i want as domain and range</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>definition f :  "nat =&gt; nat" where<br>
       "f x = (if x : {1,2,3} then ....  else undefined)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This second approach is bad, cause i dont want the domain to be decided as late as the second line of the declaration, cause after this i want to be able to program a selector "domain f"<br>
that returns me the domain of f, thats why i want the domain of f to be somehow incapsulated (parametrized) in the first line "f: nat =&gt;nat " so that i can use it later.</p>
<p>What would you do in this situation?       </p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>
