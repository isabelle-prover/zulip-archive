<p>From: <a href="mailto:Thomas.Sewell@data61.csiro.au">Thomas.Sewell@data61.csiro.au</a><br>
Hello isabelle-users.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about partially-terminating recursive functions a <br>
little over the<br>
last day or two. Here's a silly example:</p>
<p>function<br>
   escalate :: "(nat =&gt; nat) =&gt; nat =&gt; nat =&gt; nat"<br>
where<br>
   "escalate m lim n = (if n &gt;= lim then n else escalate m lim (m n))"<br>
by pat_completeness auto</p>
<p>Obviously this function doesn't always terminate, but perhaps it would if<br>
we first assumed something about the function m, for instance that it <br>
increases<br>
n, or that it increases n on a key subset of the naturals.</p>
<p>I thought I recalled that the function package could be used for this. <br>
If I inspect<br>
the theorems exported by the "function" command above (before any matching<br>
"termination), I see partial simp and induct rules named escalate.psimps<br>
and escalate.pinduct. These are sufficient to prove what we need about the<br>
escalate function, but only within its terminating domain "escalate_dom".</p>
<p>Here's the problem. We have no rules whatsoever with which to prove anything<br>
about "escalate_dom". Everything is hidden. Even the rule <br>
escalate.termination,<br>
which I think I'm meant to use next, is hidden.</p>
<p>Also, escalate.termination is only useful for proving total termination. <br>
To prove that<br>
the function terminates on some limited domain will require some other <br>
strategy.</p>
<p>In short, my recollection that the function package could easily be used for<br>
partially terminating functions was totally wrong. Is there somewhere else<br>
I'm forgetting to look?</p>
<p>In the attached theory, I use some ML-level tricks to "see" the hidden <br>
rules, to see<br>
through the abbreviation "escalate_dom", and to find the theorem <br>
escalate_rel.cases<br>
which I really need.</p>
<p>I also prove a variant of the acc/wf connection from Wellformed which <br>
allows us to<br>
prove that some subset of elements is within the accessible part, using <br>
the regular<br>
wf machinery. This is really needed if we're going to make much progress <br>
here.</p>
<p>Finally I apply that to escalate, and prove a silly case about even numbers.</p>
<p>OK. Is anyone maintaining this? Should the theorem escalate.termination <br>
really<br>
be hidden? Would it be useful to other users to have the function package<br>
expose something else, maybe a ptermination rule analagous to the<br>
termination rule, with which to prove anything about partially terminating<br>
functions?</p>
<p>It seems inconsistent to me that the package exposes these psimp rules but<br>
no way to use them.</p>
<p>Anyway, hope this might be of help to someone.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.<br>

Dear Thomas,</p>

<p>you might need to do some tricks to be able to use the theorems, but<br>
probably not <em>that</em> low level.</p>
<p>The function package exposes the ML function "Function.get_info" to<br>
obtain a bunch of results about a function. "R" is the relation you're<br>
interested in, and "Inductive.the_inductive" will give you info about<br>
that. The resulting theorems can be used in an ML tactic.</p>

<p>Nobody is maintaining this. But it's probably just a matter of removing<br>
some "concealed"s in the code.</p>

Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>It sounds like you want to use (domintros).  For example:</p>
<p>function (domintros) foo  :: "nat ⇒ nat" where<br>
  "foo x = x"<br>
  by pat_completeness auto</p>
<p>thm foo.domintros</p>
<p>Also, see Section 8.2 of the Function package documentation supplied<br>
with Isabelle.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Dominic</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
I agree with Dominic that domintros is probably what you want to use and<br>
that the function package documentation is a good way to start.</p>
<p>Here's how you could use domintros in your particular case:</p>
<p>lemma bounded_nat_gt_induct [case_names base gt]:<br>
  "(⋀n::nat. n ≥ m ⟹ P n) ⟹ (⋀n. n &lt; m ⟹ (⋀n'. n' &gt; n ⟹ P n') ⟹ P n) ⟹ P n"<br>
  by induction_schema (force, rule wf_measure[of "λn. m - n"], auto)</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  assumes "⋀x. x &lt; lim ⟹ m x &gt; x"<br>
  shows   "escalate_dom (m, lim, n)"<br>
proof (induction n rule: bounded_nat_gt_induct [of lim])<br>
  case (base n)<br>
  thus ?case by (auto intro: escalate.domintros)<br>
next<br>
  case (gt n)<br>
  from gt.hyps have "escalate_dom (m, lim, m n)" by (intro gt.IH assms) auto<br>
  thus ?case by (rule escalate.domintros)<br>
qed</p>
<p>There's also the "partial_function" command, which does not care about<br>
termination at all. It has two modes, but the most useful one is<br>
probably that where the function returns an "'a option" and<br>
non-termination returns a "None".</p>

<p>Afterwards, one can prove that the function never returns None<br>
(possibly with some preconditions), and use "the" to get the<br>
corresponding plain function.</p>

<p>From: <a href="mailto:Thomas.Sewell@data61.csiro.au">Thomas.Sewell@data61.csiro.au</a><br>
Thanks for all the replies. Thanks indeed for pointing out Section 8.2<br>
of the long function package document, which indeed seems to suggest<br>
that some of the hidden theorems I've found are canonical for use,<br>
curiously not including f.termination.</p>
<p>Yes, there are workarounds. I can use partial_function, or tailrec mode,<br>
or declare a type of well-behaved inputs, and derive (eventually) the <br>
function<br>
I want. This seems like overkill, however, since the function package <br>
defines<br>
  function exactly as I want by default, it just surprises me by <br>
"hiding" the rules<br>
I needed to proceed.</p>
<p>Yes, I could have inspected the package's ML interface. In principle, <br>
anyway.<br>
I'm embarrassed that I didn't read the manual, but I'm not embarrassed<br>
that I didn't look at the ML level. For other Isabelle packages I've <br>
found the<br>
ML info available to be low-level, verbose, and prone to change with future<br>
revisions.</p>
<p>The "domintros" mode is probably what I was looking for. Now the rules <br>
provided<br>
do actually fully characterise the function. Phew. Honestly, the form of <br>
these rules<br>
is annoying though. They really require me to phrase an inductive proof, <br>
whereas<br>
it feels easier to just supply a well-founded relation and a subdomain <br>
as I did in the<br>
example.</p>
<p>Thanks for the replies everyone.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.</p>
