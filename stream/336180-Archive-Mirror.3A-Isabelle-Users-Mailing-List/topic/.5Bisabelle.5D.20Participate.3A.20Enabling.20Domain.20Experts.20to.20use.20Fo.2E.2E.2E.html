<p>This symposium is motivated by the long-term VISION of making information<br>
systems dependable.  In the past even mis-represented units of<br>
measurements caused fatal ENGINEERING disasters.  In ECONOMICS, the<br>
subtlety of issues involved in good auction design may have led to low<br>
revenues in auctions of public goods such as the 3G radio spectra.<br>
Similarly, banks' value-at-risk (VaR) models – the leading method of<br>
financial risk measurement – are too large and change too quickly to be<br>
thoroughly vetted by hand, the current state of the art; in the London<br>
Whale incident of 2012, JP Morgan claimed that its exposures were $67mn<br>
under one of its VaR models, and $129 under another one.  Verifying a<br>
model's properties requires formally specifying them; for VaR models, any<br>
work would have to start with this most basic step, as regulators' current<br>
desiderata are subjective and ambiguous.</p>
<p>We believe that these problems can be addressed by representing the<br>
knowledge underlying such models and mechanisms in a formal, explicit,<br>
machine-verifiable way.  Contemporary computer science offers a wide<br>
choice of knowledge representation languages well supported by<br>
verification tools.  Such tools have been successfully applied, e.g., for<br>
verifying software that controls commuter rail or payment systems.  Still,<br>
DOMAIN EXPERTS without a strong computer science background find it<br>
challenging to choose the right tools and to use them.  This symposium<br>
aims at investigating ways to support them.  Some problems can be<br>
addressed now, others will bring new challenges to computer science.</p>
<p>THE SYMPOSIUM is designed to bring domain experts and formalisers into<br>
close and fruitful contact with each other: domain experts will be able to<br>
present their fields and problems to formalisers; formalisers will be<br>
exposed to new and challenging problem areas. We will combine talks and<br>
hands-on sessions to ensure close interaction among participants from both<br>
sides.</p>
<p>World-class economists will offer HANDS-ON TUTORIAL SESSIONS on the<br>
following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MATCHING MARKETS (M. Utku Ünver, Boston College): These include matching<br>
  students to schools, interns to hospitals, and kidney donors to<br>
  recipients. See the documentation for the 2012 Nobel Memorial Prize in<br>
  Economic Sciences for more background information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AUCTIONS (Peter Cramton, University of Maryland): Peter has been working<br>
  on auctions for Ofcom UK (4G spectrum auction), the UK Department of the<br>
  Environment and Climate Change, and others – and most recently on the<br>
  “applicant auctions” for the new top-level Internet domains issued by the<br>
  ICANN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FINANCE MARKETS REGULATION (Neels Vosloo, Financial Services Authority,<br>
  UK): It is currently impossible for regulators to properly inspect risk<br>
  management models. Test portfolios are a promising tool for identifying<br>
  problems with risk management models. To what extent can techniques from<br>
  mechanised reasoning automate some of the inspection process?</p>
</li>
</ul>
