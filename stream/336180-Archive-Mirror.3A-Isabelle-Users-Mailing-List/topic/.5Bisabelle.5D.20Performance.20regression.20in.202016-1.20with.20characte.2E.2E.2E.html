<p>From: Florian Haftmann &lt;<a href="mailto:florian.haftmann@informatik.tu-muenchen.de">florian.haftmann@informatik.tu-muenchen.de</a>&gt;<br>
In 96015aecfeba I have addressed this by a dedicated simproc for<br>
equality on characters.  This should be possible to be ported into a<br>
separate theory for Isabelle2016-1.</p>
<p>From the same changeset it can be seen that other tools reyling on<br>
concrete string values like state spaces use to provide their own proof<br>
devices for that.</p>
<p>The deeper reason behind this seems to be that simp rules tailored for<br>
abstract symbolic reasoning are often not suitable for calculating with<br>
concrete values and vice versa.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the most elegant solution, a simproc or simp rules for<br>
congruences »num1 mod num3 = num1 mod num2« did not work out since there<br>
are two many other rules and simprocs interfering with mod.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

<p>From: <a href="mailto:Thomas.Sewell@data61.csiro.au">Thomas.Sewell@data61.csiro.au</a><br>
Sorry I haven't been around for this discussion.</p>
<p>Thanks Florian for the patch. We've also found a similar fix, we'll <br>
adopt one or<br>
the other locally until the next release.</p>
<p>About Makarius' question:</p>
<p>Since such<br>
post-release problems of users have happened routinely in recent years,<br>
I would like to know what can be done about it.</p>
<p>It's worth thinking about this. Ideally we'd see releases go out with no <br>
problems<br>
remaining in them.</p>
<p>However, the only strategy that has been considered yet is to wait long <br>
enough<br>
during the pre-release phase for all "serious users" to update their <br>
proofs. I don't<br>
think we're going to be able to do that. On this occasion, we had a <br>
volunteer, and the<br>
INCOMPATIBILITY level wasn't so bad (the changes to supremum sets being <br>
the worst<br>
offenders), and still, we finished the update process shortly after the <br>
release became<br>
official. This was a good release. In previous releases we've been <br>
preoccupied with<br>
other things, and have stayed on the previous Isabelle version for months.</p>
<p>Another possible strategy would be to split Isabelle releases between <br>
compatible<br>
releases (new features, PIDE extensions etc) and incompatible releases<br>
(INCOMPATIBILITY allowed). "Serious users" could then do push-button <br>
tests and<br>
offer feedback on all compatible releases. This is known to be a reasonable<br>
strategy, since it's what pretty much every mature system out there does,<br>
but it's probably too much to hope that Isabelle development would change<br>
so substantially.</p>
<p>We can also suggest particular test cases that match the kinds of <br>
problems we<br>
have locally. For instance, it's obvious that we could stress-test <br>
string comparisons<br>
with a fairly short theory, and contribute that as a test case. Likewise <br>
our problems<br>
with large records. But it's a lot of work to discover an essential test <br>
case.<br>
For this release, it took three of us most of a day to<br>
narrow down the performance problems we were seeing from polymorphic <br>
constants<br>
on C-types to the simple issue of string comparison.</p>
<p>Anyway, if anyone else has any bright ideas how we can help, we'd be <br>
happy to.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
    Thomas.</p>

This sounds like requiring 5-10 more manpower behind Isabelle<br>
development and release process.</p>
<p>Even just having "patch levels" with small amendments for published<br>
releases (as done for Coq), already requires significant extra time.</p>
<p>Isabelle releases do not even have version numbers: every release is a<br>
consolidated state of ongoing linear development. In the past, the<br>
consolidation required 2-3 weeks, but we are now approaching 6-8 weeks<br>
(with relatively little happening in that long time).</p>

Usually there are a couple of weeks’ notice before the pre-release phase even starts… couldn’t at least some users choose that time to download the current development version to take a look at how it might affect their work?</p>

The full schedule for the Isabelle2016-1 release is recorded here:<br>
<a href="http://sketis.net/2016/release-candidates-for-isabelle2016-1">http://sketis.net/2016/release-candidates-for-isabelle2016-1</a></p>
<p>The informal snapshot Isabelle2016-1-RC0 was published 07-Oct-2016, i.e.<br>
9.5 weeks before the final release (13-Dec-2016). RC0 is really just an<br>
informal preview.</p>
<p>The point to hop on a new release for professional users is RC1, or RC2<br>
at the latest. There can be a tradeoff: getting on the train earlier<br>
could mean more work to figure out remaining problems of the release<br>
candidate, getting on the train tool late could mean that some<br>
inconvenience have to remain in the release.</p>
<p>My impression is that we've had again the second case several times:<br>
notable problems were discovered too late and there was no realistic<br>
change to revisit them.</p>

<p>From: <a href="mailto:Thomas.Sewell@data61.csiro.au">Thomas.Sewell@data61.csiro.au</a><br>
Hello Isabelle users, developers.</p>
<p>We've noticed a serious performance regression involving characters and <br>
strings in Isabelle-2016-1.</p>
<p>This can be demonstrated as follows:</p>
<p>lemma "''ab'' ~= ''ba''"<br>
   using [[simp_trace]]<br>
   by simp</p>
<p>In earlier Isabelle versions, it takes a few dozen steps to prove this <br>
rule. In 2016-1, the characters<br>
are compared by expanding rule Char_eq_Char_iff which requires <br>
normalising "k mod 256" for<br>
various k, which takes many many steps.</p>
<p>One workaround we tested is to adjust the simpset to ensure that the <br>
code rules nat_of_char_code<br>
and integer_of_char_simps are used, which solves the problem.</p>
<p>The C typing framework used by the seL4 proofs, Cogent proofs, <br>
AutoCorres etc, uses strings to<br>
encode field names and type identifiers. The impact of this change is <br>
big enough to explode the<br>
time to parse seL4 into Isabelle by a factor of 4 or more. There are <br>
also some other string users<br>
around.</p>
<p>We're sorry we didn't notice how significant the impact was until after <br>
the release.</p>
<p>For the moment we'll patch around this by adjusting the simpset at our <br>
end. The Isabelle version<br>
should probably be adjusted as well though.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

<p>I don’t think there is much that can be done from the release side. 7 weeks is a good period for testing for “normal” users, but it is not a lot of time to update &gt; 500kloc of proof from one Isabelle release to another when there are too many other pressing things to do. We did manage to test functionality in time, but not performance, and that was mostly a function of what testing hardware we had available on our end (a particular bottleneck this year).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Might be an idea, but currently not necessary, at least not for us :-) It’s relatively easy to change things on our side, it would just have been nicer for the rest of the community if we had managed to find the problem earlier. Maybe nobody else needs that many string comparisons — the performance regression didn’t seem to show up in a major way in the AFP or distribution after all.</p>
