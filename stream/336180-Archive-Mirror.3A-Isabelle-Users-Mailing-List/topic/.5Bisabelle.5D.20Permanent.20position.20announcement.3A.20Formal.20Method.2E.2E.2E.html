<p>From: David MENTRE &lt;<a href="mailto:dmentre@linux-france.org">dmentre@linux-france.org</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>Our research laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric R&amp;D Centre Europe, has <br>
opened a permanent position of Formal Methods Research Engineer. We are <br>
looking for a young researcher knowing well one or more formal methods <br>
(and associated tools) to work on applying formal methods to industrial <br>
systems and software of Mitsubishi Electric group <br>
(<a href="http://www.mitsubishielectric.com/products/">http://www.mitsubishielectric.com/products/</a>).</p>
<p>We are using various formalisms (Deductive Verification, Model Checking, <br>
Refinement, Abstract Interpretation, ...) applied to very diverse <br>
domains (Rail, Factory Automation, Automotive, ...). Mitsubishi Electric <br>
group has a lot of interesting cases to work on and where formal methods <br>
could make a real difference!</p>
<p>Our research is applied to concrete industrial case studies which have <br>
interesting research challenges. As we are part of corporate R&amp;D, we <br>
have less constraints than business units and make publications and <br>
prototypes or participate to collaborative research projects like any <br>
academic research laboratory. In my view, this is the best of both <br>
worlds. :-)</p>
<p>Our laboratory is located in Rennes <br>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennes</a>), France, a not-so-big city very <br>
nice to live in.</p>
<p>So if you are a researcher fond of formal methods (and you are because <br>
you are reading this message ;-) ) and think they can make a real and <br>
positive impact on society, join us and help us!</p>
<p>If you know somebody that could be interested by this position, let <br>
her/him know, thank you!</p>
<p>Feel free to publicly or privately ask questions if needed.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,<br>
D. Mentré</p>
