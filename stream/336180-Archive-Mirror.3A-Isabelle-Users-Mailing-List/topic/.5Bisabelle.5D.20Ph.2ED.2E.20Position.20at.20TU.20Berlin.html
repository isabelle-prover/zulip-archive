Ph.D. Position in Research Project at TU Berlin on<br>
Verification and Transformation of Embedded Systems (VATES)<br>
Prof. Dr. Sabine Glesner, Technical University of Berlin</p>
<hr>
<p>The aim of the VATES project, funded by the German Research Foundation <br>
(DFG), is the development of methods for the construction and <br>
verification of embedded real-time systems. Besides the complexity of <br>
such systems, a particular challenge is to cope with concurrency aspects <br>
and real-time requirements. A distinguishing feature of the VATES <br>
project is that we consider the whole development chain from abstract <br>
specifications through source code down to compiler-generated executable <br>
machine code. To ensure the correctness of our proofs and to gain a high <br>
degree of automatization, the verification is carried out with machine <br>
assistance, especially model checkers, SAT/SMT-solvers, and mechanical <br>
provers (like the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL).</p>
<p>In the first phase of the VATES project, we developed a novel approach <br>
that allows us to formally relate an abstract process-algebraic <br>
specification formulated in the timed process calculus Timed CSP with <br>
its implementation given in the LLVM compiler intermediate <br>
representation. Using this relation, we are able to verify safety, <br>
liveness, and timing properties on the level of Timed CSP and transfer <br>
them to the level of executable code.</p>
<p>In the second phase of VATES, we extend our methodology in two <br>
directions. First, we aim at supporting the verification of multicore <br>
systems, which are more and more used in the context of embedded <br>
systems. To this end, we include directives that guide the <br>
transformation for multicore target architectures into our methodology <br>
on the specification level. These can then be exploited in subsequent <br>
verification steps. Second, our methodology is extended such that <br>
adaptive systems (which dynamically restructure themselves in changing <br>
environments) can be specified, verified, and transformed into <br>
executable, semantically equivalent code.</p>
<p>As a case study, we use the embedded real-time operating system BOSS, <br>
which was developed by Fraunhofer FIRST (Berlin). It is employed, for <br>
example, in satellites, medical applications and an electronic lottery <br>
system. Furthermore, it is well suited for verification purposes because <br>
of its comparatively simple structure and its relatively small size. In <br>
this phase, BOSS is extended to support multicore architectures and to <br>
directly include mechanisms that support adaptivity. Based on this, the <br>
methods to be developed are evaluated in the context of a <br>
practice-relevant case study.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Technical University of Berlin is seeking for a researcher who will <br>
carry out research on methods for the design and verification of <br>
safety-critical real-time systems in the VATES project. The applicant <br>
should hold a Master's degree or equivalent in computer science, <br>
mathematics or similar field of study. The project will run for <br>
approximately 3 years and provides the opportunity to receive a Ph.D. <br>
during this period. To ensure equality of opportunity between men and <br>
women, applications from women with the relevant qualification are <br>
encouraged. Handicapped people with equal qualifications will be preferred.</p>
