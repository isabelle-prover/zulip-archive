Ph.D. Research Project at ETH Zurich on<br>
Security Modeling and Analysis in Cyber-physical Systems<br>
Prof. David Basin and Prof. Srdjan Capkun, ETH Zurich</p>
<p>Cyber-physical systems are systems in which computational and physical<br>
elements are tightly coupled. Due to this coupling, their failure can<br>
have catastrophic health, safety, environmental, or economic<br>
consequences. For example, the failure of a power distribution network<br>
can leave parts of a country or continent without<br>
electricity. Cyber-physical systems operate in increasingly adversarial<br>
environments where they are subject to targeted attacks.  Hence these<br>
systems are part of our critical infrastructures and must be protected<br>
from both unintentionally and intentionally induced failures.</p>
<p>ETH Zurich, together with ABB Corporate Research in Switzerland, is<br>
seeking to hire a researcher who will carry out research on methods for<br>
the design and analysis of security architectures for the security of<br>
electricity (power) grid systems.  This includes: developing foundations<br>
for modeling the structure and behavior of cyber-physical systems,<br>
developing models of existing and planned power grid systems, developing<br>
techniques to support the analysis of models (e.g., carrying out risk<br>
analysis), and validating the approach taken through case studies.</p>
<p>The project will run for approximately 3 years and provides the<br>
possibility of carrying out a Ph.D. during this period. As part of this<br>
project, the Ph.D. student will spend time at ABB learning about the<br>
systems under consideration and state-of-the-art approaches to their<br>
design and analysis.</p>
<p>The PhD student will be a paid employee of ETH Zurich. Salary and<br>
employment conditions are attractive. ETH Zurich regulations require<br>
doctoral students to hold a Master's or equivalent degree (e.g. Diplom).</p>
<p>Zurich is a diverse and multicultural city, which is consistently rated<br>
among the best cities in the world in which to live. We favor the same<br>
sort of diversity that defines Zurich's cultural makeup and encourage<br>
anyone matching the profile above to apply, regardless of where you  <br>
are from.</p>
<p>Applications should include a curriculum vitae, a brief description of<br>
research interests, transcripts of grades, and, if possible,<br>
publications, and letters of recommendation from teachers or<br>
employers. Applications and inquiries should be sent by email to:<br>
<a href="mailto:infsec.positions@inf.ethz.ch">infsec.positions@inf.ethz.ch</a></p>
<p>ETH Zurich specifically encourages women to apply with a view towards<br>
increasing the proportion of female researchers.</p>
