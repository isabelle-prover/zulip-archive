<p>Applications are invited for a PhD student position in Computer<br>
Science at Uppsala University, Sweden. The position is partly funded<br>
through a Microsoft Research PhD scholarship, and includes benefits<br>
such as a PhD summer school organised by Microsoft Research Cambridge.<br>
Research will be carried out in the context of a collaboration between<br>
Uppsala University and Microsoft Research Cambridge.</p>

<p>Subject Area</p>
<hr>
<p>SMT solvers are constraint solvers that combine highly efficient<br>
reasoning about Boolean logic with decision procedures for domains<br>
like linear arithmetic, bit-vectors, or arrays. SMT solvers form the<br>
backbone of many of today's verification systems, responsible for<br>
discharging verification conditions that encode correctness properties<br>
of hardware or software designs. Other application areas of SMT<br>
solvers include mechanised mathematical reasoning, operations<br>
research, compilation techniques, or malware detection.</p>
<p>Quantifier treatment in SMT is usually implemented by means of<br>
instantiation heuristics. For verification and other applications,<br>
efficient handling of quantifiers has been identified as one of the<br>
main challenges in the development of solvers. The topic of this PhD<br>
research is the extension of the SMT paradigm to the first-order<br>
level, by including quantifiers as first-class citizens in<br>
solvers. This will be done by combining central SMT concepts, in<br>
particular the architecturing of SMT solvers as the combination of<br>
little, domain-specific engines, with techniques developed in the<br>
context of first-order logic, in particular delayed quantifier<br>
instantiation by means of free variables and unification. The research<br>
will partly build on tools previously developed in the Uppsala<br>
University and Microsoft Research, including the theorem provers Z3<br>
and Princess.</p>
<p>Research Environment</p>
<hr>
<p>The Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University has a<br>
leading position in research as well as teaching at all levels. The<br>
Department has about 200 employees, including 80 senior faculty and 80<br>
PhD students. More than 3000 students are enrolled in one or more<br>
courses annually.</p>
<p>Founded in 1991, Microsoft Research has become one of the largest,<br>
fastest-growing, most respected software research organizations in the<br>
world. The Microsoft Research Cambridge branch was set up in July<br>
1997, and today hosts over 100 researchers, mostly from Europe.</p>
<p>Qualifications Required</p>
<hr>
<p>The candidates should have a Master of Science in Computer Science,<br>
Computer Engineering, or equivalent. Experience in mathematical logic,<br>
automated reasoning, and formal methods are desirable, as are good<br>
implementation skills.</p>
<p>The positions are for a maximum of five years and include departmental<br>
duties at a level of at most 20% (typically teaching) as well as<br>
course studies. You will be expected to teach in Swedish or<br>
English. Excellent skills in spoken and written English are an<br>
absolute requirement.</p>
<p>The department is striving to achieve a more equal gender balance and<br>
female candidates are particularly invited to apply.<br>
