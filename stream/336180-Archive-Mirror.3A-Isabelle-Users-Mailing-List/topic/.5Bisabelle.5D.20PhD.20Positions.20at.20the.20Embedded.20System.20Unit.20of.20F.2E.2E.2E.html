<p>Deadlines:  May 31, 2008</p>
<p>The Embedded System Research Unit (<a href="http://es.fbk.eu">http://es.fbk.eu</a>) of the Bruno<br>
Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy, is seeking several candidates for Ph.D<br>
positions.</p>
<p>The Ph.D. studies will be held at the International Doctorate School<br>
in Information and Communication Technologies<br>
(<a href="http://www.ict.unitn.it/">http://www.ict.unitn.it/</a>) of the University of Trento, Italy.</p>
<p>The research activity will be carried out within the Embedded Systems<br>
Unit of the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the<br>
Fondazione Bruno Kessler.</p>
<p>The research activity will aim at techniques, methodologies and support<br>
tools for the design and verification of embedded systems. In<br>
particular, possible topics will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embedded Software Design and Verification</li>
<li>Formal Requirements Analysis</li>
<li>Design and Verification of Hybrid and Timed systems</li>
</ul>
<p>The selected candidates will be initially enrolled in a stage and, if<br>
they pass the selection of the Ph.D. school, they will be enrolled as<br>
Ph.D. students. Ph.D. courses will start in Autumn 2008, and the<br>
thesis must be completed in three or four years. People enrolled in a<br>
stage and subsequent Ph.D. courses are expected to move to Trento, and<br>
will receive monetary support during both phases of their activity.</p>
<p>Candidate Profile<br>
=================</p>
<p>The ideal candidate should have an MS or equivalent degree in computer<br>
science, mathematics or electronic engineering, and combine solid<br>
theoretical background and software development skills.</p>
<p>The candidate should be able to work in a collaborative environment,<br>
with a strong commitment to reaching research excellence and achieving<br>
assigned objectives.</p>
<p>Background knowledge and/or previous experience in the following<br>
areas, though not mandatory, will be considered favorably:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symbolic Model Checking,</li>
<li>Propositional Satisfiability,</li>
<li>Satisfiability Modulo Theory,</li>
<li>Constraint Solving and Optimization,</li>
<li>Formal Requirements Analysis,</li>
<li>Software Verification,</li>
<li>Software Synthesis,</li>
<li>
<p>Embedded System Design Languages (e.g. Verilog, VHDL, System C, and<br>
     System Verilog),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safety Analysis (FTA, FMEA).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications and Inquiries<br>
==========================</p>
<p>Interested candidates should inquire for further information and/or<br>
apply by sending email to &lt;jobs[at]fbk[dot]eu&gt;.</p>
<p>Applications should contain a statement of interest, with a Curriculum<br>
Vitae, and three reference persons. PDF format is strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>Emails will be automatically processed and should have</p>
<p>'RIF: ES/phd'</p>
<p>as subject.</p>
<p>The Embedded System Research Unit<br>
=================================</p>
<p>The Embedded Systems Unit consists of about 15 persons, including<br>
researchers, post-Doc, Ph.D. students, and programmers. The<br>
Unit carries out research, tool development and technology transfer in<br>
the fields of design and verification of embedded systems.</p>
<p>Current research directions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory, and its application to the<br>
     verification of hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid<br>
     systems (Verilog, SystemC, C/C++, StateFlow/Simulink)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal Requirements Analysis based on techniques for temporal logics<br>
     (consistency checking, vacuity detection, input determinism,<br>
     cause-effect analysis, realizability and synthesis)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal Safety Analysis, based on the integration of traditional<br>
     techniques (e.g. Fault-tree analysis, FMEA) with symbolic<br>
     verification techniques.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The unit develops and maintains several tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the NuSMV symbolic model checker (<a href="http://nusmv.fbk.eu">http://nusmv.fbk.eu</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the MathSAT SMT solver (<a href="http://mathsat.fbk.eu">http://mathsat.fbk.eu</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Formal Safety Analysis Platform FSAP (<a href="http://fsap.fbk.eu">http://fsap.fbk.eu</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Requirements Analysis Tool RAT (<a href="http://rat.fbk.eu">http://rat.fbk.eu</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The unit is currently involved in several research projects, funded by<br>
the European Union (FP VI and FP VII), the European Space Agency, the<br>
European Railway Agency, as well as in industrial technology transfer<br>
projects. The projects aim at applying research results to key<br>
application domains such as space, avionics, railways, hardware design<br>
and mobile embedded applications.</p>
<p>The Embedded Systems Unit is part of Fondazione Bruno Kessler,<br>
formerly Istituto Trentino di Cultura, a public research institute of<br>
the Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy), founded in 1976. The<br>
institute, through its center for the scientific and technological<br>
research, is active in the areas of Information Technology,<br>
Microsystems, and Physical Chemistry of Surfaces and<br>
Interfaces. Today, FBK is an internationally recognized research<br>
institute, collaborating with industries, universities, and public and<br>
private laboratories in Italy and abroad. The institute's applied and<br>
basic research activities aim at resolving real-world problems, driven<br>
by the need for technological innovation in society and industry.</p>
<p>Location<br>
========</p>
<p>Trento is a lively town of about 100.000 inhabitants, located 130 km<br>
south of the border between Italy and Austria. It is well known for<br>
the beauty of its mountains and lakes, and it offers the possibility<br>
to practice a wide range of sports. Trento enjoys a rich cultural and<br>
historical heritage, and it is the ideal starting point for day trips<br>
to famous towns such as Venice or Verona, as well as to enjoy great<br>
naturalistic journeys. Detailed information about Trento and its<br>
region can be found at <a href="http://www.trentino.to/home/index.html?_lang=en">http://www.trentino.to/home/index.html?_lang=en</a>.</p>
