<p>The application deadline is 2012-12-12. Please pass this on to<br>
interested students.</p>

<p>PhD student positions in Functional Programming</p>
<p>The Department has 76 faculty members and enrolls about 70 PhD<br>
students from more than 30 countries. The research spans the whole<br>
spectrum, from theoretical underpinnings to applied systems<br>
development. There is extensive national and international<br>
collaboration with academia and industry all around the world.</p>
<p>Information about the division</p>
<p>The Functional Programming group at Chalmers is a world-leading<br>
research group with an outstanding track record in research, and an<br>
excellent network of collaborators in both academia and industry. The<br>
group has done ground breaking work in embedded domain specific<br>
languages (DSLs) and in software testing (where work on QuickCheck has<br>
been hugely influential both inside and outside the functional<br>
programming community). We are collaborating with Ericsson to develop<br>
Feldspar, a DSL for Digital Signal Processing algorithm development.<br>
We are also working on DSLs for programming GPUs and for FPGA<br>
programming. We have obtained a large grant from the Swedish Strategic<br>
Research Agency to work on Resource Aware Functional Programming, and<br>
this project brings together DSLs and testing. It also allows us to<br>
have a steady flow of interesting visitors. In a new EU project,<br>
PROWESS, we will work on new techniques for modelling and<br>
property-based testing in web services. We also have a strong interest<br>
in automated theorem proving. With four professors and five assistant<br>
professors, the group enjoys critical mass, and provides the ideal<br>
research environment for doctoral studies in Functional Programming.</p>
<p>Job description</p>
<p>The PhD students will join the Functional Programming group and<br>
contribute to its research in the general area of Functional<br>
Programming. The selection of specific research projects for the<br>
present positions will take into account both the interests of the new<br>
students and the research agenda of the group. There will be ample<br>
opportunities for collaboration with the group's academic and<br>
industrial contacts.</p>
<p>The job is a full time employment, limited to five years. 80% of the<br>
working time is devoted to research studies, and the remaining 20% to<br>
other duties, mainly teaching. It is expected that the student will<br>
obtain the PhD within the five-year period.</p>
<p>Qualifications</p>
<p>Applicants should have a Master’s Degree or corresponding (Sw.<br>
civilingenjörsexamen) in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or in<br>
a related discipline. Strong research interest and relevant research<br>
track record must be well documented in the application. A genuine<br>
interest and curiosity in Functional Programming and excellent<br>
analytical and communication skills, orally as well as literally, are<br>
needed.</p>
<p>In particular, we welcome applicants with documented interest in<br>
domain-specific languages, software testing and specification, or<br>
automated theorem proving.</p>
<p>You may apply even though you might not have completed your degree<br>
yet, but expect to do so before the position starts. Knowledge of<br>
Swedish is not a prerequisite for applying since English is our<br>
working language for research, and we publish internationally. Both<br>
Swedish and English are used in undergraduate courses. Half of our<br>
researchers and PhD students at the department come from more than 30<br>
different countries.</p>
