<p>From: Cezary Kaliszyk &lt;<a href="mailto:cezarykaliszyk@gmail.com">cezarykaliszyk@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
We invite applications for PhD student and PostDoctoral researcher<br>
positions (3 years) funded by the Austrian Science Fund project<br>
"Interactive Proof: Proof Translation, Premise Selection, Rewriting"<br>
at the Computational Logic research group of the Institute of Computer<br>
Science at the University of Innsbruck.</p>
<p>The deadline for applications is 15th of December; the project starts<br>
1 February 2014; but a later starting date can be negotiated.</p>
<p>The main goal of the project is to create and further develop techniques<br>
and tools for using automated approaches in interactive proof systems in<br>
order to allow the mechanical construction of proofs that can be<br>
computer-verified.  The project intends to develop and provide: a) proof<br>
translation between various logics and external first and higher order<br>
ATPs (automated theorem provers); b) stronger machine learning-based<br>
premise selection; c) automatic deriving and simplifying terminating and<br>
confluent rewrite databases for the interactive proof systems.</p>
<p>The project is to be conducted in the Computational Logic group of the<br>
Institute of Computer Science at the University of Innsbruck.<br>
The research group is mainly concerned with the logical foundations of<br>
computer science and their application to the analysis of complex<br>
systems. Our current work involves verification of algorithms and<br>
research on complexity, as well as term rewriting.</p>
<p>Candidates for a PhD position must hold a MSc in computer science or<br>
mathematics and candidates for the postdoctoral position hold a PhD<br>
degree in computer science or mathematics. A background in<br>
computational logic (proof assistants, functional programming, term<br>
rewriting), as well as machine learning is an advantage.</p>
<p>Knowledge of German is not required, as the group is international and<br>
the language of communication is English.</p>
<p>Salary is paid according to the FWF funding scheme: for a postdoctoral<br>
researcher (40 hours) approximately EUR 47,000 per year (gross), and<br>
for a PhD student (30 hours) EUR 27,000 per year (gross).</p>
<p>Send applications including CV and two references to Cezary Kaliszyk<br>
(<a href="mailto:cezary.kaliszyk@uibk.ac.at">cezary.kaliszyk@uibk.ac.at</a>) no later than 15 December 2013. Applicants<br>
for the PostDoc position should also send a brief research statement.<br>
Informal inquiries are welcome via the same email address.</p>
<p>The city of Innsbruck, which hosted the Olympic Winter Games in 1964,<br>
1976 and 2012 (YOG), is superbly located in the beautiful surroundings<br>
of the Tyrolean Alps. The combination of the Alpine environment and<br>
urban life in this historic town provides a high quality of living.</p>

city of Innsbruck can be found at:</p>
