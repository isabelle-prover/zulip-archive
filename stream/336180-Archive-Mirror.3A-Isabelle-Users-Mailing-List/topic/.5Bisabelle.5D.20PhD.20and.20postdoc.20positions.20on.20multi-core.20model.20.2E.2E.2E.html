<p>From: Dragan Bosnacki &lt;<a href="mailto:dbosnack@yahoo.com">dbosnack@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br>
The Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) has the <br>
following vacancy: <br>
<br>
One PhD position on the project<br>
"Efficient Multi-Core Model Checking" (V50.122) <br>
<br>
Project description <br>
<br>
Model checking is one of the most successful formal <br>
techniques for automated analysis and finding errors in <br>
software and hardware. Nowadays, model checking is used by <br>
major companies, like Microsoft and Intel, to improve the <br>
quality of their products. <br>
<br>
The aim of this project is to develop algorithms for model <br>
checking (including probabilistic model checking) that can <br>
fully exploit the parallelism of the new generations of <br>
multi- and many-core processors. The main bottleneck in <br>
practical applications of model checking is the state <br>
space explosion that has impact on the required memory and <br>
run-time. Therefore, we will strive towards designing <br>
efficient algorithms that are compatible with the major<br>
techniques for state space reduction, like partial-order or <br>
symmetry reduction. <br>
<br>
We intend to develop prototype implementations of the new <br>
algorithms In model checkers, like Spin and its <br>
extensions, as well as the probabilistic model checker <br>
MRMC. The prototype implementations will be validated on <br>
case studies including models of biological systems. <br>
<br>
As PhD Student, you will: <br>
<br>
     * perform scientific research; <br>
     * work on the implementation of (prototype) tools; <br>
     * present results at international conferences; <br>
     * publish results in conference proceedings and <br>
scientific journals; <br>
     * write a Ph.D. thesis; <br>
     * participate in activities of the group and of the <br>
department. <br>
<br>
<br>
Requirements <br>
<br>
We are looking for a candidate who meets the following <br>
requirements: <br>
<br>
     * a MSc degree in Computer Science or equivalent; <br>
     * a solid theoretical background (preferably in model <br>
checking or <br>
       other formal methods); <br>
     * interest and experience in programming (especially <br>
experience in parallel and/or distributed computing will <br>
be considered an advantage); <br>
     * good communication- and writing skills in English. <br>
<br>
<br>
Working Environment, Appointment and Salary <br>
<br>
The project will be implemented as cooperation of several <br>
departments and groups. The Software Engineering and <br>
Technology group, headed by prof. dr. Mark van den Brand <br>
at the M&amp;CS department of TU/e, focuses on maintaining <br>
consistency between models and code. Also, part of the <br>
work within the project will be done in the group of prof. <br>
dr. Joost-Pieter Katoen at RWTH Aachen University. Prof. <br>
Katoen has internationally recognized competence in the <br>
field of formal specification and verification of <br>
probabilistic systems. Biologically inspired case <br>
studies will be provided by the Biomodeling and <br>
Bioinformatics group of prof. dr. Peter Hilbers, who is <br>
also an expert on parallel algorithms and has an <br>
outstanding record in applications of parallel computing <br>
in biology. Most of the tool implementations will be done <br>
in close collaboration with the Laboratory for Quality <br>
Software at the M&amp;CS at TU/e. <br>
<br>
We offer: <br>
<br>
     * a full-time employment for 4 years with an <br>
intermediate evaluation <br>
       after 1 year; <br>
     * a stimulating scientific environment with <br>
international cooperation <br>
<br>
     * access to modern equipment (multi- and many-core <br>
systems, computer clusters) <br>
     * a salary of Euro 2,042 per month (gross) in the <br>
first year, <br>
       increasing to Euro 2,612 per month (gross) in the <br>
fourth year. <br>
       Moreover 8% holiday allowance and 8.3 % End-of-year <br>
bonus is <br>
       provided annually; <br>
     * Support with your personal development and career <br>
planning; <br>
     * Attractive secondary labour conditions (including <br>
excellent work facilities, child care, sports facilities). <br>
