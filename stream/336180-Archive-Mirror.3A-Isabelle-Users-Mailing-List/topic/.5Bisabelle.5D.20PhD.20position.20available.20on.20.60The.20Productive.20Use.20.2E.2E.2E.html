<p>From: Gudmund Grov &lt;<a href="mailto:ggrov@staffmail.ed.ac.uk">ggrov@staffmail.ed.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
--- apologies for multiple postings ---</p>
<p>The mathematical reasoning research group in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh <br>
is advertising for a PhD funded by the EPSRC project "AI4FM: Using AI to aid automation of proof search <br>
in Formal Methods". The proposed topic of the PhD is "The Productive Use of Failure in Formal Methods".</p>
<p>** DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The task allocated to this PhD will be to analyse ways in which proof attempts fail and are subsequently repaired.<br>
This analysis will be realised in a generic, strategy language for describing and classifying common forms of failure<br>
and repair. The strategy language will, in turn, be used, firstly, to describe how experts recover from failure and, <br>
secondly, to guide recovery during automated proof search of related proofs. Example failed proofs will be harvested <br>
from (a) the data from the toolset of Rodin formal methods system, (b) the manual, expert proof attempts on source <br>
theorems and (c) failed applications to target theorems of proof strategies abstracted from manual expert proofs of<br>
source theorems. Examples of repaired proof attempts will be harvested from the expert's work on failures of both <br>
types (b) and (c). This work will enhance the abilities of our prototype so it can benefit from initially failed proof <br>
attempts as well as successful ones.</p>
<p>** DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY </p>
<p>A challenging project that requires mathematical sophistication, analytic skills and creativity in constructing the strategy language.</p>
<p>** BACKGROUND NEEDED</p>
<p>A background in mathematics, logic or formal methods is required to provide the necessary mathematical maturity to undertake this project.</p>

<p>** ABOUT THE RESEARCH INSTITUTION AND RESEARCH GROUP</p>
<p>The Edinburgh School of Informatics obtained the highest volume of 4* activity in its unit of assessment in<br>
RAE 2008. It contains world-class research groups in the areas of theoretical computer science, artificial<br>
intelligence and cognitive science.</p>
<p>The Mathematical Reasoning Group in the School of Informatics has been engaged on the computational<br>
analysis, development and application of mathematical reasoning processes and their interactions since the<br>
mid 1970s (<a href="http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/">http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/</a>). Its work is characterised by its unique blend of computational theory<br>
with artificial intelligence. It has pioneered work on proof planning, tactic learning, and ontology construction<br>
and evolution.</p>
