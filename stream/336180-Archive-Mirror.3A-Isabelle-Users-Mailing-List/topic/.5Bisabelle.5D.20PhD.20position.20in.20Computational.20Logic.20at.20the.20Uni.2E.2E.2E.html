PhD position in Computational Logic at the University of Innsbruck<br>
==================================================================</p>
<p>The research group computational logic headed by Prof. Aart Middeldorp<br>
at the university of Innsbruck has an open position for a PhD student<br>
which is funded by the FWF (Austrian science fund) via the project<br>
"Improving Certifiers for Termination Proofs".</p>
<p>The project aims at increasing the reliability in current termination<br>
provers by independently checking the generated proofs. To this end,<br>
several termination techniques will be developed in the theorem prover<br>
Isabelle/HOL, in combination with executable functions which check<br>
for the correct application of these techniques.</p>
<p>For this project, we are looking for an enthusiastic young researcher<br>
with a background in formal methods. Knowledge of term rewriting and<br>
theorem proving would be an asset. Candidates with a strong theoretical<br>
background in related areas are also encouraged to apply. The ideal<br>
candidate furthermore enjoys the opportunity of working with students<br>
at all levels. The candidate must have a Master's or equivalent degree<br>
(Diplom). Knowledge of German is an advantage but not essential.</p>
<p>The preferred starting date is Oktober 1, 2010.</p>
<p>The annual gross salary of the position (30 hours research per week)<br>
is approximately EUR 25,915, where additional salary can be gained<br>
via teaching.</p>
<p>Applications (including CV) may be mailed to the project leader<br>
René Thiemann no later than September 12, 2010, preferably by email:</p>
<p>Dr. René Thiemann<br>

Techniker Str. 21a<br>

Email: <a href="mailto:rene.thiemann@uibk.ac.at">rene.thiemann@uibk.ac.at</a></p>
<p>Informal inquiries are also welcome via email.</p>
<p>The city of Innsbruck, which hosted the Olympic Winter Games in 1964 and<br>
1976, is superbly located in the beautiful surroundings of the Tyrolean<br>
Alps. The combination of the Alpine environment and urban life in this<br>
historic town provides a high quality of living. The University of<br>
Innsbruck has a long tradition dating back to the 16th century and  <br>
offers<br>
a wide spectrum of research and teaching activities with interesting<br>
opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
