<p>PhD Position on Formal Verification of Deadlock Avoidance Mechanisms  <br>
in NoCs</p>
<p>The Informatics for Technical Applications group at the Radboud  <br>
University Nijmegen invites applications for a PhD position in the  <br>
context of the NWO project "Formal Verification of Deadlock Avoidance  <br>
Mechanisms" (see <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~julien/Julien%20at%20Nijmegen/">http://www.cs.ru.nl/~julien/Julien%20at%20Nijmegen/</a> <br>
FVDAM.html).</p>
<p>The Radboud University Nijmegen is one of the leading academic  <br>
communities in the Netherlands. Renowned for its green campus, modern  <br>
buildings, and state-of-the-art equipment, it has nine faculties and  <br>
enrolls over 17.500 students in approximately 90 study programs. The  <br>
university is situated in the oldest Dutch city, close to the German  <br>
border, on the banks of the river Waal (a branch of the Rhine). The  <br>
city has a rich history and one of the liveliest city centers in the  <br>
Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Informatics for Technical Applications (ITA) group is part of the  <br>
Institute for Computing and Information Sciences (ICIS). The group  <br>
develops formal methods and tools for the specification, design,  <br>
analysis and testing of embedded systems, distributed algorithms and  <br>
protocols, and assesses and demonstrates the effectiveness of these  <br>
methods and tools in the industrial development process. ITA has an  <br>
excellent international reputation and its research program was  <br>
singled out as "Excellent" in the last national research assessment.</p>
<p>Project Description</p>
<p>Network-on-chip is an emerging paradigm that could meet future  <br>
applications demand. The correctness of a system-on-chip will largely  <br>
depend on the correctness of the NoC. There has been little work on  <br>
the application of formal verification techniques to NoCs. This is a  <br>
challenging area, in particular, due to fact that the verification  <br>
needs to be done on parameterized networks.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop formal verification methods  <br>
for parameterized networks on a chip (NoCs). We aim at a general  <br>
model and verification methodology that encompasses the essential  <br>
constituents of NoCs communication architectures -- that is,  <br>
protocols and topologies, routing algorithms, and scheduling policies  <br>
-- and applies to a wide variety of systems. The project will tackle  <br>
the specification of properties about the absence of deadlock,  <br>
livelock, and will allow to quantify the routing performance of an  <br>
NoC. In particular, the project will focus on deadlock avoidance  <br>
mechanisms. Deadlocks may be generated at the protocol or at the  <br>
structural (for example, routing algorithms) level. The challenge of  <br>
the project lies in supporting the analysis of these two kinds of  <br>
deadlocks for parameterized, or unbounded, models.</p>
<p>To begin with, we want to analyze practical case studies, either  <br>
publicly available or provided by industrial partners. Our  <br>
methodology will be based on the Generic Network model (GeNoC) and  <br>
its implementation in the ACL2 logic. From this practical  <br>
experiments, we plan to generalize our approach to generate ranking  <br>
function for parameterized systems. One interesting research  <br>
direction is to combine the general formalization in ACL2 with  <br>
powerful tools dedicated to termination proof, like Terminator.</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<p>The candidate must hold an MSc or equivalent with top performance in  <br>
a field that is closely related to computer science or mathematics.  <br>
He or she should have interest in conducting original scientific  <br>
research, publishing the results in top conferences and scientific  <br>
journals, and participating in teaching duties. Maturity, self- <br>
motivation and the ability to work both independently and as a team  <br>
player in local and international research teams are expected. Dutch  <br>
language skills are not required, English is mandatory.</p>
<p>Conditions of employment</p>
<p>The positions involve a normal employment contract for a period of up  <br>
to 4 years, and is expected to lead to a Ph.D. degree. The salary  <br>
grows to approx. 2500 euro gross per month in the fourth year. For  <br>
