<p>SMT tools will be developed on top of the MathSAT SMT platform <br>
(<a href="http://mathsat4.disi.unitn.it">http://mathsat4.disi.unitn.it</a>), and Formal Verification tools will be<br>
developed on top of the NuSMV Model Checking platform (<a href="http://nusmv.fbk.eu">http://nusmv.fbk.eu</a>).<br>
Both platforms are jointly developed and maintained by ES and SE&amp;FM.</p>
<p>The selected candidates will be initially enrolled in a stage and, if<br>
they pass the selection of the Ph.D. school, they will be enrolled as<br>
Ph.D. students. Ph.D. courses will start in Autumn 2009, and the<br>
thesis must be completed in three or four years. People enrolled in a<br>
stage and subsequent Ph.D. courses are expected to move to Trento, and<br>
will receive monetary support during both phases of their activity.</p>
<p>Candidate Profile<br>
=================</p>
<p>The ideal candidate should have an MS or equivalent degree in computer<br>
science, mathematics or electronic engineering, and combine solid<br>
theoretical background and excellent software development skills.</p>
<p>The candidate should be able to work in a collaborative environment,<br>
with a strong commitment to reaching research excellence and achieving<br>
assigned objectives.</p>
<p>Background knowledge and/or previous experience in the following areas <br>
(in order of preference), though not mandatory, will be considered<br>
very favorably:</p>
<ul>
<li>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT)</li>
<li>Propositional Satisfiability (SAT)</li>
<li>Embedded Systems Design Languages (e.g. Verilog, VHDL)</li>
<li>Symbolic Model Checking</li>
<li>Automated Reasoning</li>
<li>Constraint Solving and Optimization</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications and Inquiries<br>
==========================</p>
<p>Interested candidates should inquire for further information and/or<br>
apply by sending email to Prof. Sebastiani rseba[at]disi[dot]unitn[dot]it.</p>
<p>Applications should contain a statement of interest, with a Curriculum<br>
Vitae, and three reference persons. PDF format is strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>Emails will be automatically processed and should have</p>

<p>The Embedded Systems Research Unit at FBK<br>
=========================================</p>
<p>The Embedded Systems Unit consists of about 15 persons, including<br>
researchers, post-Doc, Ph.D. students, and programmers. The<br>
Unit carries out research, tool development and technology transfer in<br>
the fields of design and verification of embedded systems.</p>
<p>Current research directions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory, and its application to the<br>
  verification of hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid<br>
  systems (Verilog, SystemC, C/C++, StateFlow/Simulink).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal Requirements Analysis based on techniques for temporal logics<br>
  (consistency checking, vacuity detection, input determinism,<br>
  cause-effect analysis, realizability and synthesis).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal Safety Analysis, based on the integration of traditional<br>
  techniques (e.g. Fault-tree analysis, FMEA) with symbolic<br>
  verification techniques.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Embedded Systems Unit is part of Fondazione Bruno Kessler,<br>
formerly Istituto Trentino di Cultura, a public research institute of<br>
the Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy), founded in 1976. The<br>
institute, through its center for the scientific and technological<br>
research, is active in the areas of Information Technology,<br>
Microsystems, and Physical Chemistry of Surfaces and<br>
Interfaces. Today, FBK is an internationally recognized research<br>

<p>Location<br>
========</p>
<p>Trento is a lively town of about 100.000 inhabitants, located 130 km<br>
south of the border between Italy and Austria. It is well known for<br>
the beauty of its mountains and lakes, and it offers the possibility<br>
to practice a wide range of sports. Trento enjoys a rich cultural and<br>
historical heritage, and it is the ideal starting point for day trips<br>
to famous towns such as Venice or Verona, as well as to enjoy great<br>
naturalistic journeys. Detailed information about Trento and its<br>
region can be found at <a href="http://www.trentino.to/home/index.html?_lang=en">http://www.trentino.to/home/index.html?_lang=en</a>.</p>

<p>The Embedded Systems Unit consists of about 15 persons, including<br>
researchers, post-Doc, Ph.D. students, and programmers. The<br>
Unit carries out research, tool development and technology transfer in<br>
the fields of design and verification of embedded systems.</p>
<p>Current research directions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory, and its application to the<br>
  verification of hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid<br>
  systems (Verilog, SystemC, C/C++, StateFlow/Simulink).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal Requirements Analysis based on techniques for temporal logics<br>
  (consistency checking, vacuity detection, input determinism,<br>
  cause-effect analysis, realizability and synthesis).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal Safety Analysis, based on the integration of traditional<br>
  techniques (e.g. Fault-tree analysis, FMEA) with symbolic<br>
  verification techniques.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Embedded Systems Unit is part of Fondazione Bruno Kessler,<br>
formerly Istituto Trentino di Cultura, a public research institute of<br>
the Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy), founded in 1976. The<br>
institute, through its center for the scientific and technological<br>
research, is active in the areas of Information Technology,<br>
Microsystems, and Physical Chemistry of Surfaces and<br>
Interfaces. Today, FBK is an internationally recognized research<br>
institute, collaborating with industries, universities, and public and<br>
private laboratories in Italy and abroad. The institute's applied and<br>
basic research activities aim at resolving real-world problems, driven<br>
by the need for technological innovation in society and industry.</p>
<p>The SW Engineering &amp; Formal Methods Research Program at DISI<br>
============================================================</p>
<p>The SW Engineering &amp; Formal Methods R. P. at DISI currently<br>
consists on 5 faculties, 4 post-docs and 19 PhD students. The<br>
Unit carries out research, tool development and technology transfer in<br>
the fields of Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering, Agent-oriented<br>
SW engineering, Security, and Formal Methods. </p>
<p>Referring to formal methods, current research directions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory, and its application to the<br>
  verification of hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid<br>
  systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced Model Checking Techniques for Formal Verification of<br>
  hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid systems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of Propositional Satisfiability (SAT) to various<br>
  domains. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The R.P. is part of the Department of Information Engineering and <br>
Computer Science, DISI (<a href="http://disi.unitn.it/">http://disi.unitn.it/</a>) of University of Trento. <br>
University of Trento in the latest years has always been rated among the<br>
top-three small&amp;medium-size universities in Italy.  <br>
DISI currently consists of 50 faculties, 68 research staff and support<br>
people, 21 postdocs and 146 Doctoral students, plus administrative and<br>
technical staff. DISI covers all the different areas of information <br>
technology (computer science, telecommunications, and electronics) <br>
and their applications. These disciplines above are studied<br>
individually but also with a strong focus on their integration, </p>
<p>Location<br>
========</p>
<p>Trento is a lively town of about 100.000 inhabitants, located 130 km<br>
south of the border between Italy and Austria. It is well known for<br>
the beauty of its mountains and lakes, and it offers the possibility<br>
to practice a wide range of sports. Trento enjoys a rich cultural and<br>
historical heritage, and it is the ideal starting point for day trips<br>
to famous towns such as Venice or Verona, as well as to enjoy great<br>
naturalistic journeys. Detailed information about Trento and its<br>
region can be found at <a href="http://www.trentino.to/home/index.html?_lang=en">http://www.trentino.to/home/index.html?_lang=en</a>.</p>
