<p>From: Josef Urban &lt;<a href="mailto:josef.urban@gmail.com">josef.urban@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
PhD positions on the AI4REASON project in Prague<br>
================================================</p>
<p>Czech Technical University in Prague,<br>
Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics<br>
Contact: <a href="mailto:Josef.Urban@gmail.com">Josef.Urban@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Starting Salary: EUR 1,200 gross/month for 1,0 fte</p>
<p>Job description<br>
===============</p>
<p>You will be working on the ERC project AI4REASON (<a href="http://ai4reason.org">http://ai4reason.org</a>).<br>
The project's goal is to develop new combinations of AI, Machine Learning<br>
and Theorem Proving methods that learn reasoning guidance from large proof<br>
corpora and use such guidance to steer the automated reasoning processes at<br>
various levels of granularity.  Our motivation is to (i) facilitate<br>
automated computer encoding, understanding and large-scale verification of<br>
mathematics, science, software and hardware designs, and to (ii) research<br>
AI methods that combine learning and reasoning over large repositories of<br>
complex mathematical knowledge, getting closer to human-level scientific<br>
thinking.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>machine learning procedures over large proof libraries</li>
<li>methods that propose useful intermediate lemmas for long proofs</li>
<li>methods that efficiently apply learned knowledge in proof search</li>
<li>feedback loops between learning and automated reasoning</li>
<li>
<p>statistical and deductive methods for automated formalization of informal<br>
mathematics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning from aligned informal, semiformal and formal corpora</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The work will include close collaboration with several international<br>
partners: University of Innsbruck, Google Research, University of Miami,<br>
Radboud University Nijmegen and others.</p>
<p>Requirements<br>
============</p>
<p>You should meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A master's degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Mathematics or a<br>
related field, with a strong interest in Machine Learning, AI and/or<br>
Automated Reasoning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commitment and a cooperative attitude;</p>
</li>
<li>Proficiency in written and spoken English.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will enroll in the PhD program in Artificial Intelligence at CTU with<br>
an individual study plan.</p>
<p>Research Environment<br>
====================</p>
<p>The research will take place at the recently established Czech Institute of<br>
Informatics, Robotics, and Cybernetics (CIIRC) of the Czech Technical<br>
University (CTU) in Prague, which is with over 1700 members of academic<br>
staff one of the largest research institutions in the Czech Republic. CIIRC<br>
has been founded by CTU in July 2013 as a research and teaching institute<br>
and a center of excellence in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>CIIRC is the home of the Prague Automated Reasoning Group (<br>
<a href="http://arg.ciirc.cvut.cz/">http://arg.ciirc.cvut.cz/</a>) - an international research group working on<br>
various aspects of Automated Reasoning, AI and Machine Learning,<br>
Formalization of Mathematics, and related fields. The group has a large and<br>
active network of collaborations around the world. The AI4REASON project<br>
led by Josef Urban is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) which<br>
targets highest-quality investigator-driven frontier research in Europe (<br>
<a href="https://erc.europa.eu/about-erc/mission">https://erc.europa.eu/about-erc/mission</a>).</p>
<p>Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic, considered one the most<br>
beautiful cities in the world and attracting millions of tourists every<br>
year. It has the highest Quality of Living Worldwide ranking among the<br>
eastern European cities and over 160,000 foreign residents. It boasts a<br>
rich history and culture, long tradition of university education and<br>
scientific research, and a dynamic economy.  The cost of living in Prague<br>
is about one half of the living costs in Amsterdam,Paris or Munich.</p>
<p>Application<br>
===========</p>
<p>Inquiries and applications should be sent via email to <a href="mailto:Josef.Urban@gmail.com">Josef.Urban@gmail.com</a><br>
