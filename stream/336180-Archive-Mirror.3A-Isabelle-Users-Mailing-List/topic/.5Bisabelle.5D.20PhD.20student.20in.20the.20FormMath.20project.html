<p>From: Herman Geuvers &lt;<a href="mailto:herman@cs.ru.nl">herman@cs.ru.nl</a>&gt;<br>
Job description<br>
The aim of the FORMATH project(<a href="http://www.formath.cs.ru.nl">http://www.formath.cs.ru.nl</a>) is to<br>
develop libraries of formalized mathematics concerning algebra, linear<br>
algebra, real number computation, and algebraic topology:<br>
These libraries will be structured as software components, relying on<br>
Ssreflect, which has proved its worth in the formal proof of the four<br>
colour theorem, and to address topics that were mostly left untouched<br>
by previous research in formal proofs or formal methods.</p>
<p>This work concerns formally proved algorithms for solving problems in<br>
real arithmetics, solving problems in ordinary differential equations,<br>
or solving problems in algebraic topology.<br>
Our methodology is a combination of theoretical research and<br>
technological development. The main tools will be provided by the<br>
Mathematical Components project, for instance the Ssreflect library<br>
for Coq proof assistants.</p>
<p>The four partners in the EU ForMath project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goteborg;</li>
<li>INRIA;</li>
<li>Nijmegen;</li>
<li>La Roja.</li>
</ul>
<p>More specifically, as a PhD student at the Nijmegen location you will<br>
work on Work package 4;</p>
<ul>
<li>Real number computation and basic numerical analysis;</li>
<li>The use of exact real number computation to prove inequalities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The objective is specification and implementation of a simple ODE<br>
solver. Potential fields of applications include robotics and hybrid<br>
systems.</p>
<p>Requirements<br>
You should meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A master's degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Mathematics<br>
or a related field, with a strong interest in proof assistants, type<br>
theory, functional programming, constructive analysis and numerical<br>
analysis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commitment and a cooperative attitude;</p>
</li>
<li>Excellent proficiency in written and spoken English.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organization<br>
The Radboud University Nijmegen is one of the leading academic<br>
communities in the Netherlands. Renowned for its green campus, modern<br>
buildings, and state-of-the-art equipment, it has nine faculties and<br>
enrols over 17.500 students in approximately 90 study programmes. The<br>
university is situated in the oldest Dutch city, close to the German<br>
border, on the banks of the river Waal (a branch of the Rhine). The<br>
city has a rich history and one of the liveliest city centres in the<br>
Netherlands.<br>
The section Intelligent Systems of the Institute for Computing and<br>
Information Sciences (ICIS) at the Radboud University Nijmegen studies<br>
mathematical theories concerned with computability, provability and<br>
complexity. Notably, the group studies type theory, lambda calculus<br>
and logic and also applies these theories in the area of theorem<br>
proving and formalizing mathematics.<br>
The group has an excellent international reputation which was<br>
supported by the last national research assessment.<br>
