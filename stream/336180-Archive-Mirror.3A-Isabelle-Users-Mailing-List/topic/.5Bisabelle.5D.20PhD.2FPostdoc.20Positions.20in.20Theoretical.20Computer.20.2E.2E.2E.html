<p>From: Lutz Schroeder &lt;<a href="mailto:Lutz.Schroeder@dfki.de">Lutz.Schroeder@dfki.de</a>&gt;<br>
[I would be grateful for further distribution of the job advertisement <br>
below]  </p>
<p>In the newly founded Theoretical Computer Science group (Chair 8) at the <br>
University of Erlangen-Nürnberg, several research positions are <br>
available that can be filled at the doctoral or post-doctoral level. <br>
These include project positions of up to two years, in the TV-L E13 or <br>
E14 pay scale depending on qualification of the applicant; project <br>
topics include</p>
<p>- coalgebraic logic<br>
    - probabilistic description logic<br>
    - formal methods in mechanical engineering.</p>
<p>Additionally, at least one position is available that is not tied to a <br>
specific research project but does carry a teaching obligation of 5h per <br>
week; in this case, research work can be positioned in any of the core <br>
fields of the group including</p>
<p>- modal logic<br>
    - knowledge representation<br>
    - coalgebra<br>
    - formal methods<br>
    - program semantics<br>
    - applications of semantic technologies</p>
<p>Such positions can be filled at TV-L E13 for an initial appointment of <br>
three years, with a possibility of extension for another three years <br>
subject to provisions by German laws on temporal employment in academia; <br>
postdoctoral applicants from EU countries can be appointed at the A13 <br>
payscale ("akademischer Rat") (which pays better and has better <br>
benefits) for two periods of three years, with a possible extension of <br>
two periods of two years at the A14 payscale ("akademischer Oberrat") <br>
for candidates who successfully complete a habilitation during the first <br>
six years.</p>
<p>Please send applications consisting of a cover letter, resume, and <br>
contact details of three references by email to <br>
<a href="mailto:lutz.schroeder@cs.fau.de">lutz.schroeder@cs.fau.de</a>. There is no particular application deadline; <br>
positions will be filled when suitable candidates are found.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Lutz</p>
