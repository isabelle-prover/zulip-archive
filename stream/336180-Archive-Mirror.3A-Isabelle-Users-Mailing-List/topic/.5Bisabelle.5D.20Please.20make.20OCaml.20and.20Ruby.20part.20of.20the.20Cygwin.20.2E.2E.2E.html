<p>The "right language" depends a lot on what you want to do with it, but <br>
that should be common folklore anyway.</p>

<p>As a Windows user you might be interested in F# <a href="http://fsharp.org/">http://fsharp.org/</a> which <br>
seems to have taken over most of the potential market share of OCaml in <br>
recent years.  OCaml was once a big thing, but now it is just another <br>
scripting language performance-wise, since it is still not multicore <br>
capable.</p>

<p>But, though It's very easy for me to install OCaml and Ruby on Cygwin, <br>
with Cygwin-Setup.bat, it might not be easy for someone who has never <br>

<p>If OCaml and Ruby came as part of Cygwin, in the contrib folder, then <br>
things would be closer to working by magic, if someone was trying to do <br>
what I'm doing.</p>

<p>I don't see the point.  The Cygwin-Setup.bat is there to add whatever <br>
might be interesting in addition to the default packages that are <br>
necessary to run Isabelle and its standard tools.  The Cygwin installation <br>
dialog is not ultra user-friendly, but any requests for improvements <br>
should be directed to the Cygwin guys and gals, especially Corinna <br>
Vinschen.</p>

it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did look at it, but not very systematically.  Here are a few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Load all files relatively to the implicit master directory of the<br>
   enclosing theory.  This avoids absolute file-system references, and<br>
   keeps your application "portable", i.e. you don't have to ask people to<br>
   put things into a specific place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch out for global side-effects of Isar command declarations<br>
   ('keywords') and their subsequent definitions in ML part of a theory.<br>
   This implicit statefulness of the command table is TTY / Proof General<br>
   legacy and easily leads to mistakes in the Prover IDE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of fragile echo within the shell and its complicated rules for<br>
   quoting, better use a temp file and stdin redirection (via "&lt;").  See<br>
   also the Isabelle/ML operation Isabelle_System.create_tmp_path or<br>
   better the higher-order wrapper Isabelle_System.with_tmp_file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The type 'a Unsynchronized.ref in Isabelle/ML is just an alias of<br>
   regular 'a ref, to empasize its unsynchronized nature, and to make it<br>
   easier to get old ML code right with the help of static analysis: fewer<br>
   ref operations are pervasive by default, so it is easier to locate its<br>
   remaining uses.  The easiest way to give that up that discipline is ML<br>
   "open Unsynchronized", but you should not do this in production code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A mutable HashArray is a very old-fashioned (and in general inefficient)<br>
   data structure. Mutability belongs into the bucket with the label<br>
   "premature optimization is the root of all evil".  On today's parallel<br>
   hardware it is often less efficient by default, and actually plain wrong<br>
   without special precautions.  See @{file "~~/src/Pure/General/table.ML"}<br>
   for an efficient immutable data structure that can be used by default<br>
   almost everywhere, without requiring extra thinking about correctness or<br>
   efficiency.</p>
<p>If you want to make a global cache of certain items, the canonical way<br>
 is via some immutable table that is stored within a Synchronized.var.<br>
 Moving mutability away from the data structures to some topmost position<br>
 is the first step to get things right (correct and efficient).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Part of the work is related to dealing with the statelessness of the <br>
PIDE. It's not that complex to implement, but my current is idea is to <br>
use a hash table along with a random number generator to get a name. <br>
There's a number of them available, but I guess I'll use the one from <br>
Larry Paulson's book that I acquired recently from the SML/NJ import. <br>
The SML/NJ Library manual has some things to say about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much could be said about random numbers, e.g. see <br>
<a href="http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2001-10-25/">http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2001-10-25/</a> what Scott Adams says.  We <br>
have our own old jokes and running gags about the various random <br>
generators that are floating around in the Isabelle sources.</p>
<p>It is generally difficult to produce unique indentifiers that are actually <br>
unique in a sufficiently large scope.  Within a running Isabelle/ML <br>
process you can use "serial ()" or "serial_string ()" for that, but it is <br>
also not 100% fool-proof if such ids persist over unrelated Isabelle <br>
sessions.</p>

My hint was more basic that this.  Your ML_file references where all <br>
absolute, but by just removing a prefix it becaume relative to the master <br>
directory of the enclosing theory, and thus became "portable".</p>

It is about HOL-Zero and Ocaml as unsafe programming language etc.<br>
A very entangled variant of several related and unrelated threads around <br>
this can be seen here on the HOL mailing list:</p>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/hol/mailman/hol-info/thread/E1SN77r-0007Os-05%40mta0.cl.cam.ac.uk/#msg29180495">http://sourceforge.net/p/hol/mailman/hol-info/thread/E1SN77r-0007Os-05%40mta0.cl.cam.ac.uk/#msg29180495</a></p>
<p>Title of the thread: "Re: rigorous axiomatic geometry proof in HOL Light".</p>

Incidentally, the gmane interface to the mailing list, at for example</p>
<p><a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.hol/1605/">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.hol/1605/</a></p>
<p>is much nicer than the antiquated UI available through sourceforge.</p>
