Hi,</p>
<p>I have recently had to deal with probability in Isabelle but mostly I have<br>
been doing it through Probability_Mass_Function.thy. So I would like to ask<br>
about some facilities we have on “ 'a pmf".<br>
I know how to use some pre-constructed pmf such as<br>
bernoulli_pmf p :: bool pmf<br>
as a coin tossing in a way that pmf (bernoulli_pmf p) True = p and  pmf<br>
(bernoulli_pmf p) False = 1 - p,  when p is incusively between 0 and 1.<br>
1) How can we define two independent, for example, coins tossing, as one<br>
function of type " 'a pmf"? Is there any function built in Isabelle already<br>
that can make this kind of product just from bernoulli_pmf? What would the<br>
type of this product be, should it be (bool x bool) pmf for 2 bernoulli_pmf<br>
for example?</p>
<p>2) Following (1), are there any n-ary to combine n independent pmf's?</p>
<p>3) This one does not directly relate to two questions above. Do we have<br>
formalisation of sigma-algebra generated by random variable in Isabelle?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Kawin</p>

Dear Kawin,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) How can we define two independent, for example, coins tossing, as one<br>

that can make this kind of product just from bernoulli_pmf? What would the<br>
type of this product be, should it be (bool x bool) pmf for 2 bernoulli_pmf<br>
for example?<br>
There's the function pair_pmf that takes two pmfs and combines them into one. The type is <br>
as you'd expect:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>pair_pmf :: 'a pmf =&gt; 'b pmf =&gt; ('a * 'b) pmf</p>
<p>So if you write "pair_pmf (bernoulli_pmf p) (bernoulli_pmf q)", the resulting type is <br>
indeed "(bool * bool) pmf".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) Following (1), are there any n-ary to combine n independent pmf's?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is getting into applicative functors. The pmf type is a monad (with operations <br>
return_pmf and bind_pmf) and this is the main workhorse for building more complex <br>
distribution from basic building blocks. Every monad is also an applicative functor and <br>
the above pair_pmf is just the product operation of an applicative functor. So you can use <br>
the standard operations of applicative functors to iterate the construction. The AFP entry</p>
<p><a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Applicative_Lifting.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Applicative_Lifting.html</a></p>
<p>defines some notation and some proof machinery for applicative functors, which also work <br>
for pmfs. For example, if you have pmfs p1 to p3 and you want to combine their independent <br>
samples with the function f, then you can write this as</p>
<p>return_pmf f ⋄ p1 ⋄ p2 ⋄ p3</p>
<p>where (⋄) denotes the applicative operation ap_pmf on pmfs defined in that AFP entry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3) This one does not directly relate to two questions above. Do we have<br>
formalisation of sigma-algebra generated by random variable in Isabelle?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PMFs are discrete distributions, so everything is measurable and their Sigma algebra is <br>
therefore the powerset. In Isabelle, this is formalized as "count_space". Note that there <br>
is no formalization of an abstract event space Omega that we (partially) observe through <br>
the random variables, as is often done in probability theory. A pmf models only the <br>
projection of Omega to the random variable's output space, but the connection to Omega is <br>
lost. If you really need to formalize this, you'll probably want to look at the <br>
formalization of measure theory in HOL-Probability.</p>
<p>Hope this helps<br>
Andreas</p>

Andreas already answered most things, but for an n-ary independent<br>
product of PMFs, the best way (in most cases) is to use the Pi_pmf that<br>
(I think) I sent you last year. I really should put this into the<br>
distribution at some point; I'm not sure why I haven't done that<br>
already. I probably forgot.</p>

Hi Kawin,</p>
<p>for your question (3), the sigma-algebra generated by random variable(s) are not regularly used, but you can easily define it by yourself. </p>
<p>A random variable is nothing but a measurable function f mapping an arbitrary sigma-algebra (sp,sts) to Borel sigma_algebra. So you already have two sigma-algebras. The sigma-algebra generated by that random variable is a set of all PREIMAGEs of points in Borel sets. In HOL4, I defined it in this way:</p>
<p>[sigma_function_def]  Definition (in HOL4's martingaleTheory)<br>
      ⊢ ∀sp A f.<br>
            sigma sp A f = (sp,IMAGE (λs. PREIMAGE f s ∩ sp) (subsets A))</p>
<p>If I take f as the random variable, A as (subsets Borel), then I get the sigma-algebra generated by that random variable. This is because PREIMAGE naturally forms a sigma-algebra:</p>
<p>[PREIMAGE_SIGMA_ALGEBRA]  Theorem (in HOL4's sigma_algebraTheory)</p>
<p>⊢ ∀sp A f.<br>
            sigma_algebra A ∧ f ∈ (sp → space A) ⇒<br>
            sigma_algebra (sp,IMAGE (λs. PREIMAGE f s ∩ sp) (subsets A))</p>
<p>Furthermore, there's the concept of "sigma-algebra generated from multiple random variables" (from an index set). (see, e.g., [1, p.52])</p>
<p>[sigma_functions_def]  Definition (in HOL's martingaleTheory)<br>
      ⊢ ∀sp A f J.<br>
            sigma sp A f J =<br>
            sigma sp<br>
              (BIGUNION<br>
                 (IMAGE<br>
                    (λi. IMAGE (λs. PREIMAGE (f i) s ∩ sp) (subsets (A i)))<br>
                    J))</p>
<p>The trick here is, I quote, "although <code>PREIMAGE (f i) s ∩ sp</code> is a sigma-algebra, this is (in general) no longer true for their BIGUNIONs; this explains why we have to use the sigma-hull outside of BIGUNION". [1]</p>
<p>Then I can prove that, the generated sigma-algebra indeed makes all those random variables (i.e. measurable functions) simultaneously measurable in it:</p>
<p>[SIGMA_SIMULTANEOUSLY_MEASURABLE]  Theorem (in HOL's martingaleTheory)</p>
<p>⊢ ∀sp A f J.<br>
            (∀i. i ∈ J ⇒ sigma_algebra (A i)) ∧<br>
            (∀i. f i ∈ (sp → space (A i))) ⇒<br>
            ∀i. i ∈ J ⇒ f i ∈ measurable (sigma_functions sp A f J) (A i)</p>
<p>These definitions are not commonly needed in the core Probability Theory. I only found some applications in Kolmogorov's 0-1 Law and Martingales.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
