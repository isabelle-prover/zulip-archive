<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au">thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks David. That is indeed what is going on.</p>
<p>There's an Isabelle problem here: the suggested approach to executing<br>
64-bit polyML does not actually result in 64-bit polyML being run.</p>
<p>In the Isabelle NEWS file the following is suggested:</p>
<p>The following example setting prefers 64 bit if available:</p>
<p>ML_PLATFORM="${ISABELLE_PLATFORM64:-$ISABELLE_PLATFORM}"</p>
<p>I have in my isabelle settings the line:</p>
<p>ML_PLATFORM="$ISABELLE_PLATFORM64"</p>
<p>Running isabelle env | grep ML shows these settings:</p>
<p>ML_IDENTIFIER=polyml-5.5.2_x86_64-linux<br>
POLYML_HOME=/home/tsewell/.isabelle/contrib/polyml-5.5.2<br>
ML_SYSTEM=polyml-5.5.2<br>
ML_PLATFORM=x86_64-linux<br>
ML_OPTIONS=-H 500<br>
ISABELLE_POLYML=true<br>
ML_HOME=/home/tsewell/.isabelle/contrib/polyml-5.5.2/x86-linux<br>
ML_SOURCES=/home/tsewell/.isabelle/contrib/polyml-5.5.2/src</p>
<p>So, the isabelle environment is now thoroughly confused which version of<br>
polyML is running, to the extent that my heap files are being saved in a<br>
directory called "polyml-5.5.2_x86_64-linux" despite the fact that the<br>
poly process which is running is actually the x86-linux variant.</p>
<p>In short, that is all a bit confusing. Is there a better way to switch<br>
between 32 and 64 bit modes? For the moment, I've just moved the<br>
~/.isabelle/contrib/polyml-5.2.2/x86-linux directory aside, which<br>
results in Isabelle falling back to 64-bit mode. Amusingly, polyML then<br>
objects to the version of the saved heap files.</p>
<p>Well, enough said. I hope this is easy to fix.</p>
<p>Thanks all,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

<p>From: Lars Noschinski &lt;<a href="mailto:noschinl@in.tum.de">noschinl@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Indeed, there doesn't seem to be a really clean way.</p>
<p>The etc/settings file of the polyml-5.2.2-1 component automatically<br>
chooses between ISABELLE_PLATFORM32 and 64 by trying to run 32-bit poly<br>
and there is no way of overriding this.</p>
<p>To fully switch to 64-bit poly, you need to set</p>
<p>ML_PLATFORM=$ISABELLE_PLATFORM64<br>
   ML_HOME=$POLYML_HOME/$ML_PLATFORM"</p>
<p>after initializing the component.<br>
Also, ML_OPTIONS is different for 64-bit mode, so you may want to set</p>
<p>ML_OPTIONS="-H 1000"</p>
<p>too.</p>

<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au">thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks Lars.</p>
<p>OK, so I've learned a lot from this. Apparently the order of the<br>
"init_components" line with respect to the other lines of the settings<br>
file matters quite a lot.</p>
<p>The polyml component currently overrules any settings that were<br>
previously set, and then sets quite a few settings of its own. The<br>
missing "clean" approach would probably involve requesting 64-bit mode<br>
before the component initialises, and having the component notice this<br>
has been done.</p>
<p>To override the settings after the component has initialised, you must<br>
override all the settings it set, but there's no obvious way to ask what<br>
they were. Perhaps in the past it was sufficient to adjust ML_PLATFORM.</p>
<p>To confuse matters, further settings (environment variables) seem to be<br>
updated after the end of the user's settings file. For instance,<br>
adjusting ML_PLATFORM seems to imply an update to ML_IDENTIFIER, but not<br>
to ML_HOME or POLYML_HOME, thus the confusing outcome.</p>
<p>Well, I now know a lot more about how this works. However, I'm going to<br>
continue enabling 64-bit mode by sabotaging 32-bit mode until someone<br>
suggests a significantly better way.</p>
<p>Thanks for educating me,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
It seems that some more basic Isabelle education is required.  As usual <br>
there are two approaches: to work with the system, or to work against it.</p>
<p>Working with the system means to look around carefully how things are <br>
usually done, under the assumption that the system is mostly right. <br>
Concerning settings the "system" manual also has a lot to say -- here it <br>
needs to be read in the context of Isabelle component settings in <br>
particular.</p>
<p>Taking a NEWS entry from 2010 in isolation is unlikely to succeed, without <br>
its historical context.  In the past there were no Isabelle components and <br>
people usually had the full bunch of ML settings somewhere.  Then it was<br>
obvious what the change of a single line line ML_PLATFORM="..." meant.</p>
<p>Today in Isabelle2014, the component polyml-5.5.2-1/etc/settings still <br>
make it possible to work like that, taking the with a commented-out <br>
section of "basic settings" as a starting point:</p>
<p>ML_SYSTEM=polyml-5.5.2<br>
   ML_PLATFORM="$ISABELLE_PLATFORM32"<br>
   ML_HOME="$POLYML_HOME/$ML_PLATFORM"<br>
   ML_OPTIONS="-H 500"<br>
   ML_SOURCES="$POLYML_HOME/src"</p>
<p>Applying some care and common-sense, it should be obvious who to work with <br>
that, without any need to "fix" Isabelle, nor to "sabotage" anything.</p>

<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au">thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
Hello isabelle-users.</p>
<p>I've been struggling lately with fairly frequent "Insufficient memory" <br>
exceptions when trying to build heaps/images. The strange thing is that <br>
I don't seem to have run out of memory in any sense.</p>
<p>From reading the log, it looks a lot like PolyML ran out of something <br>
while trying to do its final cleanup before saving the session. In the <br>
session log, all the theories have been loaded already. There's also <br>
plenty more total memory available on this machine at the time of <br>
failure, so I don't think it's a fail-to-allocate problem. Perhaps <br>
PolyML has exhausted some fixed resource used while doing a <br>
shareCommonData or similar, such as stack space on some thread?</p>
<p>Finally, in the past I've noticed that the problem is slightly <br>
nondeterministic. If I delete a few heaps and try again, sometimes the <br>
process succeeds, usually after three or four attempts. This is not a <br>
lot of fun.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what kinds of things might cause this problem, <br>
and where I should be looking? I've noticed that polyML itself has a <br>
number of command-line memory-debugging arguments, and I'm not sure what <br>
will happen if I try to convince Isabelle to pass them along.</p>
<p>I don't set any limits on PolyML's memory usage in my isabelle settings <br>
or via ulimit or similar. (There's a limit on Java's memory consumption, <br>
but that's not what's being hit here.)</p>
<p>Here are the last few ML statistics messages from the log of the failed <br>
session:</p>

<p>From: David Matthews &lt;<a href="mailto:dm@prolingua.co.uk">dm@prolingua.co.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Looking at those figures I would guess that you are running the 32-bit <br>
version of Poly/ML.  I think that is the default for Isabelle because, <br>
generally, it gives better performance than the 64-bit version.  The <br>
problem with it is that the total address space of a 32-bit application <br>
is limited by the operating system to around 3Gbytes.  Poly/ML uses <br>
several memory pools and a situation can arise where the address space <br>
limit is reached.  Try it with the 64-bit version and if it happens <br>
there I will try and investigate further.</p>
