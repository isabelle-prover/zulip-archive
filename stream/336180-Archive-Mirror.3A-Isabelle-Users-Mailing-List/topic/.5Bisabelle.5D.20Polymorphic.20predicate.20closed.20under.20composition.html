<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch">andreas.lochbihler@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Dear readers,</p>
<p>In Isabelle/HOL, I would like to reason about a polymorphic predicate P which is closed <br>
under function composition. Since the concrete definition of the predicate is very tedious <br>
and not relevant for the reasoning, I prefer to work just with the closure properties of <br>
P. However, I have not found a nice way to accomplish that. Ideas and pointers are welcome.</p>
<p>Here are the details. The predicate P should have type "('a =&gt; 'b) =&gt; bool" and satisfy <br>
properties such as the following (type variables may be restricted to some sort if needed):</p>
<ol>
<li>P (%x :: 'a. x) for every 'c</li>
<li>P f ==&gt; P g ==&gt; P (f o g) for all f :: 'a =&gt; 'b and g :: 'c =&gt; 'a</li>
<li>P (%_ :: 'a. x :: 'b)</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, I cannot just define a locale l that fixes P as a parameter and assumes the <br>
properties 1-3, because this does not typecheck as P occurs with different type instances. <br>
Neither does inductive &amp; friends work (for the same reason).</p>
<p>I could define "P" as "%_. True" and derive properties 1-3 from this. However, my theorem <br>
is of the form</p>
<p>(ALL x. P x --&gt; foo x) ==&gt; P something ==&gt; P something_more_complicated</p>
<p>where the first assumption is folded in a definition. Unfortunately, foo does not hold for <br>
all x. Thus, defining "P" as "%_. True" would allow me to derive False from the first <br>
assumption. So I could circumvent the actual proof of deriving the conclusion from the <br>
second assumption.</p>
<p>I think of axiomatising properties 1-3 for P declared as a global constant with consts. In <br>
a separate theory, I could show that "%_. True" satisfies all the properties stated. In my <br>
understanding, this should ensure that the axioms do not introduce inconsistencies <br>
anywhere. Still, as the theorem is proven in a scope where P is only axiomatised, I cannot <br>
derive False from the first assumption in its proof. In fact, the theorem also holds for <br>
the metamodel of HOL in which P is interpreted as the predicate that I am too lazy to <br>
define (provided that it exists at all, but that's another issue). Is this argument <br>
correct? Are there better ways to approach this?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>if there would be a nice way for doing this in HOL, we could simplify a <br>
lot of things in the BNF package.</p>
<p>One approach that comes to mind is to use a locale with several <br>
monomorphic copies of P (as many as you need to express the propetries). <br>
Whether this works without being to painful, depends on what you <br>
actually are proving. For BNFs we have used some (trivial) theorems that <br>
are preconditioned with something like "M = M1 o M2" which is later <br>
instantiated with the map_comp theorem (see e.g. src/HOL/BNF_Comp).</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dmitriy</p>

Hi Dmitriy,</p>
<p>Thanks for the confirmation that there is no easy solution. Several monomorphic copies <br>
probably do not scale, because my reasoning will involve various instances of the types. <br>
So even in simple cases, I need at least 10 copies and I'd have to figure out in each case <br>
which copy I need.</p>
<p>What do you think of my axiomatic suggestion?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>it sounds ok, in the sense that it will not introduce inconsistencies. <br>
What I'm not sure about is how you plan to further work with your <br>
predicate---do you need to integrate it with some other theories or is</p>
<p>(ALL x. P x --&gt; foo x) ==&gt; P something ==&gt; P something_more_complicated</p>
<p>really the final theorem you are after?</p>

Hi Dmitriy,</p>
<p>My plans are currently that something of the stated form will be my final theorem. Of <br>
course, foo, something, and something_more_complicated depend on a huge number of other <br>
definitions. So what do you mean by integration with other theories? In any case, I should <br>
never have to do a case analysis or induction over my predicate - everything should follow <br>
from the closure properties (of which there are many more than the ones I listed).</p>
<p>I guess that I will start by axiomatising the properties I need. Maybe I can find a <br>
student to do the tedious construction later and derive the axioms from that.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

Yes, I've inferred that from the fact that the closure properties you've <br>
listed don't give you anything very tedious to define (neither <br>
inductively nor coinductively).</p>

<p>Another idea (going back to you %x. True definition):</p>
<p>context begin</p>
<p>private definition "Q x = True"</p>
<p>definition "P = Q"</p>
<p>lemma props:<br>
   "P id"<br>
   "P f ⟹ P g ⟹ P (f o g)"<br>
   "P (λx. c)"<br>
   unfolding P_def Q_def by simp_all</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>This makes it kind of hard (if possible at all) to access the definition <br>
of Q. You prospective student would need to replace just a definition <br>
rather than an axiomatization then ;-)</p>

Interesting idea, but I am not yet convinced. If I want to explain my proof to someone <br>
else, I'd have to convince them that I am proving the statement only using props, but not <br>
using Q_def. It is easier to argue that I am only using the axioms if there is nothing <br>
else available in the theorem prover. Otherwise, I'd have to explain the whole concept of <br>
name spaces and contexts. Moreover, I do not know how strict name spaces enforce <br>
privateness. I'd expect that there are corner cases where the enforcement might fail <br>
(blind shot: extract the proof terms for props and get the references to the theorem Q_def <br>
from that?).</p>

<p>In the end, replacing the axiomatisation or the bogus definition should amount to the same <br>
effort.</p>

Hm, then you need to ensure that Sledgehammer, Nitpick, Quickcheck do<br>

"false" proofs. Is "private" enough to guarantee this?</p>

No.  The new 'private' and 'qualified' command prefixes merely affect name <br>
space accesses.  Thus they do hardly anything at all.  Only the surface <br>
presentation of formal entities is modified.</p>
<p>Think of it like 'private' in Java or Scala, which is in some sense just a <br>
joke as proven here: <br>

<p>It is easy to do similar things with 'private' name space entries within <br>
the Isabelle context, using perfectly normal Isabelle/ML operations.</p>
<p>Back to the purpose of this thread: maybe the 'specification' command can <br>
do a job here, although it is a bit old and not yet localized.</p>

I tried specification, but it did not work. It complains that the specified constant <br>

this defeats the point, because I want the predicate to have different type instances in <br>
the axioms.</p>
