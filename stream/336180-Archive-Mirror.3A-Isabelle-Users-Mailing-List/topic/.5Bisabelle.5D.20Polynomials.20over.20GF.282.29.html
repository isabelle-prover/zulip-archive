Greetings -</p>
<p>I am working on a formal development of an efficient software algorithm<br>
to calculate a proprietary cyclic redundancy check (CRC). This CRC<br>
itself is defined in the usual fashion in terms of polynomials over<br>
GF(2).</p>
<p>Rather than re-invent the wheel, I'd like to re-use existing Isabelle<br>
theories as much as possible.  I'm interested in theories in any of the<br>
following areas:<br>
  --  polynomials over a field<br>
  --  GF(2)<br>
  --  CRC specifications and algorithms</p>
<p>If anyone can point me towards such material, I would be grateful.<br>
Thanks - Mark Janney</p>

Hi Mark,</p>
<p>The Isabelle distribution contains two different formalizations of  <br>
polynomials, each with its own tradeoffs.</p>
<p>First, there is Univ_Poly.thy, created by Amine Chaieb for use in his  <br>
proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. This theory is  <br>
automatically included if your theory imports Complex_Main. It does  <br>
not define a type constructor for polynomials, but rather implements  <br>
all operations in terms of lists.</p>
<p>Second, there is the collection of theories in HOL/Algebra/poly,  <br>
created by Clemens Ballarin. These theories define an actual type  <br>
constructor for polynomials, and they also include a formalization of  <br>
long division for polynomials, which I expect you would need for your  <br>
application. Unfortunately, the theories are rather out of date, and  <br>
do not use the same hierarchy of algebraic classes as the rest of  <br>
Isabelle/HOL. If you use them, you might have to provide some extra  <br>
instance proofs for the duplicated axclasses, and the proof automation  <br>
is not as good as it could be (since many simprocs in Isabelle/HOL are  <br>
specific to the type classes defined in Ring_and_Field.thy).</p>
<p>It would be nice to eventually merge these two theories, so that we  <br>
could have a type constructor for polynomials that supports all of the  <br>
usual operations, and is also integrated with the current type class  <br>
hierarchy. I have already done a bit of tinkering with these theories,  <br>
so if there is enough interest I would probably be willing to work on  <br>
this some more.</p>
<p>For GF(2), you could just import the HOL-Word image and use 1-bit  <br>
words. However, the Word library does not provide a field class  <br>
instance for this type. It probably wouldn't be too much work to just  <br>
define the type yourself.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
