<p>From: Baskar Anguraj &lt;<a href="mailto:baskar@mais.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de">baskar@mais.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de</a>&gt;<br>
The TU Darmstadt is one of Germany's top technical universities with an<br>
outstanding nation-wide and international reputation in research and education.<br>
Being part of Theoretical Computer Science, the chair Modeling and Analysis of<br>
Information Systems (MAIS) is currently offering positions for PhD students and<br>
PostDocs.</p>
<p>What are the positions about?</p>
<hr>
<p>Our aim is to make IT systems more reliable and secure than they are today. Due to<br>
the complexity of today's information systems and the manifold possibilities to attack<br>
these systems, the development of secure systems is a big technological challenge. To<br>
address this challenge, we develop formal methods and supporting tools that can be applied<br>
in the software-development process and at runtime. We test our approaches in<br>
case-studies in our Mobile Devices Lab and in practice. In particular, we are<br>
working on information flow security, policy languages, refinement of<br>
specifications, runtime monitoring, static analysis and security engineering.<br>
Currently, we are looking for candidates who are interested in formal<br>
approaches for information security in any of the above areas.</p>
<p>The positions</p>
<hr>
<p>Suitable candidates should have a Master's degree (or equivalent) in Computer<br>
Science or Mathematics.  For all our research topics, a solid background in formal<br>
methods or logic is required. A background in information security will be helpful,<br>
but is not a prerequisite. Prior knowledge in any of the following areas is also a plus:<br>
Automated Verification, Model Checking, Model-based Software Development, Concurrency<br>
Theory, Program Analysis, Side-channel Analysis, Runtime Monitoring. Candidates<br>
should be highly motivated to tackle challenging research topics and to<br>
contribute to an open-minded team.</p>
<p>We offer a productive and continuously evolving research environment, in which<br>
you can discuss ideas and collaborate with team members who are working on<br>
related research topics. Our international connections as well as our<br>
involvement in interesting research projects, for example the DFG priority<br>
programme Reliably Secure Software Systems (RS3) and the Center for Advanced<br>
Security Research Darmstadt (CASED), provide further opportunities for<br>
inspiration and collaborations. The publication of your research results at<br>
highly ranked conferences will be expected and supported. The positions offered<br>
are regular jobs with social benefits. The salary will be based on the TV-TU<br>
Darmstadt public service salary scale (equivalent to former BAT IIa and TV-L).<br>
German language skills are not required in the beginning, but the willingness<br>
to learn German within the first year is expected.</p>
<p>How to apply?</p>
<hr>
<p>Please submit your application, preferably on paper, including your detailed CV<br>
(stating your language skills in English and German), complete educational<br>
transcripts with grades and degrees (copies, no originals), description of your<br>
background and your research interests, and, if possible, the contact information<br>
of one or two references to Prof. Dr. Heiko Mantel, TU Darmstadt, Department of<br>
Computer Science, MAIS Group, Hochschulstraße 10, 64289 Darmstadt, Germany.</p>
<p>Deadline for applications is 11 December 2011. However, we will consider applications<br>
until the positions are filled. The positions are available immediately but a later start is also possible.</p>
<p>TU Darmstadt is an equal opportunities employer and welcomes applications from<br>
women. In case of equal qualifications, applicants with a degree of disability<br>
of at least 50 or equal will be given preference.</p>
