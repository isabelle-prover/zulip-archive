Positions for PhD Students and PostDocs</p>
<p>The Chair for Modeling and Analysis of Information Systems (MAIS) led<br>
by Prof. Dr. Heiko Mantel is currently looking for PhD students and<br>
PostDocs who are interested in software security, program analysis,<br>
verification, or foundations of software engineering.  In particular,<br>
the following areas are in our current research focus:</p>
<p>o static program analysis (type systems, verification, tools)</p>
<p>o runtime verification (monitoring concepts for security)</p>
<p>o foundations of information security (information flow security,<br>
  security models, security engineering, covert channel analysis)</p>
<p>o foundations of stepwise software development (abstraction,<br>
  composition, refinement, model-based development, secure coding)</p>
<p>Our activities include the advancement of theoretical foundations, the<br>
development of methods and tools, and the application of our ideas in<br>
practice.  Our overall goal is to contribute to making software-based<br>
systems more trustworthy (correct, safe, and secure) than today.</p>
<p>The MAIS group provides a productive research environment, in which<br>
you could discuss ideas and collaborate with motivated colleagues who<br>
are working on related topics.  Our international connections as well<br>
as our involvement in interesting research projects (including the<br>
Center for Advanced Security Research Darmstadt) provide further<br>
opportunities for inspiration and collaborations. For PostDocs, there<br>
might be a later opportunity to renew the position or to continue as<br>
senior researcher.</p>
<p>All of our research projects require a solid background in mathematics<br>
(logic and algebra) or in formal methods.  A background in information<br>
security will be helpful, but is not required.  PhD students should<br>
have completed a Diploma or Masters program in Computer Science or in<br>
Mathematics before starting.  PostDocs should have completed their PhD<br>
thesis.  Prior knowledge in any of the following areas is a plus:</p>
<p>o automated theorem proving, model checking, and SAT solving,</p>
<p>o formal methods and logic in Computer Science,</p>
<p>o information security, </p>
<p>o model-based software development and tools, and</p>
<p>o program analysis and semantics of programming languages.</p>
<p>Payment will be according to Bundesangestelltentarifvertrag (BAT<br>
IIa/Ib).</p>
<p>If you are interested in a position as PhD student or PostDoc, please<br>
send your application (preferably on paper) including</p>
<p>o your detailed CV (including language skills in English and German)</p>
<p>o complete educational transcripts with grades and degrees (copies,<br>
    no originals),</p>
<p>o description of your background and your research interests,</p>
<p>o and, if possible, the contact information of one or two references<br>
    (researchers who are willing to write a reference letter for you)</p>
<p>to </p>
<p>Prof. Dr. Heiko Mantel<br>
  TU Darmstadt<br>
  Department of Computer Science<br>
  Modeling and Analysis of Information Systems (MAIS) <br>
  Hochschulstrasse 10<br>
  D-64289 Darmstadt<br>
  Germany.  </p>
<p>If you have questions about the position, please contact us via<br>
e-mail (<a href="mailto:mantel@cs.tu-darmstadt.de">mantel@cs.tu-darmstadt.de</a>).</p>
<p>The TU Darmstadt aims at increasing the number of female members of<br>
staff.  We strongly encourage qualified women to apply. Disabled<br>
candidates will be preferentially treated if equally qualified.</p>
