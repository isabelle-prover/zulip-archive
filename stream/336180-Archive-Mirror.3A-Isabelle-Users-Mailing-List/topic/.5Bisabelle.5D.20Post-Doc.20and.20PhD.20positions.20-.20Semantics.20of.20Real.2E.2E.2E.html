<p>Salary: 27,319 - 35,646 pa</p>
<p>Limit of tenure: Up to 2 years</p>
<p>We are seeking a Post-Doctoral Research Associate to join a lively<br>
group working on the semantics of real-world computer systems, with a<br>
focus on the relaxed-memory concurrency they exhibit.  Current<br>
projects include work on the memory models of multiprocessors (x86,<br>
Power, ARM) and of programming languages (C++0X/C1X, Java), verified<br>
compilation of concurrent programming languages to multiprocessors,<br>
the semantic theory of relaxed-memory concurrency, and the development<br>
of tool support for semantics.</p>
<p>You should have a keen interest in applying rigorous semantic<br>
techniques to real-world systems, with a strong background in one or<br>
more of the following:</p>
<p>* Programming Language Semantics<br>
    * Automated Proof Assistants<br>
    * Relaxed Memory Models<br>
    * Program Verification</p>
<p>The position is funded by the EPRSC grant EP/H005633,<br>

<p>PhD Studentships<br>
University of Cambridge - Faculty of Computer Science &amp; Technology</p>
<p>We are seeking two PhD students to join a lively group working on the<br>
semantics of real-world computer systems, with a focus on the<br>
relaxed-memory concurrency they exhibit.  Current projects include<br>
work on the memory models of multiprocessors (x86, Power, ARM) and of<br>
programming languages (C++0X/C1X, Java), verified compilation of<br>
concurrent programming languages to multiprocessors, the semantic<br>
theory of relaxed-memory concurrency, and the development of tool<br>
support for semantics.</p>
<p>You should have a keen interest in applying mathematically rigorous<br>
semantic techniques to real-world systems, ideally with experience in<br>
one or more of the following:</p>
<p>* Programming Language Semantics<br>
    * Automated Proof Assistants<br>
    * Relaxed Memory Models<br>
    * Program Verification</p>
<p>Informal enquiries should be addressed to Peter Sewell<br>
(<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/</a>), including a Curriculum Vitae and a<br>
brief statement of your background and interests.</p>
<p>The positions are funded by the EPRSC grant EP/H005633,<br>
<a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/H005633/1">http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/H005633/1</a>.</p>
<p>For UK/EU students this covers a stipend and fees.  For October 2011<br>
entry, applications should ideally be received by December 1 2010<br>
(applications for earlier start dates may also be considered).</p>
<p>Non-UK/EU students will require additional funding for the higher<br>
level of fees. Exceptional non-EU candidates may be considered for<br>
nomination to the Gates Cambridge Trust and Cambridge International<br>
Scholarship competitions.  The application deadline (for October 2011<br>
entry) for these is October 15 2010 for US applicants and December 1<br>
for non-US applicants (note that applications must be complete by<br>
these deadlines, including transcripts, references, degree<br>
certificates, and research proposal).</p>
<p>More information on the formal application process is here:<br>
