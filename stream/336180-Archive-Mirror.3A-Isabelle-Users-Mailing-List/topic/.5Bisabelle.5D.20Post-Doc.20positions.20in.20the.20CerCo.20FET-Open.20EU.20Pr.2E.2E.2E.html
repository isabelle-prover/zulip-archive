<p>From: Paolo Tranquilli &lt;<a href="mailto:tranquil@cs.unibo.it">tranquil@cs.unibo.it</a>&gt;<br>
=== Two New Post-Doc positions in the CerCo FET-Open EU Project ===</p>
<p>** Job duration: 01/07/2012-30/06/2013 (one year)<br>
** Deadline for reception of candidatures: 29/06/2011</p>
<p>We are currently looking for two Post-Doc positions at the Department of<br>
Computer Science, University of Bologna, to work on the CerCo FET-Open<br>
EU Project (see description below). The gross salary is 26174 euros per<br>
year. Only a minimal amount of taxes is due.</p>
<p>The University of Bologna is the oldest running western university and the<br>
Department of Computer Science (<a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/en/">http://www.cs.unibo.it/en/</a>), located in<br>
the historic city center, has strong expertise in theoretical computer<br>
science and logic and it participates to several national and<br>
international projects. The Post-Doc will join the HELM team, leaded by<br>
Prof. Asperti, whose members work in the domains of Type Theory and<br>
Mathematical Knowledge Management. The CerCo project is headed by<br>
Dr. Sacerdoti Coen. The candidates will benefit from exchange opportunity<br>
with the other project participants (University Paris-Diderot, Paris,<br>
and University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh). The candidates will not have any<br>
teaching duties.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>We are looking for candidates with a Ph.D. in Computer Science and<br>
previous experience in Type Theory (in particular Interactive<br>
Theorem Proving), and being proficient in functional programming languages.<br>
We also accept candidates that will defend their Ph.D. thesis in the near<br>
future, if they can provide a formal proof that they will.</p>
<p>Starting date:</p>
<p>The proposed starting date is the 01/07/2012. The contract is for one<br>
year. The candidate should contact sacerdot at <a href="http://cs.unibo.it">cs.unibo.it</a> for further<br>
information.</p>
<p>Project description:</p>
<p>The CerCo FET-Open EU Project is aimed at producing the first _formally_<br>
_verified_ _complexity_preserving_ compiler for a subset of C to the<br>
object code for a microprocessor used in embedded systems. The output of<br>
the compilation process will be the object code and a copy of the source<br>
code annotated with _exact_ computational complexities for each program<br>
slice in O(1). The exact computational complexities (expressed in clock<br>
cycles and parametric in the program input) can then be used to formally<br>
reason on the overall code complexity. The source code of the compiler<br>
will be formally verified using the Matita Interactive Theorem Prover<br>
(<a href="http://matita.cs.unibo.it">http://matita.cs.unibo.it</a>), based on a variant of the Calculus of<br>
(Co)Inductive Constructions. The candidate will contribute to the formal<br>
proof of correctness of the compiler.</p>
<p>How to submit candidatures:</p>
<p>All candidates are invited to get in touch in advance with Dr. Claudio<br>
Sacerdoti Coen &lt;sacerdot at <a href="http://cs.unibo.it">cs.unibo.it</a>&gt;, submitting a curriculum vitae.</p>
<p>The official candidature must be received by standard mail (no<br>
electronic submission) before the 29/06/2011. Candidates must fill in the<br>
forms (in Italian only) that can be found at the following address:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aric.unibo.it/AssegniRicerca/BandiPubblicati/zz_Bandi_din.aspx">https://www.aric.unibo.it/AssegniRicerca/BandiPubblicati/zz_Bandi_din.aspx</a><br>
(look for the word "Matita" in the second column)</p>
<p>Candidates must also attach two recommendation letters.</p>
<p>Foreign candidates will be helped in compiling the forms.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
  Paolo Tranquilli</p>
