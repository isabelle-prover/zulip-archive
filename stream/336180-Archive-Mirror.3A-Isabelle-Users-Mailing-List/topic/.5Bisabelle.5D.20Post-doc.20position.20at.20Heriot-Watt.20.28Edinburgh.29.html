<p>From: Gudmund Grov &lt;<a href="mailto:gudmundgrov@gmail.com">gudmundgrov@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Post-doc position in Tactics for Program Verifiers</p>
<p>The Research Associate will work on the EPSRC project "DTacs - Program<br>
Verifier Tactics : Reducing the Development Time for Program Verifiers<br>
with Re-usable Verification Strategies".  This project  addresses a<br>
new method for proof automation for the Dafny program verifier by<br>
developing support for user-provided and re-usable proof patterns. The<br>
end goal is to liberate users from low-level and repetitive search<br>
tasks by replacing these with higher-level underlying patterns that<br>
can be reused for similar tasks; increasing automation and reducing<br>
development time and cost.</p>
<p>The work is inspired by proof tactics used to encode reasoning<br>
patterns for interactive theorem provers. The novelty of the `Dafny<br>
tactics' we seek to develop is that proof patterns will be encoded as<br>
special Dafny methods within the program text, making them accessible<br>
to a wider group of users. We are therefore seeking a candidate with<br>
expertise in tactic languages (for interactive theorem provers) and/or<br>
expertise with program verifiers. The successful candidate will work<br>
closely with the investigator in developing the concept of Dafny<br>
tactics, and will therefore be integral in shaping this new and<br>
exciting research area. Project collaborators include Microsoft<br>
Research (Redmond, USA) and NUI Maynooth (Ireland), and the successful<br>
candidate will have the opportunity to make research visits to these<br>
sites. The work will involve analysis of existing Dafny case studies,<br>
as well as developing new examples from scratch.  It is therefore<br>
desirable to have experience with formal development of software. A<br>
key outcome of the project will be a prototype implementation of Dafny<br>
tactics. Good programming skills are therefore essential, and<br>
familiarity with C# and Visual Studio are desirable.  The successful<br>
candidate should also be able to communicate effectively with people<br>
from other disciplines, and will be expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute to conference papers and journal articles</li>
<li>Present research outputs at project meetings and international conferences</li>
<li>Communicate and collaborate with project partners</li>
<li>Demonstrate good time management skills</li>
</ul>
<p>The post is available for twelve months. Candidates should have, or be<br>
near to completing, a PhD in formal methods or automated reasoning, or<br>
a similar area. Experience with formal verification is essential, and<br>
experience with program verification, in particular Dafny, and<br>
interactive theorem proving and collaborative research is also<br>
desirable. Candidates should have good programming and software<br>
development skills, be comfortable working to tight deadlines, working<br>
with other people, and be able to communicate complex ideas<br>
effectively in person and in writing.</p>
