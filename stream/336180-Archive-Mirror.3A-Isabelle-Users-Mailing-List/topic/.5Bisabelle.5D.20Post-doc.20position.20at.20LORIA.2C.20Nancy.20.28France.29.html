<p>Research team: MOSEL team at INRIA Lorraine, LORIA (<a href="http://www.loria.fr/">http://www.loria.fr/</a>)<br>
/<br>
INRIA proposes post-doctoral positions for young graduates to a maximum <br>
of two years.<br>
The salary is 2,320€ gross per month.<br>
/<br>
Research subject: Proof traces and proof reconstruction for automatic <br>
and interactive provers</p>
<p>Research context :</p>
<p>The objective of our work is the construction of a verification <br>
environment that combines specialized automated reasoners within an <br>
interactive reasoning framework. We intend to demonstrate that one can <br>
in this way significantly raise the degree of automation for the <br>
verification of complex systems and thus contribute to make deductive <br>
verification techniques economically viable. In order to ensure the <br>
overall correctness of a proof, the automated reasoning tools produce <br>
justifications that are certified by the interactive proof assistant. In <br>
this way, both the result of the external reasoner and the translations <br>
between the different syntactic representations are verified. Contrary <br>
to proof search, proof checking is of low polynomial complexity. We have <br>
validated this approach by combining Isabelle with SAT solvers and with <br>
the SMT solver haRVey for fragments of first-order logic, including <br>
equality reasoning. The goal of the post-doctoral research proposed here <br>
is to extend the approach, to make it more robust, and to improve the <br>
efficiency.</p>
<p>Description of the activity of the post-doc :</p>
<p>The post-doctoral researcher will investigate techniques for<br>
• improving our existing combination techniques. Some care will be <br>
directed to efficiency for the certification of large proofs: proof <br>
obligations arising from verification problems can be large, and <br>
interactive proof assistants are typically not optimized for <br>
representing large formulas. A promising approach may be to use <br>
reflection techniques to produce a verified certification tool.<br>
• extending the combination techniques beyond the fragments of <br>
first-order logic that are currently handled, and in particular to take <br>
into account decidable fragments of arithmetic reasoning.<br>
In order to obtain a comprehensive framework, the exchange of proofs <br>
should be based on a general-purpose format for representing formal <br>
proofs; we are involved in an international standardization effort in <br>
which the post-doc will naturally participate.<br>
The developed techniques will be evaluated by applying them on theories <br>
that are already supported by haRVey or for which support is currently <br>
being implemented – with a particular interest for arithmetics – but <br>
also by using them for the integration of generic first-order logic <br>
automatic provers such as Spass or the E-prover. We mainly think of <br>
Isabelle as the targeted proof assistant, but application to other <br>
interactive frameworks, such as Coq, would be useful, also as a means to <br>
demonstrate that the technique is independent of a specific proof assistant.<br>
Finally, it will be important to measure the improvement brought by the <br>
combination of deductive tools on real case studies; our main interest <br>
is in the verification of distributed algorithms, including <br>
communication protocols for embedded systems such as FlexRay.<br>
The research directions mentioned above are indicative of our interests <br>
in this field; the precise subjects of research will be determined <br>
jointly with the candidate. Part of this work will be carried out in <br>
close contact with the Isabelle group in Munich and with other <br>
international research teams.</p>
<p>Competences and profile :</p>
<p>The candidate should have experience in interactive and, if possible, <br>
automatic theorem proving, and should be interested in combining <br>
foundational research on calculi and logics with hands-on <br>
implementation. The main languages of implementation are C and ML.<br>
The candidates must have defended their doctoral thesis between May 2006 <br>
and end of 2007.</p>
