<em>Post-doctoral Research Position in Concurrent Software Verification</em></p>
<p>We are seeking an exceptional researcher for a project on the design and <br>
verification of correct, efficient and secure concurrent systems. The <br>
position is for 3 years and is based at the University of Queensland <br>
(UQ), Brisbane, Australia and funded by an Australian Research Council <br>
(ARC) Discovery Grant.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to provide design and verification methods <br>
for correct, efficient and secure concurrent computer software, in a <br>
manner that supports both modular design and compositional reasoning, <br>
and that has mechanised support using modern theorem provers to help <br>
eliminate human error and automate the verification task.</p>

<p>The position is part of an ARC Discovery Project under the supervision <br>
of Prof. Ian Hayes and Dr Larissa Meinicke (UQ) and in collaboration <br>
with Dr Brijesh Dongol (Surrey University, UK), Dr Peter Höfner (Data61, <br>
Sydney) and Prof. Cliff Jones (Newcastle University, UK).</p>
<p><em>The person</em></p>
<p>Applicants should possess a PhD in Computer Science or Software Engineering.</p>
<p>You should have demonstrated expert knowledge formal methods of software <br>
development, experience in using an interactive theorem prover such as <br>
Isabelle/HOL, demonstrated high-level written and oral communication <br>
skills, publication of research findings in peer reviewed <br>
journals/conferences and experience in student project supervision</p>
<p>Experience with formal methods for concurrent systems such as the <br>
rely/guarantee approach or concurrent separation logic is highly desirable.</p>
<p><em>Remuneration</em></p>
<p>This is a full-time, fixed term appointment for 3 years at level A/B.</p>
<p>The remuneration package for Academic Level A will be in the range $81, <br>
827 - $90,982 p.a., plus employer superannuation contributions of up to <br>
17% (total package will be in the range $95,738 - $106,449p.a.), where <br>
the salaries are in Australian dollars.</p>
<p>The remuneration package for Academic Level B will be in the range <br>
$95,771 - $113,728p.a., plus employer superannuation contributions of up <br>
to 17% (total package will be in the range $112,052 - $133,061p.a.).</p>
