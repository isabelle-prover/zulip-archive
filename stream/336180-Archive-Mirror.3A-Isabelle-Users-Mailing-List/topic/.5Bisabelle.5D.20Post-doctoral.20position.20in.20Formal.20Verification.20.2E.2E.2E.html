<p>Post-doctoral position in Formal Verification<br>
Portland State University</p>
<hr>
<p>Applications are invited for a post-doctoral research position at<br>
Portland State University in the area of formal verification and its<br>
applications to network and systems software.</p>
<p>The hosting project, SOUND (Safety on Untrusted Network Devices), is a<br>
new joint effort with researchers at the University of Pennsylvania<br>
(UPenn) and BAE Systems, funded as part of the DARPA MRC<br>
(Mission-Oriented Resilient Clouds) program.  The goal of SOUND is to<br>
construct distributed systems that are highly resilient against<br>
cyber-attack, using new ideas in protocols, authentication, and<br>
auditing. SOUND is also closely integrated with the existing SAFE<br>
(Semantically Aware Foundation Environment) project, hosted at UPenn,<br>
Harvard, Northeastern, and BAE.  SAFE is designing a highly secure<br>
host architecture, taking a completely clean-slate approach to the<br>
processor, programming language, and operating system.  SAFE hosts<br>
will be used as reliable components within SOUND networks.</p>
<p>At Portland State, we will apply formal verification at multiple<br>
levels---specification, algorithms and protocols, and<br>
implementation---to increase assurance of both SAFE and SOUND.  Our<br>
initial efforts will build on our experience producing verified<br>
implementations of runtime-system components using the Coq proof<br>
assistant in the context of the HASP/HARTS project. This post-doc<br>
position offers an opportunity to put formal methods to work to attack<br>
critical problems in the security of our cyber-infrastructure, in<br>
collaboration with leading researchers in secure systems and<br>
languages, and within a highly visible program.</p>
<p>The ideal candidate will have a Ph.D. in Computer Science with<br>
expertise in formal verification (for example, using Coq, Isabelle, or<br>
similar tools) and in one or more of the following areas: security,<br>
networking, and systems software.  This position initially runs<br>
through September 2012 with the possibility of renewal for up to three<br>
years total duration. Review of applications will begin immediately.<br>
The position will remain open until finalists are identified.  Start<br>
date is negotiable, but ideally within a few months. Starting salary<br>
is $60,000 per year, plus generous health and vacation benefits.</p>

<p>To apply, please send a CV together with a brief description of your<br>
research accomplishments and interests, including the names of three<br>
references, to sound-adm 'at' <a href="http://cs.pdx.edu">cs.pdx.edu</a>. Please include the phrase<br>
"SOUND Postdoc" in the subject line.  Questions about the position<br>
may be sent directly to Andrew Tolmach (apt 'at' <a href="http://cs.pdx.edu">cs.pdx.edu</a>).</p>
<p>Portland State University is an Affirmative Action, Equal Opportunity<br>
institution and welcomes applications from candidates who support<br>
diversity.</p>
