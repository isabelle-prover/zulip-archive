<p>Post-doctoral position in interactive theorem proving<br>
Computational Logic Center<br>
Department of Computer Science<br>
The University of Iowa</p>
<hr>
<p>Applications are invited for a post-doctoral research position in the <br>
Computational Logic Center at the University of Iowa in the area of <br>
interactive theorem proving and verification.</p>
<p>The position is funded by DARPA through the HACMS program. The work will <br>
be done in collaboration with researchers at New York University, the <br>
Université Paris Sud and Princeton University. The main goal of the <br>
project is to increase the level of automation in the Coq proof <br>
assistant by soundly integrating SMT solvers into it. Our immediate <br>
emphasis is on supporting software verification efforts by other <br>
research groups currently funded by HAMCS. However, we expect that the <br>
results of the integration will benefit Coq users in general.</p>
<p>The ideal candidate will have a Ph.D. in Computer Science, general <br>
knowledge of formal methods, and expertise in interactive theorem <br>
proving in higher-order logics, with substantial experience in using <br>
Coq, Isabelle, or similar tools. Candidates should demonstrate strong <br>
programming and formal modeling skills. Previous experience in writing <br>
Coq tactics and plug-ins is a considerable plus. Familiarity with SMT is <br>
welcome but not required.</p>
<p>The position is a full time appointment that runs initially through <br>
August 2016 and could be renewed for another year subject to <br>
satisfactory performance and continuous availability of funds. Review of <br>
applications will begin immediately. The position will remain open until <br>
filled. The start date is negotiable, but ideally it should be as soon <br>
as possible. The starting salary is $56,000 per year, plus health and <br>
vacation benefits.</p>
<p>Depending on the candidate's interests, there might be also be a <br>
possibility to teach one course in the spring semester in the Computer <br>
Science department as a visiting assistant professor. This is, however, <br>
a separate position that would entail a corresponding reduction of <br>
effort for the postdoc appointment. It should be understood as an <br>
opportunity, not as a requirement for the postdoc contract.</p>
<p>Inquiries and applications should be sent via email to <br>
<a href="mailto:cesare-tinelli@uiowa.edu">cesare-tinelli@uiowa.edu</a> with "Coq postdoc" in the subject. When sending <br>
an application please include your CV together with a brief description <br>
of your research accomplishments and interests, including the names of <br>
three references.</p>

<p>The Computational Logic Center at the University of Iowa is jointly <br>
headed by Professors Aaron Stump and Cesare Tinelli. In recent years, it <br>
has consisted on average of two faculty members, 3-5 postdocs, 6-7 PhD <br>
students and a few master's and undergraduate students. Its work has <br>
been funded by the AFRL, AFOSR, DARPA, NASA, NSF, Intel, Rockwell <br>
Collins, and United Technologies.<br>
Its main areas of research are automated deduction, satisfiability <br>
modulo theories, software verification, model checking, <br>
verified-programming languages, and foundations of programming <br>
languages. The center has a strong emphasis on theoretical foundations <br>
but is also known for a number of languages and tools co-developed with <br>
external partners and used in academia and industry. These include the <br>
SMT-LIB standard, the CVC3 and CVC4 SMT solvers, the Kind and Kind 2 <br>
model checkers, the LFSC proof framework and checker, the Darwin theorem <br>
prover, and the StarExec solver execution service.</p>
