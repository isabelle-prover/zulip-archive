<p>From: Zhong Shao &lt;<a href="mailto:shao@cs.yale.edu">shao@cs.yale.edu</a>&gt;<br>
[Apology for possible cross-postings!]</p>
<p>The Department of Computer Science at Yale University is seeking<br>
applicants for PostDoc and PhD positions in the broad area of<br>
certified software. The successful applicants will be expected to<br>
participate in a rigorous research program on topics such as<br>
programming languages, formal semantics, certified operating systems,<br>
program verification, proof assistants and automation, concurrency and<br>
coordination, language-based security, and certifying compilers.</p>
<p>The programming languages and operating systems group, led jointly by<br>
Professors Zhong Shao and Bryan Ford at Yale, is embarking on a<br>
multi-year effort to develop a new certified OS kernel that<br>
generalizes and unifies traditional OS abstractions in microkernels<br>
and hypervisors. The new effort advocates a modular certification<br>
framework for OS kernel components, which mirrors and enhances the<br>
modularity of the kernel itself.  Using this framework, it aims to<br>
create not just a "one-off" lump of verified kernel code, but a<br>
statically and dynamically extensible kernel that can be incrementally<br>
built and extended with individual certified modules, each of which<br>
will provably preserve the kernel's overall safety and security<br>
properties.</p>
<p>Important research questions include but are not limited to: what OS<br>
kernel structures can offer the best support for extensibility,<br>
security, and resilience? what program logics and semantic models can<br>
best capture these abstractions? what are the right programming<br>
languages and environments for developing such certified kernel?  and<br>
how to build new automation facilities to make certified software<br>
really scale?</p>
<p>Successful applicants should have a combination of creativity,<br>
self-motivation, and strong interests on applying programming language<br>
theory or formal methods to solve practical problems. </p>
<p>Applicants for PostDoc positions must have a Ph.D. in Computer Science<br>
or a closely related field. The term of a PostDoc position is one year<br>
with an option to renew for up to four years. Starting date is<br>
negotiable (a preference will be given to those who can start by<br>
Spring 2011).</p>
<p>Interested applicants for PostDoc positions should email a CV, research <br>
statement, and the names of three references with their email addresses <br>
and phone numbers to Zhong Shao (Email: zhong.shao at <a href="http://yale.edu">yale.edu</a>).</p>
<p>PhD positions (with full guaranteed financial support) are also<br>
available. Applicants interested in pursuing PhD studies can email<br>
either PI but should still submit their applications directly to the<br>
Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (the deadline for Fall 2011<br>
admission is January 2nd, 2011).</p>
<p>More information regarding this research effort can be found in a<br>
white paper available at &lt;<a href="http://flint.cs.yale.edu/ctos">http://flint.cs.yale.edu/ctos</a>&gt; or at the two<br>
PIs' research web sites &lt;<a href="http://flint.cs.yale.edu">http://flint.cs.yale.edu</a>&gt; and<br>
&lt;<a href="http://dedis.cs.yale.edu">http://dedis.cs.yale.edu</a>&gt;. Inquiries can be directed to any PI.</p>
