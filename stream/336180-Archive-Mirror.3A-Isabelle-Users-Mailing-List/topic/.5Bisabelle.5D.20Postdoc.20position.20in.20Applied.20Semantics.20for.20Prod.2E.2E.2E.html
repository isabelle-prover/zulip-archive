<p>Do you want to help build mathematically rigorous foundations for<br>
real-world computing, to make it more robust and secure?</p>
<p>We have an ongoing project to establish rigorous semantic models for<br>
production multiprocessors, to provide a clear basis for programming,<br>
software verification, and hardware verification. This involves long-term<br>
close collaborations with ARM and IBM, and we have an agreement with ARM to<br>
take their internal ISA description, build a mathematical model based on<br>
it, integrate it with the concurrency semantics we are developing, and<br>
release the whole in a form usable for verification. This will provide the<br>
first strongly validated public model for a production multiprocessor<br>
architecture. We also have a close collaboration with the CHERI research<br>
project, developing processors with hardware-accelerated in-process memory<br>
protection and sandboxing, together with an open-source operating system<br>
and toolchain based on FreeBSD and Clang/LLVM; formal modelling is at the<br>
heart of the CHERI design process. For more details, see some of our<br>
previous papers:<br>

<p>We have a position available to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the development of our Sail metalanguage for ISA description: a language<br>
with a lightweight dependent type system, designed to capture ARM, IBM<br>
POWER, and CHERI instruction semantics in an engineer-friendly way;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>translation from Sail to generate efficient emulators and usable<br>
theorem-prover definitions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mechanised proof about the architecture definitions, e.g. of security<br>
properties, relationships between concurrency models, and correctness<br>
results for high-level language concurrency compilation; and/or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>development of reasoning, symbolic execution, debugging, and/or<br>
model-checking tools above the architecture definitions - the initial work<br>
should generate many opportunities along these lines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The successful candidate must have a PhD (or equivalent experience), a<br>
track-record of publication in relevant areas of Computer Science, good<br>
knowledge of English and communication skills, and the expertise and<br>
commitment to apply rigorous semantics to real systems. We're looking for<br>
people with the skills to make solid models and tools, well-engineered and<br>
widely usable. You should have expertise in one or more of:</p>
<ul>
<li>functional programming (e.g. OCaml)</li>
<li>programming language semantics and type systems</li>
<li>theorem provers, especially Isabelle and/or Coq</li>
<li>symbolic execution</li>
<li>model-checking</li>
</ul>
<p>For senior applicants, e.g. who will be able to contribute substantially to<br>
future grant applications, it may be possible to appoint at the Senior<br>
Research Associate level.</p>
<p>This is part of the broader REMS (Rigorous Engineering for Mainstream<br>
Systems) programme grant: a lively collaboration between systems and<br>
semantics researchers in Cambridge, Imperial, and Edinburgh to scale up and<br>
apply mathematically rigorous semantics to mainstream systems.</p>
