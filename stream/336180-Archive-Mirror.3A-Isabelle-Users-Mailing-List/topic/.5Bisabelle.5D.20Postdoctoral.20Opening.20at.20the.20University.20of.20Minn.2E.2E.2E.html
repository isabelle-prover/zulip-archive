<p>From: Gopalan Nadathur &lt;<a href="mailto:gopalan@cs.umn.edu">gopalan@cs.umn.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Applications are invited for a one-year postdoctoral position at the<br>
University of Minnesota related to an NSF-funded project entitled<br>
"Reasoning about Specifications of Computations." The position is<br>
available immediately: to guarantee consideration, applications must<br>
be received before September 7, 2012.</p>
<p>The project within which the appointment is to be made concerns the<br>
areas of computational logic and programming languages. To be suitable<br>
for the position, the candidate should be broadly conversant with the<br>
issues in these areas and should have the mathematical and programming<br>
skills necessary for conducting research in them. Moreover, with<br>
suitable mentoring, he/she should be capable of developing an<br>
independent research agenda that encompasses some of the following<br>
topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the design of logics for specifying computational systems and<br>
   for reasoning about such specifications,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the implementation of systems embodying such logics, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of the implemented systems in constructing actual<br>
   specifications and reasoning about them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Facility with proof assistants and logical frameworks such as Coq,<br>
Isabelle and Twelf, an understanding of proof theoretic treatments of<br>
aspects such as induction and co-induction and familiarity with issues<br>
related to proof search in sequent calculi and related logical systems<br>
would be needed for participating in the research at the appropriate<br>
level. A specific focus for the project is the Abella system (see<br>
<a href="http://abella.cs.umn.edu">http://abella.cs.umn.edu</a>), developed originally at the University of<br>
Minnesota and currently also the subject of work within the Parsifal<br>
project at Ecole Polytechnique and INRIA, Saclay. The ideal candidate<br>
would have an interest in further developing the capabilities of this<br>
system and its applications during the appointment period.</p>
<p>To apply for this position, go to the U of M Employment System at<br>
<a href="https://employment.umn.edu/">https://employment.umn.edu/</a> and search postings with req#: 179943. The<br>
online application process will require you to submit a current CV and<br>
a brief research statement that should describe past research and<br>
future plans in a way that addresses appropriateness for the position<br>
advertised. Please also provide names, phone numbers and email<br>
addresses of two or three references as part of this material; these<br>
references may be contacted as part of the application review process.<br>
Note that a prerequisite for employment is a doctoral degree in<br>
Computer Science or closely related field.</p>
<p>Interested individuals are encouraged to contact Gopalan Nadathur at<br>

suitability of an application.</p>

<p>From: Gopalan Nadathur &lt;<a href="mailto:gopalan@cs.umn.edu">gopalan@cs.umn.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Applications are invited for a one-year postdoctoral position at the<br>
University of Minnesota related to an NSF-funded project entitled "A<br>
Higher-Order Framework for Meta-Theoretic Reasoning." The position is<br>
available immediately and reviews of applications will be conducted as they<br>
are received.</p>
<p>The project within which the appointment is to be made concerns the<br>
development of a framework that supports the encoding of rule-based<br>
relational specifications and the process of reasoning about such<br>
specifications through the encoding. A defining characteristic of the<br>
project is its focus on the so-called higher-order abstract syntax approach<br>
to representing objects that embody a binding structure. Ongoing work is<br>
aimed at developing systems for reasoning about specifications encoded in<br>
linear logic as well as in the dependently typed lambda calculus LF. The<br>
group is also interested in furthering its earlier work that has<br>
demonstrated the benefits of higher-order representations of syntax in the<br>
verification of compilers and transformers for functional programming<br>
languages. Another direction of investigation is that of enhancing the<br>
logic underlying the  Abella proof assistant (see <a href="http://abella-prover.org">http://abella-prover.org</a>)<br>
with the capability of predicate quantification and on exhibiting the<br>
usefulness of such an enhancement through a collection of targeted<br>
reasoning applications. The successful candidate will be expected to<br>
participate in and help lead the work in some of these directions.</p>
<p>To be suitable for the position, the candidate should be broadly conversant<br>
with the areas of computational logic and programming languages and should<br>
have the mathematical and programming skills necessary for conducting<br>
research in them. Some particular facets that would be help in engaging<br>
immediately with the research problems are a prior exposure to a proof<br>
assistant or logical framework such as Coq, Isabelle or Abella, programming<br>
experience with a functional language such as OCaml, an understanding of<br>
proof theoretic treatments of aspects such as induction and co-induction,<br>
and familiarity with issues related to proof search in sequent calculi and<br>
similar logical systems.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me (Gopalan Nadathur, <a href="mailto:ngopalan@umn.edu">ngopalan@umn.edu</a>) for<br>
more details about the topics of research within the project, the necessary<br>

<p>This site also provides details about how to apply and serves as the portal<br>
for applications. The application process will require you to submit a<br>
letter indicating your interest, a current CV, one or two of your papers<br>
broadly related to the topics of research and the names and contact details<br>
for two references who might be contacted as part of the application review<br>
process. Note that a prerequisite for employment is a doctoral degree in<br>
