<p>The Carnegie Mellon Department of Philosophy invites applications for <br>
the Herbert Simon Fellowship in Scientific Philosophy. We are seeking <br>
applications from scholars working in logic or philosophy of mathematics <br>
(including its history). Applications in the following areas of logic <br>
are particularly welcome: proof theory, category theory, categorical <br>
logic, formal verification, and automated proof search. The Fellowship <br>
is intended primarily for those who have recently received doctorates, <br>
including scholars with a continuing faculty appointment elsewhere. The <br>
Fellowship has a tenure of two years (non-renewable), with teaching <br>
duties of 2 courses/year, one of which should be a research seminar in <br>
the Fellow's specialty. Appointments of one year are possible for <br>
applicants with a continuing faculty appointment elsewhere. Residence in <br>
Pittsburgh is expected. Applications (including a statement of purpose, <br>
CV, at least one writing sample and two letters of reference) may be <br>
sent to: The Philosophy Department; Carnegie Mellon University; <br>
Pittsburgh PA 15213. Attention: Simon Fellowship Committee. Electronic <br>
applications, preferably in pdf format enclosed as attachments, are <br>
welcome and indeed preferred. Send email to: <a href="mailto:phil-search@andrew.cmu.edu">phil-search@andrew.cmu.edu</a>. <br>
The deadline for application is December 1, 2010.</p>
