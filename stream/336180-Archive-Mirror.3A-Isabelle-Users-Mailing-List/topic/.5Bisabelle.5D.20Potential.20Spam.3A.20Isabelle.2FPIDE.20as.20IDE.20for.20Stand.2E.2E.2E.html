<p>From: Michael Norrish &lt;<a href="mailto:michael.norrish@nicta.com.au">michael.norrish@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
Some minor criticisms: the Isabelle/ML handling of string constants is<br>
contaminating SML in this mode.</p>
<p>The lexeme "\&lt;forall&gt;" is not a valid string literal in SML (Poly, mlton and<br>
Moscow ML, certainly agree with me), but it's fine in a file being interpreted<br>
with SML_file.</p>
<p>The SML_file mode also rejects "\\&lt;" as a string literal, which is incorrect.</p>
<p>Similarly, the string literal "∀" (UTF-8 encoding) is interpreted as if it were<br>
"\&lt;forall&gt;".  It's perhaps arguable what SML really requires of "∀":  mlton and<br>
Poly/ML both see it as an error; Moscow ML accepts it as a string of size 3.  If<br>
mlton and Poly/ML were to accept it, I expect they would follow Moscow ML and<br>
evaluate</p>
<p>"∀" = "\226\136\128"</p>
<p>to true.  The SML_file facility does not.</p>
<p>Worse, if I load a file with a genuine occurrence of the UTF-8 encoded "∀", then<br>
the IDE will silently write it out to disk as "\&lt;forall&gt;" when the file is<br>
saved.  This even happens if the ∀ occurs bare in a comment.  I find this<br>
disturbing.</p>
<p>More importantly, only some special characters get this treatment.  If I write</p>
<p>String.explode "大学";</p>
<p>the IDE (at least on my machine) just displays black boxes in the edit window,<br>
but does decompose the sequence into the UTF-8 encoding as chars:</p>
<p>val it = [#"\229", #"\164", #"\167", #"\229", #"\173", #"\166"]: char list</p>
<p>So, not only is the SML mode perhaps deviating from the standard by accepting<br>
string literals like "∀" and "大学", but it's doing so in a confusing way: some<br>
string literals are silently turned into \&lt;....&gt; forms, and others are not.</p>
<p>Note that this is also a minor annoyance in Isabelle proper.  Users can't access<br>
files called ∀.c by passing that name as written to an Isabelle/ML routine.<br>
Instead they have to write  \226\136\128.c</p>

<p>That is not a "lexeme", but an "Isabelle symbol".  This concept is below <br>
the lexical syntax, like \uXXXX in Java.  It is documented in the <br>
"implementation" and "isar-ref" manual.</p>
<p>The deeper question here is how plain 7 bit ASCII -- the only universal <br>
text representation standard that actually works -- can be extended to do <br>
a bit more, without breaking too many things.  Unicode with its many <br>
uncertainties does break a lot.  The UTF-8 encoding could be called <br>
half-decent today, but the JVM uses the older UTF-16, which causes many <br>
headaches.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Formally that is a "malformed symbol".  One could try harder to accept <br>
that.  The question is if this is of practical relevance.  Are there <br>
concrete SML programs where this happens?</p>
<p>We don't have millions of SML projects around.  So it might be simpler to <br>
change these, e.g. by using "\\" ^ "&lt;".</p>
<p>In Isabelle/PIDE, the support for "auxiliary files" is limited to <br>
something that conforms to Isabelle text represented with this special <br>
symbol notation.  So far I have never seen practical problems, by mere <br>
luck.  If there are concrete counter-examples, we can think about concrete <br>
counter-measures to avoid problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the string literal "∀" (UTF-8 encoding) is interpreted as if <br>
it were "\&lt;forall&gt;".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a additional aspect.  The PIDE default encoding is UTF-8-Isabelle, <br>
which identifies certain Unicode points with certain Isabelle symbols, as <br>
specified in the cumulative etc/symbols files of the Isabelle system <br>
installation.</p>
<p>Encoding for Unicode introduce inherent unreliably.  In practice one <br>
normally commits to just one encoding.  For Isabelle, the above does the <br>
job without too many people ever noticing the point.</p>
<p>For pure SML, one could try harder to conform to strict UTF-8, but again <br>
the question is practical relevance.  Traditionally, SML never really <br>
supported Unicode anyway, so it cannot be relied on in existing programs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's perhaps arguable what SML really requires of "∀":  mlton and<br>
Poly/ML both see it as an error; Moscow ML accepts it as a string of size 3.  If<br>
mlton and Poly/ML were to accept it, I expect they would follow Moscow ML and<br>
evaluate</p>
<p>"∀" = "\226\136\128"</p>
<p>to true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such things are generally dangerous in Unicode.  Even with a well-defined <br>
encoding, so-called "combining sequences" introduce some uncertainty about <br>
the actual text content.  Do you mean before or after normalization?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Worse, if I load a file with a genuine occurrence of the UTF-8 encoded <br>
"∀", then the IDE will silently write it out to disk as "\&lt;forall&gt;" <br>
when the file is saved.  This even happens if the ∀ occurs bare in a <br>
comment.  I find this disturbing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is quite well documented in the Isabelle/PIDE documentation and <br>
literature.  You could disable these conversions by removing all <br>
etc/symbols files.  For Isabelle that would be very impractical.  For SML <br>
it could be done, if there were a real need for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this is also a minor annoyance in Isabelle proper.  Users can't access<br>
files called ∀.c by passing that name as written to an Isabelle/ML routine.<br>
Instead they have to write  \226\136\128.c</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does that have any practical relevance, or is it just a synthetic example <br>
to break the system?</p>
<p>Unicode file-names are a sure way to ask for trouble.  In conjunction with <br>
the "portable" JVM things are particularly fragile.  I have seen routine <br>
problems with Far Eastern file names on Windows and sometimes Linux. <br>
There are also problems with continental European diacritics on Windows.</p>
<p>I don't think that Unicode will ever get there to deliver something that <br>
just works everywhere and for everyone.  We can't just subscribe to a <br>
standard that is not a standard at all, but many of them with ongoing <br>
changes and no clear perspective.</p>

<p>I appreciate that all of these notions make sense in the context of Isabelle.<br>

Isabelle/ML.</p>

<p>Indeed, any SML program attempting to emit Isabelle symbols in a way that is<br>

<p>Of course there are workarounds.  I just hesitate to recommend a tool for<br>
general SML usage that doesn't quite implement SML.</p>

<p>I adjusted the seL4 C parser precisely to cope with Chinese in filenames (a<br>
user-reported problem).  So, yes, there was a problem with a Unicode filename,<br>
but luckily, I could create a system that worked.  The files were part of a C<br>
project that clearly did work in that context.  If the C infrastructure could<br>
cope with Unicode filenames, I felt I should try too.</p>

<p>That is an application of generating sources, which could be easily <br>
changed to emit "\027\027&lt;forall&gt;" instead.</p>
<p>BTW, "malformed symbol" above only refers to \&lt; not a proper \&lt;forall&gt;, <br>
but "\\&lt;forall&gt;" is also rejected due to the way how sources are passed <br>
through the system: text is always treated at Isabelle symbol boundaries.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the Prover IDE works with symbols at all. The UTF-8 <br>
that is occasionally seen in Coq sources does not work in that respect.</p>
<p>In any case, I would like to see real applications and real problems. <br>
Then one can find ways to make it work.  In contrast, the general problem <br>
of adding Unicode support everywhere and uniformly cannot be solved.</p>

<p>Such things can be made to suck less in a case-by-case basis.  I am doing <br>
it myself whenever it is feasible, but the general problem remains.  E.g. <br>
when you drag-and-drop files on some application, it depends on many <br>
side-conditions of the operating system desktop what really happens.</p>
