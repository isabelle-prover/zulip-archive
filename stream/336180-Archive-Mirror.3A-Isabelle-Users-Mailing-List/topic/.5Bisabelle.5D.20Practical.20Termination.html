<p>From: "Jens-D. Doll" &lt;<a href="mailto:jd@cococo.de">jd@cococo.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hello Rene and Isabelle developers,</p>
<p>having read your loop problems (vs. termination problems) for a while now  <br>
I would like to suggest an important improvement to your code, which might  <br>
remove infinite loops at once and forever.</p>
<p>When working for the industry in Hamburg in the 80s I was a programmer and  <br>
had to make sure that certain functions terminate definitely, which could  <br>
not be guaranteed by the recursive code. So I build a second stack in  <br>
parallel to the call stack, which was handled at each function entry. The  <br>
stack contained the names of the functions called and the simple check  <br>
consists of finding the just called function in the stack levels below the  <br>
current one. If found, there was a loop in the call sequence and gave a  <br>
hint that this might be an infinite one. The practical task was now to  <br>
identify a function</p>
<p>loopcheck(functionstack),</p>
<p>which predicted an infinite loop with a high probability. A first approach  <br>
should not be that difficult and later improvement of this method should  <br>
lead to non looping Isabelle code ...</p>
<p>Have a good Sunday,<br>
Jens</p>
