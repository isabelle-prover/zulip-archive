Dear Makarius Wenzel,<br>
dear Members of the Research Community,</p>
<p>The "tradeoff" argument concerning the "tradeoff in theoretical simplicity <br>
versus complexity required for practical applications of logic" given at<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-August/msg00084.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-August/msg00084.html</a><br>
reminds me of an e-mail discussion I had with Larry Paulson about natural <br>
deduction vs. axiomatic (Hilbert-style) deductive systems (with respect to <br>
automation). Of course, certain concessions cannot be avoided, and for <br>
automation, natural deduction (making metatheorems symbolically representable) <br>
is the only choice, although one would like to prefer a Hilbert-style system in <br>
which all rules of inference can be reduced to a single one, like in Q0. <br>
Nevertheless, one has to be aware that concessions for practical reasons (e.g., <br>
automation) are deviations from the "pure" logic, and while deviations <br>
concerning certain decisions are necessary, for all other decisions, the <br>
original concept remains, and the general design decisions still apply.</p>
<p>In the HOL handbook, this is reflected by Andrew Pitts' consideration regarding <br>
Q0:<br>
"From a logical point of view, it would be better to have a simpler <br>
substitution primitive, such as 'Rule R' of Andrews' logic Q0, and then to <br>
derive more complex rules from it." [Gordon/Melham, 1993, p. 213]<br>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/hol/mailman/message/35287517/">https://sourceforge.net/p/hol/mailman/message/35287517/</a></p>
<p>What Andrews calls "expressiveness" [Andrews, 2002, p. 205], is what I, vice <br>
versa, call "reducibility", and this concept is already implicit in Church's <br>
work (the simple theory of types), in which reducibility is omnipresent either <br>
as Currying (reducing functions of more than one argument to functions with <br>
only one argument, due to Schoenfinkel, implemented via lambda-conversion) or <br>
as the definability of the logical connectives (reducing them to combinations <br>
of a small set of primitive symbols).</p>
<p>Moreover, reducibility (expressiveness) is not just "theoretical simplicity". <br>
The reduction of symbols, variable binders, axioms, and rules of inference lays <br>
bare the inner logic of formal logic and mathematics, and reveals <br>
interdependencies between them. This holds for both interdependencies within <br>
each field (e.g., for rules: between primitive and derived rules, for symbols: <br>
between primitive and defined symbols, etc.) as well as interdependencies among <br>
the fields (e.g., the derivability of the rule of modus ponens from a certain <br>
set of rules and axioms). (Also independence: In Andrews' Q0, it is shown that <br>
elementary logic is independent of the Axiom of Choice, which is, in my <br>
opinion, a non-logical axiom, like the Axiom of Infinity. In Gordon's HOL, this <br>
is not possible, since the use of the epsilon operator instead of the <br>
description operator makes the Axiom of Choice inevitable.) Exactly this </p>
<ul>
<li>laying bare the inner logic of formal logic and mathematics - makes Church's <br>
and Andrews' formulations of the mathematical language so important, not only <br>
Church's (and Andrews') "precise formulation of the syntax"<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-175.pdf">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-175.pdf</a> (p. 5),<br>
which also is the result of consequently carrying out the principle of <br>
reducibility (expressiveness). Church's main achievement is the creation of a <br>
mathematical language largely following the concept of <br>
expressiveness/reducibility; whereas this concept seems to be implicit in the <br>
work of Church, it is explicit in the work of Andrews.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, while practical considerations enforce deviations from the "pure" logic, <br>
still implementations (e.g., Gordon's HOL or Isabelle/HOL) are based on and <br>
have to face comparison with the "pure" logical system (e.g., Q0).</p>
<p>Therefore practical concessions are in some sense a layer on top of (or, <br>
"overloading") the "pure" logic in certain areas, but do not render the general <br>
concept of expressiveness (reducibility) irrelevant. So it is not simply an <br>
alternative between logical rigor and practical considerations, but the latter <br>
overrides the general concept in certain fields only. It is important to keep <br>
this root (i.e., the underlying, but partially covered concept) and its <br>
remaining validity in mind (e.g., the reducibility not of rules, but still of <br>
symbols, variable binders, and axioms; avoidance of the use of the Axiom of <br>
Choice by preferring the description operator to the epsilon operator). With <br>
the above quote from the documentation of the original (Gordon's) HOL system, <br>
this awareness is clearly expressed.</p>
<p>Concerning "type class instantiation", my guess is that with dependent type <br>
theory, the more expressive mathematical language provides other means which <br>
might replace the features provided by the current Isabelle/HOL (polymorphic <br>
type theory). At least certain language features of the original (Gordon's) HOL <br>
system, such as</p>
<p>a) the introduction (definition) of types [cf. Gordon/Melham, 1993, pp. 225 <br>
ff.; cf. paragraph 2.5.4 of<br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf</a> (pp. 38 ff.) ],<br>
b) or the use of compound types [cf. Gordon/Melham, 1993, p. 195; cf. paragraph <br>
1.2 of<br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf</a> (p. 11)]</p>
<p>can be expressed very naturally in the dependent type theory R0, and from its <br>
point of view, these HOL language features then appear as rather artificial <br>
extensions (even with the introduction of new axioms!) which were necessary to <br>
emulate some of the expressiveness of the language of dependent type theory <br>
with the limited means of the language of polymorphic type theory, and, hence, <br>
as a preliminary and auxiliary solution.</p>
<p>Regarding the concerns about expanding abbreviations (definitions), this kind <br>
of argument is not applicable to all representations of logic. In the R0 <br>
implementation, formulae are represented as binary trees, each having assigned <br>
a natural number. So internally, any well-formed formula (wff) can be addressed <br>
by its number, and expansion (and definition) is only a question of parsing and <br>
printing, but not of the logical core (in which no definitions exist, but only <br>
binary trees and their numbers representing expanded wffs). Of course, due to <br>
Isabelle's concept of a meta-logical framework, or other practical <br>
considerations, different circumstances may be relevant that I am not familiar <br>
with.</p>
<p>For the HOL documentation team, it might be worth considering making the <br>
brilliant HOL documents, such as<br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf</a><br>
available directly on the HOL homepage in order to make it readable within the <br>
browser, e.g., via<br>
<a href="https://hol-theorem-prover.org/documents/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf">https://hol-theorem-prover.org/documents/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf</a><br>
since a download is a barrier for many people, for example, due to security <br>
considerations, or at public terminals providing browsing, but not downloading.</p>
