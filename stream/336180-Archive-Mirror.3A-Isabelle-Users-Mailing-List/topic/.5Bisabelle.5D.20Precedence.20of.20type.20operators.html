<p>From: "W. Douglas Maurer" &lt;<a href="mailto:maurer@gwu.edu">maurer@gwu.edu</a>&gt;<br>
On p. 11 of the document "Whats In Main" there is a very useful table <br>
giving, for every infix operator in Main, its precedence as an <br>
integer between 0 and 100, and its associativity (either left or <br>
right).<br>
I would like to ask: Is there anything like this for the Isar type operators?<br>
All I have been able to find in the reference manuals and tutorials <br>
is relative precedence. So for example (p. 3 of prog-prove): "Note <br>
that 'a =&gt; 'b list means 'a =&gt; ('b list), not ('a =&gt; 'b) list : <br>
postfix type constructors have precedence over =&gt; ."<br>
This answers some of the obvious questions about type operator <br>
precedence, but not all of them. There should be a table from which I <br>
can deduce the answers to questions like: Why the parentheses in (int </p>
<ul>
<li>int) set ? Do postfix type constructors also have precedence over * <br>
as well as over =&gt;  ?<br>
Such a table, in addition to covering postfix type constructors <br>
(list, set, rel, etc.) and * (for product type), should cover / (for <br>
quotient type), =&gt; (for function types), and all the other type <br>
operators.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was first confused by that.  The type operators are part of the logical <br>
language of Pure or HOL, not the theory and proof language of Isar.</p>

<p>The function space is part of Pure, and the "isar-ref" manual has section <br>
7.4.3 The Pure grammar.  You can also use the print_syntax command, but <br>
its output is a bit large (in theory Pure it is still manageable).</p>

<p>Like in the term language, application for types binds most tightly, so <br>
you need parentheses for arguments with separate structure.  The Pure <br>
grammar reveals that as well.</p>
