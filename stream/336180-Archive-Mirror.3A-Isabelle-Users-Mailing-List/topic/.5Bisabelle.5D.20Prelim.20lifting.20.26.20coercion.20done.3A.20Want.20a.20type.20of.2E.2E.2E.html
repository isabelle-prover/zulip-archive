<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I added "lifting" and "coercion" in the subject to make sure Ondrej and <br>
Dmitriy see it, but here I keep my talk general, since it's a mailing list.</p>
<p>From here, I describe the three files I attach, summarize why I think I <br>
would and wouldn't want to use the types I defined, and try to make my <br>
case for Ondrej and Dmitriy to expand the ability of lifting and <br>
coercion to accept type variables where they currently don't.</p>
<p>Well, things are good already. I'm just finishing this off.</p>
<p>The three files I attach are part of my attempt to make a case. The <br>
algebra is already there in HOL, and I'm more interested in working with <br>
abstract algebraic structures than with the rational and real numbers. <br>
Partly, it's because they're at chapters 4, 13, and 14, where the <br>
rationals and reals are at chapter 76 and 79 of the HOL document. It'll <br>
take me while to get to chapter 14, let alone chapter 79.</p>
<p>It probably wouldn't be good to use a special type of positives just to <br>
get rid of a few conditions in the premises, but there could be <br>
applications where their use would be structural, such as being used to <br>
generalize positive and negative exponents for different algebraic <br>
structures. Also, I could use them in a datatype, as with the following, <br>
where the types would be closed under addition:</p>
<p>datatype 'a::linordered_field lofD =<br>
   NNeg "'a lF0"<br>
  |NPos "'a lFN0"</p>
<p>Use them for what? Nothing that I can think of right now.</p>
<p>I tried workarounds using option, ordered pairs, and lists, and those <br>
were good enough for what's in the file <code>lF0_lF1.thy</code>. In that file, I <br>
do "Lift nothing much; Coerce everything". It occurred to me that I <br>
didn't have to do anything but use <code>setup_lifting</code>.</p>
<p>The main thing I wanted from the lifting was the numerals, and I was <br>
having problems proving the type class requirements with the clutter of <br>
the types I mentioned.</p>
<p>That led me to <code>Lifting_Option.thy</code>, and I cut and pasted and modified <br>
from there to set up a datatype in <code>dID_lifting.thy</code>, which is just an <br>
identity datatype:</p>
<p>datatype 'a dID = dIDc 'a</p>
<p>I couldn't have done it without Sledgehammer, and thanks to Brian <br>
Huffman and Ondreg for that file.</p>
<p>With that datatype, I was able to instantiate my typedef datatypes to <br>
get the requirements, using lifting, for numeral, up to <code>semiring_1</code>, <br>
and that file is <code>lF0_numerals.thy</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
