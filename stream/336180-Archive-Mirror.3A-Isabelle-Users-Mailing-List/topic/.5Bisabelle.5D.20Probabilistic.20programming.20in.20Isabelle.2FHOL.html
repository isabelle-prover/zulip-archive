Dear Isabelle users,<br>
  Next week I will be in a course of probabilistic programming [2]. I think that it will be a great learning experience to combine this theory with practice in Isabelle. So, I would like to ask how could probabilistic programming be done in Isabelle? Is there any tutorial?</p>
<p>My guess is that I need to use ML and a random number generator, but maybe there is an easier way (without ML). I know the book [1], which is an introduction to ML, but I have not started using ML in a systematic way yet.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,<br>
José M.</p>

It's not quite clear to me what you want to achieve. Isabelle is not a<br>
programming language as such, but a logical system (okay, the code<br>
generator sort of allows you to you use it in a similar fashion as a<br>
programming language).</p>
<p>You can write down probabilistic algorithms in Isabelle using the Giry<br>
Monad, either on measure spaces or on "Probability Mass Functions"<br>
(PMFs). The latter is more restricted (it only supports distributions<br>
with discrete support), but much more pleasant to use since you don't<br>
have to worry about measurability.</p>
<p>There is currently no way to execute such algorithms in the way you<br>
think (e.g. sampling a single random result from them) or to obtain<br>
executable code for them. Doing this would probably require some<br>
extension to the code generator (similarly to Imperative HOL). We<br>
thought about this occasionally in the past, but nobody did it yet. Any<br>
such implementation would, however, necessarily be somewhat unfaithful<br>
in the sense that when you reason about these things in Isabelle, you<br>
assume a perfectly random distribution, whereas translating the<br>
algorithms to a real programming language with some pseudo-random number<br>
generator will never be able to provide that. Therefore, some properties<br>
that you proved abstractly might not hold anymore.</p>
<p>What you can, however, do in most cases is to execute the algorithm to<br>
obtain the entire probability distribution of results. This also allows<br>
you to compute expectation, standard deviation etc. Of course, this is<br>
usually much more expensive than sampling a single result, but it can<br>
still be useful for experiments, and it means that QuickCheck works and<br>
you can sometimes get counterexamples.</p>
<p>I don't think there are any tutorials, but there are a number of AFP<br>
entries with relatively simple, self-contained examples:</p>

<p>And there is Andreas Lochbihler's very advanced AFP entry on CryptHOL,<br>
which uses probabilistic reasoning in Isabelle to prove properties of<br>
cryptographic systems:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CryptHOL.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CryptHOL.html</a></p>
<p>All of these do /not/ use an actual deeply-embedded programming language<br>
with a formal semantics, but rather they directly describe these<br>
algorithms as probability distributions in the logic and reason about<br>
them mathematically (as opposed to a program logic whose correctness was<br>
proven seperately).</p>
<p>There is also one with a deeply-embedded probabilistic programming<br>
language, which is the more usual approach when working on paper:</p>
