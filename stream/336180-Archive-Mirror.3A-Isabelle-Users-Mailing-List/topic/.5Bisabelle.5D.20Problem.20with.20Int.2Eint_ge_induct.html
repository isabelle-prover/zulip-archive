<p>From: "W. Douglas Maurer" &lt;<a href="mailto:maurer@gwu.edu">maurer@gwu.edu</a>&gt;<br>
From my previous posts you may be aware that I am still looking for <br>
the best possible way to do the kind of mathematical induction that <br>
is typically taught first in a course on discrete mathematics. After <br>
looking over the various replies I have gotten, I would like very <br>
much, for most of this, to use Int.int_ge_induct: "?k &lt;= ?i ==&gt; ?P ?k <br>
==&gt; (!!i. ?k &lt;= i ==&gt; ?P i ==&gt; ?P (i + 1)) ==&gt; ?P ?i".<br>
This assumes that the induction variable is an int, not a nat, so <br>
inductions starting at negative numbers can be covered, as well as <br>
numbers greater than zero. It can also be applied to course-of-values <br>
induction.<br>
Having made this decision, I now tried a very simple case, namely <br>
proving by induction that if x &gt;= 0, then x &lt;= x*x. Most of what <br>
Int.int_ge_induct is supposed to be doing seems to be working fine, <br>
but, at the end, I am getting the message: "Failed to finish proof: <br>
goal (1 subgoal): 1. 0 &lt;= 0". Well, it's true that (0::int) &lt;= 0 <br>
would be true by simp, but 0 &lt;= 0 is not (and it makes sense to me <br>
that it is not, since 0 might be a label, for instance). But my <br>
question now is: Why am I getting 0 &lt;= 0 in that form? Here is my <br>
proof, in which I have replaced every occurrence of 0 by (0::int), in <br>
order to try (unsuccessfully) to stop generating a subgoal involving <br>
0 rather than 0::int:<br>
theory IntInduct imports Main begin<br>
lemma "[|x &gt;= (0::int)|] ==&gt; (x::int) &lt;= x*x" proof-<br>
assume "x &gt;= (0::int)"<br>
then have 1: "(0::int) &lt;= x" by simp<br>
have 2: "[|(0::int) &lt;= (0::int)|] ==&gt; (0::int) &lt;= (0::int)*(0::int)" by simp<br>
have 3: "!!i. (0::int) &lt;= i ==&gt; (i::int) &lt;= i*i ==&gt; (i::int)+1 &lt;= <br>
(i+1)*(i+1)" sorry<br>
from 1 and 2 and 3 show "(x::int) &lt;= x*x" by (rule Int.int_ge_induct)<br>
qed<br>
end<br>
I have also tried this starting with lemma fixes x::int assumes 4: <br>
"x &gt;= (0::int)" shows "x &lt;= x*x" proof- from 4 have 1: "(0::int) &lt;= <br>
x" by simp<br>
with the same result. -Douglas<br>
P. S. Might there be a problem with Int.int_ge_induct having a <br>
variable called ?i and a (presumably different) bound variable called <br>
i? -WDM</p>

By default, Isabelle does not print the types (and in 2014, it also does<br>

<p>You get these goals, because of the way rule works, you still need to<br>
discharge the assumptions of 2, 3 after rule application. As you don't<br>
need the assumption in 2, just get rid of it. BTW, 3 is easily proved by<br>
simp.</p>

<p>I've never needed "using assms" before, and its position in this <br>
proof confuses me. "Programming and Proving in Isabelle/HOL" <br>
(prog_prove) states (p. 43): "There are two further linguistic <br>
variations: (have|show) prop using facts = from facts (have|show) <br>
prop...The 'using' idiom de-emphasizes the used facts by moving them <br>
behind the proposition." This, however, is for "using" within a <br>
proof, not before the word "proof." Then (pp. 43-44), <br>
fixes-assumes-shows is introduced, with the meaning of assms; but <br>
there is no reference here to "using" immediately after <br>
fixes-assumes-shows and before "proof." No further occurrences of <br>
"using" in prog_prove involve "using" before the word "proof." Is <br>
there a better writeup which explains this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>proof (induct x rule: Int.int_ge_induct)<br>
  case base then show ?case by simp</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this particular proof, the base case is the case "x=0". However, <br>
Int.int_ge_induct also works for proofs with other base cases. If I <br>
were to prove something with base case "x=1", would I still be able <br>
to write "case base then show" here? Or would I write something <br>
slightly different? Or would I have to spell out assumptions and <br>
conclusions, as you have done below?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>next<br>
  case (step i) then show ?case by simp<br>

</blockquote>
<p>You appear, here, to be making use of "base" and "step" as what I <br>
believe are called minor keywords within the case construction. Where <br>
are minor keywords (if that's what they're called) defined?</p>

You are misunderstanding how "rule" works, I think. When used with<br>
chained facts (this is what "from 1 and 2 and 3" does -- it chains the<br>
facts 1, 2, 3), it uses the first fact to discharge the first premise of<br>
the rule, the second for the second and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you use a fact "A1 ==&gt; ... ==&gt; Am ==&gt; B" to discharge a premise "C1<br>
==&gt; ... ==&gt; Cn ==&gt; B", you will get m new subgoals, you need to prove:</p>
<p>"C1 ==&gt; ... ==&gt; Cn ==&gt; A1"<br>
    ...<br>
    "C1 ==&gt; ... ==&gt; Cn ==&gt; Am".</p>
<p>Let's have a look at your proof again:</p>
<p>assume "x &gt;= (0::int)"<br>
    then have 1: "(0::int) &lt;= x" by simp<br>
    have 2: "[|(0::int) &lt;= (0::int)|] ==&gt; (0::int) &lt;= (0::int)*(0::int)"<br>
by simp<br>
    have 3: "!!i. (0::int) &lt;= i ==&gt; (i::int) &lt;= i*i ==&gt; (i::int)+1 &lt;=<br>
(i+1)*(i+1)" sorry<br>
    from 1 and 2 and 3 show "(x::int) &lt;= x*x" by (rule Int.int_ge_induct)</p>
<p>The rule Int.int_ge_induct has three premises, you are chaining in three<br>
facts. The first fact has no premise, so no new subgoal arises for that.<br>
The second fact has one premise, "(0::int) &lt;= (0::int)" and the second<br>
premise of Int.int_ge_induct has no premises. This gives you one new subgoal</p>
<p>(0::int) &lt;= (0::int)            (which Isabelle prints as 0 ≤ 0)</p>
<p>Similarly, from the third fact and premise arise the subgoals</p>
<p>⋀i. 0 ≤ i ⟹ i ≤ i * i ⟹ 0 ≤ i<br>
  ⋀i. 0 ≤ i ⟹ i ≤ i * i ⟹ i ≤ i * i</p>
<p>Rule is a basic tool and does nothing more then combining the chained<br>
facts with the given rule in the way I described above and apply this to<br>
the goal. In particular, it does not pick up any other facts you may<br>
have proven before.</p>
<p>You can see these three subgoals if you write "apply (rule<br>
Int.int_ge_induct)" instead of "by (rule Int.int_ge_induct)".</p>
<p>So, why does your proof "by (rule Int.int_ge_induct)" complain only<br>
about the subgoal "0 ≤ 0" and not the other subgoals? This is because<br>
the "by" tries to solve any remaining subgoals with "assumption" and<br>
this obviously succeeds for the subgoals 2 and 3.</p>
<p>So, that being explained, how can you fix your proof (without rewriting<br>
it completely)? "by" can take two proof methods: an initial step to<br>
transform the goal and a second step to finish the remaining subgoals.<br>
In your case, simp (or simp_all) suffices:</p>
<p>by (rule Int.int_ge_induct) simp_all</p>

The standard way of applying this induction rule would be:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>lemma<br>
  fixes x :: int<br>
  assumes "0 &lt;= x"<br>
  shows "x &lt;= x * x"<br>
  using assms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've never needed "using assms" before, and its position in this proof<br>
confuses me. "Programming and Proving in Isabelle/HOL" (prog_prove)<br>
states (p. 43): "There are two further linguistic variations:<br>
(have|show) prop using facts = from facts (have|show) prop...The<br>
'using' idiom de-emphasizes the used facts by moving them behind the<br>
proposition." This, however, is for "using" within a proof, not before<br>
the word "proof." Then (pp. 43-44), fixes-assumes-shows is introduced,<br>
with the meaning of assms; but there is no reference here to "using"<br>
immediately after fixes-assumes-shows and before "proof." No further<br>
occurrences of "using" in prog_prove involve "using" before the word<br>
"proof." Is there a better writeup which explains this?<br>
While these usages may look different, they are exactly the same. All of<br>
"have", "show" and "lemma" switch into proof mode. In proof mode, you can</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* do one-line proofs ("by ..."),<br>
  * structured proofs ("proof ... qed"),<br>
  * apply-style proofs ("apply ..."), or<br>
  * add additional chained facts "using ...")-</p>
<p>Both "apply" and "using" modify the proof state and leave you in proof mode.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>proof (induct x rule: Int.int_ge_induct)<br>
  case base then show ?case by simp</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this particular proof, the base case is the case "x=0". However,<br>
Int.int_ge_induct also works for proofs with other base cases. If I<br>
were to prove something with base case "x=1", would I still be able to<br>
write "case base then show" here?<br>
Yes. This is determined by the single fact you chained in.<br>
Int.int_ge_induct is</p>
</blockquote>
<p>?k &lt;= ?i ==&gt; ?P ?k ==&gt; (!!i. ?k &lt;= i ==&gt; ?P i ==&gt; ?P (i + 1)) ==&gt; ?P ?i</p>
<p>so resolving this with "0 &lt;= x" leaves you with</p>
<p>"?P 0 ==&gt; (!!i. 0 &lt;= 0 ==&gt; ?P i ==&gt; ?P (i + 1)) ==&gt; ?P ?i</p>
<p>Had you chained in "1 &lt;= x", base would refer to 1 instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You appear, here, to be making use of "base" and "step" as what I<br>
believe are called minor keywords within the case construction. Where<br>
are minor keywords (if that's what they're called) defined?<br>
These are no keywords, it is just what the author of the induction rule<br>
thought the cases ought to be called.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The induction method sets up cases according to some additional<br>
information stored in the induction rule. To see which cases are there,<br>
you can type "print_cases" (or select "cases" in the "print context" tab<br>
of the "Query" panel) after the initial "proof (induct ...)" step.</p>
<p>Basically, a case is a shortcut for the fix/assume I did manually in my<br>
example below and sets up "?case" to refer to the correct goal.</p>
