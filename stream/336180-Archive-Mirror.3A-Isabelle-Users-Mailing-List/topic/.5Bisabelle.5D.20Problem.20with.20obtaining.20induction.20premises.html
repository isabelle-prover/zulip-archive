Hello,</p>
<p>Most of my Isabelle/Isar proofs are based on induction, and sometimes I<br>
have problems when extracting the premises of the current inductive case,<br>
something like:</p>
<p>lemma "?Q xs ==&gt; ?P xs"<br>
proof (induct xs)<br>
  case (Cons x xs) hence "?Q xs" by auto ...</p>
<p>Sometimes I can extract the premises with ".", but in the most of cases I<br>
need to apply "auto". However, even this method is some cases does not<br>
work. I attached a small test case which does not work. I use the build of<br>
2006 Sep 12. Am I doing something wrong? If not, is there any workaround<br>
for this?</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
Vaidas<br>

<p>Here the facts stemming from the Cons case consist of several things <br>

<p>Thanks, this can be very useful to make the proof more readable, because <br>
now I invent a lot of fancy names to refer to the known facts.</p>

<p>I don't know, but I somehow proved it without additional type <br>
annotations.</p>

<p>You also need a type constraints "!!ys :: 'a list. ..." here.  Otherwise <br>
this closed formula will be syntactically unrelated to the context of the <br>
problem.</p>

<p>This is a good strategy.  It is usually easier (and more informative) to <br>
derive immediate conclusions from the induction hypotheses, rather than <br>
duplicate them literally.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Note that 'apply' merely applies a proof method.  The "." abbreviates <code>by 
this'', which can be expanded to </code>apply this .'' The latter allows more <br>
fine-grained debugging.</p>
<p>The single step methods (notably "this" and "rule") insist on being able <br>
to apply all chained facts, without ignoring anything.  Thus providing <br>
excessive facts makes the method invocation fail.</p>
<p>This principle is important to achive some degree of robustness and <br>
predictability of structured proof checking.  In contrast, automated <br>
methods readily ignore irrelevant facts.  So it is easy to write proofs <br>
that tell the wrong story, e.g. like this:</p>
<p>assume a: A<br>
  assume b: B</p>
<p>from a and b have C by auto</p>
<p>Here the ``auto'' step can ignore either a or b, or even worse ignore both <br>
and use different facts declared in the context.  The relevance of facts <br>
is a fundamental problem in most automated proof tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If  I write</p>
<p>have "[| length zs = length ys; a \&lt;in&gt; set zs |] ==&gt; !y. lookupEq zs ys <br>
a = Some y" .</p>

<p>have "!!ys. [| length zs = length ys; a \&lt;in&gt; set zs |] ==&gt; !y. lookupEq <br>
zs ys a = Some y" .</p>
<p>does not work. But the latter is the hypothesis, which I see in the <br>
context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is again a problem with unexpectedly general types.  The first form <br>
refers to the fixed variable ys of the context, i.e. gets the expected <br>
type.  The second is detached due to !! closure and gets a fresh type.</p>

Indeed, when I write</p>
<p>from Cons.hyps have "!!(ys::'a list). [| length zs = length ys; a \&lt;in&gt; <br>
set zs |] ==&gt; !y. lookupEq zs ys a = Some y" .</p>
<p>then it works. Now I will know how to deal with such cases.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Vaidas</p>
