Hi Peter,</p>

<p>In my concrete proof, ?P also occurs in other subgoals, it is the<br>
result of applying exI to a goal of the form EX P. a1=P &amp; a2=P. The<br>
list of flex-flex pairs and newly introduced schematics with <br>
duplicate parameters gets very long until Isabelle only spits out<br>
tons of trace output and does not terminate any more.</p>
<p>What happens here?</p>

<p>I think this is caused by Isabelle doing gratuitous lifting of<br>
parameters as it applies substitution. Lifting is necessary if some part <br>
of the proof state not under the bound parameters also contains the <br>
meta-variable (also called schematic variables) - which is the general <br>
assumption when Isabelle performs resolution.</p>
<p>If you do fix your parameters to free variables, then you get something<br>
more reasonable:</p>
<p>lemma "(A ?P) ==&gt; f ((x = y) = (a = b)) = ?P x"<br>
apply (subst (1 3) eq_commute)<br>
...<br>
fixed variables: A, f, x, y, a, b<br>
goal (lemma, 1 subgoal):</p>
<p>1. A ?P ==&gt; f ((y = x) = (b = a)) = ?P2 x<br>
flex-flex pairs:<br>
   ?P2 x =?= ?P1 x<br>
   ?P1 x =?= ?P x</p>
<p>But, depending on your context (other subgoals, assumptions etc), that<br>
may give incorrect results as it allows meta-variables to capture the<br>
bounds (which are being represented as Frees) - if the meta-variable<br>
also occurs outside of the scope of the parameters and is instantiated<br>
to a term containing the bound variable, you end up with a badly formed<br>
instantiation w.r.t. the context.</p>
<p>However, I think something funny is going on in the substitution tactic <br>
here: there seems to be an extra flex-flex pair, and I didn't think that<br>
was necessary, and is probably also the reason for the duplication of<br>
the bound variables... I remember doing lifting by hand very carefully, <br>
but it seems the code has changed slightly... I also vaguely recall not <br>
being sure if I could get rid of extra lifting in the tactic without <br>
doing something very different... actually I think I remember discussing <br>
it in 2004... I'll look through my old email and I'll have a think about <br>
it again... thanks for reminding me of the issue :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a way to get rid of introducing new schematics during subst,<br>
and get the desired subgoal: 1. !!x y a b. f ((y = x) = (b = a)) = ?P<br>
x y a b</p>
<p>Something that simplifies the subgoal after each substitution step<br>
would also be ok.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the meantime, if you can't just fix the parameters, a horrible hack <br>
is to instantiate your meta-variables to lambda terms that throw away <br>
duplicated arguments. You then simply apply this after substitution.</p>

Some years ago I wrote some code based on the "conversionals" of HOL, to <br>
do this sort of thing more easily.  Thus, for example,</p>
<p>Goal "!!x y a b. f ((x = y) = (a = b)) = P x y a b" ;<br>
by ((Conv.CONV_TAC o Conv.TDSTOP_CONV) (eqc eq_commute)) ;<br>
(applies conversions top-down, but stopping (ie, not descending into a <br>
resulting term upon success)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>!!x y a b. P x y a b = f ((x = y) = (a = b))<br>
by ((Conv.CONV_TAC o Conv.TOPDN_CONV) (eqc eq_commute)) ;<br>
(applies conversions top down)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>!!x y a b. f ((b = a) = (y = x)) = P x y a b<br>
by ((Conv.CONV_TAC o Conv.BUSTOP_CONV) (eqc eq_commute)) ;<br>
(applies conversions bottom up, stopping upon any success)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>!!x y a b. f ((a = b) = (x = y)) = P x y a b</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With these, I usually don't need the following, which makes a conversion <br>
succeed only the first and third times it would otherwise have succeeded).<br>
by ((Conv.CONV_TAC o Conv.TOPDN_CONV o Conv.NTH_CONV [1,3]) (eqc <br>
eq_commute)) ;</p>
<ol>
<li>!!x y a b. P x y a b = f ((b = a) = (x = y))</li>
</ol>
<p>Incidentally, I found my code doesn't work with schematic variables (I <br>
don't know why), so to use it you'd have to wrap your goal in <br>
freeze_thaw.  Which would presumably solve your problem anyway.</p>
<p>But if you're interested in my code, it's at<br>
