Dear all,</p>
<p>I'm currently having a question concerning class-constraints:</p>
<p>In a locale where I just fix some constants without assuming anything about them, it<br>
is always possible to get rid of the "locale-constraint".</p>
<p>So my question is, whether this is also possible for class-constraints? I.e., if I just<br>
fix some function (emb in the example below) without making any assumptions about it, <br>
can one get rid of the sort constraint (i.e., replace the "('a :: embed)list by ('a list)").</p>
<p>In the proof below, I just require the exakt definition of emb for lists, but it does not matter how emb<br>
is defined on type 'a for the elements of the list.</p>
<p>In principle, I have shown "!! xs :: ('a :: embed) list. len_dom xs", and I would like to derive<br>
"!! xs :: 'a list. len_dom xs" without the embed sort-constraint.</p>
<p>class embed =<br>
  fixes emb :: "'a ⇒ nat"</p>
<p>instantiation list :: (embed) embed <br>
begin<br>
  fun emb_list where <br>
    "emb_list [] = 0" <br>
  | "emb_list (x # xs) = emb x + 2 * emb xs + 1"<br>
instance ..<br>
end</p>
<p>function len :: "('a :: embed) list =&gt; nat"<br>
  where "len [] = 0"<br>
      | "len (x # xs) = Suc (len xs)"<br>
  by pat_completeness auto</p>
<p>termination len (* goal: All len_dom *)<br>
proof <br>
  let ?r = "inv_image ({(x,y). x &lt; y}) (emb :: 'a list =&gt; nat)"<br>
  show "wf ?r"<br>
    by (rule wf_inv_image[OF wf_less])<br>
  fix x xs<br>
  show "(xs, x # xs) ∈ ?r" by simp<br>
qed</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
René</p>

Dear René,</p>

No. Type classes are explicitly made to prevent applications of overloaded <br>
constants when it is not clear that there is an instantiation.</p>

I do not see why you need a type class in this case at all. You could equally <br>
well define emb_list inside the proof itself and not introduce the type <br>
constraint at all:</p>

<p>function len :: "'a list =&gt; nat"<br>
   where "len [] = 0"<br>
       | "len (x # xs) = Suc (len xs)"<br>
   by pat_completeness auto</p>
<p>termination len (* goal: All len_dom *)<br>
proof<br>
   def emb == "list_rec 0 (%x xs res. undefined + 2 * res + 1) :: 'a list =&gt; nat"<br>
   let ?r = "inv_image ({(x,y). x &lt; y}) emb"<br>
   show "wf ?r"<br>
     by (rule wf_inv_image[OF wf_less])<br>
   fix x xs<br>
   show "(xs, x # xs) : ?r" by(simp add: emb_def)<br>
qed</p>
<p>Obviously, definitions inside proofs are not as convenient as top-level <br>
definitions. You could also define emb_list only for lists and use that, but <br>
possibly, your real use case is more complex and you do want to use the global emb.</p>
<p>If you want to do overloading without sort constraints, there's the overloading <br>
command (Isar-Ref manual 5.8) or the old-fashioned consts+defs (overloaded) <br>
pattern, without type classes at all. Note, however, that you then will lose the <br>
ability to generate code for whatever is to be implemented in terms of emb. To <br>
that end, you would have reintroduce the type class for code generation as follows:</p>
<p>(* not tested *)<br>
consts emb :: "'a =&gt; nat"<br>
defs (overloaded) emb_list_def:<br>
   "emb = list_rec 0 (%x xs res. emb x + 2 * res + 1)"</p>
<p>class emb_code =<br>
   fixes emb_code :: "'a =&gt; nat"<br>
   assumes emb_code: "emb = emb_code"</p>
<p>declare emb_code[code]</p>
<p>instantiation list :: (emb) emb begin<br>
definition "emb_code :: 'a list =&gt; nat == emb"<br>
instance by(intro_locales)(simp add: emb_code_def)<br>
end</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
Andreas</p>

<p>thanks, this was the expected answer, which tells me that I have to do some work.</p>

<p>Exactly, for my presented (short) proof, it is easy to do it within the proof. In the general setting, I'll have to think about how to solve this problem.</p>

<p>Thanks for the pointers. I'll have a look into it whether these techniques can be utilized to solve my problem.</p>
