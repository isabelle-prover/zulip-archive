<p>From: Matej Urbas &lt;<a href="mailto:mu232@cam.ac.uk">mu232@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>I am having a bit of problems using 'compose_tac' with an intermediate<br>
theorem (produced with mk_implies + Goal.prove). I hope you do not mind<br>
if I ask for a hint.</p>
<p>Here is the problematic example:</p>
<p>I have this subgoal (call it sg1):</p>
<p>⋀s1 s2. ⟦distinct [s1, s2]; s1 ∈ A; s1 ∈ B; s2 ∈ A; s2 ∉ B⟧ ⟹<br>
        ∃s1 s2. distinct [s1, s2] ∧ s1 ∈ A ∧ s2 ∈ B</p>
<p>Then an external tool is invoked, which returns another goal (call it<br>
sg2):</p>
<p>⋀s1 s2. ⟦distinct[s1, s2]; s1 ∈ A ∩ B; s2 ∈ A - B⟧ ⟹ (∃s1 s2.<br>
        distinct[s1, s2] ∧ s1 ∈ A ∧ s2 ∈ B)</p>
<p>I want to 'replace' the current subgoal sg1 with sg2. Therefore I make a<br>
meta-implication and prove it with 'Goal.prove':</p>
<p>val intert = Logic.mk_implies (sg2, sg1)<br>
        val interThm = Goal.prove ctxt [] [] inter1 (K ((auto_tac<br>
        (clasimpset_of ctxt)) THEN (ALLGOALS (Intuitionistic.prover_tac<br>
        ctxt NONE))))</p>
<p>where interThm becomes:</p>
<p>⟦⋀s1 s2. ⟦distinct [s1, s2]; s1 ∈ A ∩ B; s2 ∈ A - B⟧ ⟹ ∃s1 s2.<br>
        distinct [s1, s2] ∧ s1 ∈ A ∧ s2 ∈ B; distinct<br>
        [?s1.0, ?s2.0]; ?s1.0 ∈ A; ?s1.0 ∈ B; ?s2.0 ∈ A; ?s2.0 ∉ B⟧ ⟹<br>
        ∃s1 s2. distinct [s1, s2] ∧ s1 ∈ A ∧ s2 ∈ B</p>
<p>The next step is to use interThm in 'compose_tac', which is applied on<br>
the original goal sg1:</p>
<p>compose_tac (false, interThm, 1) i</p>
<p>which fails.</p>
<p>Does it fail because of schematic variables? Is it possible to tell<br>
'Goal.prove' to not produce them?</p>
<p>Apologies for the length, and thank you in advance for your help.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

Hi Matej,</p>
<p>Two interesting things have happened. The first is that Goal.prove has lifted your meta-quantified conclusion (/\s1 s2. P s1 s2) into a schematically quantified theorem (P ?s1 ?s2). The internal ==&gt; implications within your conclusion sg2 are now treated together with the sg1 ==&gt; sg2 implication as a group of assumptions. This may make compose_tac surprise you. You've told it you want to have only 1 new goal - if I recall correctly that will be the final assumption of the supplied theorem, so try rotating the sg1 assumption to the end.</p>
<p>If that fails, you could try to stop Goal.prove lifting your meta-quantification. Playing around with the (invisible) protect constant might help you - look up protectI or protectD, No promises. Alternatively you could sidestep Goal.prove entirely by creating Thm.trivial from sg1 ==&gt; sg2 and applying your tactic to eliminate the first assumption.</p>
<p>Can't be bothered firing up Isabelle on a weekend to test any of these strategies for you. Good luck.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
    Thomas.</p>

<p>Thank you very much. I will try and use this.</p>
<p>Sadly, however, a quick glance at the documentation did not reveal a way<br>

could be possible if I constructed my own instance of the 'focus'<br>

<p>From: Holger Gast &lt;<a href="mailto:gast@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de">gast@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Matej,</p>
<p>The short answer is: If you use Goal.prove_internal instead of Goal.prove,<br>
your approach works just fine. (See the code below.)</p>
<p>The function Goal.prove_internal is merely a wrapper for Goal.init /<br>
Goal.conclude (+ introducing &amp; discharging assumptions), and init/conclude<br>
perform the internal fiddling with the invisible protect constant for you.<br>
A quick grep over the sources shows that prove_internal and compose_tac are<br>
used by tools and internal code, presumably to do similar low-level goal<br>
manipulations.</p>
<p>I'm sure this solution is not entirely orthodox, but since it worked<br>
for me in many similar situations where I needed precise control over<br>
the entire subgoal structure, I thought I'd share it none the less.</p>

<p>Above you say "While verifying this inference step instance with <br>
Isabelle's tactics".  If this is so, then it is natural to stay within the <br>
regular framework, as these tactics do anyway.  What is the purpose of <br>
mk_implies + Goal.prove?  Normally you can just work in-place, by <br>
addressing the subgoal using SUBGOAL, or on an isolated state via <br>
SELECT_GOAL or Subgoal.FOCUS.</p>
<p>If the "magic" above is by a totally alien tool, you can also apply <br>
Object_Logic.full_atomize_tac first, then work on a close HOL proposition, <br>
then apply the result using plain resolve_tac. (A common trap is to get <br>
types too general in examples, then the statement cannot be internalized <br>
into HOL.)</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Grepping through the sources (or using hypersearch in jEdit) is indeed <br>
very important to get an idea how common certain operations are.</p>
<p>Goal.prove_internal shows up very rarely, in special situations or ported <br>
versions of quite old tools (the latter aspect can be seen from the <br>
Mercurial history, if this extra time is spent with it).</p>
<p>We are getting at an interesting collection of odds and ends of internal <br>
system tools.  I maintain that it is possible to ignore all this for <br>
regular applications, and just use the standard system structures around <br>
the Pure rule calculus and its goal format, without lots of workarounds.</p>

<p>You still did not explain what you are trying to do exactly.  I was about <br>
to disprove your assumptions.</p>
<p>There are <em>rare</em> situations where one needs to step outside the standard <br>

It would be of much help if you further clarified your application,<br>
especially what kind of problems you are solving and how you connect<br>
the external tool (i.e., how you feed the subgoal to the external tool<br>

out, it is likely that your integration can be tuned towards standard<br>
operations (which won't be deprecated in the next Isabelle release).</p>
<p>In the meantime, here is a somewhat more standard approach to solve<br>
your issue, although still using the odd detour via Goal.prove:</p>
<p>ML {*<br>

        val thm = Goal.prove ctxt [] [] (Logic.mk_implies (t, u))<br>
          (fn {context, ...} =&gt; auto_tac (clasimpset_of context))<br>
      in Tactic.rtac thm i end)<br>
*}</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  "\&lt;And&gt;s1 s2.<br>

     \&lt;exists&gt;s1 s2. distinct [s1, s2] \&lt;and&gt; s1 \&lt;in&gt; A \&lt;and&gt;<br>
       s2 \&lt;in&gt; B"<br>
  apply (tactic {* replace_subgoal_tac @{context} @{term<br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Here is one more trick using more modern concepts -- I have just seen in <br>
an incoming changset by Florian Haftmann:</p>
<p>notepad<br>
begin</p>
<p>have "!!x y. x = y ==&gt; y = x"<br>
     apply (fact sym)<br>
     done</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>In ML this is ProofContext.fact_tac.  It unifies rules against each other, <br>
without taking the implication structure apart.</p>
<p>The nice thing about using "canonical" soluations is that you can switch <br>
between Isar source language and ML back and forth in the exploration. <br>
In contrast, odd things like Goal.prove_internal are not part of the Isar <br>
infrastructure.  This is what I meant by "standing naked in the rain".</p>
