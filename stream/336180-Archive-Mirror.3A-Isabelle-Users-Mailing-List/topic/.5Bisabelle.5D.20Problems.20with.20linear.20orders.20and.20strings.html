Dear Florian and Peter,</p>
<p>thanks again. However, there now seems to be an incompatibility of Char_ord with RBTMapImpl from the AFP:</p>
<p>If I try to load both modules (to use RBTMaps with strings as keys), then there is class conflict <br>
since the dependent theories of Char_ord and RBTMapImpl both define the ordering on pairs <br>
(Product_ord and AFP/common/Misc).</p>
<p>Peter, can you remove the pair-ordering in common/Misc and load Product_ord instead (it is the same definition)?</p>
<p>I have the following workaround, but of course this should be fixed in a better way.</p>
<p>theory Linorders<br>
imports List_lexord Char_nat (* but not Char_prod *)<br>
begin</p>
<p>instantiation char :: linorder<br>
begin<br>
fun less_eq_char :: "char \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; char \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; bool" where "less_eq_char c d = (nat_of_char c \&lt;le&gt; nat_of_char d)"<br>
fun less_char :: "char \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; char \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; bool" where "less_char c d = (nat_of_char c &lt; nat_of_char d)"</p>
<p>instance<br>
proof<br>
  fix x y :: char<br>
  assume "x \&lt;le&gt; y" and "y \&lt;le&gt; x"<br>
  hence "nat_of_char x = nat_of_char y" (is "?x = ?y") by auto<br>
  hence "char_of_nat ?x = char_of_nat ?y" by simp<br>
  thus "x = y" unfolding char_of_nat_of_char .<br>
qed auto<br>
end</p>
<p>Afterwards strings are in class linorder, code-generation works also after Code_Char_chr,<br>
and I can use RBTMapImpl as there is no conflict between Misc and Product_ord.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
René</p>

<p>From: René Thiemann &lt;<a href="mailto:rene.thiemann@uibk.ac.at">rene.thiemann@uibk.ac.at</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>the problem I have is as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>I want to use the AFP/Collection/RBT... theories to have efficient implementations of sets.</li>
<li>to use this framework, the carrier has to be in the class linorder</li>
<li>moreover, I need to operate on sets of strings<br>
==&gt; strings (= char list) must be in the class linorder</li>
</ul>
<p>unfortunately, neither char nor list are contained in the linorder class.<br>
So here I have three questions:</p>
<p>1) are there already theories which make char and string members of linorder</p>
<p>2) I have defined my own class instance for char as follows:</p>
<p>fun nibble_to_nat :: "nibble =&gt; nat" where <br>
  "nibble_to_nat Nibble0 = 0"<br>
| "nibble_to_nat Nibble1 = 1"<br>
...</p>
<p>fun char_to_nat :: "char =&gt; nat" where <br>
  "char_to_nat (Char n1 n2) = (16 * nibble_to_nat n1 + nibble_to_nat n2)"</p>
<p>fun less_eq_char :: "char =&gt; char =&gt; bool" <br>
  where "less_eq_char c d = (char_to_nat c &lt;= char_to_nat d)"</p>
<p>and then proven that this implementation satisfies the class conditions.<br>
Unfortunately, after loading Code_Char_chr I cannot export the code anymore<br>
since it is complains as follows:<br>
*** Illegal character expression,<br>
*** in equation char_to_nat (Char ?n1.0 ?n2.0) \&lt;equiv&gt;<br>
*** plus_nat_inst.plus_nat<br>
***  (times_nat_inst.times_nat<br>
***    (nat (number_int_inst.number_of_int<br>
***           (Int.Bit0 (Int.Bit0 (Int.Bit0 (Int.Bit0 (Int.Bit1 Int.Pls)))))))<br>
***    (nibble_to_nat ?n1.0))<br>
***  (nibble_to_nat ?n2.0)</p>
<p>3) In reality I need linorder not only for strings, but also for more<br>
   complex datatypes like the following for labeled symbols:</p>
<p>datatype ('f,'l)lab = <br>
  Lab "('f,'l)lab" 'l <br>
| Funlab "('f,'l)lab" "('f,'l)lab list" <br>
| Unlab 'f </p>
<p>The generation of an arbitrary linearization of each<br>
   datatype is trivial via a lexicographic comparison. However, the proof<br>
   obligations are tedious to prove. Is there some automatic way to<br>
   let Isabelles generate a linearization?</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
René</p>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu">andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Peter Lammich schrieb:<br>
There is no theoretical problem to parametrise ordering, equality, <br>
hash-functions, etc. However, the current state results from what has been <br>
available before: The Isabelle Collections Framework reuses various existing <br>
formalisations, e.g. red black trees (RBT), associative and distinct lists from <br>
HOL/Library. All of them have been phrased in terms of type class operators ("op <br>
&lt;=" and "op &lt;" for rbts) or HOL equality "op =". If one of these is to be <br>
parametrised, these developments must first be changed or replicated. Thus, this <br>
is mainly an engineering problem.</p>
<p>In fact, a few weeks ago, I changed the red black tree development on my local <br>
copy such that the type class constraint vanishes and the ordering can now be a <br>
parameter. It was not a big deal, but the new version is not backward-compatible <br>
  (w.r.t. HOL/Library/RBT_Impl), because I had to rename operations to avoid <br>
name clashes. The key was to shift the definitions and lemmas in RBT_Impl from <br>
the theory context with sort constraint linorder to the locale context <br>
ord/order/linorder that is associated with the respective type class.<br>
The locale context takes the order as parameter, i.e. only few changes are <br>
necessary to the rbt formalisation (except for name clashes, etc.).</p>
<p>Since the ICF supports explicit invariants, different order implementations for <br>
different RBTs should be relatively easy: In addition to the RBT itself, each <br>
map also stores the comparison operation. Upon the first creation of the (empty) <br>
map, one has to decide which order to use and stick with that. Even operations <br>
on multiple RBTs like union and intersection are no problems if they are <br>
implemented via iterators.</p>
<p>However, the ICF currently builds on the type RBT.rbt from HOL/Library/RBT, <br>
which hides the data structure invariant of the raw implementation RBT_Impl.rbt <br>
in a typedef. Hence, the red black tree implementation from the ICF requires <br>
<em>no</em> invariants. If one wants to hide the invariant from one's formalisation, <br>
there are two options:</p>
<p>Either, one introduces a typedef of its own for each order operation of <br>
interest. This scales only to a few and requires to replicate HOL/Library/RBT <br>
for each of them.</p>
<p>Or, one defines the type of all well-formed red black trees together with their <br>
ordering, and adapts HOL/Library/RBT once for this more general type. But now, <br>
equality tests via "op =" are no longer computable because equality of the order <br>
operations is not. Thus, one would also have to replace "op =" with a <br>
user-defined equality operation and redo all the above. With "op =", however, it <br>
does not suffice to shift definitions from the theory context to a locale <br>
context because "op =" is a HOL constant, not a type class parameter. Hence, <br>
everything that depends on "op =" would have to be generalised w.r.t. an <br>
explicit equality operator. Since "op =" is at the very core of HOL, this would <br>
probably be a lot of work.</p>
<p>All the above should work fine for the ICF. HOL/Library also contains Mapping <br>
and Cset as isomorphic types for 'a =&gt; 'b option and 'a set, and a setup to <br>
implement these types via associative lists and red black trees. If you want to <br>
take the above approach to Mapping and Cset, this would require even more work <br>
and thought.</p>
<p>To sum everything up: I think it would be no big deal to provide a map and set <br>
implementation for a variant of red black trees where the user can specify his <br>
own ordering of the keys. User-specified equality would be a much bigger task.</p>

Hallo René,</p>

<p>Does this persists if you use the »official« Char_ord theory?</p>

<p>Unfortunately: yes.</p>
<p>theory Test<br>
imports Char_ord Code_Char_chr<br>
begin</p>
<p>definition f where "f x \&lt;equiv&gt; (x :: char) &lt;= x"<br>
export_code f in Haskell file -</p>
<p>yields a similar error message as my own definition of &lt;= on characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the key issue is that the code lemmas for less_eq, less on char should<br>
use nat_of_char rather than relying on the exact representation of nats.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma [code]:<br>
  "c1 \&lt;le&gt; c2 \&lt;longleftrightarrow&gt; nat_of_char c1 \&lt;le&gt; nat_of_char c2"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma [code]:<br>
  "c1 &lt; c2 \&lt;longleftrightarrow&gt; nat_of_char c1 &lt; nat_of_char c2"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would appreciate if these would go to the Char_ord theory.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
    Florian<br>
