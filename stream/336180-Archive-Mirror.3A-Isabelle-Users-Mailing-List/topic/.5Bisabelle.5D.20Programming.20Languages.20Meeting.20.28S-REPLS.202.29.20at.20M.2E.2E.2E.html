<p>S-REPLS is a new and informal meeting for those with a professional<br>
interest in programming languages-whether it be academic or commercial-in the South of England region. The highly successful inaugural S-REPLS meeting was held on Thursday, 30th April at Wolfson College, Cambridge. It had one invited talk and four contributed talks.</p>
<p>For this second edition, we are planning to have a blend of invited and contributed talks. We are delighted to have Phil Wadler (Edinburgh) as confirmed invited speaker and we are in the process of confirming with others.</p>
<p>** Please let us know if you are interested in giving a talk on an exciting programming language topic. You can do this by sending a proposed title and abstract to Andrei Popescu<br>
at a.popescu@mdx.ac.uk&lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:a.popescu@mdx.ac.uk">a.popescu@mdx.ac.uk</a>&gt;. There is, of course, a limited number of slots, so please contact us as early as you can. **</p>
<p>The event is hosted by the Foundations of Computing group at Middlesex University. The meeting will start around 12 noon and finish by 6 p.m. Lunch will be provided. There will be no charge for the event, although we would appreciate prior notice of attendance for catering purposes: please email a.popescu@mdx.ac.uk&lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:a.popescu@mdx.ac.uk">a.popescu@mdx.ac.uk</a>&gt; if you plan to attend.</p>
