<p>From: Freek Wiedijk &lt;<a href="mailto:freek@cs.ru.nl">freek@cs.ru.nl</a>&gt;<br>
Programming Languages for Mechanized Mathematics Workshop</p>
<p>As part of Calculemus 2007 <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/Calculemus2007/">http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/Calculemus2007/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Hagenberg, Austria</p>
<p>[http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/plmms07/]</p>
<p>The intent of this workshop is to examine more closely the intersection <br>
between programming languages and mechanized mathematics systems (MMS). <br>
By MMS, we understand computer algebra systems (CAS), [automated] <br>
theorem provers (TP/ATP), all heading towards the development of fully <br>
unified systems (the MMS), sometimes also called universal mathematical <br>
assistant systems (MAS) (see Calculemus 2007 <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/Calculemus2007/">http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/Calculemus2007/</a>&gt;).</p>
<p>There are various ways in which these two subjects of /programming <br>
languages/ and /systems for mathematics/ meet:</p>
<p>* Many systems for mathematics contain a dedicated programming<br>
      language. For instance, most computer algebra systems contain a<br>
      dedicated language (and are frequently built in that same<br>
      language); some proof assistants (like the Ltac language for Coq)<br>
      also have an embedded programming language. Note that in many<br>
      instances this language captures only algorithmic content, and<br>
      /declarative/ or /representational/ issues are avoided.</p>
<p>* The /mathematical languages/ of many systems for mathematics are<br>
      very close to a functional programming language. For instance the<br>
      language of ACL2 is just Lisp, and the language of Coq is very<br>
      close to Haskell. But even the mathematical language of the HOL<br>
      system can be used as a functional programming language that is<br>
      very close to ML and Haskell. On the other hand, these languages<br>
      also contain very rich specification capabilities, which are<br>
      rarely available in most computation-oriented programming<br>
      languages. And even then, many specification languages ((B, Z,<br>
      Maude, OBJ3, CASL, etc) can still teach MMSes a trick or two<br>
      regarding representational power.</p>
<p>* Conversely, functional programming languages have been getting<br>
      "more mathematical" all the time. For instance, they seem to have<br>
      discovered the value of dependent types rather recently. But they<br>
      are still not quite ready to 'host' mathematics (the non-success<br>
      of docon &lt;<a href="http://www.haskell.org/docon/">http://www.haskell.org/docon/</a>&gt; being typical). There are<br>
      some promising languages on the horizon (Epigram<br>
      &lt;<a href="http://www.e-pig.org/">http://www.e-pig.org/</a>&gt;, Omega<br>
      &lt;<a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/%7Esheard/Omega/index.html">http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/%7Esheard/Omega/index.html</a>&gt;) as well as<br>
      some hybrid systems (Agda &lt;<a href="http://agda.sourceforge.net/">http://agda.sourceforge.net/</a>&gt;, Focal<br>
      &lt;<a href="http://focal.inria.fr/site/index.php">http://focal.inria.fr/site/index.php</a>&gt;), although it is unclear if<br>
      they are truly capable of expressing the full range of ideas<br>
      present in mathematics.</p>
<p>* Systems for mathematics are used to prove programs correct. (One<br>
      method is to generate "correctness conditions" from a program that<br>
      has been annotated in the style of Hoare logic and then prove<br>
      those conditions in a proof assistant.) An interesting question is<br>
      what improvements are needed for this both on the side of the<br>
      mathematical systems and on the side of the programming languages.</p>
<p>We are interested in all these issues. We hope that a certain synergy <br>
will develop between those issues by having them explored in parallel.</p>
<p>These issues have a very colourful history. Many programming language <br>
innovations first appeared in either CASes or Proof Assistants, before <br>
migrating towards more mainstream languages. One can cite (in no <br>
particular order) type inference, dependent types, generics, <br>
term-rewriting, first-class types, first-class expressions, first-class <br>
modules, code extraction, and so on. However, a number of these <br>
innovations were never aggressively pursued by system builders, letting <br>
them instead be developped (slowly) by programming language researchers. <br>
Some, like type inference and generics have flourished. Others, like <br>
first-class types and first-class expressions, are not seemingly being <br>
researched by anyone.</p>
<p>We want to critically examine what has worked, and what has not. Why are <br>
all the current ``popular'' computer algebra systems untyped? Why are <br>
the (strongly typed) proof assistants so much harder to use than a <br>
typical CAS? But also look at question like what forms of polymorphism <br>
exists in mathematics? What forms of dependent types exist in <br>
mathematics? How can MMS regain the upper hand on issues of <br>
'genericity'? What are the biggest barriers to using a more mainstream <br>
language as a host language for a CAS or an ATP?</p>
<p>This workshop will accept two kinds of submissions: full research papers <br>
as well as position papers. Research papers should be nore more than 15 <br>
pages in length, and positions papers no more than 3 pages. Submission <br>
will be through _EasyChair_. An informal version of the proceedings will <br>
be available at the workshop, with a more formal version to appear <br>
later. We are looking into having the best papers completed into full <br>
papers and published as a special issue of a Journal (details to follow).</p>
