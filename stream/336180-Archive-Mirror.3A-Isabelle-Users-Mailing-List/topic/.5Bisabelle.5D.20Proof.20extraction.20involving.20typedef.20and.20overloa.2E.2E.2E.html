<p>From: Florian Haftmann &lt;<a href="mailto:florian.haftmann@informatik.tu-muenchen.de">florian.haftmann@informatik.tu-muenchen.de</a>&gt;<br>
[This thread has become too volumnious to be followed in detail by a<br>
casual bystander, so I try here with »one issue – one mail«.]</p>
<p>I did a glimpse at Alexander Krauss and Andreas Schropp, A mechanized<br>
translation from higher-order logic to set theory. According to my<br>
knowledge this had been the definite reference for taming overloading<br>
and typedef until recently.</p>
<p>The critical passages are:</p>
<p>»Abstracting  out  unresolvable  overloading  would  give  rise  to<br>
dependent  types.<br>
This  is  no  problem  in  the  set-theoretic  interpretation,  but  as<br>
 the  overloading<br>
elimination is currently implemented as a preprocessing step on the HOL<br>
side,<br>
it does not handle such overloading. This can be fixed by collapsing the<br>
differ-<br>
ent parts of the translation. However, to remove unresolvable<br>
overloading from<br>
type definitions while staying in HOL, one has to eliminate the type<br>
definition<br>
altogether, replacing it by its representing type together with a predicate.<br>
It appears that this subtle issue was overlooked in all proof sketches<br>
of con-<br>
servativity of overloading so far. Practically, this form of overloading<br>
seems  to  be  quite  rare.  It  does  not  occur  in  the  main  HOL<br>
image,  but  a  few<br>
instances exist in the HOLCF development.«</p>
<p>»The fact that we uncovered a notable omission in all previous proofs of<br>
conservativity of overloading shows that our approach of »implemented<br>
semantics« is also useful for better understanding the logical system.«</p>
<p>Has anyone tried to apply proof extraction to a »inconsistent typedef«<br>
example? According to my blurry understanding of the whole picture this<br>
should fail then!? Maybe this would deserve a reference.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
    Florian<br>
