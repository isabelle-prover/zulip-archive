Dear Makarius,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the last chance to report any problems before the official<br>
release of Isabelle2012.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>if, using RC-3 (linux 32 bit), and jedit I edit a new theory, say "test.thy":</p>
<p>theory test<br>
        imports Main<br>
    begin<br>
    lemma shows "True" proof-   </p>
<p>And then intend to outcomment the proof attempt by inserting "(*" before the<br>
lemma, and "*)" after the lemma, that is I want to get </p>
<p>theory test<br>
        imports Main<br>
    begin<br>
    (* lemma shows "True" proof- *)</p>
<p>then after inserting the "(*", I get "Outer syntax error: <br>
command expected, but bad input (* was found". Apparently this is <br>
because jedit still assumes that in this scenario I want to be in <br>
prove mode, while of course by outcommenting it I wanted to abandon <br>
the proof attempt. While this is sth I can live with, is it<br>
desired or necessary behavior or sth that ought to be reported?</p>
<p>Best,</p>

The behaviour is a consequence how the parser of text changes works, so it <br>
is necessary in that sense.  It is also officially specified as a feature <br>
in the REAME:</p>
<p>Incremental reparsing sometimes produces unexpected command spans.<br>
   Workaround: Cut/paste larger parts or reload buffer.</p>
<p>This does not mean the specification could not be improved. Compared to <br>
Isabelle2011-1 it is already slightly better in Isabelle2012, and is <br>
anticipated to improve further.</p>

<p>Ok, thanks, works. For the record:</p>
<p>If the cursor <em>is not</em> at the end of the theory text<br>
(1) cutting out the entire freshly out-commented section, in our <br>
case "(* lemma shows "True" proof- *)", <br>
(2) then repasting it <br>
==&gt; Exits proof mode and also clears the output window.</p>
<p>If the cursor <em>is</em> at the end of the theory text<br>
Doing (1) and (2) above, <br>
==&gt; Again, exits proof mode. <br>
In this case, in the "Output" window the syntax error <br>
message persists, but I can simply ignore it and just type <br>
on until the system overwrites the output buffer either by a new <br>
error message or by an empty string (e.g. after accepting a <br>
successful declaration).</p>
<p>Of course, as the README mentions, there is also the option of <br>
"File -&gt; Reload", but it involves saving and for me feels more <br>
disruptive to workflow.</p>

<p>This is probably an instance of the known incident where the Output panel <br>
is not updated automatically as expected.  One needs to press the "Update" <br>
button manually in such situations.</p>
<p>The coupling of the output window with the cursor movement in the source <br>
buffer is sub-optimal in several ways.  E.g. it is often unclear to which <br>
part of the source text the output actually refers.</p>
<p>This arrangement stems from very early versions of Isabelle/jEdit from <br>
about 2-3 years ago.</p>

<p>When you say "workflow" it sounds like such exceptional situations of <br>
incremental parsing would occur very often.</p>
<p>Note that it can only happen when you change the "polarity" of quoted <br>
material, especially (* ... <em>) and {</em> ... *}.  The current line is always <br>
reparsed fully.</p>
<p>Your original motivation was to abandom a proof attempt temporarily. <br>
This can be done formally via the 'oops' command.  Comments are relatively <br>
rare in formal text anyway, more like % in latex.  (Which does not mean <br>
that formal text {* ... *} is not subject to the same problem.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>At least for my working style (I am often changing things in the middle <br>
of a theory file), this situation is far from being exceptional. Take <br>
e.g. this multi-line definition:</p>
<p>definition K33 :: "('a, 'a × 'a) pre_graph ⇒ bool" ("K⇣3⇣3") where<br>
   "K33 G ≡ sym_pair_digraph G ∧ card (verts G) = 6 ∧<br>
     (∃U ⊆ verts G. ∃V ⊆ verts G. U ∪ V = verts G ∧ card U = 3 ∧ card V <br>
= 3 ∧<br>
       (∀u ∈ U. ∀v ∈ V. (u, v) ∈ edges G ∧ (v, u) ∈ edges G) ∧<br>
       (∀u ∈ U. ∀u' ∈ U. (u, u') ∉ edges G) ∧<br>
       (∀v ∈ V. ∀v' ∈ V. (v, v') ∉ edges G))"</p>
<p>Now, if I input 'term "x', give it time to reparse and just then add the <br>
closing '"', the definition of K33 is not parsed anymore. And if I am in <br>
such a situation, the incremental reparsing goes wrong every few minutes.</p>
<p>(The cut-and-repaste workaround is non-disruptive enough that I am fine <br>
with it. If the only workaround I knew would be reloading (and thus <br>
reproving and losing Undo and a lot of time), I would probably switch <br>
back to Proof General).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Not for nested proofs. Also, I have another common use-case for <br>
commenting out lemmas: I want to see what breaks, when a lemma is gone.</p>

I am afraid I was in this situation earlier on and I just gave up on jedit. The<br>
theory was small, so it was not a question of cut-and-paste vs reload, but my<br>
workflow was seriously disrupted by having to do something special every few<br>
minutes to make jedit happy. It is also confusing to novices because you keep<br>
staring at your text thinking there is something wrong with it although there isn't.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
I need to recall some Isabelle/jEdit history here: for 4 years or so I've <br>
been trying desparately make a future beyond Proof General / Emacs happen. <br>
In Isabelle2012 it is now the second stable release of it, after the one <br>
of Isabelle2011-1.  The quality of the result critically depends on <br>
feedback by early adopters, not silently giving things up.</p>
<p>So far I've often had the impression that many peoples don't want to go <br>
beyond Proof General at all.  This is fine.  They only need to organize <br>
themselves to maintain Proof General in the future, because I have stopped <br>
working on it myself in October 2011.  (For the Isabelle2012 release I've <br>
invested the canonical 2 weeks of brushing up PG/Emacs into the Windows <br>
installer.)</p>
<p>So for me there is no way looking back.  I hope to get more constructive <br>
feedback on Isabelle/jEdit in the future, and find time to work on the <br>
small and big things that still need to be done.</p>

I also prefer not requiring such workarounds, but for me this feature only <br>
occurrs in exceptional situations.  This is why it got a lower priority in <br>
the list of things to work on.</p>
<p>Since the balancing problem of quotes/comments is a common problem of <br>
IDEs, maybe someone on the mailing list can point to solutions that other <br>
people have found for it.  For example, Netbeans makes it hard to type <br>
unbalanced quotes/comments at all by closing the range immediately, but I <br>
did not like the mechanics of it very much.</p>

For quotes such an auto-closing feature sounds fairly natural and useful,<br>
although this is just a gut reaction. For comments it won't be so helpful<br>
because one often wants to comment out already existing text (whereas I never<br>
want to quote existing unquoted text).</p>
