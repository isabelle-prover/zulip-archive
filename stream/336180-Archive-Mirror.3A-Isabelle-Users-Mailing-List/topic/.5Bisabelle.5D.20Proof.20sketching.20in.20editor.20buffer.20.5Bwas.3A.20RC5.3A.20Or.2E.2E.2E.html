Hi all,</p>
<p>I definitely agree that it is still unclear how IDE support for proof<br>
construction should look like, and this for me seems the main reason why<br>
numerous people (including me) prefer a output-buffer-centric working<br>
style here.</p>
<p>What I would appreciate is better support to materialize pending proof<br>
obligations in the source proper – what, by the way, is one of my main<br>
applications of the output buffer: copying open goals to the source and<br>
turning them into proper Isar.</p>
<p>Some time (years?) ago I did a small sketch of a command which takes a<br>
method, applies and it writes back the resulting goal state as Isar<br>
skeleton.  In the presence of the rich infrastructure (including<br>
sledgehammer's facilities to print pretty Isar proofs) it should not be<br>
that difficult to get something running and useful here, with rich<br>
potential for research.  I would appreciate if somebody would seriously<br>
take up this enterprise.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
    Florian<br>

<p>(At least for me) another main application of the output buffer is<br>
backward-style proof exploration. I throw apply-style tactics onto my<br>
goal until it is solved, including old-fashioned things like<br>
  rule_tac x="..." in exI<br>
(For me) this is a very efficient method to find proofs. Once the proof<br>
is found, I usually clean it up (a bit). Thus, even if apply-style and<br>
xxx_tac methods are considered bad style for camera-ready proof text,<br>
they are very important for proof exploration, and should not be<br>
abandoned without viable alternatives.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea that may save lot's of tedious copy-and-paste if<br>
you already have the detailed proof in mind, and want to document the<br>
steps at a very fine-grained level in Isar.</p>
<p>I am unsure whether it would work as a replacement for proof-exploration<br>
as described above, because it would produce lots of text in the main<br>
buffer, which may obfuscate the whole proof, in particular for big<br>
subgoals. (I regularly have ~20 subgoals, each of which is ~20 lines<br>
long)</p>

I also work in the way you describe. I imagine that this is the normal approach, as opposed to trying to generate structured proofs directly out of nothing.</p>
<p>It would be great to have a command that could take the current subgoal and generate the corresponding text of a nested block. At the same time, I hope that users would take the trouble to clean this up, deleting unused assumptions and possibly generalising the result proved.</p>

<p>I really had proof exploration in mind.</p>

<p>Deleting big experimental sections should not be a big problem.</p>
<p>When doing proof development nowadays, I often make the experience that,<br>
when I am actually finishing the proof, I have to delete draft lines<br>
more than an editor page (!) which has accumulated over time.</p>

The same for me. </p>
<p>My fear was, if these draft lines now also contain tons of subgoals,<br>
they may be dozens of editor pages, and obfuscate the essential proof<br>
steps that have been worked out. But, maybe I've not correctly<br>
understood the idea.</p>
