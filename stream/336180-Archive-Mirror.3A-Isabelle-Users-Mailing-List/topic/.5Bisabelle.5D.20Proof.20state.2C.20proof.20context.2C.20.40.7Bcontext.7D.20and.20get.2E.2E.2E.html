<p>From: Rafal Kolanski &lt;<a href="mailto:rafalk@cse.unsw.edu.au">rafalk@cse.unsw.edu.au</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle Gurus,</p>
<p>Once more I am wishing for enlightenment. Since I'm doing dependency <br>
tracking of theorems, I want to basically go up the chain of theorems to <br>
get to the top, finding dependencies.</p>
<p>There is a command which does something like this, called thm_deps, <br>
which works nicely in a graphical context. However, I am unable to <br>
replicate the functionality at the ML level.</p>
<p>The problem is as follows, thm_deps is defined in isar_cmd as:</p>
<p>fun thm_deps args = Toplevel.unknown_theory o Toplevel.keep (fn state =&gt;<br>
     Thm_Deps.thm_deps (Proof.get_thmss (Toplevel.enter_proof_body <br>
state) args))</p>
<p>I have a simple theory:</p>
<p>theory DeepDepends imports Plain begin</p>
<p>lemma lem1: "A --&gt; A" by simp</p>
<p>thm_deps "lem1" (* this works great *)</p>
<p>ML {* (* this does not work *)<br>
   Proof.get_thmss (Proof.init @{context}) [pair (Facts.Fact "lem1") []]<br>
*}</p>
<p>I've examined IsarCmd.thm_deps using tracing, and it really only has <br>
[(Facts.Fact "lem1" [])] passed in to it.</p>
<p>The error I get is:<br>
*** Failed to retrieve literal fact:<br>
*** lem1</p>
<p>I've been running around in the code in circles. The problem is most <br>
likely that I have no idea how to get the proper proof context / proof <br>
state from the toplevel.</p>
<p>The reason I'm digging so deep, is because when I get the names of <br>
depended-on theorems from the proof term for a theorem, I get names like <br>
HOL.simp_thms_17, not theorems. To go any further up the dependency <br>
hierarchy, I need to look up HOL.simp_thms_17, which Isabelle has no <br>
idea about, as it's the 17th theorem in HOL.simps and its original name <br>
is something else entirely. This behaviour has always puzzled me, but <br>
this time it has really stopped me in my tracks.</p>
<p>At one point I got Thm_Deps.thm_deps to get going with my request, but <br>
then it also bailed on unknown fact "HOL.simp_thms_17". At this point I <br>
am considering catching the exception, stripping the _ and number from <br>
the end, looking up the theorem list without the number, and if that <br>
exists, getting the nth theorem in the theorem list, which is a very <br>
ugly thing to be doing.</p>
<p>Does anyone see where I went wrong?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rafal Kolanski.</p>
