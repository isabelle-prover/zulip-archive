<p>From: "John F. Hughes" &lt;<a href="mailto:jfh@cs.brown.edu">jfh@cs.brown.edu</a>&gt;<br>
I often find myself trying to prove things in a context like this:</p>
<p>Theorem: Given this, that, and the other, there's a widget X with these<br>
properties.</p>
<p>An example might be</p>
<p>Theorem: Given two real numbers r and s, with r &lt; s there's a real number t<br>
between them, i.e., with r &lt; t and t &lt; s.</p>
<p>My approach, as a mathematician, is often to explicitly construct the<br>
widget described, and show it has the properties needed. In the example<br>
theorem, I'd say: let t = (r+s)/2. Then because r &lt; s, we know that r+r &lt;<br>
r + s, so (dividing by 2) r &lt; (r+s)/2, so r &lt; t. [Then I'd write a similar<br>
proof for t &lt; s. ]</p>
<p>I seem, in Isar, to often reach a state where I've done exactly this --<br>
I've established the existence of the missing widget by explicitly<br>
constructing it -- but I can't make Isar say, "Oh, good...we're done here!"</p>
<p>In the example above, Isar can figure out a proof all on its own, but since<br>
that's not true in general (most of the constructive proofs I'm doing are<br>
beyond its 'i can do that' skills), I'd like to work through the details to<br>
get the general structure.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that part of the problem is that there's an implict<br>
"forall r, forall s" in front of the theorem, while I want to do my proof<br>
by doing it for a particular (but arbitrary) r (and s, of course).</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to do that with "fix r" and "fix s". But then<br>
I need to do something more. I figured that because I was trying to prove<br>
that "r &lt; s" implies something, I should assume that r &lt; s, and proceed.</p>
<p>Here's a start:</p>
<p>theory Proof_practice<br>
  imports Complex_Main<br>
begin</p>
<p>theorem mid: "(r::real) &lt; s⟹∃t. ((r &lt; t) ∧ (t &lt; s))"<br>
proof<br>
  fix r<br>
  fix s<br>
  assume "r &lt; s"<br>
  let t = "(r+s)/2"<br>
qed<br>
end</p>
<p>The type-ascription on "r" seemed to be necessary; without it, auto<br>
Quickcheck claimed to have a counterexample (apparently by assuming that I<br>
meant r and s to be Enums rather than reals). Even so, the "r" in the first<br>
line of the proof appears to be unrelated to the "r" in the theorem<br>
statement, for it's described as a Skolem variable with type 'a, so that<br>
the "let" line completely fails (complaining that "+" is not defined for<br>
items of type 'a, quite reasonably).</p>
<p>Can someone describe a general pattern for proofs like this (where I<br>
construct some object, and show that it has some properties, and then say<br>
"see, that's proof that such a thing exists!"? It's clear that I'm headed<br>
down the wrong path.</p>

<p>You statement already introduces r and s, fixing them again introduces new r and <br>
s, which is not what you want. You can also write the goal with assumes/shows <br>
instead of ==&gt; so you don't have to assume the assumptions once more but can <br>
refer to them by the predefined name "assms". This leads to</p>
<p>theorem mid: assumes "(r::real) &lt; s" shows "∃t. r &lt; t ∧ t &lt; s"<br>
proof<br>
   let ?t = "(r+s)/2"<br>
   show "r &lt; ?t ∧ ?t &lt; s" using assms by simp<br>
