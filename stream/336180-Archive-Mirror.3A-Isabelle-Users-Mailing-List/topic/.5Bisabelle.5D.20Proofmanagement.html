<p>From: Jan Keller &lt;<a href="mailto:Jan@Familie-Keller.org">Jan@Familie-Keller.org</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,<br>
I am a student in the 6th semster on TU Darmstadt and writing on my <br>
bachelor thesis about proof management for KeY <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.key-project.org/">http://www.key-project.org/</a>&gt;. My mentor implemented the tool Visual <br>
DbC. It visualize Java code with JML contracts in a diagram based on the <br>
UML standard.</p>
<p>I added associations for all dependencies of prooves, identify changes <br>
in the Java code and JML contracts and compute wether a proof is <br>
deprecated or still valid.</p>
<p>I have a few Qestions for my related work section:</p>
<p>How do you do the management  of proofs in Isabelle? Are there any tools?<br>
Are there technics to react on changes of potential dependencies of <br>
proof? Could you detect wether a proof is still valid or deprecated?<br>
Are there tools for the dependencies of proofs? How are the dependencies <br>
visualized? I saw something like a dependency graph in JEdit. Is that <br>
correct?<br>
Have you tools to refractor proofs or requirements?</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. I look forward to <br>
your response.</p>

<p>This is mainly part of the implicit "document model" of the prover, which <br>
is then connected to jEdit via conventional text editing operations <br>
(insert/remove intervals of text).  The document model is declarative in <br>
the sense that it reacts on changes in a (hopefully) sensible way.  The <br>
hard work of managing dependencies is in the core implementation, both <br>
src/Pure/PIDE/document.ML and document.scala.</p>
<p>The main result of document processing is a markup tree that is associated <br>
with the original source text.  By querying that information (via a <br>
document "snapshot") one can get some dependency-like information, say <br>
where formal entities are defined and references.  This is how hyperlinks <br>
work in Isabelle/jEdit.</p>

<p>Most of that is still missing.  I am already glad to have most of the <br>
ascyncronous editing model running after several years of working on the <br>
concepts and implementation.</p>
<p>What is coming in the next release is some offline dependency management <br>
as part of Isabelle/Scala, to figure out which source files contribute to <br>
an Isabelle "session" (say HOL or an application of it), and to figure out <br>
changes here wrt. a persistent state in the file-system.</p>
