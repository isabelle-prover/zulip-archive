<p>From: Jesper Bengtson &lt;<a href="mailto:jesperb@it.uu.se">jesperb@it.uu.se</a>&gt;<br>
Greetings</p>
<p>In my current formalisation I have a relation which is created through  <br>
some quite trivial rules. It's an equivalence relation, it is a  <br>
congruence, it's idempotent and it has one or two more obscure rules.  <br>
The problem is that these rules are inherently symmetric -- especially  <br>
rules regarding associativity and commutativity of one of the  <br>
operators and I am having a hard time to have Isabelel automatically  <br>
verify proofs even though they are seemingly quite simple. Doing it by  <br>
hand works, but it's a bit of a pain.</p>
<p>My question is basically if there is a way to reason about these types  <br>
of relations automatically in Isabelle where the automatic tactics get  <br>
stuck on symmetries.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>From: Tjark Weber &lt;<a href="mailto:tjark.weber@gmx.de">tjark.weber@gmx.de</a>&gt;<br>
Jesper,</p>
<p>Isabelle uses ordered rewriting.  Permutative rules, e.g. commutativity, are <br>
applied only if this results in a "smaller" (with respect to some fixed <br>
lexicographic order on terms) term.</p>
<p>For an associative and commutative operator f, you should add not only <br>
associativity and commutativity to the set of default rewrite rules, but also <br>
a derived rule, left-commutativity: f(x, f(y, z)) = f(y, f(x, z)).  Please <br>
see Section 9.1.1 of the Isabelle/HOL tutorial for further details.</p>
<p>Since ordered rewriting should prevent the simplifier from "getting stuck" on <br>
symmetries, loops are probably due to more complex interaction between <br>
different rewrite rules.  Maybe try "Isabelle &gt; Settings &gt; Trace Simplifier" <br>
in ProofGeneral to see which rules are getting used.  "apply (simp del: XXX)" <br>
and "apply (simp only: XXX)" (see Section 3.1.4 of the Isabelle/HOL tutorial) <br>
might also be useful to locate the problem.</p>
<p>I hope this answers your question.  Otherwise could you maybe supply a <br>
concrete example of a proof that hangs?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Tjark</p>
