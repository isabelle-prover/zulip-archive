<p>From: José Manuel Rodriguez Caballero &lt;<a href="mailto:josephcmac@gmail.com">josephcmac@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
A practical way to prevent cheating is to ask to the participants to upload<br>
a video of they solving the problem to youtube or a similar website (videos<br>
uploaded 1/2 hour after the end of the competition will be ignored). Only<br>
the videos of the winners will be checked by humans, increasing the speed<br>
of the films. For people with less economic resources, this option is<br>
better than to travel to another continent in order to participate in a<br>
contest. This is just theory, in case someday something similar will be<br>
implemented.</p>

Dear All,</p>
<p>Thank you for your replies with regard to my comment about proving contests<br>
and please accept my apologies for resurrecting an old topic. I have to<br>
admit that my comment was written in awkward circumstances and,<br>
unfortunately, did not convey its intended meaning. Moreover, the comment<br>
may have sounded slightly aggressive, which also was not my intention.<br>
Unfortunately, in this comment, I failed to mention that, of course, I<br>
completely support all proposals and existing contests in the areas of<br>
formal proof and formal verification.</p>
<p>I would also like to emphasize that my comment was made in relation to the<br>
proposal of organizing the "Internation Olympiad in Isabelle" (or,<br>
alternatively, "Internation Olympiad in Formal Proof and Verification")<br>
that was made by José Manuel Rodriguez Caballero and not in relation to any<br>
other contest (i.e. a contest that bears a name that does not start with<br>
the phrase "Internation Olympiad in..."). To the best of my knowledge, all<br>
international olympiads (i.e. all contests that bear names that start with<br>
the phrase "International Olympiad in...") require the presence of<br>
participants on site and take many other steps to prevent cheating.<br>
Moreover, it is likely to be very uncommon for participants to pay for<br>
their travel expenses to international olympiads because they are usually<br>
sponsored by their governments (even participants from less developed<br>
countries). However, of course, admission committees at universities and<br>
employers treat international olympiads much more seriously than all other<br>
events.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for our system, we foresee to also get other theorem provers on board.<br>
For each theorem prover, one needs to find a volunteer who is willing to<br>
implement a prover backend,<br>
and who is willing to formulate the tasks for the theorem prover.</p>
<p>As for most programming competitions, our main goal is to spark<br>
motivation. For this purpose, in my opinion, the<br>
only way is to host the competition online, as only then everyone has the<br>
possibility to participate.</p>
<p>I agree that if you want to hand out an important prize, you will always<br>
need to make sure that<br>
the person you give the prize to will be the one who actually solved the<br>
problems. However,<br>
I believe this is already ten steps ahead of where we stand now.<br>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to make several comments with regard to the proposal by José<br>
Manuel Rodriguez Caballero (as someone who participated in olympiads while<br>
studying at secondary school).<br>
Of course, the olympiads in informatics can hardly be described as<br>
olympiads that test the participants on their knowledge of the syntax of a<br>
particular programming language. The main challenge is the design of<br>
algorithms and not their implementation. The participants are allowed to<br>
select a programming language. While the choice is relatively narrow (C++,<br>
Pascal and Java), they seem to be working on expanding this choice (until<br>
recently the participants were allowed to use only C, C++ and Pascal).<br>
While Isabelle is one of the most popular proof assistants, it is not the<br>
only available proof assistant. I believe that Coq is equivalently popular<br>
and has nearly identical functionality (for example, there are more<br>
questions about Coq on Stack Overflow than about Isabelle). Of course,<br>
there are other well-known systems for proof verification.<br>
Personally, I prefer Isabelle and I would like to see it succeed. However,<br>
if one was to organise an international olympiad that allows its<br>
participants to use Isabelle, in my opinion, it would need to be an<br>
olympiad in the proof verification/logic/formal methods and not an olympiad<br>
"in Isabelle". From the start, it should allow the participants to use<br>
either Isabelle or Coq. Also, of course, the tasks should reflect that the<br>
participants are being tested on their knowledge of the methods that are<br>
commonly used for the formalisation of mathematics or formal proof of<br>
computer programs and not the knowledge of the 'advanced features' of a<br>
given proof assistant. Thus, the organisers would have to carefully select<br>
the subsets of the standard libraries that one is allowed to use during the<br>
olympiad.<br>
Also, personally, in my view, participation over the internet should not<br>
be allowed, because it favours cheating. Being able to claim that one has a<br>
prize in an olympiad in formal verification would provide an enormous<br>
competitive advantage when one is applying to universities (and beyond).<br>
Thus, cheating must be eliminated at all costs. It may be best (for the<br>
sake of humanity) not to organise such an olympiad at all, rather than<br>
allowing the participation over the internet. Also, of course, there should<br>
be different olympiads for secondary school students and undergraduate<br>
students.<br>
Thank you</p>

<p>There is not aggressiveness in pointing out that there are people who cheat<br>
in life: this is the reason why cryptography and security engineering<br>
exist. In one phrase due to the great MILAN KUNDERA: Only animals were not<br>
expelled from Paradise. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Kundera">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Kundera</a></p>

<p>You already mentioned the possibility of individual people cheating. Well,<br>
there is the possibility of some governments cheating too. I have many<br>
friends who will start laughing if someone talks about the honesty of their<br>
governments. I do not want to talk about politics. So, I leave it to your<br>
imagination.</p>
