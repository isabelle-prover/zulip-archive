Hi José,</p>
<p>indeed, judging the solutions in those competitions was always a tremendous effort.<br>
The reason why at these events humans had to be involved in the judging was the diversity of tools and the fact that specifications were given in natural language.</p>
<p>Your idea is quite different and very intriguing! I hope it will be realized eventually :)</p>
<p>Best,<br>

<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
Instead of judging by proof by runtime (which does not seem like a very<br>
useful criterion) or by beauty (which needs big human effort), an option<br>
would be percentage of completion. By giving out several problems of<br>
differing hardness one could make sure that basically no-one will get 100%<br>
of the solutions. (And even for a given problem one might have different<br>
options. E.g., prove this for integers vs. for any ring. Or prove this with<br>
the following additional simplifying assumption vs. prove it without<br>
assumption, etc.)</p>
<p>Then checking can be automated. (And to look for cheaters, it will not be<br>
enough to manually scan the source for for "sorry". Instead, the only<br>
reliable way as far as I know is to extract the proof term and replay it in<br>
a separate instance of Isabelle. But the infrastructure for that is mostly<br>
there, so it's mainly a question of filling in some "plumbing".)</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

Dear all,</p>
<p>currently we use the following scheme. Each sub-task is worth a certain<br>
number of points. We first rank by highest total score, and then lowest sum<br>
of submission time stamps to break the ties.</p>

<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>I would like to make several comments with regard to the proposal by José<br>
Manuel Rodriguez Caballero (as someone who participated in olympiads while<br>
studying at secondary school).</p>
<p>Of course, the olympiads in informatics can hardly be described as<br>
olympiads that test the participants on their knowledge of the syntax of a<br>
particular programming language. The main challenge is the design of<br>
algorithms and not their implementation. The participants are allowed to<br>
select a programming language. While the choice is relatively narrow (C++,<br>
Pascal and Java), they seem to be working on expanding this choice (until<br>
recently the participants were allowed to use only C, C++ and Pascal).</p>
<p>While Isabelle is one of the most popular proof assistants, it is not the<br>
only available proof assistant. I believe that Coq is equivalently popular<br>
and has nearly identical functionality (for example, there are more<br>
questions about Coq on Stack Overflow than about Isabelle). Of course,<br>
there are other well-known systems for proof verification.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer Isabelle and I would like to see it succeed. However,<br>
if one was to organise an international olympiad that allows its<br>
participants to use Isabelle, in my opinion, it would need to be an<br>
olympiad in the proof verification/logic/formal methods and not an olympiad<br>
"in Isabelle". From the start, it should allow the participants to use<br>
either Isabelle or Coq. Also, of course, the tasks should reflect that the<br>
participants are being tested on their knowledge of the methods that are<br>
commonly used for the formalisation of mathematics or formal proof of<br>
computer programs and not the knowledge of the 'advanced features' of a<br>
given proof assistant. Thus, the organisers would have to carefully select<br>
the subsets of the standard libraries that one is allowed to use during the<br>
olympiad.</p>
<p>Also, personally, in my view, participation over the internet should not be<br>
allowed, because it favours cheating. Being able to claim that one has a<br>
prize in an olympiad in formal verification would provide an enormous<br>
competitive advantage when one is applying to universities (and beyond).<br>
Thus, cheating must be eliminated at all costs. It may be best (for the<br>
sake of humanity) not to organise such an olympiad at all, rather than<br>
allowing the participation over the internet. Also, of course, there should<br>
be different olympiads for secondary school students and undergraduate<br>
students.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

Dear all,</p>
<p>for our system, we foresee to also get other theorem provers on board.<br>
For each theorem prover, one needs to find a volunteer who is willing to<br>
implement a prover backend,<br>
and who is willing to formulate the tasks for the theorem prover.</p>
<p>As for most programming competitions, our main goal is to spark motivation.<br>
For this purpose, in my opinion, the<br>
only way is to host the competition online, as only then everyone has the<br>
possibility to participate.</p>
<p>I agree that if you want to hand out an important prize, you will always<br>
need to make sure that<br>
the person you give the prize to will be the one who actually solved the<br>
problems. However,<br>
I believe this is already ten steps ahead of where we stand now.</p>
<p>Simon</p>

Just to point out that Contests using Isabelle do not need to be restricted<br>
to mathematics: they can be about any subject, e.g, chemistry, physics,<br>
biology, and even philosophy. The only requirement is to use axioms. The<br>
fact that the solutions can be automatically checked allow massive<br>
participation from several countries via email. Internet is a new paradigm<br>
for Contests.</p>
<p>A similar massive educational-scientific project are the games about<br>
quantum mechanics, in order to develop the quantum intuition in people<br>
which are not quantum physicists :<br>

Hi Gidon,</p>
<p>Interesting Proving Contests in your links, thank you ! Nevertheless, I<br>
took a look at the Geographical distribution of the participants (page 3 in<br>
the following link):<br>
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.362.2877&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.362.2877&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a></p>
<p>I think that it is important to open a competition for millions of<br>
participants at the same time, including participants from less<br>
economically developed countries. This is the reason why I suggested a<br>
software in order to do the ordering of the solutions in virtue of the<br>
running time: human cannot handle such a huge data.</p>
<p>In the same way that alphabetization was extended from an elite to the<br>
whole world, proof assistants are a second alphabetization that the world<br>
need in order to get update: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU</a></p>

Hi Jose  </p>
<p>Considering ranking of the solutions by running time: I am not convinced that<br>
this is a good measure for ranking formal proofs ... it's indeed a practical<br>
one that is simple to automate, but it surely does not discriminate good from<br>
bad proofs ... I even fear that optimizing a proof for running time may make<br>
it harder to read and less elegant. Are there other criteria to rank proofs<br>
that can be checked automatically? Size of the thy file isn't a good one, too,<br>
I fear.  </p>

<p>Nice project. My idea of an International Olympiad in Isabelle are a little<br>
bit different. Indeed, I can summarize my vision as follows:</p>
<p>1) There will be some publicity about the International Olympiad some<br>
months before its date. The publicity should be mainly addressed to<br>
undergraduate and high school students. People interested in the Olympiad<br>
should summit their email addresses in a website. People working with<br>
Isabelle in an official research project, e.g., a Master, a PhD, a<br>
professor or a professional programmer, are not allowed to apply in order<br>
to guarantee more space for beginners.</p>
<p>2) The day of the Olympiad, a thy-file with a theorem followed by sorry<br>
will be sent to each one of the email addresses.</p>
<p>3) People can submit their solutions until 6 hours after their received the<br>
email  with the problem (5 hours to solve the problem and 1 hour to make a<br>
break, I guess). Solutions sent after the deadline will be automatically<br>
ignored.</p>
<p>4) An automatic system (software) will discriminate the invalid solutions,<br>
e.g., using sorry somewhere, from the valid solutions. After that, it will<br>
make an ordering according to the running time of each valid solution.</p>
<p>5) Finally, an email with the ranking of his/her solution will be<br>
automatically sent to each participant. The participants having ranking 1,<br>
2, 3 will receive a prize.</p>
<p>When I think about such an international project, I am mainly concerned<br>
with people living in economically less developed countries. The idea is<br>
that a person from such countries, having the dream of winning an<br>
International Olympiad in Isabelle will have a motivation to improve<br>
himself/herself in this field. Of course, classification by countries<br>
should be avoided and people from highly developed countries should be<br>
allowed to participate as well.</p>
<p>This is just a dream, I have not enough free time to do something about it.<br>
My inspiration are the IOI: <a href="https://ioinformatics.org/">https://ioinformatics.org/</a></p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
José M.</p>
