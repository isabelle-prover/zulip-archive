Dear José,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I seem to be missing something while trying to show a certain<br>
construction is a Ring (a locale in an imported theory).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>could you maybe point us to the theory file where this is defined? It<br>
would make helping you solve your problem much easier. (The answers<br>
below are speculations because I don't know the details.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma stalk_set_is_ring:<br>
assumes P: "x ∈⋃T"<br>
shows "Ring (stalk_ring x)"<br>
proof unfold_locales</p>
<p>although at least most of them must be trivial (I built this ring out of<br>
an existing one). There must be a gap in my understanding of this<br>
process, since I tried to prove this apparently trivial</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where exactly did you get stuck? This looks at least like the correct<br>
lemma statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma (in presheaf) objecstmapringvalued:<br>
assumes L: "(U:: 'a set) ∈ T"<br>
shows "Ring (objectsmap U)"<br>
proof unfold_locales</p>
<p>and failed. This should show for each U that objectsmap U is a Ring, and<br>
here objectsmap :: "'a set ⇒ ('a, 'm) Ring_scheme" is one of the<br>
parameters of the locale presheaf, so wouldn't that be immediate since<br>
the last type is ('a,'m) Ring_schemes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this is hard to say without seeing the "Ring" locale. There could<br>
be additional assumptions you have to show.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also noticed that although I<br>
can invoke presheaf_axioms and presheaf_def, I can't directly use<br>
something like the definition of objectsmap itself in a proof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How so? There should be a theorem called "objectsmap_def" if<br>
"objectsmap" is a regular "definition". You can unfold that using "apply<br>
(subst objectsmap_def)" or "unfolding objectsmap_def".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm still not sure about how to tell Isabelle to use an instance of the ring<br>
axioms or theorems for a particular ring during a proof -- in my<br>
situation, for example, all the new ring operations are built out of<br>
those of rings objectsmap U, so it would be great to invoke facts for such.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use the command "interpret" in a proof to obtain the facts for<br>
an existing structure, like so:</p>
<p>interpret xyz: Ring "other_structure"</p>
<p>... then, if there's an assumption "abc" in the "Ring" locale, you can<br>
access that via "<a href="http://xyz.abc">xyz.abc</a>". See the locale manual for more details on<br>
this process.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>

Hi José,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry for the delay, it seems I was missing a hypothesis in my locale<br>
declaration (presheaf) and after adding<br>
that I spent some time trying to make it work using your suggestion, to<br>
no avail (although it's certainly progress).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>did you mean to reply to the list instead of privately?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've attached all the relevant theories. The one I'm building is<br>
"Sheaves.thy", while the locale "Ring"<br>
is declared in "Algebra4.thy". It still says "objectsmap_def" is an<br>
undefined fact, by the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason is that "objectsmap" is not a definition.</p>
<p>If you use a definitional package in Isabelle, for example, "fun",<br>
"inductive", or plain old "definition", you will get a constant (e.g.<br>
"x") and an accompanying theorem "x_def".</p>
<p>If you however introduce a parameter in a locale (as you did in the<br>
"presheaf" locale), there is no such theorem. You can only use the<br>
assumptions of the locale.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>

Dear Isabelle Users,</p>
<p>I seem to be missing something while trying to show a certain <br>
construction is a Ring (a locale in an imported theory).</p>
<p>I defined all the necessary operations and this</p>
<p>definition stalk_ring :: "'a ⇒  ('a set × 'a) set Ring" where<br>
    "stalk_ring x =<br>
    ⦇carrier = stalk x,<br>
      pop = stalk_pop x,<br>
      mop = stalk_mop x,<br>
      zero = stalk_zero x,<br>
      tp = stalk_tp x,<br>
      un = stalk_un x⦈"<br>
which should give me a Ring stalk_ring x for each x. I then tried to <br>
show it's a ring, but have been unable to show any of the subgoals after <br>
writing</p>
<p>lemma stalk_set_is_ring:<br>
assumes P: "x ∈⋃T"<br>
shows "Ring (stalk_ring x)"<br>
proof unfold_locales</p>
<p>although at least most of them must be trivial (I built this ring out of <br>
an existing one). There must be a gap in my understanding of this <br>
process, since I tried to prove this apparently trivial</p>
<p>lemma (in presheaf) objecstmapringvalued:<br>
assumes L: "(U:: 'a set) ∈ T"<br>
shows "Ring (objectsmap U)"<br>
proof unfold_locales</p>
<p>and failed. This should show for each U that objectsmap U is a Ring, and <br>
here objectsmap :: "'a set ⇒ ('a, 'm) Ring_scheme" is one of the <br>
parameters of the locale presheaf, so wouldn't that be immediate since <br>
the last type is ('a,'m) Ring_schemes? I also noticed that although I <br>
can invoke presheaf_axioms and presheaf_def, I can't directly use <br>

situation, for example, all the new ring operations are built out of <br>
those of rings objectsmap U, so it would be great to invoke facts for <br>
such.</p>
<p>I'm a mathematician recently introduced to Isabelle, so I'd appreciate <br>
any orientation on the matter.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>José Siqueira</p>
