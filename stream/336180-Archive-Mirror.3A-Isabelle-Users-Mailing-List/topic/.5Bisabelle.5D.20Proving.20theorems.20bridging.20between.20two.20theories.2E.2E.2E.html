Hi,</p>
<p>I was wondering whether Isabelle can prove theorems bridging between two<br>
theories. For example, if I have A.thy and B.thy, can I prove that there is<br>
a constant c in A that equals to v, while c in B doesn't equal to v? A and B<br>
can't be merged into one because together they'd be inconsistent.</p>
<p>Could locales be used here? It seems to me that: "locale C = A + B" would<br>
merge A and B together to form C. Perhaps another operator could be used to<br>
indicate that two locales are involved in the proof, but are not imported.<br>
Is there a better way for proving bridging theorems? If not, would it make<br>
sense for me to implement such an operator in ML? How much effort do you<br>
think the implementation will require?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Steve</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>I'm reposting a question from earlier:</p>
<p>I was wondering whether Isabelle can prove theorems bridging between two<br>
theories or locales. For example, if I have A.thy and B.thy, can I prove<br>
that there is a constant c in A that equals to v, while c in B that doesn't<br>
equal to v? A and B can't be merged into one because together they'd be<br>
inconsistent.</p>
<p>Could locales be used here? It seems to me that: "locale C = A + B" would<br>
merge A and B together to form C. Perhaps another operator could be used to<br>
indicate that two locales are involved in the proof, but are not imported.<br>
Is there a better way for proving bridging theorems? If not, would it<br>
necessary for me to implement such an operator in ML? How much effort should<br>
the implementation require?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Steve</p>
