<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Members of the Research Community,</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce the publication of the mathematical logic R0, a <br>
further development of Peter B. Andrews' logic Q0. The syntactic features <br>
provided by R0 are type variables (polymorphic type theory), the binding of <br>
type variables with the abstraction operator and single variable binder λ (type <br>
abstraction), and (some of) the means necessary for dependent types (dependent <br>
type theory).</p>
<p>The publication is available online at<br>
<a href="http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf</a></p>
<p>The introduction can be found on pp. 11 f.</p>
<p>A printed copy can be ordered with ISBN 978-3-943334-07-4. The software <br>
implementation is expected to be published in due course. For more information, <br>
please visit: <a href="http://doi.org/10.4444/100.3">http://doi.org/10.4444/100.3</a></p>
<p>The expressiveness of the formal language obtained with type abstraction allows <br>
for a natural formulation of group theory [cf. p. 12 of <br>
<a href="http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf</a> ]. With the set (type) of Boolean <br>
values o, the exclusive disjunction XOR, and an appropriate definition of <br>
groups Grp [p. 362], the fact that (o, XOR) is a group can be expressed in <br>
lambda notation with [p. 420]<br>
    Grp o XOR</p>
<p>This enhancement of the expressiveness of the formal language overcomes the <br>
"limitation of the simple HOL type system [...] that there is no explicit <br>
quantifier over polymorphic type variables, which can make many standard <br>
results [...] awkward to express [...]. [...] For example, in one of the most <br>
impressive formalization efforts to date [Gonthier et al., 2013] the entire <br>
group theory framework is developed in terms of subsets of a single universe <br>
group, apparently to avoid the complications from groups with general and <br>
possibly heterogeneous types." [Harrison, Urban, and Wiedijk, 2014, pp. 170 f.]</p>
<p>Furthermore, the enhanced expressiveness provided by R0 avoids the <br>
circumlocutions connected with preliminary solutions like axiomatic type <br>
classes recently developed and discussed for Isabelle/HOL. The expressiveness <br>
of type abstraction also replaces the notion of compound types, which in HOL <br>
are used for ordered pairs (the Cartesian product, see section 1.2 of <br>
<a href="http://freefr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/hol/hol/kananaskis-11/kananaskis-11-logic.pdf">http://freefr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/hol/hol/kananaskis-11/kananaskis-11-logic.pdf</a> ), <br>
that in R0 can be formalized without compound types [cf. pp. 378 f. of <br>
<a href="http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf</a> ].</p>
<p>Mike Gordon's HOL developed at Cambridge University is, like Andrews' logic Q0, <br>
based on the Simple Theory of Types (1940) developed by Alonzo Church, Andrews' <br>
Ph.D. advisor at Princeton University. Among the HOL group, there has always <br>
been the awareness that besides automation, there is the philosophical <br>
(logical) desire to reduce the means of the logic to a few principles. In the <br>
HOL handbook, Andrew M. Pitts wrote the legendary sentence: "From a logical <br>
point of view, it would be better to have a simpler substitution primitive, <br>
such as 'Rule R' of Andrews' logic Q0, and then to derive more complex rules <br>
from it." [Gordon and Melham, 1993, p. 213]</p>
<p>In the same spirit, Mike Gordon wrote on the genesis of HOL: "[T]he terms [...] <br>
could be encoded [...] in such a way that the LSM expansion-law just becomes a <br>
derived rule [...]. This approach is both more elegant and rests on a firmer <br>
logical foundation, so I switched to it and HOL was born." [Gordon, 2000, p. <br>
173]</p>
<p>The general principle of reducing the logic (including the language) to a few <br>
principles is the main criterion for the design of Q0 (having only a single <br>
primitive rule of inference, Rule R), which is summarized by Peter B. Andrews <br>
as follows: "Therefore we shall turn our attention to finding a formulation of <br>
type theory which is as expressive as possible, allowing mathematical ideas to <br>
be expressed precisely with a minimum of circumlocutions, and which is as <br>
simple and economical as is possible without sacrificing expressiveness. The <br>
reader will observe that the formal language we find arises very naturally from <br>
a few fundamental design decisions." [Andrews, 2002, pp. 205 f.]</p>
<p>R0 "follows Andrews' concept of expressiveness (I also use the term <br>
reducibility), which aims at the ideal and natural language of formal logic and <br>
mathematics.“ [p. 11 of <a href="http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf</a> ]</p>
<p>Like John Harrison's HOL Light, R0 has an extremely small kernel. R0 resembles <br>
Norman Megill's Metamath, which "attempts to use the minimum possible framework <br>
needed to express mathematics and its proofs.“ ( <a href="http://us.metamath.org/">http://us.metamath.org/</a> ) For <br>
the same reason, R0 is, unlike most other systems, a Hilbert-style system.</p>
<p>R0 uses, like Q0, the description operator, avoiding the problems of the <br>
epsilon operator already discussed by Mike Gordon himself for HOL: "It must be <br>
admitted that the ε-operator looks rather suspicious." [Gordon, 2001, p. 24] <br>
"The inclusion of ε-terms into HOL 'builds in' the Axiom of Choice [...]." <br>
[Gordon, 2001, p. 24]</p>
<p>Unlike in Coq, in R0, the Curry-Howard isomorphism is not used, favoring a <br>
direct (unencoded) expression rather than the encoding of proofs. For the same <br>
reason, it is an object logic and not a logical framework (such as Larry <br>
Paulson's Isabelle and Norman Megill's Metamath). Like Cris Perdue’s Prooftoys <br>
( <a href="http://prooftoys.org">http://prooftoys.org</a> , <a href="http://mathtoys.org">http://mathtoys.org</a> ) - a natural deduction variant of <br>
Andrews' Q0 - in R0, the turnstile symbol is replaced by the logical <br>
implication [p. 12].</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
