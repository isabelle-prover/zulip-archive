The Second International Workshop on<br>
            Proof Exchange for Theorem Proving (PxTP)<br>
<a href="http://pxtp2012.inria.fr">http://pxtp2012.inria.fr</a></p>
<p>associated with </p>
<p>The International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning<br>
                          (IJCAR), 2012</p>
<hr>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers working<br>
on proof production from automated theorem provers with potential<br>
consumers of proofs.  Machine-checkable proofs have been proposed for<br>
applications like proof-carrying code and certified compilation, as<br>
well as for exchanging knowledge between different automated reasoning<br>
systems.  For example, interactive theorem provers can import results<br>
from otherwise untrusted high-performance solvers, by means of proofs<br>
the solvers produce.  In such situations, one automated reasoning tool<br>
can make use of the results of another, without having to trust that<br>
the second tool is sound.  It is only necessary to be able to<br>
reconstruct a proof that the first tool will accept, in order to<br>
import the result without increasing the size of the trusted computing<br>
base.</p>
<p>This simple idea of proof exchange for theorem proving becomes quite<br>
complicated under the real-world constraints of highly complex and<br>
heterogeneous proof producers and proof consumers.  For example, even<br>
the issue of a standard proof format for a single class of solvers,<br>
like SMT solvers, is quite difficult to address, as different solvers<br>
use different inference systems.  It may be quite challenging, from an<br>
engineering and possibly also theoretical point of view, to fit these<br>
into a single standard format.  Emerging work from several groups<br>
proposes standard meta-languages or parametrized formats to achieve<br>
flexibility while retaining a universal proof language.</p>
<hr>
<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of proof<br>
exchange among automated reasoning tools.  More specifically, some<br>
suggested topics are:</p>
<p>-- proposed proof formats for different classes of logic solvers (SAT,<br>
   SMT, QBF, First-Order ATP, Higher-Order ATP, Rewriting, etc.).</p>
<p>-- meta-languages and logical frameworks for proofs, particularly <br>
   proof systems designed for solvers.</p>
<p>-- proof checking tools and algorithms.</p>
<p>-- proof translation and methods for importing proofs, including proof<br>
   replaying or reconstruction.</p>
<p>-- tools and case studies related to analyzing proofs produced by<br>
   solvers, and proof metrics.</p>
<p>-- applications relying on importing proofs from automated theorem<br>
   provers, such as certified static analysis, proof-carrying code, or<br>
   certified compilation.</p>
<p>-- data structures and algorithms for improved proof production in<br>
   solvers (for example, more time- or memory-efficient ways of<br>
   representing proofs).</p>
<hr>
<p>Submissions</p>
<p>Submitted papers must fall into one of the following two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Short papers: up to 6 pages, work in progress, experience reports, <br>
  tool presentations or position statements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular papers: 12-15 pages, research papers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will<br>
select a balanced program of high-quality contributions. <br>
Short submissions that could stimulate fruitful discussion at the<br>
workshop are particularly welcome.</p>
<p>Submissions should be in standard-conforming Postscript or PDF.  Final<br>
versions should be prepared in LaTeX using the easychair.cls class<br>
file.</p>
<p>To submit a paper, go to the EasyChair PxTP page<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pxtp2012">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pxtp2012</a> <br>
and follow the instructions there.</p>
<p>PxTP will have no formal proceedings, but we intend to provide<br>
electronic proceedings on the CEUR-WS website.</p>
