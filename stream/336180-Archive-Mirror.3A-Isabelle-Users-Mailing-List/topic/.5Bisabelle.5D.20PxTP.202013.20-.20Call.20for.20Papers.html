<p>The Third International Workshop on<br>
            Proof Exchange for Theorem Proving (PxTP)<br>
            (and Cooperation between Theorem Provers)<br>

<p>June 10, 2013, Lake Placid, USA</p>
<p>associated with</p>
<p>The Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE), 2013.</p>

<p>Invited Speaker</p>

<p>Scope</p>
<p>The PxTP workshop welcomes contributions on various aspects of<br>
communication, integration, and cooperation between reasoning systems<br>
and formalisms.</p>
<p>The past decades have seen impressive advances in computer-aided<br>
reasoning, both in automated and interactive theorem proving. As shown<br>
by various system competitions, such as CASC, SMT-COMP, and the SAT<br>
competition, deduction tools are able to tackle larger problems<br>
progressively faster and are increasingly more applicable to a wider<br>
range of problems. In recent years, integration of such automated<br>
tools in larger verification environments has demonstrated the<br>
potential to reduce the amount of manual verification work.</p>
<p>It is becoming clear that the success of deduction tools will not only<br>
depend on their power to solve large and difficult problems in an<br>
isolated manner, but it will also rely on their ability to cooperate,<br>
by exchanging problems, proofs, and models. The PxTP workshop aims at<br>
encouraging such cooperation by inviting contributions on various<br>
aspects of communication, integration, and cooperation between systems<br>
and formalisms. The workshop's mission is to facilitate building of<br>
complex reasoning applications and reuse of reasoning tools by<br>
developing and discussing suitable integration, translation and<br>
communication methods, standards, protocols, and application<br>
programming interfaces (APIs).  We are interested both in success<br>
stories and in descriptions of the current bottlenecks and proposals<br>
for improvement.</p>
<hr>
<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of<br>
cooperation between reasoning tools, whether automatic or interactive.<br>
More specifically, some suggested topics are</p>
<p>-- applications that integrate reasoning tools<br>
   (ideally with certification of the result);</p>
<p>-- translations between logics, proof systems, models;</p>
<p>-- distribution of proof obligations among heterogeneous reasoning<br>
   tools;</p>
<p>-- algorithms and tools for checking and importing (replaying,<br>
   reconstructing) proofs;</p>
<p>-- proposed formats for expressing problems and solutions for<br>
   different classes of logic solvers (SAT, SMT, QBF, first-order<br>
   logic, higher-order logic, typed logic, rewriting, etc.);</p>
<p>-- meta-languages, logical frameworks, communication methods,<br>
   standards, protocols, and APIs connected to problems, proofs, and<br>
   models;</p>
<p>-- comparison, refactoring, and optimization of proofs;</p>
<p>-- practical experiences, case studies, feasibility studies;</p>
<p>-- applications relying on importing proofs from automatic theorem<br>
   provers, such as certified static analysis, proof-carrying code, or<br>
   certified compilation;</p>
<p>-- data structures and algorithms for improved proof production in<br>
   solvers (e.g., efficient proof representations).</p>
<hr>
<p>Submissions</p>
<p>Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either<br>
an extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15<br>
pages) via EasyChair.</p>
<p>Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will<br>
select a balanced program of high-quality contributions.  Short<br>
submissions that could stimulate fruitful discussion at the workshop<br>
are particularly welcome.</p>
<p>Submissions should be in PDF. Final versions should be prepared in<br>
LaTeX using the "easychair.cls" class file, available at<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/publications/">http://www.easychair.org/publications/</a>.</p>
<p>To submit a paper, go to the EasyChair PxTP page<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pxtp2013">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pxtp2013</a><br>
and follow the instructions there.</p>
<p>PxTP proceedings will be published electronically in the EasyChair<br>
Proceedings in Computing (EPiC) series or in the CEUR workshop<br>
proceedings.</p>
