<p>(Preliminary Comment): In my mind, I'm doubting that the so-called <br>
first-order language of Zermelo-Frankael set theory does in fact give <br>
one the ability to completely state and prove set theory as a <br>
first-order language, primarily because of the absence in the symbols <br>
of  FOL to name constants in relation to FOL formulas. This sentence, <br>
however, should be ignored, since I'm sitting on a question about that.</p>
<p>Listing the books below is the purpose of this reply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, as you may have observed on hol info, I know next to nothing<br>
about HOL... Where is a good place to learn about HOL?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a "book collecting" step ahead of you when it comes to learning <br>
Isabelle/HOL, which I consider necessary to use Isabelle. My primary <br>
interest is not in HOL but in the first-order language of ZF sets. <br>
However, it's occurred to me that Isabelle/HOL can probably be used as a <br>
meta-language to implement any object-language that I'll be interested <br>
in. Additionally, and maybe of more importance, is the need in <br>
mathematics for a solid implementation of a number system. I gather that <br>
implementing a number system that's useful in a theorem prover is a very <br>
difficult thing to do, and it appears that the Isabelle group has put <br>
put a whole lot of work in doing that in Isabelle/HOL. It also appears <br>
that most of the tool support and code development is going into <br>
Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>Anyway, no one has told me this, but it appears that to understand <br>
Isabelle/HOL in depth, you need to understand a combination of subjects:</p>
<p>1) Natural deduction logic<br>
2) Lambda calculus<br>
3) Typed lambda calculus, some of it coming from a non-constructivist <br>
viewpoint<br>
4) The ML programming language<br>
5) The meta-logic of Isabelle/Pure</p>
<p>As to the minimum a person needs to know to be successful with Isabelle, <br>
I don't know what that is. Whatever the minimum is, I'm not there yet.</p>
<p>Below are a list of books and documents that I've found. I don't provide <br>
links to Amazon because the Amazon URLs get long, and the list server <br>
converts all HTML links to the actual URL.</p>
<p>-----NATURAL DEDUCTION LOGIC---</p>
<p>NOTE: You won't find much natural deduction in logic books written by <br>
mathematicians. They primarily use truth-table based logic.</p>
<p>"Proof and Disproof in Formal Logic", by Richard Bornat (Amazon)<br>
         This books is what I'm working through. Some of it's written like<br>
         "An Idiot's Guide to Natural Deduction", but it's still good, <br>
and there's<br>
         the Jape prover for doing some natural deduction exercises.<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bernard.sufrin/personal/jape.org/">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bernard.sufrin/personal/jape.org/</a></p>
<p>"Mathematical Logic", by Ian Chiswell &amp; Wilfrid Hodges (Amazon)<br>
         Covers natural deduction, but it also hits on a related logic, <br>
sequent calculus, that gets<br>
         referred to in the Isabelle literature.</p>
<p>"Logic for Computer Science", by Jean H. Gallier (Amazon)<br>
         More advanced. I use it to try and find unfamiliar terminology.</p>
<p>"Natural Deduction", by Dag Prawitz (Amazon)<br>
         One of the first books (or the first) on natural deduction. I <br>
use it to try and find unfamiliar terminology.</p>
<p>"Logic for Computer Science", by Steve Reeves and Mike Clarke (Amazon)<br>
         Covers natural deduction, but also hits on "semantic tableaux", <br>
which gets referred to in the Isabelle literature.<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_analytic_tableaux">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_analytic_tableaux</a></p>
<p>---LAMBDA CALCULUS &amp; TYPED LAMBDA CALCULUS---</p>
<p>NOTE: I separated lambda calculus from typed lambda calculus because <br>
there are books for typed lambda calculus that take a strong, <br>
constructivist approach, and some of these books don't apply as much. <br>
What you're looking for is simply typed lambda calculus.</p>
<p>"An Introduction to Functional Programming through Lambda Calculus", by <br>
Greg Michaelson (Amazon)<br>
       Written to be "super friendly", it uses a combination of <br>
pseudo-programming syntax and<br>
       lambda calculus syntax. It works through examples with an <br>
obnoxious level of detail which<br>
       serve their purpose to drive the points in.</p>
<p>"Type Theory &amp; Functional Programming", by Simon Thompson (Amazon)<br>
       Has intro chapters on propositional logic, first-order logic, and <br>
lambda-calculus. It<br>
       ties together logic, lambda-calculus, and functional programming, <br>
and it emphasizes<br>
       types as proofs, and proofs as types.</p>
<p>"Basic Simple Type Theory", by J. Roger Hindley (Amazon)<br>
       A more formal, mathematical treatment. Gets to typed lambda <br>
calculus fairly fast.</p>
<p>"Lambda-Calculus and Combinators - an Introduction", by Hindley &amp; Seldin <br>
(Amazon)<br>
      Has some of the same material as Hindley's books above, but has <br>
too much on<br>
      combinatory logic.</p>
<p>"Foundations of Functional Programming", by Lawrence Paulson<br>
      A quick summary of lambda calculus.<br>

<p>"Lambda Calculi with Types", by Henk Barendregt (Amazon)</p>
<p>"Types and Programming Language", by Benjamin C. Pierce (Amazon)</p>

<p>---ML PROGRAMING LANGUAGE---</p>
<p>NOTE: The great thing about learning ML is that you can do your little <br>
code snippets in Isabelle. Just use the command "ML{* ...code... *}".</p>
<p>"ML for the Working Programmer", 2nd, by Larry Paulson (Amazon)</p>
<p>"Programming in Standard ML '97", by Stephen Gilmore<br>

<p>"Elements of ML Programming", by Jeffrey D. Ullman (Amazon)</p>
<p>---META-LOGIC OF ISABELLE/PURE---</p>
<p>NOTE: I'll ask the list someday what documents explain the meta-logic, <br>
but here's some docs that appear to explain the meta-logic to varying <br>
degrees.</p>

This last part was supposed to be a joke on my part, but I forgot that <br>
this is an international community, that Rudin's book is not a standard <br>
textbook everywhere, that not everyone would know that it was first <br>
published many years ago, and that not everyone would be aware that <br>
Rudin is deceased.</p>

Hello Gottfried,</p>
<p>let me answer the subject partially: Besides of real world understanding <br>
and learning by oneself there also some books which could help you <br>
clarify your (an other people's) thinking. The basic ones are listed at <br>
<a href="http://cococo.de/Context_IT_GmbH/index.jsp?content=columbo&amp;detail=literatur">http://cococo.de/Context_IT_GmbH/index.jsp?content=columbo&amp;detail=literatur</a> <br>
and are structured in a certain way.  Sorry for missing translations ...</p>
