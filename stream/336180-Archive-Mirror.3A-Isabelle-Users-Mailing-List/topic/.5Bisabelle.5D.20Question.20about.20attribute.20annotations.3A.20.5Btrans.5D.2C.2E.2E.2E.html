<p>From: Hannes Verlinde &lt;<a href="mailto:Hannes.Verlinde@UGent.be">Hannes.Verlinde@UGent.be</a>&gt;<br>
I am experimenting in Isabelle/Isar with an object-logic that represents<br>
equational propositional logic (using the calculational patterns provided by<br>
Isar). In the theory, there are just a few inference rules (meta-level<br>
axioms):</p>
<p>Leibniz [intro] : “P = Q ==&gt; E P = E Q”</p>
<p>Transitivity [trans] : “[P = Q; Q = R] ==&gt; P = R”</p>
<p>Equanimity [trans] : “[P = Q; Q] ==&gt; P”</p>
<p>There are also a few derived inference rules (meta-level theorems) that are<br>
simple variations of the rules above. By annotating the rules with the<br>
attributes [intro] and [trans], I don’t have to mention them explicitly in<br>
the Isar proofs. Writing “by rule” will make the system pick a rule<br>
annotated with [intro] and the rules annotated with [trans] will be used<br>
implicitly when chaining calculations with “also” and “finally”.</p>
<p>All of this works fine but it does feel a bit strange to label rule Leibniz<br>
as an introduction rule (or as an elimination rule, or as a symmetry rule).<br>
Note that I don’t really use classical reasoning in my theory. Is it ok to<br>
somewhat “abuse” these attributes in order to obtain the effect of the rules<br>
being automatically selected by the system? I would expect that there is<br>
some annotation like [standard] that simply declares a rule to be a<br>
“standard” rule without forcing the user to classify it as an introduction<br>
or elimination rule. Is there any source that explains clearly which<br>
attributes should be used for which kind of rules and what the consequences<br>
are exactly?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help or comments.</p>

<p>Just note that <code>..'' abbreviates </code>by rule'' (more precisely <code>`by
default'' which includes the rule method as well).  Also, the system will

<p>The conclusion of Leibniz is indeed rather general, and apt to cause<br>
pathological cases for higher-order unification.  If you always provide<br>
the left equality first the situation will be much more predictable.  So<br>
maybe declare it as elim, then the system will only try to use it if there<br>
are any facts being used, but not in a purely backward proof step.</p>

<p>It is basically OK, but may prevent you from using the automated classical<br>
proof tools as expected later on.  Alternatively, you may use Pure.intro<br>
or intro? instead, which do not affect the classical proof tools.  See<br>
also appendix A of the isar-ref manual for a table of rule declarations<br>
and methods.</p>
