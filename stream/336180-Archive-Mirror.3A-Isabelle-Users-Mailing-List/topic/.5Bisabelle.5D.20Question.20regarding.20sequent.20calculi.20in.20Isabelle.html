Hi all,</p>
<p>I currently work on implementing a sequent-style proof calculus over  <br>
dynamic logic. To this end, I have given Isabelle a try (which I  <br>
haven't used much before) and extended LK0.thy from the Sequents logic  <br>
with my proof rules. This seems to work until I run into problems with  <br>
a symbolic execution rule, where every symbol in a predicate needs to  <br>
be replaced by a new symbol.</p>
<p>The rule is of the shape</p>
<p>|- p[v0/v'] --&gt; q[v0/v]<br>
-----------------------,<br>
|- [p]q</p>
<p>where p[v0/v'] denotes the replacement of every primed symbol in p by  <br>
a fresh symbol v0 (and similarly for q). This is not a problem as long  <br>
as only a single symbol is to be substituted -- but I need to replace  <br>
all primed symbols in v'. Is something like this possible with Isabelle?</p>
<p>Second, I have a more general question: it seems that the Sequents  <br>
theory of Isabelle isn't used much and that the main work is on  <br>
Isabelle/HOL. Does it nevertheless make sense to use the Sequents  <br>
theory of Isabelle as a basis for a sequent-style calculus, or is  <br>
Isabelle not the right choice for such a calculus?</p>
<p>I have already asked Makarius about this, who pointed me to this  <br>
mailing list.</p>
<p>Many thanks for any help!</p>
<p>Johannes<br>

I hesitate to call anything impossible, because there are various ways to attach code to a theory. However, this kind of systematic renaming of non-variable symbols isn't directly supported by Isabelle's logical framework.</p>
<p>As for your second question, certainly most development focuses on Isabelle/HOL, but much of it involves strengthening the framework in general, which benefits all logics. We have retained a lot of ancient developments, such as CCL, and I would be very surprised if we got rid of the Sequents theory. Whether there exists an alternative out there I couldn't say. There are of course ready-made implementations of dynamic logic, <a href="http://www.key-project.org/">http://www.key-project.org/</a> for example.</p>
