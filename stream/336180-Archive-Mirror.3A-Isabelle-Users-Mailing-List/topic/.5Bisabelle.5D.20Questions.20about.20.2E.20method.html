<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:christian.sternagel@uibk.ac.at">christian.sternagel@uibk.ac.at</a>&gt;<br>
Just out of curiosity:</p>
<p>1) Why does the method assumption restrict the given facts to 0 or 1?</p>
<p>2) Why does 'by this' seem to do the same thing? Example: Since I am <br>
using exclusively Isar for proves, I accustomed myself to state lemmas as</p>
<p>lemma<br>
     assumes "A" and "B" shows "C"</p>
<p>rather than as</p>
<p>lemma "A ==&gt; B ==&gt; C"</p>
<p>Now, e.g.,</p>
<p>lemma "A ==&gt; B ==&gt; A" .<br>
   lemma "A ==&gt; B ==&gt; A" by assumption</p>
<p>both works. When 'Isarfying' the lemma a bit more, like</p>
<p>lemma assumes "A" shows "B ==&gt; A"<br>
   using assms .</p>
<p>lemma ssumes "A" shows "B ==&gt; A"<br>
   using assms by assumption</p>
<p>it is still working. But with</p>
<p>lemma assumes "A" and "B" shows "A"</p>
<p>it doesn't work any longer. Wouldn't it be nice, to have a short way of <br>
proving such simple statements (where one of the current facts solves <br>
the goal). E.g.,</p>
<p>lemma assumes "A" and "B" shows "A' using assms .</p>
<p>And indeed, isn't that, what the documentation claims? In isar-ref.pdf <br>
on page 88, I read "this applies all of the current facts directly as <br>
rules."</p>
<p>cheers</p>

<p>From: Brian Huffman &lt;<a href="mailto:brianh@cs.pdx.edu">brianh@cs.pdx.edu</a>&gt;<br>
I think the documentation means to say that "." can use multiple facts<br>
to prove multiple goals. Here's an example:</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  assumes "A" and "B"<br>
  shows "B" and "A"<br>
proof -<br>
  from assms show "A" and "B" .<br>
qed</p>
<p>By the way, you can get a fairly short proof using "rule", like this:</p>
<p>lemma assumes "A" and "B" shows "A" by (rule assms)</p>
<p>Of course, this relies on having a named set of facts. To use the<br>
chained facts in this way you would need something like</p>
<p>have "A" and "B" by ...<br>
  note foo = this<br>
  show "A" by (rule foo)</p>
<p>which isn't quite as nice. I agree that a proof method with the<br>
semantics you described would be useful. It probably wouldn't take too<br>
much code to implement; why don't you try writing one?</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The above gives you a goal A and rules <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> which are all applied <br>
as rules (in the order of the text).  After the first rule application, <br>
there are no goals left, so the attempt to apply <code>B</code> fails. Example <br>
situations where several rules actually can be applied: multiple goals, or <br>
single goals with facts that have premises.</p>
<p>The general idea of proper Isar proof methods (as opposed to <br>
semi-automated tools like "simp", or old tactic emulations like <br>
"rule_tac") is to try to take the given structure of the problem <br>
seriously.  The aim is to get a text that faithfully represents the <br>
reasoning, not to accept as much as possible.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<p>from <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> have A by this</p>
<p>reads to me like both A and B somehow contribute to the result, not that <br>
the second one is silently ignored.  In practice there are many corner <br>
causes of proof methods, and often one could define certain fine points <br>
one way or the other, such as "this" vs. "assumption".  On the spot, I do <br>
not recall all the details that lead up all details in basic Isar methods <br>
-- it always takes several rounds of in-depth studies of various <br>
mechanisms to make things fit together in the end.</p>
<p>Anyway, using "assumption" like methods for trivial proofs is slightly <br>
old-style since the "fact" method has come up some years ago.  E.g. this <br>
works:</p>
<p>lemma assumes "A" and "B" shows "A' by fact</p>
<p>Here the implicit scope for trivial facts is the whole of the visible <br>
proof text.  You can also use (fact my_facts) to limit the scope <br>
explicitly.</p>
