<p>From: Tambet &lt;<a href="mailto:qtvali@gmail.com">qtvali@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Sorry for reposting, but I had a few errors (whole day played with Isabelle,<br>
now a bit blurry). This is the same message with errors fixed (hope that<br>
moderator catches the previous one).</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I would like to ask a few questions about Isabelle, because in a day of<br>
reading manuals and testing things, I have some questions needed to do<br>
anything at all left unanswered.</p>
<p>I did, in previous few days, study about Coq, but found out that Isabelle<br>
language use is much more intuitive to me and it has some tools built-in,<br>
which Coq lacks.</p>
<p>However, now I have a number of problems:</p>
<p>- Loading built-in libraries is extremely slow. Is there any kind of<br>
   caching, compilation or preloading technique to make it faster?</p>
<p>- Built-in heuristics tool does not solve things and I think that this is<br>
   related to some bias in my understanding of semantics, because things are<br>
   really trivial.</p>
<p>- Search of patterns is extremely slow - is Isabelle meant only for<br>
   supercomputers and clusters?</p>
<p>Next thing that I quite much do not understand the Class semantics. I am<br>
used to programming languages, mostly imperative, but with many plays with<br>
others, but it's a first try I try to use prover. I am actually completely<br>
lost with that.</p>
<p>I give concrete examples about what I want to do to get on track:</p>
<p>I want to prove several things about Collatz sequences. For that, I tried<br>
(taking fibonaccy series and primes theories as examples) to just formulate<br>
a class, which contains all positive naturals. I did write fixes clause with<br>
'a =&gt; bool and definition that it's over zero. After that I tried to prove<br>
with heuristics, that even integers of that class are bigger than one - this<br>
failed. I tried to unfold the definition from class, but wasn't able to do<br>
that. Now I think that maybe this class does not provide me that check at<br>
all? It's basically copy of similar class from primes with definitions for<br>
naturals removed as I thought that maybe it does not have enough rules for<br>
naturals.</p>
<p>Also, as I'm not even conscious about what exactly to ask, is this possible<br>
to just give me random important hints about good strategies and common<br>
biases related to proving similar things:</p>
<p>I would like to define the following properties to numbers:</p>
<p>Collatz itself, is this OK:</p>
<p>fun<br>
  collatzNext :: "int \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; int"<br>
where<br>
  "collatzNext n =<br>
   (if (n \&lt;in&gt; even) then (n div (2::int)) else<br>
   (if (n \&lt;in&gt; odd) then ((3::int) * n) + (1::int) else<br>
   1))"</p>
<p>I am somewhat worried about this last else clause - it should not be "1",<br>
but undefined. Such output is not possible as I'm considering only the<br>
typical version of Collatz with naturals. I would like to do in one step:<br>
create class that collatz(i) or smth. is positive natural so that I could<br>
use it in definitions (instead of writing everywhere the clause &gt;0) and<br>
prove that thus, it's output is also positive natural (I imagine that this<br>
proof will be automatically asked from me when defining such function?) I<br>
wasn't able to prove this trivial thing - actually I wasn't able to even<br>
prove that things belonging to my class of positive naturals are always<br>
bigger than zero. Thus, maybe the class was totally wrong? I haven't done<br>
classes with Haskell, I am only tried Haskell for a few days as my<br>
girlfriend learns it (sometimes) and I do not want to take the fun away by<br>
knowing better. Anyway, I am now stuck with Isabelle classes - or do I need<br>
a class at all?</p>
<p>Second, I would like to define such things:<br>
"follows a b" for a comes after b in series.<br>
"nextto a b" for b is right after a.<br>
I would better like to use something like a \&lt;before&gt; b and a \&lt;rightbefore&gt;<br>
b.</p>
<p>I would like to have everything after a available as sequence for this class<br>
of rules:<br>
head (collatzSequence a) \&lt;in&gt; even.<br>
first (collatzSequence a) \&lt;in&gt; even. - how to argument about concrete<br>
position, for example that third element is first even element and thus,<br>
second element is last odd element in this series?</p>
<p>I would also like to (check and) prove the following lemmas:</p>
<p>I am playing with Coq and Isabelle now :) Formalizing the following:</p>
<p>fun p(a) = if (p(a) % 2 = 0) then (p(a div 2)) else (a).<br>
The greatest divisor of a, which is power of two = p(a).</p>
<p>I want to show that the number of multiplication-addition series always<br>
equals p(a+1) and gives odd result for odd, even result for even and follows<br>
the formula (((3/2)*<em>(p(a+1)))</em>a+1)-1.<br>
This should be trivial by binary analysis - how to use that and mix with<br>
other parts?</p>
<p>I want to show that because of this even-odd differentiation, 3n+1 series is<br>
never called more than twice in a row. This follows from upper.</p>
<p>I want to show that for any even number, all following even numbers will<br>
have p(n) &gt;= a(n) and that when looked from the position of n/2, that will<br>
come back to even if n/2 it started with was odd and vice versa, because<br>
div2 can't possibly change oddity of any upper level.</p>
<p>Thus, starting from even it leads to odd (next number) and starting from odd<br>
it leads to even (smaller number). Modulus is built in such way that p(n)<br>
for each even number is p(n)+1 related to it's division by two and this p(n)<br>
is how many times it will be divided by two, thus p(n) for any following<br>
even is big enough to lead to smaller number (n/2+1 for next one, as numbers<br>
grow, also this p(n) grows and thus, even leads to following(n)&lt;=n+1).</p>
<p>I want, thus, to show that the sequence always eventually leads to smaller<br>
number than it started from or 1.</p>
<p>Which classes and other stuff I should use for all that?</p>
<p>Tambet</p>
<p>Brute-force (python) check for those lemmas follows:</p>

I took a quick look at your problem and attach a small theory file, in which I define your collatzNext function and prove a trivial property of it. To undertake the project you describe, you just have to do one step at a time, and your first step should be to read the tutorial: <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle/doc/tutorial.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle/doc/tutorial.pdf</a></p>
<p>It will take a while before you can become proficient enough to do a challenging project.<br>

If you do not need negative numbers, I suggest to use nat instead of int.</p>
