<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hallo,</p>
<p>I am wondering about the following things w.r.t. Quickcheck:</p>
<p>– What is the real difference between exhaustive and full_exhaustive? <br>
There are a sentence or two on this in isar-ref about term <br>
reconstruction, but it's not quite clear to me what that actually means.</p>
<p>– Why does quickcheck not fall back to random testing when exhaustive <br>
testing is not available?</p>
<p>– Why is Quickcheck for multisets only set up for random and <br>
full_exhaustive, but not for exhaustive?</p>
<p>– Is there any reason not to simply replace the entire Quickcheck setup <br>
for multisets with "quickcheck_generator multiset construtors: mset"? (I <br>
have done that locally and it seems to work well)</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

Hi Manuel,</p>

<p>AFAIK exchaustive and full_exhaustive are two different compilation schemes, but I don't know<br>
the details. You can switch between the two schemes with the option quickcheck_full_support.<br>
Since this option is enabled by default, the exhaustive tester is essentially untested.<br>
Most types in the library do not have any setup for exhaustive any more (in particular all <br>
the datatypes, it seems).</p>

AFAICS, you get essentially the same testers.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br>

<p>From: Lukas Bulwahn &lt;<a href="mailto:lukas.bulwahn@gmail.com">lukas.bulwahn@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Manuel,</p>
<p>since I am subscribed the isabelle users' mailing list for a couple of<br>
days now, I can tell you some of the rationales for the design<br>
decisions in quickcheck.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I did some profiling of quickcheck's execution and<br>
observed that much time was actually spent constructing and<br>
deconstructing the term representations for printing no matter if<br>
counterexamples were found or not. For fair comparison between<br>
different testing approaches that all are based on the same code<br>
generation setup and are quasi-complete, in the sense, if there is a<br>
counterexample, it will eventually be found (assuming the<br>
counterexample can be represented as ground term with the given code<br>
generation setup), the testing performance is essential. The overall<br>
testing performance would render one approach superior or inferior to<br>
another one.</p>
<p>Exhaustive generators are more performant than full-exhaustive, but do<br>
not allow to print terms when functions are involved.<br>
Full_exhaustive generator are less performant but can always print the<br>
terms, and hence, are generally more useful.</p>
<p>I was always hoping that a lifting and transfer mechanism would allow<br>
to transfer the function space of whole theory developments into the<br>
Andreas' FinFuns function space and make this automatic transferred<br>
code setup usable for quickcheck. This would make the fast exhaustive<br>
generators as powerful as the full_exhaustive ones, but (I believe)<br>
this development has not happened yet.</p>
<p>In practice (thanks to much work on the IDE, non-blocking interaction<br>
and use of multiple cores), quickcheck is powerful and useful even if<br>
it is not the slightly optimized version yet.</p>
<p>Commonly, the manual and automatic setup for random and exhaustive<br>
testing is done in one go. So both strategies would usually work and<br>
start searching for counterexamples or both would fail, as they rely<br>
on the same code generation setup. So then to find counterexamples<br>
quickly, applying one strategy after the other seems awkward, and I<br>
preferred to implement that multiple strategies can be applied in<br>
parallel. As back in 2012, we still had a blocking IDE in wider use,<br>
the blocking auto-quickcheck was limited to only one strategy; I<br>
decided for exhaustive testing.</p>
<p>Without further investigation of the past, I cannot tell you the<br>
reason for the definition of the current Multiset quickcheck setup.<br>
Possibly, during some work on the new datatype package or on code<br>
generation of multisets, some one touched the quickcheck setup, but<br>
was not aware of the quickcheck_generator command---but that's just a<br>
wild guess from my side; one would really need to look at the relevant<br>
changesets and their context. The multiset theory has quite some<br>
evolution since I looked deeply into that file.</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Lukas</p>
