<p>From: Yevgeniy Makarov &lt;<a href="mailto:emakarov@gmail.com">emakarov@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>I am wondering how easy it is to change the representation of numbers<br>
in Isabelle. If I understand correctly, currently natural numbers are<br>
represented as a datatype that has zero and successor, integers are<br>
represented as equivalence classes of pairs of natural numbers, and<br>
rationals are equivalence classes of fractions. Moreover, when<br>
Isabelle specifications are translated into ML, natural numbers are<br>
again represented as a datatype, and integers are converted into the<br>
type int of ML. As was pointed out in couple of days ago in this list,<br>
rational numbers in the development snapshot may be represented as<br>
triples (sign, enumerator, denominator). There is also a module that<br>
maps natural numbers to ML's int. Of course, providing ML types as<br>
counterparts for Isabelle ones raises efficiency and clarity of<br>
programs; however, one has to trust that facts about types proved in<br>
Isabelle hold for the implementation.</p>
<p>Changing number representation is important for code generation. For<br>
example, one may want to produce a program that works with natural<br>
numbers in binary representation or a representation based on an array<br>
of digits instead of a datatype.  Of course, it is desirable that the<br>
number of properties proved manually for the new representation is<br>
minimal.</p>
<p>Isabelle library contains definitions and properties for semirings,<br>
rings, and fields, and many lemmas are proved for those abstract<br>
structures. However, there are dozens of statements proved<br>
specifically for natural numbers as a datatype, such as statements<br>
about the successor, order, and truncated subtraction. Some lemmas are<br>
also proved specifically for integers, e.g., facts that the order on<br>
int is not dense and properties of absolute value.</p>
<p>Isabelle also has internal binary representation of integers given by<br>
numerals as well as simplification rules for operations on such<br>
integers, but this seems unrelated to number representation in<br>
Isabelle and extracted programs.</p>
<p>I'd like to ask the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Was there any attempt to characterize different classes of numbers<br>
(naturals, integers, rationals) purely axiomatically in order to<br>
minimize the number of facts one has to prove for a new<br>
representation?</p>
<p>(2) What is the best way in Isabelle to change the representation of<br>
naturals or integers? I am not just talking about types_code<br>
directive, which maps an Isabelle type into an unrelated ML type, but<br>
a representation whose properties (like commutativity of addition) can<br>
be proved in Isabelle.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>
Yevgeniy</p>

If you want to use a different representation in the logic but retain <br>
all the theorems that you have for the old representation, you <br>
essentially have to reprove them. The only way to automate this to a <br>
large degree is by factoring out a common axiomatic basis. Then you can <br>
use Isabelle's proof terms to reply the old proof but plugging in the <br>
new basis. The AWE project may provide the necessary automation: <br>

<p>If you are "only" interested in code generation, you could use <br>
types_code in a disciplined manner: if you want to implement t by t', <br>
you describe t' and its operations in HOL and show (roughly speaking) <br>
that there is a homomorphism from t' to t. This is not completely <br>
foundational because you could make a mistake when writing down the <br>
necessary homomorphism conditions.</p>

<p>Can't you just prove that the old and new representations are  <br>
isomorphic? Properties should then be easy to transfer from the old  <br>
representation to the new one.</p>

<p>Indeed, HOL contains a rich theory of abstract algebra: see theories<br>
Orderings.thy, Lattices.thy, OrderedGroup.thy and Ring_and_Field.thy.<br>
However, internal representation of numerals is implemented completely<br>
independent from that.</p>

<p>Concerning code generation, the default HOL setup for code generator<br>
framework leaves nats as datatypes and maps ints to machine ints.<br>
Technically, it is hard to change without patching the HOL/Main theories<br>
themselves.  In any case, you will have to reprove theorems on<br>
fundamental operations in order to get it really working.  Though this<br>
demands some effort, there are no fundamental issues to prevent somebody<br>
from doing this.  Can you provide me with a little more context, i.e.<br>
which particular representation you want to use for with numeric<br>
datatype for what particular reason etc.?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
