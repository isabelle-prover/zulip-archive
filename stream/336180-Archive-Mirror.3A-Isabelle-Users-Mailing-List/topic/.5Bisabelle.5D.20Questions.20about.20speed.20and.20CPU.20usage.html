<p>From: Tambet &lt;<a href="mailto:qtvali@gmail.com">qtvali@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
First thing is that on my computer, when Isabelle loads and processes<br>
theories from lib, it almost hangs. It would be nice if my only goal was to<br>
load those theories, but I would also like to read documentation meanwhile<br>
and do notes. Is this possible to give it some numbers about how much it's<br>
allowed to use memory, CPU and utilize hard drive speed at any given time?<br>
It would be much better if moving mouse and opening PDF document was always<br>
possible. It's not enough to change priority of emacs, because I would like<br>
emacs to run full-speed meanwhile. Is there some option to make specific<br>
processes lower-priority as much as needed so that computer works fast and<br>
those processes use 100% of idle time, but max 50% of time I am using other<br>
applications?</p>
<p>Also, can I precompile those libraries or cache that data, which is<br>
generated and reusable? As much as I can understand it just goes through the<br>
proving process and does something, what has zero-dependancy of the file I'm<br>
editing; those libs also won't change often (and probably if they did, the<br>
proofs of other files would still mostly hold). Does this feature exist?</p>
<p>One more speed-related question: usually the button to stop the current<br>
activity does not work (if I run something, what takes very long, I just<br>
have to kill emacs, which is not the best way to use a program and also<br>
wastes a lot of time). Is there some way to easily stop things, which do not<br>
work or were erroneously triggered?</p>
<p>Btw. I like the Structured Isar Proofs much more than that other one with<br>
"apply" etc., because that actually allows me to consciously prove (at least<br>
very simple) things whereas that other looks like randomly trying different<br>
buttons in hope that they eventually do something [this was actually why I<br>
switched to Isabelle after playing with Coq a few days that I saw that<br>
manual and it's just nice]. Structured proofs is clearly at least a good<br>
starting point, but this goal-based way is nice in many ways (I wish that<br>
most library proofs were built in that way).</p>

Hi all.</p>
<p>I have a related Problem with the new 2009-2 release.<br>
While 1GiB of RAM have always been enough for the 2009-1 release,<br>
the new version very quickly allocates more than 1GiB, and starts thrashing.<br>
Switching of "parallel proofs" makes things a bit better, but still my<br>
computer is nearly unusable<br>
during running larger proofs.</p>
<p>Have you changed any memory-related configurations in the new release, and<br>
is it possible to set them back again?</p>
<p>Best Peter</p>

Initial heap size of Poly/ML is configured by ML_OPTIONS="-H 200", which <br>
is the same default as for Isabelle2009-2.  The options for parallel <br>
checking are also the same.</p>
<p>What did change in Isabelle2009-2 is the overall bloat factor of main <br>
Isabelle/HOL.  With as little as 1 GB it is unlikely that you will be able <br>
to process big sessions.</p>

<p>This indicates a low memory situation, i.e. the OS is swapping most of the <br>

anyway?</p>

<p>When running Isabelle via Proof General / Emacs, the actual Isabelle <br>
process is already running at a low priority ("nice" level &gt; 0).  This <br>
does not help though, if you run out of physical memory (see above) or <br>
Emacs is too busy processing prover output (e.g. traces of some automated <br>
proof tools like "simp" or "auto").</p>

<p>You can work with persistent sessions, see section 1.2 in the Isabelle <br>
System manual for some basic examples.  Having created such a writable <br>
logic image, you can tell Proof General to make use of it.</p>
<p>This is useful for really big development, but your applications are <br>
probably much smaller at the moment.  Which library theories did you try <br>
to load anyway?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This indicates that Emacs is busy.  The Unix "top" utility will tell you. <br>
In some denial-of-service situations on Emacs you can also send kill -INT <br>
to the poly process.</p>
<p>Nothing like this should happen in small experiments with Isabelle, <br>
though.  Again it might be just a corollary of general memory shortage.</p>

<p>Structured proofs also scale up to larger proofs, and are more efficiently <br>
checked than old-style proof scripts.  The reason why you don't see Isar <br>
proofs everywhere is that it is usually harder to produce such nice <br>
proofs.</p>

<p>I am happy to report that after installing XFCE and logging in, it became<br>
extremely fast - things I used to wait 1-20 minutes for happened in moments<br>
or a few seconds. I can now even <em>scroll</em> PDF manuals when Emacs Proof<br>
General is running, which completely changes the whole experience ;)</p>
<p>As KDE normal install (with no programs working) takes 530MB of memory, but<br>
XFCE takes 370 - based on<br>
<a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux_desktop_vitals&amp;num=1-">http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux_desktop_vitals&amp;num=1-</a>,<br>
they might have such properties:</p>
<p>- Say that you use 200MB of memory for normal background processes -<br>
   Firefox and PDF reader.</p>
<p>- Say that Proof General takes some 200MB (I measured that it reaches<br>
   that point very fast).</p>
<p>- Then, XFCE takes 370, which means 770 in total.<br>
   - KDE takes 530, which makes 930 in total.<br>
   - <a href="http://manual.sidux.com/en/cd-content-en.htm">http://manual.sidux.com/en/cd-content-en.htm</a> shows that this memory<br>
   requirement of KDE can get even worse - looking recommended numbers the<br>
   difference could be as much as four times in worse case.</p>
<p>For me, the difference was fatal - when nothing did response before (I was<br>
making coffee when waiting switch from Firefox window to Emacs window or<br>
vice versa after I had ran anything proof-related for once - and this<br>
speeddown was somewhat in effect until reboot), in XFCE it's just working.<br>
It might also be that XFCE is better at memory management of critical things</p>
<ul>
<li>because KDE obviously lets even things needed to move mouse cursor be<br>
written to swap (maybe to have those fancy jumping full-colored cursors).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, maybe it works for you, too :)</p>
<p>[I wouldn't actually believe that the difference is so big, it was just a<br>
last resort after replacing several other programs with more lightweight<br>
versions and turning some less-needed functionality off]</p>
