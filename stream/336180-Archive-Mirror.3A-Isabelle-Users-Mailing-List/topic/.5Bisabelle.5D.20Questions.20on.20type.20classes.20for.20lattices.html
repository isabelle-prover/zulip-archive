Hello,</p>
<p>Since a (non-empty) finite lattice is also complete, I would like to define</p>
<p>class finite_lattice = finite + lattice</p>
<p>and then prove</p>
<p>instance finite_lattice &lt; complete_lattice</p>
<p>after giving suitable definitions for Inf/Sup/bot/top.</p>
<p>But apparently</p>
<p>instance A &lt; B</p>
<p>requires A to have (at definition time) all the operators of B. Are <br>
there "deep" reasons for this requirement, or could it be relaxed with <br>
relative ease to allow the extra operators to be defined after A has <br>
been defined and then used to show that A is a subclass of B?</p>
<p>Anyhow, given the current situation, one approach is to define <br>
finite_lattice as above, define Inf/Sup/bot/top on finite_lattice, and <br>
prove that finite_lattice is a sublocale of complete_lattice. In this <br>
way, after proving that a type L has class finite_lattice, all the <br>
operators and theorems of complete_lattice should be available for L. <br>
The drawback of this approach is that L will not have class <br>
complete_lattice, and so, for example, existing operations that take <br>
complete_lattice arguments cannot be used on L.</p>
<p>Another approach is to define class finite_lattice to include <br>
Inf/Sup/bot/top, along with assumptions that define these four operators <br>
in terms of the existing operators of finite_lattice. In this way, <br>
finite_lattice can be a subclass of complete_lattice. The drawback is <br>
that proving that a type L has class finite_lattice will require more <br>
work because of the extra operators and assumptions that must be <br>
satisfied (but perhaps this work can be eased by proving and using <br>
general lemmas that relate Inf/Sup/bot/top to inf and sup). Furthermore, <br>
the approach seems (to me) methodologically less clean than the previous <br>
one.</p>
<p>A third approach is to define</p>
<p>class finite_lattice = finite + complete_lattice</p>
<p>and avoid proving subclass relations altogether. The drawback is that <br>
proving that a type L has class finite_lattice is even more work (but <br>
again perhaps this work can be eased by suitable general lemmas). This <br>
seems to be the approach taken in the library definition of class <br>
complete_lattice, which includes bounded_lattice explicitly, even though <br>
Inf and Sup suffice. Also, this approach seems (to me) methodologically <br>
less clean than the previous two.</p>
<p>Does anybody have comments on the three approaches sketched above? <br>
Relative pros and cons? Other approaches?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!<br>

Hi Alessandro,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>this is a well-known restriction of type classes.  The short answer is,<br>
no, this restriction cannot be lifted.  This is the price you have to<br>
pay to have operations <em>and</em> assumptions about them: in order for a<br>
structure to be a complete lattice, it is not necessary that there exist<br>
operations which satisfy its properties, but these operations must be<br>
explicitly defined for that particular type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyhow, given the current situation, one approach is to define<br>
finite_lattice as above, define Inf/Sup/bot/top on finite_lattice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such definitions would be rejected, since they violate the rules for<br>
overloading: Inf/Sup/bot/top can only be instantiated on particular type<br>
constructors, not (sort-constrained) type variables.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another approach is to define class finite_lattice to include<br>
Inf/Sup/bot/top, along with assumptions that define these four operators<br>

<p>IMHO it is the cleanest one you can achieve inside the current<br>
infrastructure.  E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma finite_complete_lattice:<br>
  assumes Inf: "\&lt;And&gt;A. (Inf :: ('a::{Inf, Sup, bounded_lattice, finite}) set ⇒ 'a) A =<br>
    (if A = {} then top else Inf_fin A)"<br>
  assumes Sup: "\&lt;And&gt;A. (Sup :: ('a::{Inf, Sup, bounded_lattice, finite}) set ⇒ 'a) A =<br>
    (if A = {} then top else Sup_fin A)"<br>
  shows "OFCLASS('a::{Inf, Sup, bounded_lattice, finite}, complete_lattice_class)"<br>
proof</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A third approach is to define</p>
<p>class finite_lattice = finite + complete_lattice</p>
<p>and avoid proving subclass relations altogether. The drawback is that<br>
proving that a type L has class finite_lattice is even more work (but<br>
again perhaps this work can be eased by suitable general lemmas).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This does indeed save you nothing on instance proofs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This<br>

complete_lattice, which includes bounded_lattice explicitly, even though<br>
Inf and Sup suffice. Also, this approach seems (to me) methodologically<br>

</blockquote>
<p>The issue is that class bot already demands assumptions on bot and thus<br>
you cannot instantiate bot without actually proving these.</p>
<p>There have been two ideas around to lift this somehow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide purely syntactic classes for operations without further<br>
assumptions; this has a long tradition in isabelle (cf. plus, times,<br>
zero etc.), but has the disadvantage that you can write down things<br>
syntactically which do not obey properties you would expect naively<br>
(i.e. "a + 0 = a" does not hold in general).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a fancy wrapper around instantiation in the spirit of Haskell<br>
default class method definitions.  Since this must also cover proofs, it<br>
would be a tedious affair and maybe not worth doing it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers,<br>
