Dear list,</p>
<p>is there any reason why there's no Quickcheck setup for finite sets? I<br>
couldn't find any, so I tried setting it up (see attached theory). I'm<br>
hardly a Quickcheck expert, so I have no idea whether it makes sense –<br>
at least it works for some cases I tried.</p>
<p>Slightly related question: How does the interaction between the datatype<br>
package and Quickcheck work? It appears that it produces instances of<br>
full_exhaustive in certain cases and not in others, but I'm not quite<br>
sure in which cases. (Current working hypothesis: It doesn't when nested<br>
recursion is involved.) Is there any other way to conveniently obtain<br>
full_exhaustive instances?</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars<br>

Hi Lars,</p>
<p>quickcheck in its current form was mainly developed by Lukas Bulwahn, who left academia <br>
before fset became usable. So far, nobody cared to add the quickcheck setup. From my <br>
experience with quickcheck, your setup is fine. However, you could also just have used the <br>
command</p>
<p>quickcheck_generator fset constructors: "{||}", finsert</p>
<p>which generates almost the same instances as you did manually. The difference is that the <br>
your instances check whether an new element is already present in the set and if so, they <br>
skip the execution assuming that it has been tested before. This is just an optimisation <br>
which avoids to run the code on equivalent test case several times, but I doubt that this <br>
redundancy causes any problems in practice.</p>
<p>According to the documentation in isar-ref, quickcheck installs random and exhaustive <br>
generators for first-order datatypes. I do not know whether the documentation has been <br>
kept up to date during the transition to the BNF package, but it looks as if it is still <br>
correct. So no nested recursion.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

<p>first of all, I didn't know about that command :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, the way I implemented the generator for 'fset's was to copy the<br>
generator for 'set's and changed the constants (e.g. 'insert' → 'finsert').</p>
<p>If nobody objects, I would add these instances to the 'FSet' theory in<br>
HOL-Library.</p>

<p>Maybe this is a candidate for consolidation with the 'Derive' AFP entry.<br>
(On the other hand, as far as I know, that one doesn't support nested<br>
recursion through non-datatypes.)</p>
<p>Because you mentioned it in your mail, I also tried<br>
'quickcheck_generator' on my datatype, but it (silently!) fails to<br>
produce instances.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
