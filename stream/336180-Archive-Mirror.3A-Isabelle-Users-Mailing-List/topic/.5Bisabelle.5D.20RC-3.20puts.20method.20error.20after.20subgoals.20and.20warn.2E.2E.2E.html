<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:lammich@in.tum.de">lammich@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
In RC-3, I discovered the undesirable behaviour that errors are put<br>
after the goal state in the output window. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>lemma "g1" "g2" "g3"<br>
proof -<br>
  have "False" by (simp add: list.simps)</p>
<p>--&gt; The error output appears after a list of the goals "g1" "g2" and<br>
"g3" and after a long list of simplifier warnings.  </p>
<p>Thus, you have to scroll down to see the error output --- every time you<br>
move the cursor in the main window from a different line to the<br>
erroneous line. This is tedious when developing a proof, as you will go<br>
up, change something, and then come back to the failing command multiple<br>
times.</p>
<p>Moreover, the error is not visible as prominently as it used to be: </p>
<p>When writing "have foo by method", expecting that it works, you look at<br>
the output window ... and it looks the same, whether your method worked<br>
or not. Formerly, you used to see a fat red error message there, right<br>
at the top of the output window, which is now hidden.</p>
<p>If using separate outputs for error, warning, tracing, and goal is not<br>
possible, and one must have a fixed order, I would vote for the<br>
following order:<br>
  Errors first, then the goal, then warnings, then tracing.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be even better to make the message types and the<br>
order in which they appear in the output configurable!</p>

<p>You don't have to scroll around, but can look directly in the main source <br>
window -- either at the colors or the popups produced by hovering.</p>
<p>In PIDE the annotated source is the primary means of exposing prover <br>
information.  In the above example it works particularly well, because the <br>
failure of the proof method invocation gets a precise error position for <br>
the method text, not just the main command keyword as a fall-back.</p>
<p>If you have problems to distinguish the color overlays, you can choose <br>
different colors in the Rendering section of Isabelle/jEdit plugin <br>
options.  Note that there is also an alpha channel for transparency.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Output dockable is not really part of the PIDE concepts. <br>
It is still around as a fall-back to display proof states, and anything <br>
else concatenated in some canonical order given implicitly by the prover. <br>
Thus Output is merely an intermediate approximation of the real thing, <br>
which would probably be the speculative "Preview" panel to show the <br>
document sources with intermediate proof states, according to what is <br>
presently relevant in the structured proof editing.</p>
<p>I am using myself Output relatively rarely.  In the Isabelle tutorial this <br>
Spring there was a funny incident: after approx. 2h explaining Isabelle <br>
proof document editing, with various examples of definitions and proofs, <br>
Timothy Bourke pointed out that I should also show the Output panel for <br>
message display.  I had just forgotten that, because it was not necessary <br>
up to that point. But he was right that beginners often manage more <br>
quickly to operate the Output panel than the delicate choreography with <br>
the mouse that is required for hovering.  The latter is more flexible <br>
after some practice, though.</p>

<p>That reminds me a bit of old mistakes from Proof General, with certain <br>
policies imposed by the front-end and corresponding workarounds on the <br>
back-end.  That is not fully overcome yet.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Telling so many anecdotes, I have forgotten to point out an important <br>
aspect in this example: the 'by' proof is forked by default, so the proof <br>
state you see after it is the correct one after it, while the warnings / <br>
errors belong to the independent sub-proof.  The printed order is correct <br>
according to the structure of the proof, independently of accidental <br>
operational details in the prover.</p>
<p>Replacing 'by' by 'apply' or setting the option parallel_proofs to 0 does <br>
not show a new proof state, only the cumulative messages.  The verbosity <br>
of simp-add warnings remains, but is another problem. In Isabelle2014-RC3 <br>
warnings are generally more to the point, but not yet this case.</p>

<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:lammich@in.tum.de">lammich@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
In think it is personal preference of how much you want to use the<br>
mouse, and no IDE should enforce too much mouse usage.</p>
<p>For example, when I develop a proof, I often start throwing "apply"s at<br>
the goal, and then want to immediately see the new subgoals, definitely<br>
without removing my hand from the keyboard to grab the mouse. </p>
<p>In many cases, this "experimenting phase" leads to proving the goal, and<br>
I then try to clean up my apply-script: Ideally, it becomes a single<br>
"by ...".</p>
<p>Otherwise, I get stuck at some subgoals. Then I invoke sledgehammer<br>
and/or try to identify auxiliary lemmas, that I then state and prove<br>
separately using Isar.</p>
<p>For this mode of proof development, which is definitely not the only way<br>
to develop a proof, but for my type of developments a very effective<br>
one, it is essential to always see the current subgoals, also while<br>
typing the next apply-command, without having to do some mousing or<br>
other interaction. As there is no dedicated subgoals-panel in PIDE (as<br>
there was in PG), I have to resort to the output panel.</p>
<p>As pointed out in previous mails, this is not an ideal replacement for a<br>
subgoals-panel, but I currently try to live with its features:<br>
Currently, the most annoying one is that the current subgoal vanishes in<br>
favour of a "syntax error"-message while you are typing the next<br>
apply-command.</p>

<p>From: bnord &lt;<a href="mailto:bnord01@gmail.com">bnord01@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Here's some experience from a course we gave last year:</p>
<p>We had some students that were output panel agnostic. They developed no <br>
understanding at all about the proof state and why things didn't work as <br>
expected. E.g. you can't simply assume ~A and show False. They had <br>
problems with including assumptions in inductions, as for them they were <br>
obviously part of the proof as the document explicitly stated them. The <br>
difference in this apparent redundancy is hard to grasp from the <br>
document without consulting the output. Also the ability to just <br>
continue editing and getting things evaluated after many errors together <br>
with the agnostic for the proof state lead to "nearly done proofs" that <br>
were merely accumulations of loosely connected statements.</p>
<p>I don't know if these problems were always there and students ignored <br>
the output in PG as well but I think the PIDE fosters this behaviour.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
When writing Isar proofs, there is indeed a mismatch of the proof state <br>
vs. the proof text, stemming from the step-by-step interpretation of the <br>
language.  People who have never been instructed by one of the initial <br>
pioneers of Isar in Munich 1998-2000 have explained to me accurately that <br>
confusion, e.g. someone at VSL 2014 in July.  This is a weakness of Isar <br>
implemented with the side-conditions of TTY interaction -- I was aware of <br>
that situation already 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Over the years I have tried to improve this bit by bit.  E.g. the 'by' <br>
command now produces proper error output on its own.  The funny effect was <br>
that long-term users who have been instructed in the workarounds from <br>
1999-2000 don't want to change at all.</p>
<p>I have mentioned a speculative "Preview" panel before on this thread.  If <br>
it ever arrives, it will be just an adequate dynamic view on the emerging <br>
proof document, based on the original source text with just the right <br>
"state" information that is required to continue, following the structure <br>
of the proof and its naturally unfinished state.</p>
