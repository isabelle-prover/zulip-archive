<p>SLEDGEHAMMER PANEL</p>

the panel doesn't use them.</p>

<p>The panel picks up global defaults from the prover session, in particular <br>
on startup.</p>
<p>There are several sources of defaults that might get in conflict, but the <br>
text field has a persistent history (like the one for regular "find" in <br>
jEdit), so you can easily switch back to other items that were used <br>
before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The panel doesn't give any feedback other than finding a proof, and the <br>
rotating icon, so I'll probably continue to insert a sledgehammer command and <br>
look at the results in the output panel. If no results are coming back, and <br>
the icon is moving, I'm inclined to think it's hung up in a bad way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't understand this part.  Do you want to see the command status color <br>
(dark violet) or is there some output of the command that the panel does <br>
not show?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SLUGGISH BEHAVIOUR AND BEING UNRESPONSIVE</p>
<p>I think this was mainly because of the Sledgehammer panel running <br>
Sledgehammer when I didn't know it was running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How many cores do you have?</p>
<p>There can be many things running, either explicitly via panels or <br>
implicitly via automatically tried tools.  Sometimes it is difficult to <br>
keep an overview: there could be a central "task manager", but I did not <br>
get that far for this release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once I click the Sledgehammer apply button, it will start running again <br>
even after I've hit cancel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Isabelle2013-1-RC2 this should work precisely: Apply always makes a <br>
fresh start, Cancel cancels the current sledgehammering, Apply makes again <br>
a fresh start etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it will start running on its own if I save the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one sounds odd.  Did you have it running already?  Maybe in a state <br>
where it actually waits for evaluation of the context?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I hit F11 to maximize the screen, the circular icon will start moving <br>
slowly, but there aren't any ATPs running, so I click "Apply", and then <br>
the circular icon starts moving faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have seen that myself in Isabelle2013-1-RC2, and will investigate it <br>
further.</p>
<p>The current success rate for full-screen mode is a bit more than 50%.  On <br>
some platforms it does not work at all, and when it works it can cause <br>
some surprises (like windows that are unreachable somewhere behind the <br>
main window).</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
I now understand better what F11 (toggle full-screen mode) does here.</p>
<p>The deeper problem is that the state of the Sledgehammer panel is managed <br>
in accordance to its GUI representation, but that is reset a bit more <br>
often than anticipated.  When you toggle full-screen mode, the panel is <br>
removed and added again, so the Sledgehammer run is reset. In <br>
Isabelle2013-1-RC2 the GUI display is a bit crude and merely changes into <br>
the state "Waiting for evaluation of context ...".  In the coming RC3 this <br>
week it will be more clear that the state is reset.</p>
<p>These slight inconveniences of dockable window state are due to certain <br>
features of Java/Swing and jEdit Dockable Window Management. For Output <br>
and Info, I had already made some workarounds a few years ago, to pretend <br>
more persistence than is there in reality. Instead of adding more <br>
workarounds it would be better to brush up the Dockable Window Manager at <br>
some point, but it requires some enthisiastic and competent people helping <br>
out at the jEdit project on Sourceforge.</p>
<p>Another known problem of dockable windows (especially in full-screen mode) <br>
is that windows often get lost behind the main window.  The precise <br>
behaviour is platform dependent.</p>

The old Toplevel.timing produced a plain-text message that was printed for <br>
the corresponding command.  You can get similar output as tooltip now.</p>
<p>Here is a clarified NEWS entry for the release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dockable window "Timing" provides an overview of relevant command<br>
timing information, depending on option jedit_timing_threshold.  The<br>
same timing information is shown in the extended tooltip of the<br>
command keyword, when hovering the mouse over it while the CONTROL or<br>
COMMAND modifier is pressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does that address all problems and confusions?</p>

"RC" means "release candidate", not "release".  We are presently at <br>
release candidate #2, working towards just one final release called <br>
"Isabelle2013-1" (according to the canonical Isabelle release naming <br>
scheme).</p>
<p>And yes, the NEWS item refers to what you see in Isabelle2013-1-RC2 <br>
already.  I merely updated the NEWS to make more clear how it works.</p>
<p>I've also tried once again on Windows that timing of some 'apply' command <br>
also works.  Of course, you need to set the timing threshold to something <br>
that is sufficiently small (even 0.0).</p>

<p>That was just an accident.  You found some funny flag and used it for some <br>
odd purpose, without any general principle behind it.  For every Isabelle <br>

<p>The following user-space attribute definition defines something that is<br>
close to the discontinued blast_trace declaration:</p>
<p>attribute_setup blast_trace = {*<br>
   Scan.succeed (Thm.declaration_attribute (K (Config.put_generic Blast.trace true)))<br>

<p>lemma "A ⟶ A" using [[blast_trace]] by blast</p>
<p>Here is also a slightly more elaborate version with argument parser:</p>
<p>attribute_setup blast_trace = {*<br>
   Scan.lift<br>
    (Parse.$$$ "=" -- Args.$$$ "true" &gt;&gt; K true ||<br>
     Parse.$$$ "=" -- Args.$$$ "false" &gt;&gt; K false ||<br>
     Scan.succeed true) &gt;&gt;<br>
   (fn b =&gt; Thm.declaration_attribute (K (Config.put_generic Blast.trace b)))<br>

<p>These Isabelle/ML operations are much less arcane than the use of <br>
blast_trace in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's also not about proving the theorem. It's about learning something <br>
from the blast method. I allocate a few minutes to look at the HOL.impCE <br>
that it lists in the details.</p>

<p>Blast is a slightly more sophisticated version from the basic Classical <br>
Reasoner.  The latter is definitely worth learning, using its fine <br>
documentation in the isar-ref manual and its ML sources.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
There is a more serious socket problem behind this, see also <br>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/issue/19/unreliable-socket-communication-leads-to">https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/issue/19/unreliable-socket-communication-leads-to</a></p>
<p>I've spend 1-2 days looking through the socket implementation of Poly/ML <br>
and Java/Scala and TCP/IP manual pages.  It is still unclear what can be <br>
done. The problem only manifests itself in relatively rare situations, <br>
i.e. an empty edit following the options change, which explains why it was <br>
not noticed before.</p>
<p>Another reason why it was overlooked is that people on isabelle-dev rarely <br>
use Windows.  But Linux and Mac OS X also have their own problems in <br>
different departments.  I reckon that the amount of issues and annoyances <br>
is approximately equal on all 3 platforms now.</p>
<p>I hope to make Isabelle2013-1-RC3 tomorrow, probably without any change in <br>
that corner.  Then I am on vacation from 17-Oct..04-Nov.  Afterwards comes <br>
the final round for final lift-off of the Isabelle2013-1 release.</p>

How about changing the Threshold for timing display?  It is 0.1 seconds by <br>
default, so most commands won't show up, since they are much faster.</p>

That low-level approach to inspect document markup is obsolete, as far as <br>
timing is concerning.</p>
<p>Slowness or unresponsiveness here might mean you just have a very big text <br>
with lots of markup.  If there are other reasons for that, there might be <br>
a genuine problem, but from the description so far there is no indication.</p>
