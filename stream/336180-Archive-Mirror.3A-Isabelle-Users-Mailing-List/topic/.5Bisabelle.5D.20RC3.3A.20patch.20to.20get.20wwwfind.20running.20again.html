<p>From: Rafal Kolanski &lt;<a href="mailto:xs@xaph.net">xs@xaph.net</a>&gt;<br>
So, here is a minimal patch to get the wwwfind tool working again. It<br>
helps that there was nothing wrong with the code itself, only the way it<br>
was being invoked.</p>
<p>For those who care: when working with isabelle-process directly, the<br>
following scenario breaks:<br>
 use_thy "MyTheory"; MyStructure.blah ();<br>
i.e.</p>
<ol>
<li>passing use_thy "MyTheory" to isabelle-process</li>
<li>MyTheory uses ML_file "blah.ML" to define ML structures</li>
<li>trying to refer to structures from (2) after the use_thy from (1)</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know why exactly this is (due to contexts and thread safety?),<br>
but I don't object to it. Just makes it hard to pass parameters in.</p>
<p>I would be interested in the current canonical way to write isabelle<br>
tools which take some parameters, pass them to ML code to do stuff, then<br>
at some future point exit. The old route of<br>
isabelle-process -r -e "use_thy \"my_thy\"; Thing.do_stuff \"$PARAM\";"<br>
appears deprecated. This took me a while to grasp.</p>
<p>Keeping a back door to make this pattern possible will make it easier to<br>
keep the ML tools going which are unlikely to be rewritten in scala<br>
anytime soon.</p>
<p>Makarius:<br>
I don't know what your plan for the "ROOT" file in WWW_Find is. I have<br>
assumed that it is for testing purposes, so that "isabelle build" will<br>
run over the ML files and make sure they at least typecheck. Thus I have<br>
left it, and WWW_Find.thy unchanged, creating a "launcher" in<br>
Start_WWW_Find.thy.<br>
If my assumption is incorrect, you can delete ROOT and merge<br>
Start_WWW_Find.thy into WWW_Find.thy quite easily.<br>
Any other problems, let me know.</p>

<p>Yes, I know. I just assumed that "build" builds an image, got it wrong<br>
and apologised.</p>

<p>You have approx. 24h left.  I had reported its broken state almost 3<br>

I've looked only briefly, to understand what it does.  Should there be a <br>
static Start_WWW_Find.thy in the changeset?  It is missing.  (Or is it <br>
somehow dynamic?)</p>

It is just the normal context discipline of Isabelle: everything is stored <br>
as a value within the theory (or other context).  Until approx. 2008 ML <br>
values were not treated properly like that -- it was an old snag going <br>
back to pioneering days of Proof General, when one could not undo ML <br>
bindings.</p>
<p>For multithreaded Isabelle/ML (which became the default in Isabelle2008) <br>
there was indeed no more way to ignore this.  So David Matthews and myself <br>
spent some time to solve this problem once and for all: runtime invocation <br>
of the ML compiler (via 'ML' commands or 'ML_file' in Isabelle2013) <br>
happens within the theory context.</p>
<p>The reason why WWW_Find broken down after such a long time is here:</p>

files:       lib/scripts/getsettings src/Tools/WWW_Find/ROOT <br>
src/Tools/WWW_Find/ROOT.ML src/Tools/WWW_Find/WWW_Find.thy<br>
description:<br>
more standard session setup for WWW_Find;</p>
<p>This discontinues the old ROOT.ML with its implicit global context -- <br>
there was no way around it in the new isabelle build system.</p>
<p>It thus indirectly broke WWW_Find, or rather exhibited the latent problem <br>
that has been there for a long time.  Or rather, it was probably not even <br>
a problem when WWW_Find was first implemented.  It is totally normal that <br>
side-conditions are gradually changing, and thus one improvement here and <br>
another improvement there, or lack of improvement, eventually cause a <br>
breakdown.  Then things need to be renovated.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
OK, it is now here <br>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/commits/d90218288d51">https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/commits/d90218288d51</a></p>
<p>I can confirm that it works on Linux (as specified).  Being curious about <br>
its exclusion of Mac OS X and Windows/Cygwin, I've tried the other <br>
platforms as well, and it did not work (also as specified).  The problems <br>
seem to be unportable netstat options (Mac OS X) and other unknown <br>
differences on Cygwin (although netstat and lighttpd are the same there as <br>
on Linux).</p>
<p>So we are back to the status-quo of WWW_Find for the Isabelle2013 release.</p>

<p>Deprecation probably goes back to 2007/2008, when "the_context" was the <br>
best-known Isabelle insider joke.  Whatever you do in Isabelle, it somehow <br>
works within the formal context, including ML.</p>
<p>There are various ways to ensure that some ML runs within an existing <br>
theory context.  The Start_WWW_Find.thy approach looks fine in this <br>
respect.</p>

<p>When WWW_Find was implemented first several years ago, I pointed already <br>
out that its technology was outdated.  You don't do a HTTP server in ML. <br>
The shell scripts around it only work on Linux.</p>
<p>The JVM platform is much better at such things, and TCP clients and <br>
servers usually work uniformly (in contrast to Swing GUI stuff).</p>
<p>Isabelle/Scala is not an exotic Isabelle add-on that will emerge <br>
eventually -- that was in 2008/2009.  It is here right now, as the <br>
standard Isabelle system programming interface.</p>

<p>The ROOT file is merely the result of porting the old ROOT.ML.  It has <br>
been there from the beginning of WWW_Find to have at least a static test <br>
of its code-base.</p>
<p>There was never a proper dynamic test of it.  3 months ago, I realized <br>
that it was broken, and was trying to find its maintainer.  Even now, I am <br>
unsure if it is actually maintained.</p>
