That is one of these hard crashes of the Poly/ML runtime system that <br>
become the more likely the more it approaches certain resource limits. <br>
In the screenshot the sledgehammer invocation has quite a lot of provers. <br>
What is your Multithreading.max_threads_value() in Isabelle/ML?<br>
The question is how many are actuallt run in parellel.</p>
<p>How big is the theory that you were working on?</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
The theory is not that big, about 1700 lines, which takes about 8 <br>
seconds to prove.</p>
<p>I was just starting with RC4, so I think threads was set by the default <br>
"0" in the options, which appears to give me 4 threads, since I have an <br>
older quad core.</p>
<p>I've been running with the thread options set to 4, and it has only <br>
crashed that one time, and I've now been running sledgehammer quite a <br>
bit over 6 hours or so.</p>
<p>For observational purposes, I have the "sledgehammer_params" set to use <br>
17 provers, and I also have those 17 in the "Provers" option for the <br>
Sledgehammer panel.</p>
<p>I list the 17 below and I've set threads=12 now, and, watching the <br>
number of processes, it appears willing to actually start the number of <br>
threads that max_threads_value() is set to.</p>
<p>For the first provers in the list, I interleave local provers with <br>
remote provers, with the best 3 locals at the beginning, z3, e, and <br>
spass, and I think it starts all the provers in the order listed. So, <br>
with threads=4, remote_spass_pirate wasn't returning with an error <br>
quickly, but with threads=12, it was failing after a few seconds, for a <br>
particular proof.</p>
<p>Provers:</p>
<p>z3 remote_vampire e remote_e_tofof spass remote_iprover remote_snark <br>
remote_e_sine remote_iprover_eq agsyhol remote_spass_pirate satallax <br>
remote_waldmeister_new leo2 remote_satallax remote_agsyhol remote_leo2</p>
<p>The short story is that RC0 and RC4 have failed in a way that Cygwin <br>
Isabelle hasn't failed before, so something has changed. RC4 has only <br>
failed once, so it could be a rare thing.</p>
<p>On the surface, Isabelle2014 doesn't seem to be a big change, though I <br>
suppose that's because I've already been exposed to it a while, such as <br>
to datatype_new.</p>
<p>There is one huge surface addition, and that's \&lt;open&gt; and \&lt;closed&gt;. <br>
Those are huge, because they're subtle and graphical, and they help to <br>
clearly delimit the beginning and end of text, better than {* and *}, <br>
though those have their use.</p>
<p>In watching Sledgehammer with "verbose=true", it also appears that <br>
machine learning is in the house. The prover "e" has become very <br>
competitive with remote_vampire.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

Finally another crash.</p>
<p>This is following a pattern. The crash doesn't happen until after I <br>
terminate the sledgehammer command, and then it's not immediate.</p>
<p>In this case, I haven't changed threads back to threads=4, it's still at <br>
12, with the 17 provers.</p>
<p>About 30 seconds after I terminated a sledgehammer command, I was <br>
staring at the screen thinking about what I wanted to do, and it <br>
terminated. The "Isabelle Syslog" message is below:</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This one is already quite well-known in internal circles.</p>
<p>It can happen when the Poly/ML runtime system and memory management is <br>
under high pressure -- we've increased that pressure on the application <br>
side significantly since the last release.  Trying to hunt it down and pin <br>
it up, I have found out that Windows has a much higher chance to expose <br>
that bad behaviour, presumably due to more narrow memory resources on <br>
Cygwin.  The situation might become better again, after switching to <br>
Cygwin x86_64, but I have not tried it yet.</p>
<p>Note that David Matthews did not manage to eradicate the source of the <br>
problem, because it never happened on any of his machines, and the people <br>
who have seen it elsewhere could not repeat it reliably.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Makarius,</p>
<p>I thought there was nothing more to say about it, and I didn't want to <br>
reply just to say, "Switching to Cygwin x86_64 sounds exciting, if it <br>
works". Now I have something to add.</p>
<p>"Auto Methods", mysteriously, could also be putting demands on the CPU <br>
when Sledgehammer is running.</p>
<p>I usually enable, all together, "Auto Methods", "Auto Nitpick", and <br>
"Auto Quickcheck" and forget about them.</p>
<p>Today, "Auto Methods" is acting as the only culprit for what I describe, <br>
because I've enabled them one at a time for the setup I describe below. <br>
"Auto Solve direct" seems to not be a problem, because I've left it <br>
enabled, and I don't use "Auto Sledgehammer".</p>
<p>I attach a screenshot to show what's above where I have the cursor, and <br>
what's below. It doesn't seem like any attempts should be made to prove <br>
or disprove anything, and it's not like I have this problem all the time.</p>
<p>My setup for the screenshot is that I started PIDE with those 3 auto <br>
options disabled. I then enabled them, with where the cursor is shown, <br>
(I then took the time to do them one at a time, with only "Auto Methods" <br>
causing this).</p>
<p>The CPU goes to about 50% as shown for all four cores, and then I have <br>
to terminate. Disabling the three options is not enough.</p>
<p>As a final note, in repeatedly starting up, enabling "Auto Methods", <br>
disabling, and then terminating PIDE, I had problems terminating, so I <br>
rebooted.</p>
<p>So, on a fresh boot, I started PIDE, saw the purple bar show proving <br>
until got to the cursor position I show in the screenshot, I enabled <br>
"Auto Methods", all 4 cores started working to about 50% if the CPU, I <br>
disabled "Auto Methods", and then I had to terminate.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB<br>

<p>This is what the Isabelle/jEdit manual says in Isabelle2014:</p>
<p>\item @{system_option_ref auto_methods} controls automatic use of a<br>
   combination of standard proof methods (@{method auto}, @{method<br>
   simp}, @{method blast}, etc.).  This corresponds to the Isar command<br>
   @{command_ref "try0"} \cite{isabelle-isar-ref}.</p>
<p>The tool is disabled by default, since unparameterized invocation of<br>
   standard proof methods often consumes substantial CPU resources<br>
   without leading to success.</p>
<p>There might be additional reasons for its CPU hunger.  If so, I can refine <br>
the text accordingly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Auto Solve direct" seems to not be a problem, because I've left it <br>

<p>More quotes from the manual:</p>
<p>\item @{system_option_ref auto_sledgehammer} controls a significantly<br>
   reduced version of @{command_ref sledgehammer}, which attempts to prove<br>
   a subgoal using external automatic provers. See also the<br>
   Sledgehammer manual \cite{isabelle-sledgehammer}.</p>
<p>This tool is disabled by default, due to the relatively heavy nature<br>
   of Sledgehammer.</p>
<p>\item @{system_option_ref auto_solve_direct} controls automatic use of<br>
   @{command_ref solve_direct}, which checks whether the current subgoals<br>
   can be solved directly by an existing theorem.  This also helps to<br>
   detect duplicate lemmas.</p>
<p>This tool is \emph{enabled} by default.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You can also experiment with the improved Monitor panel, to get some <br>
statistics of the running ML system from inside.</p>
