<p>From: "W. Douglas Maurer" &lt;<a href="mailto:maurer@gwu.edu">maurer@gwu.edu</a>&gt;<br>
In section 2.6 ("Raw proof blocks") of "A Tutorial Introduction to <br>
Structured Isar Proofs," there appears the following sentence at the <br>
top of page 13: "Note that the conclusion of a raw proof block is <br>
stated with 'have' rather than 'show' because it is not the <br>
conclusion of some pending goal but some independent claim." Yet in <br>
theory Fields, in the section (14.1) on division rings, there is a <br>
proof of the right-inverse-eq lemma that contains a raw proof block <br>
(at least I assume it is a raw proof block -- it is contained in <br>
curly brackets) that ends in 'show.' Is this just a bug, or is it a <br>
version of raw proof blocks that isn't described in the Tutorial <br>
Introduction?</p>

Whenever the meaningless word "bug" comes up, there is a high chance that <br>
it is a misunderstanding of the user.</p>
<p>A tutorial is not necessarily complete and exhaustive, in contrast to a <br>
reference manual.  Isabelle has lots of manuals with different approaches <br>
to explain things.  Ultimately the authoritative source for Isar is the <br>
isar-ref manual (and of course the implementation).  So if the system <br>
accepts some proof text, it is probably right.</p>
<p>According to the inner workings of Isar, it is of course possible to use <br>
raw proof blocks { } together with fix-assume-show of regular proof <br>
bodies.  It is not used very often, but it definitely has its uses.  It <br>
allows to manage local contexts with further depth, instead of the <br>
immediate default context of the original goal statement.</p>
<p>You can also use the block separator 'next' within { } even though some <br>
explanations sometimes tell a different story.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
It is a reference manual, which means you don't read it from start to end <br>
in one go, but look occasionally if there are relevant bits and pieces. <br>
Taking all that information together, some mental picture of what Isar <br>
actually is should emerge.  You should skim through the table of contents <br>
to get an idea of the different areas that are covered.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is about proofs.  Section 6.1 about proof structure.  Blocks are <br>
described in 6.1.2 --- some abstract text about that concept.  At least it <br>
says something about 'next' and also mentions 'show' in a way that <br>
indicates that it can be used here.</p>
<p>BTW, the current version of Isabelle is from August 2014 and the manual <br>
has the same date.  As a habit you should follow the normal Isabelle <br>
release cycle, unless there are special reasons to stick to an older <br>
version.</p>

<p>From: Lars Noschinski &lt;<a href="mailto:noschinl@in.tum.de">noschinl@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
The difference between show and have is that show uses the proven fact<br>
to discharge a pending proof obligation.</p>
<p>Now, when you open a raw proof block, you don't setup a proof obligation<br>
to be discharged in this block, so there is no need to use show there.<br>
Rather, the last fact mentioned in this block (whether this be by means<br>
of have or e.g. note) is exported, when you close the block.</p>
<p>However, even though you don't setup a proof obligation to be discharged<br>
in a raw proof block, you can still discharge all the pending proof<br>
obligations which were there before you open the proof block -- and for<br>
this you use show, as you would usually do.</p>
