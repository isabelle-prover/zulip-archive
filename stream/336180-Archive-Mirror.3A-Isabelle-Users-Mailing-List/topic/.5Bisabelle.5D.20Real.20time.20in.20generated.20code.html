<p>timeap/timeit are from Isabele/ML.</p>
<p><a href="http://Time.now">Time.now</a> is from Standard ML and it is OK to use in Isabelle/ML as well <br>

<p>Step 0 is to get the basic mental model about Isabelle right, including <br>
some elementary terminology.  Isabelle is a framework of many different <br>
languages: Isabelle/Pure, Isabelle/HOL, Isabelle/ML, Isabelle/Scala, ... <br>
Isabelle/XYZ according to your own imaginations if you like.</p>
<p>Some of these languages are intertwined, and embeded into each other in <br>
certain ways, but it does not make sense to speak of "layers" or to <br>
"descend" -- especially not for the special pair Isabelle/Isar versus <br>
Isabelle/ML.</p>
<p>The canonical picture to keep in mind is <br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yin_and_Yang.svg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yin_and_Yang.svg</a> -- sometimes this one <br>
also helps: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Klein_bottle.svg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Klein_bottle.svg</a></p>
<p>You can learn more about Isabelle/ML in the "implementation" manual that <br>
is included in Isabelle, e.g. Documentation panel in Isabelle/jEdit. <br>
There is also a tiny example at the bottom of the same panel: <br>
src/HOL/ex/ML.thy.  It includes some bits of HOL -&gt; ML code generation, <br>
but not Scala.</p>
<p>That is an interesting pastime, but it is probably irrelevant to your <br>
problem.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>I am using Isabelle/HOL to produce executable Scala code from suitable specifications.<br>
I can get some code returning the value of some function upon a given argument.<br>
However, I would also like this code to be triggered by time events at runtime.<br>
For example, I would like the code to output its values every second.<br>
A simple way I had in mind was to add an argument to the specification of my function representing time, <br>
and then to plug a time counter into that argument, but I'm digressing.</p>
<p>In general, how do you exploit machine's clock at runtime?<br>
Googling, I found references to timeap/timeit and to <a href="http://Time.now">Time.now</a> ().<br>
Questions:</p>
<p>1) Would any of these approaches be useful for the problem stated above?</p>
<p>2) I am only familiar with Isar, but I understand that to use these approaches I should embed ML code in it, right?<br>
In this case, is there a good primer to descend from the Isar layer to the underlying ML layer?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Marco</p>

Hi Marco,</p>
<p>as you produce Scala code, I assume that you want to have those time events in Scala. <br>
However, Isabelle's code generator generates only a subset of what you can do in Scala, <br>
namely the purely functional programming part. With some extension like Imperative_HOL, <br>
you get a bit further. But for asynchronous time events, you need concurrency, and AFAIK <br>
there's nothing like that in Isabelle at the moment. Do you want to reason about these <br>
time events? If not, then all this is just a matter of wrapping up the generated Scala <br>
code -- you definitely don't want to do all this in Isabelle. That is, you should write in <br>
Scala your time trigger that evaluates the function you are interested in and outputs the <br>
results. If you want to reason about these timing events in Isabelle, then you first have <br>
to model all this in HOL (not easy) and adapt the code generator such that maps your model <br>
to the Scala primitives (difficult to get really right).</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
Andreas</p>
