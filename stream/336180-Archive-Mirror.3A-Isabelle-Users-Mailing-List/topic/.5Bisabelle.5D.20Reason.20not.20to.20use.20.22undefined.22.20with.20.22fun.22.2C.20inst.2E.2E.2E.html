<p>if no selector is specified for datatypes, there will be none <br>

</blockquote>
<p>With "nonexhaustive", and with being able to define selector's in the <br>
datatype definition, those two will get rid of most warnings that can <br>
come from using underspecified functions. I switched my use of a "fun" <br>
to an "abbreviation", which doesn't warn me about "the None", so that <br>
gives me another way to get rid of warnings.</p>
<p>I kept using the query panel to try and find the "getter" functions for <br>
a datatype, but I didn't see anything, so your comment above was useful, <br>
and in going to look at "the" again, as an underspecified function, I <br>
saw that it is now defined in the datatype defintion, which showed me <br>
how to define a getter.</p>

<p>I don't exactly know what "pay attention to this" means in regards to <br>
"primrec", but I guess it means if I'm having proof problems when using <br>
"primrec" and "undefined", then I can try to see if switching to "fun" <br>
helps, since "fun" is doing what I'm doing".</p>

<p>Modelling and semantics learning always stays at the end of the line, <br>
but I worked through your example, and it reminded me how "undefined" is <br>
concrete, in regards to existence and uniqueness for a particular type.</p>
<p>Thanks to the both of you,<br>

Hi,</p>
<p>The canonical way in the HOL sources, when there's no need for a total <br>
function, is to not cover all the cases, like "last", which is not <br>
covered for []:</p>
<p>primrec last :: "'a list =&gt; 'a" where<br>
     "last (x # xs) = (if xs = [] then x else last xs)"</p>
<p>I've been doing that kind of thing, but it occurred to me that I could <br>
put "undefined" to good use, to get rid of the warnings, like this:</p>
<p>datatype fooD = Bar | BarC "nat option"</p>
<p>fun BarC_get :: "fooD =&gt; nat" where<br>
     "BarC_get Bar = undefined"<br>
    |"BarC_get (BarC None) = undefined"<br>
    |"BarC_get (BarC (Some n)) = n"</p>
<p>Instead of like the above:</p>
<p>fun BarC_get2 :: "fooD =&gt; nat" where<br>
     "BarC_get2 (BarC (Some n)) = n"</p>
<p>Is there some, good, mysterious reason why I shouldn't do this to get <br>
rid of the warnings?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>

No, I don't know one. At first I thought that in the latter case <br>
"BarC_get Bar = BarC_get (BarC None)" would not be provable, but <br>
Sledgehammer helped me out: by (metis BarC_get.elims fooD.distinct(1) <br>
fooD.inject option.distinct(1)).</p>

<p>However, Nitpick also reported a non-spurious counterexample (empty <br>
assignment), so I'm cc'ing Jasmin.</p>

Dear Gottfried,</p>
<p>Technically, you do not change the internal construction at all if you add the missing <br>
cases with undefined on the right-hand side. The function package does the same <br>
internally. With primrec, it is slightly different, because primrec internally abstracts <br>
over the other parameters and then uses undefined with a function type rather than the <br>
parameters. So, if you pay attention to this, you do not change what you can prove in <br>
Isabelle about your definitions.</p>
<p>However, from a modelling perspective, it can make a difference. Say, you write the <br>
following definition:</p>
<p>fun nth :: "nat =&gt; 'a list =&gt; 'a" where<br>
   "nth 0 (x # xs) = x"<br>
| "nth (Suc n) (x # xs) = nth n xs"<br>
| "nth n [] = undefined"</p>
<p>Then the last equation is part of the specification that fun exports for regular usage. <br>
 From a modelling point of view, all your theorems about nth then only apply to the real <br>
world if whenever you access a list (think array) beyond its end, you get the same back no <br>
matter how far you reach beyond the end. If you want to model array access in memory, this <br>
is clearly unrealistic. Instead, if you omit the last equation (and do not pierce the veil <br>
of abstraction that fun provides you - but there is currently no way to express this in <br>
Isabelle), then you don't have this assumption about nth in your model.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>
