Hello,</p>
<p>I am confused as to why Isabelle displays different variables than their <br>
actual names in some cases. For instance:</p>
<p>lemma "P (xs::'a list)"<br>
proof (induct xs)<br>
   case Nil<br>
   thus ?case sorry<br>
next<br>
   case (Cons x xs)<br>
   hence "P xs" .</p>
<p>Note how I write "Cons x xs" and "P xs" but Isabelle keeps displaying <br>
xsa. With complicated induction proofs this makes it hard to keep track <br>
of what exactly the variables are called. It doesn't prevent shadowing <br>
because when I write "xs" I don't get the blue xs from the original <br>
statement.<br>
Also, when copying a subgoal or parts thereof to a new "have" or "lemma" <br>
statement to prove them separately, I have to go through and convert <br>
every "&lt;var&gt;a" to "&lt;var&gt;". This is cumbersome.</p>
<p>Why does this happen, and is there a way to turn this behaviour off?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rafal Kolanski.</p>

First of all note that the induction proof really needs to refer to <br>
locally fresh variables in the body.  Your proof can be spelled out more <br>
explicitly as follows:</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  fixes xs :: "'a list"<br>
  shows "P xs"<br>
proof (induct xs)<br>
  show "P Nil" sorry<br>
next<br>
  fix y ys<br>
  assume "P ys"<br>
  show "P (Cons y ys)" sorry<br>
qed</p>
<p>The choice of names is up to you, it is convenient to re-use some names <br>
from the original statement, but the internal logic is still the same.  <br>
In particular, using x and xs here makes the system invent an internal <br>
(brown) xsa, to avoid a clash with the initial (fixed) xs.</p>
<p>For historical reasons, goal display uses the internal names of the raw <br>
logic, not the terminology of the Isar text.  This makes it indeed hard to <br>
paste text from the goal state back into the source.  (At some later <br>
stage, the print layer might get smart enough to perform the trick.)</p>
<p>To avoid such inconveniences right now you can either use completely <br>
different bound names (as y and ys above), or try to avoid pasting from <br>
low-level goal state in the first place.  This can be achieved to some <br>
degree by referring to symbolic facts and goals produced by the ``cases'' <br>
infrastructure (see also the print_cases command), maybe also with some <br>
additional term abbreviation derived from the original statement (using <br>
"is" patterns).</p>
