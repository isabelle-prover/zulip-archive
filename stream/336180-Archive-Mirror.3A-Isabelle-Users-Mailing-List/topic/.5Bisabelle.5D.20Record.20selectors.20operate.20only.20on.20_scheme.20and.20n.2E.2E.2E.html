Dear experts of the record package,</p>
<p>Last week, Jasmin and I had a long discussion about integrating the record package further <br>
with the free_constructors package. In the end, we found out that things are not so <br>
simple. The main obstacle was the somewhat non-uniform treatment of record extensions when <br>
it comes to the different generated constants. Let me illustrate the problem with an example.</p>
<p>record foo = foo :: nat<br>
   record bar = foo + bar :: int</p>
<p>The first command creates a type "'m1 foo_ext"<br>
and synonyms "'m1 foo_scheme = 'm1 foo_ext" and "foo = unit foo_scheme".<br>
The second a type "'m2 bar_ext"<br>
and synonyms "'m2 bar_scheme == 'm2 bar_ext foo_ext" and "bar = unit bar_scheme".</p>
<p>The record notation (| ... |) gets translated to constants foo_ext and bar_ext, which <br>
serve as free constructors for the types foo_ext and bar_ext. Thus, a value of type 'm2 <br>
bar_scheme is composed of two nested constructors, namely bar_ext in the extension <br>
parameter for foo_ext. If it were only for this, it would be easy to register the <br>
constants foo_ext and bar_ext as free constructors of the respective types.</p>
<p>However, the free_constructor command also supports selectors and therefore, it would be <br>
good to register them too. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find a proper selector <br>
for the bar_ext type. The selector bar is generated as a constant of its own rather than <br>
an abbreviation like</p>
<p>bar x == <a href="http://bar_ext.bar">bar_ext.bar</a> (foo.more x) (* <a href="http://bar_ext.bar">bar_ext.bar</a> does not exist at the moment *)</p>
<p>Can anyone remember why the selectors for _scheme are constants rather than abbreviations <br>
of selectors for the _ext types?</p>
<p>In the present form, free_constructors cannot handle compound types such as bar_scheme. So <br>
we cannot register bar reasonably with free_constructors.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

Hey Andreas.</p>
<p>The record package builds records out of layers of "ext" record<br>
extensions, as you've understood.</p>
<p>In the distant past, the record package defined two layers of selectors<br>
and updators, one (mostly hidden) for each "ext" layer, and surface<br>
selectors/updators which operate on the "completed" type. These were all<br>
new constant definitions - it may be relevant that this design predates<br>
abbreviations.</p>
<p>When I last attacked the record package, I got rid of the duplication in<br>
order to reduce the proof times, and just kept the surface<br>
selectors/updators.</p>
<p>In hindsight, we could have instead kept the layer-by-layer<br>
selectors/updators, and turned them into the final selectors/updators<br>
with abbreviations or other syntax tricks. I didn't think of this at the<br>
time. Also, I wanted to change as little of the old design as possible,<br>
in particular I didn't want to try to understand the syntax aspects.</p>
<p>I suspect that making this change would require a modest amount of work,<br>
probably a few weeks for someone who knows what they're doing. It would<br>
also simplify the simprocs a little - they have to think a lot about the<br>
special cases for the more/"..." selector/updator.</p>
<p>A final complexity you might want to think about: the reason I got<br>
involved in this in the first place is that the record package <em>can</em> be<br>
used to define some really big records (&gt; 500 fields). I don't think<br>
that the corresponding datatype proofs can be done in a reasonable<br>
amount of time. This is one reason why records aren't given the datatype<br>
treatment by default. There might be an argument for switching the<br>
default here, and providing a richer theorem set by default with a<br>
"simple mode" switch available for bigger records.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

Hey Thomas,</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick reply. I still wonder how a change from selectors on _scheme to <br>
layer-by-layer would affect efficiency. With layer-by-layer, we'd get less <br>
selector/updator pairs, because we only need them for the fields of one record <br>
specification, not for the fields inherited from existing records. On the other hand, <br>
selectors then consist of several constants and pretty-printing has to collapse the <br>
abbreviations. In the end, it certainly depends on the depth of the record extensions. I <br>
myself have never exceeded depth 5, but how about at NICTA?</p>
<p>Despite the explanation at the beginning of Record.thy, I have not yet understood how you <br>
manage to state and prove O(n ^ 2) theorems (for the selector-updator rules) in <br>
O(log(n)^2) step. In the end, there are O(n ^ 2) theorems, aren't there?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au">thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
The "NICTA record problem" is with a single flat record that has a lot<br>
of fields (~ 500 I think). I don't think we use record extensions much<br>
at all. I've never seen a record extension more than 2 deep.</p>
<p>The change would impact syntax performance somehow, more work, or<br>
different work. I don't understand the syntax layer at all though, so I<br>
can't really comment on that.</p>
<p>There are less selector/updator pairs, but this essentially doesn't<br>
matter. There are in any case far too many pairs (for a record with &gt;<br>
100 fields) to generate all the simp rules ahead of time. Anyway, only a<br>
tiny proportion of them would be syntactically encountered. The record<br>
simproc proves the relevant rules each time they are needed. The proof<br>
of each one is O (log(n)), so we don't even bother to cache them.</p>
<p>Your suggested change would make this simproc proof process fire<br>
multiple times for some cases where it currently fires once, but I think<br>
the total amount of work would stay about the same, so I suspect the<br>
performance impact would be minor.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification, I did not know that the theorems are only generated inside <br>
the simproc on demand. This indeed adds some complication.</p>
<p>For the moment, I'll wait and see what Dmitriy's new tool for lifting BNFs over typedefs <br>
brings and how he integrates the record selectors.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>
