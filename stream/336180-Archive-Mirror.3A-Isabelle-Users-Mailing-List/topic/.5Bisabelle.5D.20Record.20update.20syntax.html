<p>From: Lukas Stevens &lt;lukas.stevens+isabelle-users@in.tum.de&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>when using records a common theme is to just update some fields of a <br>
record and leave the others at is. To this end, many functional <br>
languages have a record update syntax, e.g. in OCaml you can write {bar <br>
with x = 1} to obtain a new record that has all the same values as bar <br>
except for x. As far as I can see, Isabelle/ML currently has no such <br>
syntax which can lead to quite a bit of bloat. For a pathological <br>
example, see src/Provers/order.ML where multiple functions are declared <br>
that each just update one field of the record, but you still have to <br>
explicitly provide all the other fields. It would be nice to have this <br>
build into the language. An even more flexible solution would be to <br>
implement this as an ML antiquotation; however, this requires the <br>
ability to introspect the type of a record to obtain a list of all the <br>
record members. I am not sure if this is currently (or at all) possible.</p>
<p>Is there any interest in having such a language construct?</p>
<p>Lukas</p>

<p>From: Lukas Stevens &lt;lukas.stevens+isabelle-users@in.tum.de&gt;<br>
Thanks for the answer and the additional practical hints.</p>
<p>Of course, the example is, as I said, pathological but you will find<br>
clumsy usage of records in other places as well.</p>
<p>I agree with you that introducing a new language feature would not be a<br>
good idea. Lenses would probably be a nice and flexible solution. The<br>
problem with those is that you have to write quite a bit of boilerplate<br>
if you can't generate them automatically. To generate them<br>
automatically, one could define an ML antiquotation that reads a record<br>
type definition and defines the record type while automatically<br>
generating the code for the lens as well. Or is there a way to generate<br>
the lens for an existing record type (which would make it more flexible)?</p>
