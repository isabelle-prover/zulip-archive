<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>For my use of technology, there's only one product, programming <br>
language, etc. which/I have to /stay connected to be able to get enough <br>
information, and that's this product, Isabelle/HOL. I make vows to not <br>
post here, but then, how many Windows users are here? If the next <br>
Windows version has a big problem, should I not send in an email, to <br>
stick with my vow? Then I've stuck with an old version, or have to <br>
suffer through 9 months to a year of a "bug". So, when I end up <br>
compromising, things like this end up getting posted.</p>
<p>I'm not commenting here to get any response. I actually like the absence <br>
of chatter here. I don't care to see traffic on the type of things I say <br>
sometimes.</p>
<p>Some time ago, someone suggested the use of Stackoverflow for Isabelle, <br>
and now there's a tag for Isabelle. It gets promoted by its link on the <br>
Isabelle web page, and it gets some support by some members of the Set <br>
of Big Guns. If there's now a Stackoverflow tag, maybe there should be a <br>
Isabelle reddit (though maybe not).</p>
<p>First, I give an example of a Reddit site that appears to balance all <br>
the needs and problems that come with a discussion/question/answer forum <br>
for a technical/professional/academic/research product centered around <br>
formal knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/new/">https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/new/</a></p>
<p>From here, being a True Analyst of Life and Society, I go through <br>
problems and advantages of the different forum formats. At the end, I'll <br>
say something like, "Given the problems and advantages I've pointed out, <br>
it might be that the best compromise is a reddit, as shown by the Rust <br>
reddit site."</p>
<p><em>--NEEDS:</em> /for a different format than this mailing list/</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are three main advantages to the formats of <br>
Stackoverflow and <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit.com</a>:</p>
<p>(1) One web page that contains an question or remark, along with all <br>
answers and discussions, and the complete discussion that follows.</p>
<p>(2) Decent verbatim formatting.</p>
<p>(3) The result of (1) and (2), an involved question that no one has <br>
time to answer, has a better chance of eventually getting answered.</p>
<p>I unsubscribe here at times, and then view the mailing list posts on the <br>
Web. However, this time, I subscribed back because the Web site doesn't <br>
display some of the graphical characters correctly.</p>
<p>Even subscribing, there's not a complete, good solution for submitting <br>
source to be viewed by others. A little HTML formatting can go a long <br>
way towards making things readable.</p>
<p>I can either insert source in the email body, with no guarantees to what <br>
others will see, or I can attach a THY.</p>
<p>At Stackoverflow, I don't have to attach anything, and it gives me basic <br>
formatting. If it's a big, long THY, I can put it in, and it'll truncate <br>
the view and provide a scroll bar. (I know reddit has code formatting, <br>
but I don't know what else).
*
--PROBLEM: */Stackoverflow suppresses involved discussion/</p>
<p>I ultimately don't care whether there's ever an Isabelle reddit, because <br>
I'm not in charge, but I think the Stackoverflow format suppresses <br>
discussion too much.</p>
<p>Because mathematics and logic in Isabelle/HOL gets complex, and because <br>
novices and experts have to co-exist, lengthy discussion needs to be an <br>
acceptable, and technology-enabled, part of the Isabelle etiquette.</p>
<p><em>--PROBLEM:</em> /Stackoverflow empasizes voting too much/</p>
<p>As to crowd sites that actually provide good information, and voting, I <br>
have a very schizophrenic psychology about that, and I'll suppress most <br>
all of my opinions  on that.</p>
<p>In the context of Isabelle, voting to establish credibility, and voting <br>
to establish the value of a question or answer, how is that applicable here?</p>
<p>I'll guess that 99% of those subscribed to this mailing list have a PhD, <br>
where I have one of the minimum qualifications needed to possibly <br>
succeed with Isabelle/HOL, a B.S. in math.</p>
<p>When Larry Paulson had 1 point on Stackoverflow, as opposed to his <br>
current giganormous 181 points, what bearing did that and does that have <br>
on anything?</p>
<p>*--PROBLEM: */democracies and voting aren't the magic wand/</p>
<p>This is already becoming too long, so I'll turn my opinion here into a <br>
complement.</p>
<p>One thing I respect about this mailing list is that those in charge rule <br>
with a light hand. Compare that to a certain mailing list on <br>
foundational mathematics. It it tells me that I have to subscribe, and <br>
then the moderator will reply back if accepted. No thanks. I already <br>
know I'm unacceptable, and thank you for saving me time from writing <br>
emails like this one. To be fair, some topics may require a heavy hand, <br>
from experience.</p>
<p>The quality of a democracy is dependent on the quality of voters, and <br>
people voting on what they don't understand is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Additionally, if the crowd self-regulates, like here, except for me <br>
occasionally, there's no need for voting. In fact, for a forum to <br>
discuss Isabelle, I say you don't want a democracy.</p>
<p>I say, here, you want about 3 leaders in charge, along with some core <br>
group of professional who also provide some leadership. You then want <br>
that group to monitor the place with a light hand, giving people <br>
freedom, until it's obvious that a person has abused the freedom given, <br>
at which time a heavier hand is applied.</p>
<p>If that's what's needed here, then it seems to me that's more of what <br>
you need other places. It appears to me, just by reading the Rust reddit <br>
rules in the sidebar, what I described about here is sort of how the <br>
Rust professionals work it there.</p>
<p><em>--PROBLEM:</em> dilution of knowledge over too many sites</p>
<p>I decided that's not a problem for adding a Isabelle reddit. I think <br>
it's a fact, the vast majority of people who subscribe to this mailing <br>
list would be more likely to be willing to participate in an Isabelle <br>
reddit, than participate on Stackoverflow. I'll give some opinions about <br>
why below.</p>
<p><em>--PROBLEM:</em> having to sign up for accounts, and getting notified of new <br>
post</p>
<p>People may not want to create an account for a particular web site. <br>
Companies try to force us to do that. I don't like it, but <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit.com</a> <br>
may not be too bad. I don't have an account.</p>
<p>Everyone has email, so everyone can get mailing list emails. I subscribe <br>
to tags and users by RSS for Stackoverflow, but I don't see the reddit <br>
provides RSS, and some people aren't set up with a RSS reader anyway.</p>
<p><em>--EXIT</em></p>
<p>Well, initially, I had an outline in my mind about comparing problems <br>
and disadvantages about different types of forums, but at the point I <br>
start needing to make sure I implement ancient Greek principles of <br>
rhetoric, to get my point through, I know an email is becoming more than <br>
what it should be.</p>
<p>One last point is that initially, I couldn't make any sense of the <br>
Stackoverflow way of organizing question. Primarily, it's just a <br>
sequential list of questions, displayed by time, though it can be <br>
filtered by tags.</p>
<p>I've decided that's the best way to do things, because there's no good <br>
way to organize anything when questions keep streaming in, and where if <br>
a question doesn't get attention fairly fast, it most likely won't get <br>
attention. There are current questions,  the search box to look for <br>
what's in the past, and pages for particular people. There's just too <br>
much knowledge to try and cleanly organize it all.</p>
<p>That point is related to what I care about in all of this. If I ask an <br>
involved question here, is it going to get answered? Probably not, at <br>
least, not very fast.</p>
<p>If it doesn't get answered heere very fast, what's the result? It gets <br>
buried, because emails keep coming in, and the newest emails are what <br>
get the attention.</p>
<p>If I spend 4 hours working up a question on reddit, then it can just set <br>
there. It will get forgotten, but it's not the same thing as getting <br>
buried in time here. All I have to do to try and resurrect it is provide <br>
the link to someone.</p>
<p>If a professional has 5 minutes to throw out a quick paragraph, does <br>
Stackoverflow facilitate that very good? No. It emphasizes the giving of <br>
good, well thought out answers.</p>
<p><em>--EXIT 2</em></p>
<p>That reminded me of my outline. Does an expert want to submit what they <br>
say to a novice, a novice who has absolutely no ability to judge the <br>
technical value of what the expert says? No, of course not.</p>
<p>I tell you how it works sometimes, when it comes to voting. A person <br>
doesn't have the ability to determine whether someone has given them <br>
good information or bad information. They only know that they feel bad, <br>
about something. Well, that's so wrong, so they click an icon to show <br>
their displeasure.</p>
<p>In that part of the outline, I would have also made comparisons about <br>
problems with expert sites on <a href="http://stackexchange.com">stackexchange.com</a>. Here, novices have to <br>
mix with experts, so there has to be a greater level of tolerance by <br>
novices for experts, and experts for novices. It seems to me, I see that <br>
kind of philosophy in the rules of the Rust reddit.</p>
<p>--Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
I usually treat the history of pending threads on this mailing list with <br>
special care: anything that looks like I should comment on, but is not <br>
immediately clear, is marked as important in my mail folder.</p>
<p>At the end of a month, I look through all pending messages of 1 month, <br>
sometimes of 2 or 3 months.</p>
<p>Before a release I look through all pending messages back to the last <br>
release.</p>
