<p>From: Patrick Michel &lt;<a href="mailto:uni@pbmichel.de">uni@pbmichel.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi!</p>
<p>I am working with a five-way mutual recursive set of datatypes, that have a combined count of 27 constructors. For induction proofs over these datatypes this means proving 27 cases at minimum, sometimes more, as I often have multiple properties to prove for one of the types at once.</p>
<p>Many of these proofs can be done "by (induct v and p and d and r and l) auto", provided I have good lemmas and auto doesn't choke.<br>
In other proofs I cam fine with listing all the cases and doing the "proof (induct v and p and d and r and l)", as many cases need different tactics.</p>
<p>What I am worried about are the cases in between. Sometimes there really are only three interesting cases, the rest works "by auto". If auto doesn't choke on these three, I can do the proofs in apply style of course, but I try to avoid apply proofs. So with "proof" these proofs look like this:</p>
<p>proof (induct v and p and d and r and l)<br>
 case A: … next<br>
 case B: … next<br>
 case C: … next<br>
 case rest1 thus ?case by auto next<br>
 case rest2 thus ?case by auto next<br>
 case rest3 thus ?case by auto next<br>
 …<br>
qed</p>
<p>Where "restX" goes up to 27, as said, or even worse these cases can have sub cases, etc. pp.</p>
<p>The same situation arises with induction theorems from complex functions that match more than one parameter. The way Isabelle disambiguates the equations is to unfold all combinations. In a recent proof I had to proof the cases 1 to 7, 8_1 to 8_3 and 9_1 to 9_27. Thereof only 1 to 8_3 where interesting and were followed by 27 lines of boilerplate cases :-)</p>
<p>Now I know some possible ways to get out of this mess:<br>
1) pick another induction scheme<br>
2) if necessary, define one via a terminating function<br>
3) in the case of the function example above: change the definition by avoiding to match another parameter (which can complicate things and in general makes the function harder to read)<br>
4) find more lemmas so the proof works "by (induct v and p and d and r and l) auto" again, or something comparable in size</p>
<p>In the past weeks, however, I found myself in several situation where I could not come up with a good solution.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my original point :-D</p>
<p>I would love to just rewrite the above proof to something like:</p>
<p>proof (induct v and p and d and r and l)<br>
 case A: … next<br>
 case B: … next<br>
 case C: … next<br>
 remaining_cases by auto<br>
qed</p>
<p>Where "remaining_cases" presents me with the exact proof state I see after the last next. I.e., I can pick all the "cherries" from the cases, proof them nicely, and dispose of the rest.<br>
That would be incredibly useful to me.</p>
<p>So has this been considered? Is it easy/hard to implement? Is it already possible and I missed it?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>I believe that you are looking for the following pattern:</p>
<p>proof (induct v and p and d and r and l)<br>
 case A: … next<br>
 case B: … next<br>
 case C: … next<br>
qed auto</p>
<p>That is, you give a final proof method after "qed" to solve the remaining cases.</p>

Dear Patrick,</p>
<p>Then just do it :-)</p>
<p>proof (induct v and p and d and r and l)<br>
  case A: … next<br>
  case B: … next<br>
  case C: … next<br>
qed auto (* solves remaining cases *)</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
René</p>
