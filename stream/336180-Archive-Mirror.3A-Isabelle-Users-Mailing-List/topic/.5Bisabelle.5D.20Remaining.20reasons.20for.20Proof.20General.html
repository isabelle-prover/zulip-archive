Hi,</p>
<p>do you really mean “composing”, in the sense of the Compose key, or<br>
rather “dead” key?</p>
<p>For a dead key i would expect that &lt;~&gt;&lt;space&gt; will print "~", not "~ " –<br>
why do you need Ctrl-B? What OS by the way?</p>
<p>I have disabled dead keys and use the Compose Key<br>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key</a>) so that &lt;Compose&gt;&lt;~&gt;&lt;n&gt;<br>
yiels ñ. But that might not be an option if you have to enter a lot of<br>
accents. In that case, you might want to customize jEdit, as suggested<br>
by René¹².</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
Joachim</p>
<p>¹ Yes, that is &lt;R&gt;&lt;e&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;Compose&gt;&lt;´&gt;&lt;e&gt;.<br>
² No, ¹ is not &lt;Compose&gt;&lt;^&gt;&lt;1&gt;, although that works as well, but <br>
  &lt;AltGr&gt;&lt;1&gt;<br>
³ My &lt;Compose&gt; key is &lt;Print&gt;, which Thinkpads have for some reason <br>
  between the right AltGr and String. I enable that with<br>
  keycode 107 = Multi_key<br>
  in my ~/.Xmodmap.<br>

<p>From: René Neumann &lt;<a href="mailto:rene.neumann@in.tum.de">rene.neumann@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
As a matter of fact: The Linux' XCompose input method [1] works fairly<br>
well with Isabelle/jEdit. For example, I use my right windows key as<br>
compose key, allowing me to use Compose + / + \ to enter ∧ in any text.<br>
Same for Compose + g + a for α ... and many more.</p>
<p>Using this in Isabelle/jEdit yields the result I'd expected, i.e. no<br>
visual difference to using jEdits abbreviations here.</p>
<p>Hence, in theory, a sophisticated user could have different levels of<br>
input abbreviations (very often used ones: jEdit, not so often: Compose,<br>
seldomly: explicit completion), where the first ones can even share the<br>
same codes (f.ex. &lt; + = for ≤ and Compose + &lt; + = for ⇐ )</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>[1] I probably am using the wrong nomenclature here...<br>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Using a compose key is definitely a good way to just ignore jEdit's<br>
completion. I have a customised .XCompose file that allows me to write<br>
∀, ∃, ∈, ⟹, ⊆ and so on using the Compose key; this solution has the<br>
advantage that it also works the same way outside of jEdit. I only just<br>
realised that I could simply use my Compose key to solve the whole<br>
Unicode token issue for me, maybe I should give jEdit another try.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
For completeness here are my own remaining reasons for Proof General, <br>
which are really the last bits.</p>
<p>* Use of ispell to spell-check the "text" parts of theories (the<br>
     latex-oid formal source).</p>
<p>I think jEdit VoxSpell will do the job after some fine-tuning.  In<br>
     particular the token language needs to be taken into account to<br>
     distinguish informal from formal text.</p>
<p>* Reformatting of plain ASCII or "text" parts with fill-paragraph.</p>
<p>It should be reasonably easy to reshape the jEdit action<br>
     format-paragraph to work more like the old Emacs operation.  It<br>
     especially needs to distinuish a given margin for informal text vs.<br>
     the overall "wrap margin" of the source file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the above you can guess how I've edited the new Isabelle/jEdit manual <br>
some weeks ago: using Proof General in offline mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully that was the last time that such oddities happened.  Once that <br>
the Isabelle document preparation system is integrated into <br>
Isabelle/jEdit, there will be little reasons to look back on ancient <br>
things anyway.</p>

A few more hints on SideKick in general.  Its main purpose is to provide <br>
some simple tree view on text buffers, depending on "edit mode" and <br>
"sidekick parser".</p>
<p>For example, you can use the Documentation panel to open the Isabelle NEWS <br>
file.  Then you switch to SideKick and get some clickable outline of that <br>
file, according to its structure.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>additional fact: gtk (or GNOME?) disables the usual X11 provided compose<br>
method (which is configurable and more extentensive) by a hard-coded<br>
list which contains, for example ☭ and ¹, but not the ones you mention,<br>
which is unfortunate. This can be overwritten (export<br>
GTK_IM_MODULE="xim" ), but that had other side-effects which I don’t<br>
recall at the moment.</p>

I usually use Nimbus -- it is a good compromise of performance vs. <br>
look-and-feel quality.  GTK+ is not only slow, but has occasional <br>
dropouts, e.g. in ListView.  The Color Picker is also not quite <br>
up-to-date -- lacking important tabs.</p>
<p>The really old Metal L&amp;F is even faster and more reliable, but is a bit <br>
retro now.</p>
<p>The fastest L&amp;F I've ever seen is native Windows, but native Mac OS X is <br>
also OK.</p>

Here is a probably related note from the last section of the <br>
Isabelle/jEdit manual:</p>
<p>\item \textbf{Problem:} Some Linux / X11 input methods such as IBus<br>
   tend to disrupt key event handling of Java/AWT/Swing.</p>
<p>\textbf{Workaround:} Do not use input methods, reset the environment<br>
   variable @{verbatim XMODIFIERS} within Isabelle settings (default in<br>
   Isabelle2013-1).</p>
<p>It has required almost 1 year until I managed to reproduce this myself and <br>
to find an entry on the IBus tracker, which is still pending, I think.<br>
(The IBus guy did not understand the source of the problem.)</p>
<p>So Linux input methods can be as hostile to Java as window managers.  To <br>
me that "platform" has become more and more like a freak show.</p>
<p>People who do have the ambition to iron out such snags, are especially <br>
welcome to provide further hints to the jEdit guys at <br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jedit/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jedit/</a></p>
<p>My impression is that the quality and coverage is approx. 90% Windows, 9% <br>
Mac OS X, 1% Linux.  The little remains of the latter are then potentially <br>
destroyed by Linux packagers (but Isabelle/jEdit does not depend on that).</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The non-handling of add-on files, especially ML ones, is one of the main <br>
omissions from the past 5 years of Isabelle/jEdit.  Just a few weeks ago, <br>
while cycling through sunny Apulia, I've devised a reasonably simple way <br>
to get there.  Lets see if I manage for the next release.</p>
<p>The reason why its not there yet is indeed the coincidence that it mostly <br>
affects people working on Isabelle/HOL itself, which are releatively few, <br>
and it is a relatively tough job anyway.  It does not mean that I am not <br>
annoyed myself by the omission.</p>
<p>Some months ago, I had a different and quite pleasant experience with <br>
Isabelle/ML development in Isabelle/jEdit.  Doing just plain 'ML' sections <br>
(to avoid the ML file problem) and some 'keywords' in the header, it was <br>
really nice to work out some Isar commands.  The only surprise was a <br>
sudden breakdown due to an old version of the command still persisting <br>
while the new version was malformed (rejected by the ML compiler).</p>
<p>The internal command table is still global for historic reasons (Proof <br>
General legacy again) and poking into it can have unexpected effects.</p>

I just gave the jEdit in 2013-1 a try. Here are my first impressions:</p>
<p>* In PG, I have some open buffers, these are the buffers that I'm<br>
interested in. jEdit opens all dependent theories (approx 50 to 100 in<br>
my typical use-case). So using cycle-buffer or similar functions makes<br>
no sense. </p>
<p>How can I efficiently switch between the theories that I'm currently<br>
editing/interested in, without having to search them among dozens of<br>
uninteresting theories?</p>
<p>* I have no control when theories are processed. I loaded a theory,<br>
and saw in the theory-panel all these purple bars slowly disappearing,<br>
until no purple was left. Also for the theory that was currently<br>
displayed in the main window. However, the theory in the main window was<br>
NOT completely processed. When moving down the cursor, the purple bar<br>
appeared again.</p>
<p>So how can I be sure that my theories are all correct?</p>

<p>You can give some declarative hints in the "Theories" panel, namely for <br>
global "Continuous checking" and individual "Mark as required for <br>
continuous checking".  There are also actions and keyboard shortcuts for <br>
that.</p>
<p>To get a general overview of specific actions and shortcuts of <br>
Isabelle/jEdit, you can go to "Global Options / Shortcuts / Edit <br>
Shortcuts: Plugin: Isabelle".</p>

<p>By making a batch build in the old-fashioned manner.</p>
<p>An approximation in Isabelle/jEdit is to look closely at the Theories <br>
panel overview, but with hundreds of theories it might be a bit difficult.</p>
<p>What is missing here is a general "wrapup" of the editor session similar <br>
to the batch build session.  This non-uniformity is one of these spots <br>
where Proof General legacy support is in the way.</p>
<p>You have already noticed a subtle breakdown in this department in one of <br>
the release candidates.  Doing things once right is better than doing it <br>
3-4 times slightly differently (Isabelle/jEdit, isabelle build, Proof <br>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I use ProjectViewer as both a file manager and a project manager, either <br>
of which lets you import folders, flattened or not flattened, or just <br>
add specific files. It has features for projects I don't use yet, like <br>
setting compile and run commands to be run in the console plugin.</p>
<p>ProjectViewer would let you group together a few files, from the 50 to <br>
100, and switch back and forth between them by double-clicking on them <br>
in the ProjectViewer tree.</p>
<p><a href="http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?ProjectViewer">http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?ProjectViewer</a></p>
<p>In the ProjectViewr panel "Folders" tab, you right-click on the "All <br>
Projects" and click "Add project". A "Create New Project" window opens <br>
where you can change different options, but the basics are a project <br>
name and root directory.</p>
<p>You give the project a name and root directory and click "OK", after <br>
which it takes you to an import window. In your case, if you don't want <br>
to import the 100 files you don't care about, you would hit cancel, and <br>
then add individual files, as I describe below.</p>
<p>At this point, I don't actually use it as a project manager most of the <br>
time, so I right-click on the project name and select "Close group or <br>
project".</p>
<p>Under "All Projects", I can right-click on a project name and "Re-import <br>
files" or "Add files". If I've imported a folder, I can expand the tree <br>
and right-click on a filename and select "Remove from project", but you <br>
have to be careful, because "Delete from disk" is right under that command.</p>
<p>If you've right-clicked on a project name and selected "Open group or <br>
project", then %p, $p, or %p% is the console path variable for the <br>
project root folder. See "Help/jEdit Help/Plugins/Console" for more <br>
details about Console and its interplay with jEdit and other plugins.</p>
<p>Like I say, I use it as a file manager, so I have files open from <br>
different projects, where all project names show up below "All <br>
Projects", because I don't have any project open.</p>
<p>So that it doesn't automatically close the files I want open all the <br>
time, in "Plugin Options/Project Viewer/General Options", I uncheck both <br>
"Close files on project change" and "Remember open project files".</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>From: Joachim Breitner &lt;<a href="mailto:breitner@kit.edu">breitner@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>as a suggestion, would it be possible to decouple the question of<br>
whether a theory appears in the Theories panel from the question of<br>
whether a buffer exists for it?</p>
<p>In detail, given Theories A and B, where B imports A. If I import A.thy,<br>
I will be asked if I want to load theory B as well. Obviously I press<br>
Yes. Now B appears in the Theories panel, and will be processes as a<br>
prerequisite for A, but the file B.thy will not be (visibly) opened.</p>
<p>If I now want to edit B.thy as well, I can either double-click on B in<br>
the Theories panel, or File→Open it as usual. When I’m done with it, I<br>
can even close it; it will stay in the Theories panel (as a dependency<br>
of A).</p>
<p>This way, I have full control over what files I have open, and what I<br>
can cycle with Ctrl-PgUp. In fact, I was expecting this behavior when I<br>
first fired up jEdit. Possible, it could also speed up things, as no UI<br>
elements would have be generated for the files that do not have buffers.</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
Joachim<br>

That approach was basically at the very start of theory management some <br>
years ago, but it did not work out on the spot so I made the explicit <br>
flooding with jEdit buffers as intermediate solution.  This worked better <br>
than anticipated, which explains why it is still there in its relatively <br>
crude way.</p>
<p>In the meantime isabelle build has become a formal part of Isabelle/Scala, <br>
and various jEdit "project" facilities have emerged.  So it all needs to <br>
be all revisited to fit it nicely together, such that there is signicant <br>
conceptual progress as well.</p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>With some years of delay, that is a start.  I don't see any fundamental <br>
problems in this list, just accidental behaviour which can be easily tuned <br>
or done differently.</p>
<p>You know yourself that XEmacs / ProofGeneral 3.7.1.1 is totally obsolete. <br>
Current GNU Emacs is at version 24 and Proof General 4.2.  I wonder if <br>
there are other remaining users of ProofGeneral 3.7.1.1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With jEdit, I have to switch to the mouse far more often, in particular <br>
for sledgehammer, find_theorems and to navigate from one theory file to <br>
another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>jEdit has quite smart keyboard shortcuts for many things, but they are <br>
usually quite different from Emacs.  Switching files works via the "buffer <br>
switcher", which is keyboard operable (a bit difficult on German layouts, <br>
though).  After several weeks of practice, operating jEdit should be much <br>
faster than Emacs.</p>
<p>The Find and Sledgehammer panel are my own responsibility, and they are <br>
new in Isabelle2013-1, so more refinements can be expected.  There are <br>
already jEdit actions to open the dockable windows, which also puts the <br>
focus on the main GUI component to activate the tool in question via plain <br>
RETURN.  Note that jEdit "actions" can be mapped to keyboard shortcuts by <br>
the user.  This is not done by default, to avoid the "Escape Meta Alt <br>
Control Shift" syndrome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, I often want to look somewhere else in my theory file (and use <br>
PgUp/PgDn for that); with ProofGeneral, I just type C-c C-. to get back to <br>
where I was before, but I do not know an equally simple way in jEdit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't that just abuse of the accidental boundary between checked and <br>
unchecked text?  This "focus" no longer exists in Isabelle/jEdit anyway, <br>
which is actually one of the main points of the whole approach.</p>
<p>What jEdit (or Isabelle/jEdit) really needs is nice navigation support in <br>
the sense of Firefox or similar.  One mainly needs to work out a good <br>
scheme when or how to "commit" positions to the navigation history, and <br>
maybe brush up the existing Navigator plugin.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>XEmacs has less spacing between the lines (this is the main reason why I <br>
still use ProofGeneral 3.7.1.1, GNU Emacs with PG 4.x has a similar spacing <br>
as jEdit), so more of the proof script fits on the screen at the same font <br>
size.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a question about fonts.  In principle you can use alternative <br>
fonts in jEdit to your liking, although I consider IsabelleText the best <br>
compromise for display quality and glyph coverage.</p>
<p>Note that jEdit has an option for extra vertical line spacing (Global <br>
Options / Text Area).  I've never used it myself, but it could work out <br>
reasonably well.  If not, it is relatively easy to tune that text <br>
painting, because I am doing it all myself anyway.</p>
<p>In XEmacs you still have bitmap fonts.  I wonder if/how it survives a <br>
switch to high-definition displays that have become available in the mass <br>
marked last year.  Gladly, Oracle has already managed to catch up, notably <br>
with Apple's Retina in Jdk-7u40, so jEdit is already beyond the dividing <br>
line of current and obsolete applications.  My cheap Sony HD display also <br>
works nicely with jEdit fonts.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>The output buffers are not usable with a key board. This is <br>
particularly annoying when I examine diagnostic output as produced by <br>
code_thms, export_code, print_classes, thm &lt;large Named_THM collection&gt;, <br>
etc. In jEdit, I first have to open a new buffer and copy the output <br>
there before I can use search and friends to navigate through.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The Output panel is not a buffer at all, but a dockable window.  It <br>
re-uses some of the jEdit buffer display technology, but there is no <br>
attempt to imitate Emacs where "everything is a buffer".  The latter <br>
approach sometimes has advantages, sometimes disadvantages.  Like Proof <br>
General stayed faithful how Emacs works, Isabelle/jEdit takes jEdit <br>
customs seriously.</p>
<p>Searching in Output panels should not be a fundamental problem.  It is <br>
just one of the many small things that did not yet make into <br>
Isabelle/jEdit, because time was spent instead to maintain Proof General.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>After a few hours of work, jEdit reacts slower and slower. This gets <br>
particularly annoying when typing fast. For example, I want that <br>
entering &lt; = TAB produces the \&lt;le&gt; symbol, always. Half of the time, I <br>
am faster than the popup and I get "&lt;= " instead.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I have never heard of that.  There might be a serious problem behind it <br>
that needs to be investigated.  Problems that are known can be solved <br>
eventually.  Secret ones will remain forever.</p>

Especially when there are NEWS items reading "you have to re-do all your <br>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hallo,</p>
<p>if it is in interests, here are the reasons why I do not use jEdit:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Automatic Processing<br>
By this I mean that jEdit always processes the proof text at the cursor<br>
position. I know this is supposed to be a feature of jEdit, but I just<br>
find it annoying. I like my prover to be in a fixed state that I can<br>
alter when I want to. Particularly when you have proof text that takes a<br>
long time to process (e.g. due to large terms, I had that in programme<br>
refinement a lot), one does not want jEdit to keep processing stuff that<br>
it should leave alone for the moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unicode Tokens<br>
In Proof General, I type "ALL" and I get a "∀". In jEdit, I type "all",<br>
I get an annoying popup and have to confirm my choice with a key press.<br>
I have tried to get used to this, but I cannot, even after setting the<br>
popup delay to 0 and adding Space and Tab as keys for confirming the<br>
currently selected symbol. This is particularly tedious if one types a<br>
sequence of symbols. In a way, I feel that users who /know/ their<br>
unicode token names by heart are slowed down by unnecessary GUI (the<br>
popup). I'd like to be able to switch it off and fall back to a Proof<br>
General-like mechanism where I can type "ALL", "==&gt;" and "\&lt;alpha&gt;" and<br>
they are immediately converted to the corresponding Unicode token.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I could probably live with the first "problem"; but the second one is<br>
really annoying; I just find that it slows down the speed at which I can<br>
write proofs to great extent.</p>
<p>I am no friend of emacs and Proof General certainly has its problem, so<br>
I have tried to switch to jEdit twice in the past, but the above two<br>
things and the crashes and lags have led me back to Proof General; maybe<br>
these are fixed now and I should try it again.</p>
<p>In this context, what is the point of "Sidekick"? It displays every<br>
"have", every "using", every "by" as a single node?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Manuel</p>

I must admit I did not know about this option before; it must be rather<br>
new. However, the behaviour is… odd. It seems to complete as soon as<br>
there is only one alternative left, i.e. "\alp" is turned into "α".<br>
"\ta" is turne into "τ". When one types "\alpha", one gets "αha", when<br>
one types "\tau", one gets "τu". So basically, if one wants to use this<br>
feature, one has to remember what part of the abbreviation will lead to<br>
there being only one possibly completion.</p>
<p>That is not exactly what I had in mind.</p>
<p>(On a related note, I also found that jEdit was quite slow; it takes<br>
over a minute to start up on my laptop; Proof General is /much/ faster.)</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>I believe that that will soon enter your procedural memory. I also just<br>
recently switched on this feature and from time to time write Γma, but<br>
it becomes less often quickly. With this, entering fancy symbols becomes<br>
quite nice.</p>
<p>There is still the problem that it relies on unique completions, and<br>
some symbols don’t have short unique prefixes, e.g. \sqsubsete is not a<br>
great win – but then, this symbol has [=, so I just have to get used to<br>
that.</p>

Another problem are codes such as "not", which are still not replaced at<br>
all, since "notation", "note" and so on also exist. I'm afraid I don't<br>
think I can get used to this.</p>

Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>I still find myself using Proof General on a daily basis. The main reason for this is that it's much easier to reload ML code in PG than in jEdit. Here's a typical scenario. Suppose I want to debug a failure in "primcorec". Then I do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open a "Scratch" theory by starting PG with -l HOL-Cardinals (the base image of BNF).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Import "~~/src/HOL/BNF/BNF_GFP" and write a small example that reproduces the problem in "Scratch".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add debugging commands, fix bugs, etc., in the ML files loaded (directly or indirectly) by "BNF_GFP" using some other editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unprocess and reprocess "Scratch".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat steps 3 and 4 dozens of times.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Isabelle/PG was good at reloading exactly those theories that need to be reloaded, without baby sitting. Trying to achieve the same in jEdit requires a lot of clicking and a bit of thinking (to figure which .thy file has the right "ML_file" command).</p>
<p>I understand my use case is not typical for most users, who do not spend their days writing long pieces of ML code, and I can live with PG to do that. Still, it would be nice if jEdit/PIDE, which is otherwise so smart about so many Isabelle specifics, would reach the level of PG on this one point.</p>
<p>Jasmin</p>

There is no big point and it can be simply ignored.  In 2010 I've made <br>
some quick attempts to wire up Isabelle/jEdit with this generic jEdit <br>
plugin and I did not find time yet to make it more serious.  Its main <br>
function at the moment is to provide some outline for section headings.</p>
<p>Occasional unfinished things are no remaining reason for Proof General, <br>
especially since Proof General has nothing like SideKick at all.</p>
<p>I did make the completion serious in Isabelle2013-1, and it is no longer <br>
using SideKick.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>for not, I use ~&lt;TAB&gt;. Not consistent with the others, but still fast.</p>
<p>In any case I believe that jEdit is an editor capable of suiting most<br>
uses when it comes to abbreviations, navigation etc. It surely takes<br>
time to find out how things work, and even more how to change the<br>
behavior if it does not work as intended, and what fancy plugins are<br>
available.</p>
<p>Ideally most of the issues that we discussed in this thread about<br>
symbols are actually independent from whether we edit Isabelle theories<br>
or love letters (\he gives ♡ ;-)), so that we can use upstream resources<br>
when solving them.<br>
I’m not sure if this is actually the case, though, as I cannot tell<br>
which editing features are provided by jEdit by default, which are<br>
provided by jEdit but instrumented and configured using the Isabelle<br>
plugin, and which are genuine Isabelle plugin features.</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
Joachim<br>

Maybe I'm to stupid.</p>
<p>I find the "not" case still unpleasant.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I can't use "~&lt;TAB&gt;" because it's a composing key so I have to type <br>
"~&lt;space&gt;C-b&lt;TAB&gt;"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"\not" is not unique so have to also press Tab</p>
</li>

<p>At sophistication level 2 you can experiment with your own symbol <br>
abbreviations, by imitating / overriding some entries of <br>
$ISABELLE_HOME/etc/symbols with your own entries in <br>
$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/symbols.</p>
<p>There is an art to make certain groups of symbols non-unique on purpose to <br>

<p>I've played this game at the end of the summer, until I was myself <br>
satisfied with 2-3 rounds of refinement.  In the whole history of Isabelle <br>
and Proof General, I have never been that fast typing certain formal <br>
texts.  Even more brevity and immediacity of completion is conceivable, <br>
but my next priority is to make context-sensitive completion based on <br>
information by the prover.</p>
<p>I had some concrete ideas how to approach this delicate problem at the end <br>
of the summer, but then got stuck with too many GUI reactivity problems. <br>
You have seen the last bits of that with the key event loss at extreme <br>
typing speed.  (Next time I simply avoid switching GUI focus for <br>
completion; it will only require the usual 2-3 weeks of testing to <br>
stabilize again.)</p>

You can define your own abbreviations. F.ex. -, for ¬ :)</p>
<p>Do this by putting the following into ~/.isabelle/etc/symbols</p>

<p>This is an important observation.  The new Isabelle/jEdit manual describes<br>
the situation as follows:</p>
<p>\medskip \paragraph{Input methods.} In principle, Isabelle/jEdit<br>
   could delegate the problem to produce Isabelle symbols in their<br>
   Unicode rendering to the underlying operating system and its<br>
   \emph{input methods}.  Regular jEdit also provides various ways to<br>
   work with \emph{abbreviations} to produce certain non-ASCII<br>
   characters.  Since none of these standard input methods work<br>
   satisfactorily for the mathematical characters required for<br>
   Isabelle, various specific Isabelle/jEdit mechanisms are provided.</p>

<p>The new manual should give some impression what is jEdit and what is <br>
Isabelle/jEdit.  It is the first go on such a manual, though, and many <br>
fine points might be missing or difficult to understand.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Looks like the usual confusion due to platform-specific and/or national <br>
keyboard layouts.  E.g. on a German Mac it is really hard to type many <br>
basic things.  It routinely requires some re-adjustments in one of five <br>
possible departments.</p>
<p>For ¬ in particular, note that it is a plain-old ISO-LATIN-1 character. <br>
Many keyboard layouts have a relatively direct path to it.</p>
