Just the canonical question: What is the remaining use of {* ... *} here?</p>
<p>It won't go away, but might eventually be superseded by \&lt;open&gt; ... <br>
\&lt;close&gt; (which is rendered in Unicode as as ‹...› with some input method <br>
in the Prover IDE via single backquote).</p>
<p>I am myself using mainly ‹...› since a few months and it should be easy to <br>
make an Isabelle/Scala function to replace outer syntax {* ... *} <br>
systematically in existing Isabelle projects.</p>
<p>At UITP 2014, Andrew Butterfield briefly referred to Isabelle/UTP <br>
<a href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~simonf/utp-isabelle">http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~simonf/utp-isabelle</a> in comparison to his <br>
own UTP proof assistant.  He made a funny rant about "terms in double <br>
quotes with double single quotes to quote UTP within HOL".  Moving more <br>
and more towards cartouches ‹...› would make the nesting of Isabelle <br>
languages more regular.</p>

<p>I was just playing it safe. It might come in useful to be able to <br>

<p>One problem with graphical characters is they don't align good in <br>
columns with ASCII characters, so I set up my notation many times to <br>
give myself an ASCII-only version, if I also have one with graphical <br>

<p>Just now testing out \&lt;open&gt;, it has the same spacing as an ASCII <br>
character. Most non-ASCII symbols don't, though a few do, such as \&lt;bar&gt;.</p>

<p>I take your word that if you didn't use some sort of delimiters for <br>
terms, that it would come back to haunt you. It seems that the <br>
architects of new languages such as Scala and Rust would have abandoned <br>
the use of "{" and "}", like Haskell, but they didn't, so I guess they <br>
had good reason not to.</p>
<p>Here are a maintenance question and comment I've held off on.</p>
<p>Is there a way to keep PIDE from loading Scratch.thy? I don't use it. In <br>
the past, I think I tried to mess with the command line options for <br>
jEdit, though Isabelle, but couldn't force it to not load Scratch.thy.</p>
<p>That brings up the MyDoggy plugin, which has some quirks, but I've <br>
figured workarounds. After I close Scratch.thy, MyDoggy won't parse any <br>
other buffer view, so I have to shift-mouse-click on the Sidekick tab to <br>
eliminate it, and then shift-mouse-click on it to bring it back.</p>
<p>The reason I specifically use MyDoggy is to be able to do horizontal <br>
splits on the plugin panels. Using MyDoggy is the only way I know of to <br>
do that, and it's very important for me to be able to do that. I can <br>
split buffer views horizontally, but I can't normally split plugin <br>
panels, you can only move them to the top, left, right, and bottom.</p>
<p>I attach a screenshort to show my normal, one-window setup for the PIDE. <br>
I normally permanently have two non-buffer views, sidekick and output, <br>
in addition to two vertical buffer views. The other tabs, I have them <br>
set up in pin mode. I click on them, they expand out without eliminating <br>
sidekick and output, then I click on them to eliminate them. With 10 or <br>
so plugin views, floating windows don't work, except for temporarily <br>
detaching a view.</p>
<p>I understand that MyDoggy is not being actively developed, so it makes <br>
sense for you not to officially use it. But without MyDoggy, I would be <br>
in a constant state of annoyance, trying to find some PIDE view that <br>
works for me, but never does.</p>

<p>There is no plan to remove delimiters, but to simplify them.  The Coq guys <br>
made the mistake a long time ago to assume that everything fits into just <br>
one formal syntax, and got a lot of problems over the years.  Coq PIDE is <br>
still very crude in its command-span parsing, for example.</p>
<p>In Isabelle we've had systematic inner syntax that is delimited within the <br>
outer syntax for uncounted years, but the different kinds of quotes make <br>
things a bit complicated and unesthetic.  With cartouches there is a <br>
chance to improve that.  See also ~~/src/HOL/ex/Cartouche_Examples.thy in <br>
Isabelle2014 -- it is just playground of possibilities.</p>

<p>Scratch.thy is not opened if you specify other files to open.</p>
<p>On Windows the main Isabelle.exe application wrapper accepts normal <br>
arguments according to that platform, e.g. via drag-and-drop.  You can <br>
also create a Windows alias for the exe and give it some arguments via the <br>
Windows Properties dialog.  Using the special argument "--" (the <br>
end-of-options indicator of jEdit) seems to do the trick to imitate a <br>
semantically empty command-line that looks syntactically non-empty.</p>

<p>There was a recent initiative on the jedit-devel mailing list to re-assign <br>
maintainers to some unmaintained plugins.  MyDoggy was one of them.  It <br>
has the additional problem that the underlying MyDoggy project is <br>
inactive.</p>
<p>Anybody with notable Java/Swing skills should be able to revive that. See <br>
also <a href="http://mydoggy.sourceforge.net/">http://mydoggy.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
