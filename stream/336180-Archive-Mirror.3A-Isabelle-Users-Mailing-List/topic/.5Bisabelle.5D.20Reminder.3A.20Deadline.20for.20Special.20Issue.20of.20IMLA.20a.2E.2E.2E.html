<p>From: Valeria de Paiva &lt;<a href="mailto:valeria.depaiva@gmail.com">valeria.depaiva@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>The deadline for the submission of papers to the special issue of<br>
Information and Computation on Intuitionistic Modal Logics and<br>
Applications is fast approaching (31st May).</p>
<p>Please see the CFP below, and forward it to other interested colleagues. If<br>
you'd like to submit a paper, but don't think you can make the deadline,<br>
please write to us with your title and preliminary abstract and we can have<br>
(some!)  flexibility.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
 Brigitte &amp; Valeria</p>

<p>Call for Papers</p>
<p>Special Issue of Information and Computation on<br>
Intuitionistic Modal Logics and Applications (IMLA)</p>
<p>Guest Editors: Valeria de Paiva, Brigitte  Pientka and Aleks Nanevski</p>
<p>Submission deadline: 31. May, 2009</p>
<p>Constructive modal logics and type theories are of increasing<br>
foundational and practical relevance in computer science. Applications are<br>
in type disciplines for programming languages, and meta-logics for reasoning<br>
about a variety of computational phenomena.<br>
Theoretical and methodological issues center around the question of how the<br>
proof-theoretic strengths of constructive logics can best be combined with<br>
the model-theoretic strengths of modal logics. Practical issues center<br>
around the question of which modal connectives with associated laws or proof<br>
rules capture computational phenomena accurately and at the right level of<br>
abstraction and how to implement these efficiently.</p>
<p>There have been a series of   LICS-affiliated workshops devoted to the<br>
theme. The first one was held as part of FLoC1999, Trento, Italy, the second<br>
was part  of FLoC2002, Copenhagen, Denmark, the third was associated with<br>
LiCS2005, Chicago, USA and the last one was associated with LICS 2008 in<br>
Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Two special issues of journals on the theme have<br>
already appeared,  a Mathematical Structures in Computer Science volume<br>
edited by Matt Fairtlough, Michael Mendler and Eugenio Moggi (Modalities in<br>
type theory) in 2001, and a special<br>
issue of  the Journal of Logic and Computation  in 2004<br>
(Intuitionistic Modal Logics and Application, eds. Valeria de Paiva, R. Gore<br>
ad M. Mendler).</p>
<p>We are hereby soliciting papers for a further special volume<br>
 of Information and Computation, devoted to Intuitionistic Modal<br>
Logics and Applications. We hope to cover the novel applications<br>
presented in the last two workshops, especially applications to<br>
computer security, automated deduction and  computational linguistics, but<br>
also to include work not presented at the workshops. The proposed timeline<br>
 of events is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Papers (preferably under 20 pages long) should be submitted by 31st May<br>
 2009</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reviews will be provided until the end of August 2009 and the volume<br>
should be ready by the end of the Fall.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Topics  of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>applications of intuitionistic necessity and possibility</li>
<li>monads and strong monads</li>
<li>constructive belief logics and type theories</li>
<li>
<p>applications of constructive modal logic and modal type theory to formal<br>
verification, foundations of security, abstract interpretation, and program<br>
analysis and optimization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>modal types for integration of inductive and co-inductive types,<br>
higher-order abstract syntax, strong functional programming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>models of constructive modal logics such as algebraic, categorical,<br>
Kripke, topological, and realizability interpretations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>notions of proof for constructive modal logics</p>
</li>
<li>extraction of constraints or programs from modal proofs</li>
<li>proof search methods for constructive modal logics and their<br>
implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact one of the editors (Valeria de Paiva<br>
<a href="mailto:valeria@cuill.com">valeria@cuill.com</a> or  Brigitte Pientka <a href="mailto:bpientka@cs.mcgill.ca">bpientka@cs.mcgill.ca</a>) if<br>
you're not sure that your paper is within the scope of this special<br>
volume. Submissions should be 10 to 20  pages  long and sent in<br>
PostScript or PDF format to one of the editors, before the 31st<br>
May 2009.</p>
