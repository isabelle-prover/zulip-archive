Dear Members of the Research Community,</p>

Paulson, please allow me to comment on some remarks by David Cock, Lawrence C. <br>
Paulson, Markus Wenzel and Andrei Popescu, available at</p>

<p>The phenomenon of schematic variables in Isabelle, as addressed by David Cock, <br>
seems to coincide with the concept of syntactical variables in the works of <br>
Alonzo Church and Peter B. Andrews. The basic idea is that the same kind of <br>
proof can be carried out with certain or all possible substitutions for the <br>
schematic or syntactical variable, and due to its nature it must be a free <br>
"variable".</p>
<p>However, there also seems to be a difference in the way this idea is <br>
formalized, leading to different results.</p>
<p>In the works of Alonzo Church and Peter B. Andrews, syntactical variables <br>
always indicate a metatheorem of the meta-language: "In making metamathematical <br>
(syntactical) statements, we shall use bold capital letters as variables for <br>
well-formed formulas, and bold small letters as variables for variables [...]." <br>
[Church, 1940, p. 57] "We shall prove theorems in both the object language and <br>
the meta-language. Indeed, in the meta-language we shall prove theorems about <br>
the theorems of the object language. For emphasis, we may call a theorem of the <br>
meta-language a metatheorem." [Andrews, 2002, p. 11] "We shall now prove <br>
certain theorem schemata [...] of Q0." [Andrews, 2002, p. 215]</p>
<p>So the object language and the meta-language are always clearly separated, as <br>
the meta-language is "meta", in other words "above" the object language, and <br>
therefore, strictly speaking, outside of the mathematical language.</p>
<p>This is reflected by the fact that Andrews consequently distinguishes <br>
metatheorems from theorems of the object language by the use of bold letters <br>
for syntactical variables. (And, if I am not mistaken, only metatheorems employ <br>
informal words like "if" and "then" instead of logical symbols only [cf. <br>
Andrews, 2002, p. 224 (5224 = Modus Ponens)]; only metatheorems use the set of <br>
hypotheses [cf. ibid.]; and only metatheorems have restrictions, i.e., <br>
"provided that A is free for x in B" [Andrews, 2002, p. 224 (5226)].)</p>
<p>With his high accuracy, Andrews sets forth the path of Church's approach which <br>
is known for its "precise formulation of the syntax" [Paulson, 1989, p. 5].</p>
<p>It seems to me at the first glance that in Paulson's system Isabelle, in which <br>
a new kind of variable (schematic variables) is introduced, the separation of <br>
the object language and the meta-language is not as strict as in the works of <br>
Alonzo Church and Peter B. Andrews. There are three reasons for this impression.</p>
<p>First, it seems that metatheorems can be inferred directly in Isabelle and <br>
later instantiated for a concrete case by substitution, as indicated in the <br>
e-mail by David Cock. But inference should not work with metatheorems, since <br>
with purely mathematical means (namely, those of the object language) this is <br>
not possible. For example, in my (still unpublished) system R0 described at</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00170.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00170.html</a></p>
<p>metatheorems are represented by files containing the proof templates, but for <br>
each individual case the proof has to be carried out again (technically <br>
implemented through file inclusion). Of course, there are theorems about <br>
general properties that can be instantiated for concrete cases. For example, I <br>
proved some property on groups in general and then transferred it to a concrete <br>
group. But this does not work with metatheorems (without artificially enhancing <br>
and, hence, violating the object language), because the mathematical language <br>
(the object language) simply does not provide the means for proving <br>
metatheorems or transferring (instantiating) them to theorems of the object <br>
language.</p>
<p>Second, the introduction of schematic variables only (without the introduction <br>
of names for the symbols of the object language in the meta-language) in <br>
Isabelle supposedly takes place in the same logical sphere (computational <br>
namespace) as the object language. In contrast, Church and Andrews emphasize <br>
that the names for the symbols of the object language in the meta-language are <br>
only the same for practical reasons, but logically belong to a different <br>
sphere: "Moreover we shall adopt the customary, self-explanatory, usage, <br>
according to which symbols belonging to the formal language serve in the syntax <br>
language (English) as names for themselves, and juxtaposition serves to denote <br>
juxtaposition." [Church, 1940, pp. 57 f.] "We shall use formulas of the object <br>
language as names for themselves in the meta-language." [Andrews, 2002, p. 11] <br>
Thus, carrying out a proof in the object language is something entirely <br>
different than expressing in the meta-language (i.e., by means of <br>
arithmetization of the object language) the fact that this proof can be carried <br>
out. Hence, through metatheorems, additional knowledge is obtained, but <br>
metatheorems cannot replace the theorems of the object language nor otherwise <br>
can meta-language substitute the mathematical language (the object language) <br>
itself.</p>
<p>Third, the strict distinction of the object language and the meta-language does <br>
not seem to be a criterion for the development of Isabelle, as the term <br>
"meta-logic" in the context of Isabelle is used for the _technical_ <br>
meta-language only, in which specific logics can be specified and implemented, <br>
but not in the sense of the _mathematical_ meta-language: "A calculus of logics <br>
is often called a logical framework; I prefer to speak of a meta-logic and its <br>
object-logics. Isabelle-86 required a precise meta-logic suited to its aims and <br>
methods. A fragment of higher-order logic (called M here for 'meta') now serves <br>
this purpose." [Paulson, 1988, p. 3]</p>
<p>The lack of a strict distinction between object language and meta-language <br>
seems inherent to natural deduction (and not only to Isabelle). Alonzo Church <br>
and Peter B. Andrews use an axiomatic (Hilbert-style) deductive system, whereas <br>
Lawrence C. Paulson's Isabelle is clearly a natural deduction system, since it <br>
allows the use of multiple deduction symbols (turnstiles) per line of a proof <br>
or per theorem. In Andrews' Hilbert-style system Q0, each line or each theorem <br>
has exactly one occurrence of the deduction symbol.</p>
<p>In both his 1988 and 1989 articles Lawrence C. Paulson explicitly refers to <br>
Peter B. Andrews' logic Q0: "Andrews [1] has written a book covering <br>
higher-order logic. Here is a brief sketch of a fragment called M, which will <br>
be our meta-logic." [Paulson, 1988, p. 4] "Andrews [1] presents a formulation <br>
based on equality." [Paulson, 1989, p. 14]</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in these articles no principle reasons are given for why Isabelle <br>
was implemented as a natural deduction system, but only a practical one: <br>
"Church's axiom system is now antiquated, largely dating back to Principia <br>
Mathematica. There are improved formulations but most use the Hilbert style. <br>
Natural deduction is far superior for automated proof." [Paulson, 1989, p. 3]</p>
<p>From the point of view of axiomatic (Hilbert-style) deductive systems, the <br>
theorems of the proofs of (historical) natural deduction were primarily <br>
metatheorems. For example, the classical rules and inferences given at</p>
<p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/proof-theory-development/#NatDedSeqCal">http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/proof-theory-development/#NatDedSeqCal</a><br>
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/reasoning-automated/#NatDed">http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/reasoning-automated/#NatDed</a></p>
<p>are all metatheorems.</p>
<p>But if principle questions about the expressiveness of the mathematical <br>
language are concerned, they have to prevail over practical (technical) <br>
questions.</p>
<p>Maintaining the distinction between object language and meta-language, Goedel's <br>
First Incompleteness Theorem (and hence, the Second) does not work in Peter B. <br>
Andrews' logic Q0. Dealing with Goedel's First Incompleteness Theorem <br>
seriously, one cannot simply ignore the fact that this proof fails in one of <br>
the most important mathematical systems currently available to the public. As <br>
mentioned earlier at</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00170.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00170.html</a></p>
<p>step 7101.4 has no syntactic justification [cf. Andrews, 2002, p. 314 (7101)], <br>
since "there is no rule of inference from a theorem to the existence of its <br>
proof in the object language." [Kubota, 2013, p. 9] Neither the basic rules of <br>
inference of Q0, R and R' [cf. Andrews, 2002, pp. 213 f.], nor any derived <br>
rules can be used to infer 7101.4.</p>
<p>In Paulson's proof, for this step (for which in Andrews' proof only some <br>
implicit rule is used) the theorem 'proved_iff_proved_PfP' - called (P) in my <br>
article - is required, which is the result of a long proof [cf. Kubota, 2015, <br>
pp. 8 f., 19]. I do not see any way of proving such a theorem in a <br>
Hilbert-style system.</p>
<p>Independently, James R. Meyer has raised the same concern: "[T]he result, as <br>
for Świerczkowski's proof, is an illogical confusion of meta-language and the <br>
language of HF. [...] Paulson does not include any computer code that proves <br>
that this cannot result in an illogical confusion of meta-language and <br>
object[ ]language." [Meyer, 2015, p. 11]</p>
<p>If Professor Paulson decides to respond to this critique (possibly including <br>
those in section 3.8), I would be interested in the answer, too, as my <br>
communication with him was dominated by misunderstandings obviously caused by <br>
different interpretations of the term "meta-language", as outlined above, such <br>
that the main question remained unan<br>

<p>Central to your email is your emphasis on the traditional phrases of <br>
logic, "object language" and "meta-language". The problem I see with <br>
that is that though you use the phrases to try and frame the discussion <br>
about Isabelle, the phrases aren't used in the distribution <br>
documentation, which is a major representation of how the primaries want <br>
to frame the discussion.</p>
<p>Definitions and axioms are everything. You shouldn't be arguing <br>
subtleties if there's no common agreement on the meaning of central <br>
words and phrases.</p>
<p>In Logic and Computation, by Paulson, published 1987, Paulson was still <br>
sticking with tradition, and wrote:</p>
<p>To clear up the confusion we must distinguish the meta language from <br>
the object<br>
   language. The formal language of terms and formulae is the object <br>
language. We<br>
   make statements about the object language in the meta language.</p>
<p>In 1988, only a year later, he switched to "meta-logic" and <br>
"object-logic", as shown in the document you quote from, which I show <br>
again below.</p>
<p>I've always been under the impression that Paulson did that to give <br>
himself new or relatively unused terminology, to define specifically <br>
what he was doing, to separate his stuff from the crowd's stuff. In <br>
fact, if you search on "meta-logic" and "object-logic", the two compound <br>
words don't show up much, unlike "object language" and "metalanguage".</p>
<p>I'm actually a bit confused. I'm inclined to believe that Larry Paulson <br>
is who introduced their use into the language of logic, or at least, <br>
he's who made their use "popular". I could ask him about the history of <br>
the words, but he's a member of the set of everyone, and not to be <br>
fraternized with.</p>
<p>Back to the documentation. If the authors, in the documentation, don't <br>
use the words "object language" and "meta-language", and they do use <br>
"meta-logic" and "object-logic", doesn't that tell us there's a <br>
distinction they're trying to make?</p>
<p>That your points may be valid for some kind of general critique, that <br>
may be true, but you can't attack a claim that a person hasn't made. You <br>
want to talk about "object language" and "meta-language", when I only <br>
hear them talking about "meta-logic" and "object-logic".</p>
<p>I think they are at fault at something. It's that they describe <br>
Isabelle/HOL in terms of older logics, when, in my opinion, though it <br>
draws from far and wide, it is its own standard; it defines itself, in a <br>
very concrete way. There is something very specific to talk about.</p>
<p>Because they describe it in terms of other logics, to give people an <br>
idea of what it is, people then expect it to be what they want it to be, <br>
which usually is what the people are familiar with.</p>
<p>I did a search for "language", in PDF and DJVU verions of this book, <br>
"Isabelle - A Generic Theorem Prover":</p>

<p>That book is a big part of what's in the current documentation. It was <br>
basically intact, though split up, until at least 2008, in the docs <br>
ref.pdf, intro.pdf, logics.pdf, and logic-ZF.pdf.</p>
<p>I didn't see one use of "object language" and "meta-language" in those <br>
documents. I could have missed something.</p>

<p>You say, "Third, the strict distinction of the object language and the meta-language does not seem to be a criterion for the development of Isabelle..."</p>
<p>Maybe so, or maybe not, or maybe it's a lot easier to just talk about"meta-logic" and "object-logic", since they're precisely defined by Isabelle/Pure, along with the primary object-logic, Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>The beauty of proof assistants is that, unlike a logic like traditional <br>
ZFC, at build time, the heap for Isabelle/HOL is precisely and exactly <br>
defined. When I'm told that Isabelle/Pure is the meta-logic, I know <br>
exactly what "meta-logic" is. In fact, my understanding of "meta-logic" <br>
has no bearing on what the meta-logic of Isabelle/Pure is. Per binary <br>
file, called the heap, it's locked in, assuming no randomness in the <br>
physics of it all.</p>
<p>Compare that to abstract thoughts of the mind, where the outcome is <br>
dependent on understanding.</p>

<p>I'm not out to critique anything that I don't understand. I'll interpret <br>
this sentence broadly: "one cannot simply ignore the fact that this <br>
proof fails in one of the most important mathematical systems currently <br>
available to the public".</p>
<p>I think, actually, most everything gets ignored, in the grand scheme of <br>
things. Larry Paulson put a lot of work into the ZF logic, but then it's <br>
not used. Google introduced Dart to try and replace Javascript, but it <br>
hasn't. They tried to displace Facebook with something-or-another. They <br>
didn't. They're big, but not so big as to not get ignored in many of <br>
their new ventures.</p>
<p>What people care about with Isabelle is this: Isabelle/HOL. It's the <br>
result of a collective effort by many people, a product of 30 years or <br>
so, with millions of dollars having been poured into it. Tobias Nipkow, <br>
the wizard of mysterious low-level, under appreciated, under-the-hood <br>
magic, teamed up with Larry Paulson and switched the emphasis to <br>
Isabelle/HOL, which is based on the work of Mike Gordon. The large group <br>
at TUM gave it the huge boost it needed to get to the point it is now.</p>
<p>Nobody cares about a raw logic. Nobody cares about raw much-of-anything. <br>
If we work real hard, and give people a polished, or semi-polished <br>
product, then they might care about something we have to give away, or <br>
they may not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A technical meta-logic as in the case of Isabelle or technical meta-languages<br>
like ML have the advantage of offering the easy implementation and comparison<br>
of several logics. But this advantage is relevant for the experimental stage<br>
only. As for the final implementation of the particular preferred logic, I<br>
would advise against using some kind of meta-logic or meta-language, as<br>
additional features may weaken the rigor of (or even create an inconsistency<br>
in) the logical kernel, but would suggest restricting oneself to the _direct_<br>
encoding of the logic in order to preserve logical rigor or necessity. This<br>
implies the use of a purely imperative computer programming language without an<br>
implicit type system for the mathematical objects to be represented (i.e., C++).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're looking at things wrong. If the rigor of the logic of <br>
Isabelle/HOL is weakened, and it's possibly inconsistent, then what is <br>
that? It's an opportunity for someone like you to get some bragging rights.</p>
<p>What did we see recently? A major accumulation of bragging rights by 3 <br>
people, though I'm not completely clear on how the bragging rights <br>
deserve to be divvied out. There's the Czech. Will he just get a Ph.D? <br>
No. He also gets the summa cum laude of bragging rights, for showing a <br>
logic is inconsistent.</p>
<p>Scary stuff, inconsistent logics. "Falso, you stay from me! You scary <br>
scary dude! You scare me, worse than a talking Barbie doll!!"</p>
<p>Really, what would be of more value? A generalized logic that stands the <br>
test of time, such as Isabelle/Pure and Isabelle/HOL, or a very narrow <br>
logic, such as what you advise?</p>
<p>How are people supposed to test the generalized logic, over many years, <br>
if the safer route is taken. And an inconsistent logic is not a crisis <br>
anyway. An inconsistent logic that can't be fixed with "don't do that" <br>
is <br>
