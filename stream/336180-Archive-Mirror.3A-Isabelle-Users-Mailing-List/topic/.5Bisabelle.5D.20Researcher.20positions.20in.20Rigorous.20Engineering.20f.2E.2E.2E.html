<p>From: Peter Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:Peter.Sewell@cl.cam.ac.uk">Peter.Sewell@cl.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Researcher positions in Rigorous Engineering for Mainstream Systems (REMS)</p>
<p>How can we use rigorous semantics to improve the quality of mainstream<br>
computer systems? REMS (Rigorous Engineering for Mainstream Systems)<br>
(<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/</a>) is a 6-year EPSRC-funded<br>
Programme Grant to do just that, bringing together an exciting<br>
combination of researchers in systems (architecture, operating<br>
systems, and networks) and in semantics (programming languages,<br>
automated reasoning, and verification) at three UK universities:<br>
Cambridge, Imperial, and Edinburgh.</p>
<p>We want to understand how to build accurate full-scale mathematical<br>
models of some of the key computational abstractions (processor<br>
architectures, programming languages, and concurrent OS interfaces),<br>
and how these can be used for new verification research, to build<br>
tools that are applicable to real systems, and to enable new systems<br>
and programming language research. Supporting all this, we are also<br>
working on new specification tools and their foundations.</p>
<p>If you have a keen interest in developing and applying rigorous<br>
methods for real-world systems, we'd like to hear from you. At the<br>
Cambridge site, we're looking to appoint several researcher and<br>
research-engineer staff: up to four postdocs and two research<br>
engineers (we will also be looking to appoint researchers at the<br>
Imperial site, advertised separately). We're looking for people who<br>
have a strong background in systems, in semantics, or in both, and who<br>
want to develop research that integrates theory and practice,<br>
contributing to ongoing research and initiating new subprojects. You<br>
should have expertise in one or more of the following, on the<br>
semantics side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming Language and Processor Semantics and Type Systems</li>
<li>Automated Reasoning Tools, including Interactive Proof Assistants</li>
<li>Concurrency</li>
<li>Program Verification</li>
<li>Static and Dynamic Analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>and/or the following, on the systems side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer Architecture</li>
<li>Operating Systems</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Compilers</li>
</ul>
<p>We have four postdoctoral researcher positions available. For these<br>
positions you should have a PhD (which should be submitted by the<br>
start date) or equivalent experience. For candidates with exceptional<br>
experience it may be possible to appoint on the Senior Research<br>
Associate scale (£37,382-£47,314); for this you should also have the<br>
ability to assist with project coordination.</p>
<p>We also have two research engineer positions available, which will be<br>
on the Research Assistant scale. Candidates for these should have an<br>
excellent first degree. One of the positions has a tenure of three<br>
years; in some cases it may be possible to combine this with PhD<br>
study. The limit of tenure for the other position is one year; this<br>
may suit someone who is thinking of going on to a PhD later.</p>
<p>The positions are funded by the EPSRC grant EP/K008528<br>
(<a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K008528/1">http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K008528/1</a>), led<br>
by Peter Sewell (<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/</a>). Further details of<br>
the project are at <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/</a>. Enquiries can<br>
be addressed to any of the investigators, listed there.</p>
<p>Those involved in the project include researchers in semantics and<br>
systems at Cambridge: Mike Gordon, Magnus Myreen, Andrew Pitts, and<br>
Peter Sewell (PI) for the former, and Jon Crowcroft, Steve Hand, Anil<br>
Madhavapeddy, Simon Moore, and Robert Watson for the latter, together<br>
with Philippa Gardner at Imperial College London and Ian Stark at the<br>
University of Edinburgh. Also involved are Mike Dodds (York), Susmit<br>
Sarkar (St. Andrews) and Scott Owens (Kent). Project partners include<br>
ARM, IBM, Microsoft Research, the FreeBSD foundation, INRIA,<br>
U. Pennsylvania, Purdue University, and U. Texas Austin.</p>
<p>Applications should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a Curriculum Vitae</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a brief statement of the particular contributions you would like to<br>
  make to the project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a completed form CHRIS6: <a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/hr/forms/chris6/">http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/hr/forms/chris6/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the names and contact details (postal and e-mail addresses) of two<br>
  or three referees who, if asked, will be able to provide references<br>
  promptly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Start date: as soon as possible. The project runs until end February 2019.</p>
<p>For the postdoctoral researcher positions, please quote reference:<br>
NR27842.  Closing date: 15 May 2013; salary: £27,854-£36,298 pa.</p>
<p>For the research engineer positions, please quote reference NR27832.<br>
Closing date: 14 May 2013; salary: £24,049-£27,047 pa.  Please<br>
indicate the length tenure for which you are applying (one or three<br>
years).</p>
