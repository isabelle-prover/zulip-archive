<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@andreas-lochbihler.de">mail@andreas-lochbihler.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts on this topic. I have played around with various <br>
options that you mention and I also ran into the problems you mentioned.</p>
<p>Records in Isabelle/HOL provide only one extension slot. So fields must <br>
be added linearly. You cannot have one record (such as partial_object) <br>
be extended independently (ord and topology) and then later combine <br>
them. To do that smoothly, we would need to have a unification mechanism <br>
that can work modulo type isomorphisms, which basically adds the <br>
conversions as needed. The coercions functionality implements something <br>
like that, but I could never get this to work properly because the <br>
conversions are added during parsing and not during reasoning. I'm <br>
pretty sure, though, that one could implement such a coercion insertion <br>
algorithm, at least for first-order unification or higher-order pattern <br>
matching, in Isabelle/ML. Yet, this would not be integrated with all the <br>
proof methods (simp, clarify, auto, ...) and therefore of little use.</p>
<p>In my AFP entry Monomorphic_Monad [1], I therefore gave up on using <br>
records and went for listing every parameter individually. I found that <br>
I could get a long way by judiciously using nested<br>
"context fixes ... begin" with interspersed "interpretation" commands.</p>
<p>This approach works well with higher-order unification and all proof <br>
tools. The main drawback is that the terms get rather large, in <br>
particular if you stack several algebraic constructions on top of each <br>
other. Consequently, type checking the terms and folding the <br>
abbreviations for displaying terms may get slow.</p>
<p>If your types are sufficiently distinct, the notation problem can be <br>
worked around with adhoc_overloading as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define an uninterpreted constant for each operation of the right <br>
arity and attach the notation to it. For example,</li>
</ol>
<p>consts plus :: "'a =&gt; 'a =&gt; 'a"<br>
notation plus (infixl "\&lt;oplus&gt;" 65)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Register on demand the operations for which you want to use the notation:</li>
</ol>
<p>context<br>
   fixes plus1 :: "'a =&gt; 'a =&gt; 'a"<br>
   and plus2 :: "'b =&gt; 'b =&gt; 'b"<br>
begin</p>
<p>adhoc_overloading plus plus1<br>
adhoc_overloading plus plus2</p>
<p>You can now use \&lt;oplus&gt; for both plus1 and plus2 in your lemmas <br>
provided that type inference can unoverload all occurrences. You may <br>
have to add occasional type constraints. Clearly, this does not work if <br>
the types overlap.</p>
<p>Finally, here's another proposal that might be worth a try: unrestricted <br>
overloading. If Isabelle/HOL had multi-parameter type classes, we could <br>
formalize all these things as type classes. In Haskell, we'd say</p>
<p>class PartialObject a b where carrier :: a =&gt; b set</p>
<p>with a dependency from a to b, i.e., if a is known, then so is b. In <br>
Isabelle/HOL, type class operations may only have one type parameter, so <br>
this does not work directly. However, type classes are internally <br>
implemented with unrestricted overloading + some type inference magic. <br>
So we can achieve something if we don't care too much about the type <br>
inference convenience. Here's a sketch:</p>
<p>consts<br>
   carrier :: "'a =&gt; 'b set"<br>
   le :: "'a =&gt; 'b =&gt; 'b =&gt; bool"<br>
   tau :: "'a =&gt; 'b set =&gt; bool"</p>
<p>Here, the algebraic structure is left abstract as "'a" and you phrase <br>
all your definitions and theorems such that the structure is always an <br>
abstract type.</p>
<p>For example, to specify that a structure of type 'a is an order on <br>
elements of type 'b, you'd write</p>
<p>definition order :: "'a itself =&gt; 'b itself =&gt; bool" where<br>
   "order G _ = (ALL x :: 'b. x \&lt;in&gt; carrier G --&gt; le G x x) &amp; ..."</p>
<p>In practice, you'll have to add many type constraints to guide type <br>
inference into the right direction. This can be alleviated with custom <br>
syntax that shortens the type syntax. An example for this is the <br>
CARD('a) syntax from HOL-Library.Cardinality [2]. So you'd write</p>
<p>"ORDER('b) G"</p>
<p>instead of</p>
<p>"order G (Pure.type :: 'b itself)"</p>
<p>and "CARRIER('b) G" instead of "carrier G :: 'b set"</p>
<p>Combining two structures in this way is then very simple, as the <br>
definitions and proofs do not assume any particular repesentation of the <br>
structure. Accordingly, I'd recommend to also do constructions <br>
abstractly. For example, the product construction would look like</p>
<p>datatype ('a1, 'a2) product = Product (proj1: 'a1) (proj2: 'a2)</p>
<p>overloading<br>
   carrier_product == "carrier :: ('a1, 'a2) product =&gt; ('b1 * 'b2) set"<br>
begin</p>
<p>definition carrier_product :: "('a1, 'a2) product =&gt; ('b1 * 'b2) set"<br>
where<br>
   "carrier_product G =<br>
    CARRIER('b1) (proj1 G) &lt;*&gt;<br>
    CARRIER('b2) (proj2 G)"</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Here, I've introduced a separate type "product" for the generic product <br>
construction such that we keep the types of abstract constructions (like <br>
products) separate from types that may show up in normal applications <br>
(like the type constructor for pairs).</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>

<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Fabian Immler and Andreas Lochbihler,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your replies.</p>
<p>I believe that records with the support for multiple inheritance would<br>
be exceptionally useful for Isabelle/HOL users. However, I guess, it<br>
would be too much to hope that this technology will become available<br>
in the near future.</p>
<p>Having, to an extent, tried the various approaches that I was aware of<br>
before asking the question and, also, the methods suggested by Andreas<br>
Lochbihler, I am beginning to converge on the thought that, for my use<br>
case, the best methodology might be the one that I am already using<br>
(i.e. the methodology similar to the one used by Bohua Zhan and Fabian<br>
Immler in their development). Unfortunately, by now, I have completely<br>
convinced myself that records are not suitable for libraries with<br>
complex locale inheritance trees, primarily, due to the absence of<br>
support for multiple inheritance.</p>
<p>I liked the method proposed by Andreas Lochbihler that uses constants<br>
parameterised by the spaces/algebraic structures themselves. However,<br>
even ignoring the problem of the type inference, I am not certain how<br>
would one deal with the interpretation of the theorems stated for the<br>
parametric constants using suitable arbitrary user-supplied terms.<br>
Would it not be necessary for the users to combine and abstract the<br>
terms as an element of some newly designed type before the can be<br>
achieved? In this case, as it seems, making the interpretation<br>
mechanism as convenient for the users as the locale interpretation for<br>
the approach that is used at the moment would require a substantial<br>
amount of effort for the developer.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I would like to understand if one was to, hypothetically, implement a<br>
large-scale overhaul of HOL-Algebra using the modern locale features, what<br>
would the structure of the new library look like? Would the records still<br>
be used or would it be implemented in the style of the main HOL library<br>
with all parameters stated explicitly and all definitions stated implicitly<br>
in the locale context? Would it be too much to ask to provide a small<br>
example that demonstrates this modern approach based on the existing<br>
locales in HOL-Algebra?</p>
<p>The primary reason why I am asking the question is that I would like to<br>
understand what is considered to be a canonical methodology for the<br>
implementation of a library about abstract spaces/algebraic structures with<br>
the explicit carrier sets using locales.</p>
<hr>
<p>I provide further (and, perhaps, superfluous) details with regard to my<br>
enquiry. I am working on the relativization of the main HOL library using<br>
Types-To-Sets: <a href="https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-SML-Relativization">https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-SML-Relativization</a>. I believe<br>
that this development directly addresses some of the existing concerns of<br>
the users of HOL. For example, in the context of the previously referenced<br>
thread:</p>
<p>On Sat, 13 Apr 2019 10:37:23 Dominique Unruh wrote:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>As far as I know, all proofs are simply done twice. And someone building a</p>

<p>development on these things needs to pick on approach and is then "locked<br>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My own development, effectively, unifies both approaches using<br>
Types-To-Sets as the conceptual glue. The proofs of the set-based theorems<br>
no longer need to be stated explicitly: the type-based theorems from the<br>
main library are converted to the set-based theorems automatically.<br>
Moreover, the adopted methodology explicitly establishes an injection<br>
(potentially, there can be several distinct relativisations of the same<br>
type-based theorem) from the set-based theorems to the type-based theorems<br>
and this injection can be visualised using the features of the framework.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I am still not certain as to what would be the best way to<br>
structure the set-based library. At the moment, the development follows the<br>
approach that merely extends the locales that exist in the main HOL library<br>
with an additional locale parameter that represents a carrier set (or<br>
several locale parameters for multiple carrier sets) - this approach is<br>
consistent with the existing library of relativised results (primarily,<br>
about vector spaces) that was previously developed by Bohua Zhan and Fabian<br>
Immler. This approach, straightforward as it may seem, has several<br>
problems. Firstly, whenever reasoning about the spaces/algebraic structures<br>
themselves, the long list of the locale parameters always needs to be<br>
provided explicitly in each theorem. This problem is exaggerated further<br>
whenever dealing with pairs/triples of spaces/algebraic structures - the<br>
lists of parameters can become dramatically long. For example, a context<br>
that describes a pair of complete lattices would look similar to (of<br>
course, explicit context can be replaced with a locale named, for example,<br>
complete_lattice_pair_ow, but the problem remains the same)</p>
<p>context<br>
  fixes 𝔘A :: "'at set"<br>
  fixes 𝔘B :: "'bt set"<br>
  fixes lea leb<br>
    and lsa lsb<br>
    and infa infb<br>
    and supa supb<br>
    and bota botb<br>
    and topa topb<br>
    and Infa Infb<br>
    and Supa Supb<br>
  assumes clow_a: "complete_lattice_ow 𝔘A Infa Supa infa lea lsa supa bota<br>
topa"<br>
  assumes clow_b: "complete_lattice_ow 𝔘B Infb Supb infb leb lsb supb botb<br>
topb"</p>
<p>Furthermore, the notation associated with the locale parameters for a<br>
single space/algebraic structure, as far as I know, cannot be reused<br>
directly when dealing with pairs/triples of spaces/algebraic structures due<br>
to overlaps. Also, I am not aware of any methodology that would enable one<br>
to make the notation associated with the locale parameters to depend on,<br>
for example, other locale parameters. In the context of the example above,<br>
if one is to define the notation for Infa as (‹⨅⇩o⇩w⇩a›), then it becomes<br>
non-sensical if 𝔘A is interpreted as a set named 𝔘B and 𝔘B is<br>
interpreted as a set named 𝔘A. The same problem also occurs when trying to<br>
transfer the notation for the implicit definitions (i.e. definitions stated<br>
in a locale context) from a single space/algebraic structure to a pair of<br>
spaces/algebraic structures. Moreover, even restating the notation for the<br>
locale parameters and implicit definitions when providing the locales for<br>
the pairs/triples of algebraic structures/abstract spaces can be a very<br>
irritating, tedious and error-prone process that results in a substantial<br>
amount of seemingly boilerplate code.</p>
<p>I believe that the use of records/schemes with the explicitly stated<br>
definitions (i.e. outside of the context of locales), as archaic as it may<br>
seem, resolves all of the aforementioned issues. However, the lack of<br>
support for multiple inheritance creates its own problems. While in some<br>
cases, using a scheme that has more fields than necessary is bearable (as<br>
the referenced example from HOL-Algebra demonstrates), in certain cases, it<br>
becomes impossible. For example, in my attempt to use records/structures in<br>
the library of relativised results, I defined</p>
<p>record 'a ord =  "'a partial_object" +<br>
  le :: "['a, 'a] ⇒ bool" (infix ‹⊑ı› 50)<br>
  ls :: "['a, 'a] ⇒ bool" (infix ‹⊏ı› 50)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>record 'a topology = "'a partial_object" +<br>
  τ :: "'a set ⇒ bool" (‹τı›)</p>
<p>Now, I would like to define an order topology. It does not seem that<br>
records provide a natural way to combine the two concepts together. The<br>
best methodology that I was able to come up with is exhibited via the<br>
following locale that uses two structures:</p>
<p>locale order_topology_ow =<br>
  order_ow 𝒪 for 𝒪 :: "('at, 'bt) ord_scheme" (structure) +<br>
  fixes 𝒯 :: "('at, 'bt) topology_scheme" (structure)<br>
    and 𝔘 :: "'at set"<br>
  assumes 𝔘𝒪: "𝔘 = carrier 𝒪"<br>
    and 𝔘𝒯: "𝔘 = carrier 𝒯"<br>
    and open_generated_order:<br>
      "s ⊆ 𝔘 ⟹ τ⇘𝒯⇙ s = generate_topology_on ((λa. {..⊏a}) <code> 𝔘 ∪ (λa.
{a⊏..}) </code> 𝔘) 𝔘 s"</p>
<p>In my view, this approach is still better than providing all definitional<br>
elements explicitly. However, this approach is still quite limiting and, in<br>
certain cases, even the list of schemes can become quite long.</p>
<p>I would be curious to know if anyone has dealt with similar problems in the<br>
past and knows a solution that is better than using explicitly listed<br>
parameters. Alternatively, perhaps, someone could suggest a canonical<br>
approach for combining two distinct schemes into one scheme with a 'shared'<br>
field.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

typographical errors because I am unable to identify their root cause):</p>

the function of this type is always injective immediately before stating<br>
that there exist non-injective functions of this type.</p>

<p>The second error occurs in my first answer in the thread (<br>
