<p>From: Andrei Popescu &lt;<a href="mailto:A.Popescu@mdx.ac.uk">A.Popescu@mdx.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all, </p>
<p>This is a less gentle reminder that the second edition of S-REPLS is this Friday at the Middlesex University in London. <br>
The talk titles and abstracts are now available online at <a href="http://www.cs.mdx.ac.uk/foundations/s-repls-2/">http://www.cs.mdx.ac.uk/foundations/s-repls-2/</a><br>
The meeting will take place in the historic Margaret Thatcher room in the Hendon Town Hall, which might be of interest at least to the supporters of <br>
John Major equality. Unfortunately, in spite of our excellent speakers and their interesting programming language topics, this high-capacity room will be <br>
half empty, hence the desperation. Registration is still open (and free).  </p>
<p>All the best, <br>
  Andrei </p>
