<p>Call for Papers<br>
                  SAVCBS'09<br>
        Workshop at ESEC/FSE 2009, August 25, 2009<br>
<a href="http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/SAVCBS/">http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/SAVCBS/</a></p>
<p>The sixth workshop on specification and verification of component-based <br>
systems is affiliated with ESEC/FSE 2009 and will be held in Amsterdam, <br>
The Netherlands, August 25, 2009. Eight page papers are due May 15, <br>
2009. Details on paper submission follow the general description of the <br>
workshop below.</p>
<p>Theme and Topics of Interest</p>
<p>SAVCBS is focused on using formal (i.e., mathematical) techniques to <br>
establish a foundation for the specification and verification of <br>
component-based systems. Specification techniques are urgently needed<br>
to support effective reasoning about systems composed from components. <br>
Component-based approaches also underscore the need for scaling advanced <br>
verification techniques such as extended static analysis and model <br>
checking to the size of real systems. The workshop will consider <br>
formalization of both functional and non-functional behavior (such as <br>
performance or reliability). Suggested research topics of interest <br>
include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>* Techniques for component-based verification or reasoning<br>
   * Component-based specification languages<br>
   * Static analysis of components and component compositions<br>
   * Verification-oriented design methodologies for components<br>
   * Dynamic checking techniques, including run-time assertion or<br>
     property checking</p>
<p>* Specification and verification of non-functional component<br>
     behavior (performance, memory, concurrency, etc.)</p>
<p>* Unifying formal descriptions of concurrency properties with<br>
     model-based behavioral descriptions of components</p>
<p>* Balancing tradeoffs (automatic/manual verification,<br>
     soundness/completeness, static/dynamic verification,<br>
     testing/formal verification, scalability/coverage, etc.)</p>
<p>* Theories of component composition<br>
   * Industrial experience, such as adoption issues, with formal<br>
     techniques for component-based systems</p>
<p>* Case studies of applying formal techniques to component based systems<br>
   * Educational experience or tactics for formal approaches to<br>
     component-based systems</p>
<p>Submissions should outline the current state of research or practice, <br>
describe the most pressing shortcomings, and formulate goals for future <br>
development.</p>
<p>Challenge Problem</p>
<p>One session during the workshop will be devoted to presenting solutions <br>
(full or partial) to a challenge problem. This problem will present <br>
features that pose difficulties for current specification technologies. <br>
The session will be open both to presenters as well as participants of <br>
the workshop. Details on the challenge problem will be posted at <br>
<a href="http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/SAVCBS/2009/challenge.shtml">http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/SAVCBS/2009/challenge.shtml</a>. Solutions should <br>
illustrate innovative features of specification or verification as they <br>
pertain to this particular problem.</p>
<p>Submissions</p>
<p>Submissions must not exceed 8 pages. We encourage, but do not require, <br>
use of the ACM Conference format. We also suggest that you add page <br>
numbers to your submission, to make adding comments easier. Papers will <br>
be accepted in PDF or Postscript formats. Papers may be submitted <br>
on-line at <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=savcbs09">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=savcbs09</a> . We are <br>
considering to invite best papers for submission to a journal special issue.</p>
<p>Important dates:</p>
<p>Paper submission deadline: May 15, 2009<br>
        Notification date: June 10, 2009<br>
        Final versions: June 20, 2009</p>
