<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:lammich@in.tum.de">lammich@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>I recently spotted down a problem with SELECT_GOAL and schematic<br>
variables. If new schematic variables are produced in the proof of the<br>
selected goal, their names may clash with existing schematics in the<br>
outer proof state, resulting in unexpected error messages:</p>
<p>inductive P for x where I: "P x"<br>
  lemma J: "P (\&lt;lambda&gt;_. R)" by (rule I)</p>
<p>schematic_lemma "\&lt;And&gt;a. P (?R a) \&lt;or&gt; P (?R)" "TERM ?R3"<br>
    apply -<br>
    apply (tactic {* SELECT_GOAL (<br>
      rtac @{thm disjI2} 1 THEN rtac @{thm J} 1 <br>
      (<em>THEN PRIMITIVE zero_var_indexes</em>)<br>
      THEN print_tac "Proof state after inner tactic"<br>
      ) 1<br>
      *})</p>
<p>*** exception TYPE raised (line 109 of "envir.ML"):<br>
*** Variable "?R3" has two distinct types<br>
*** 'c<br>
*** 'd</p>
<p>What happened here is that the tactic inside SELECT_GOAL produced the<br>
proof state: "\&lt;And&gt;a b. P ?R3 \&lt;or&gt; P (\&lt;lambda&gt;_. ?R3)"<br>
And when retrofitting this into the outer proof state, ?R3 happens to<br>
clash with the ?R3 there.</p>
<p>Moreover, if one directly changes schematic variables that occur in the<br>
selected goal, like the "zero_var_indexes" does in the commented out<br>
line of the example, the unifier runs havoc and produces errors like:</p>
<p>*** mk_ff_list<br>
*** At command "apply" (line 9 of<br>
"/home/lammich/lehre/praktWS1112/cava/Libs/Refine/Autoref/Scratch.thy")</p>
<p>(I also got some exceptions about "Var name confusion" from the unifier,<br>
that I cannot reproduce any more)</p>
<p>These observations result in two main questions:</p>
<p>1. What are the conventions that tactics must stick to when<br>
instantiating schematic variables? E.g. is it ok to do <br>
  PRIMITIVE zero_var_indexes or not?</p>
<p>2. Is SELECT_GOAL implemented correctly and was never supposed to <br>
    work with schematics, or should it be fixed?</p>
<p>Regards and thanks for any comments/workarounds on this,<br>
  Peter</p>

I'm afraid that I really can't answer this question without a time machine.</p>
<p>In the early days, I must have introduced SELECT_GOAL in the context of some specific application where it worked fine. Then it got put in the standard libraries of tacticals and more or less forgotten. I know that a lot of derivations that involve new variables in sub-proofs can go wrong as you describe. The usual method of getting around such problems was to freeze variables prior to applying the tactic, thawing them afterwards. That was a hack, but it generally worked. My impression is that Makarius has replaced such trickery by more robust methods, but it's possible that quite a lot about old code is still there and running. I'm not sure about the current best practice for dealing with this sort of situation.</p>

Unfortunately, this problem does not only affect the (admittedly<br>
low-level) SELECT_GOAL, but also high-level proof scripts, as the<br>
following example demonstrates:</p>
<p>inductive P for x where I: "P x"<br>
  lemma J: "P (\&lt;lambda&gt;_. R)" by (rule I)</p>
<p>schematic_lemma "\&lt;And&gt;a b. P (?R a) \&lt;or&gt; P (?R)" "TERM ?R4"<br>
    apply (rule disjI2, rule J) []<br>
*** exception TYPE raised (line 109 of "envir.ML"):<br>
*** Variable "?R4" has two distinct types<br>
*** 'c<br>
*** 'd</p>
<p>note that everything works fine without the [].</p>

<p>In principle the time machine is Mercurial, but it also takes time to <br>

<p>The ancient freeze_thaw and freeze_thaw_robust (which were actually both <br>
fragile) have evolved over a long way to become the current FOCUS <br>
combinators, which are also mentioned in the "implementation" manual.</p>
<p>This Isar technology for structured tactic programming is useful in many <br>
situations, but it does not really cover the schematic goal approach that <br>
Peter appears to use a lot.  In fact, the continued retreat of genuine <br>
logic-programming with schematic variables in Isabelle tactics over the <br>
years had paved the way for these more recent high-level tacticals.</p>
<p>Readers of the old "intro" manual by Larry might remember the final Prolog <br>
example.  Such techniques are now extremely rare, so it is no surprise <br>
that certain tools choke.</p>
<p>(I will have a close look later at what is actually happening here, when I <br>
have catched up with various other open threads.)</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
I've had a first round of studying 10-15 years of Isabelle source history <br>
yesterday.</p>
<p>SELECT_GOAL and Subgoal.FOCUS represent different strands of tradition, <br>
only the latter (much younger) uses high-end Isar infrastructure -- <br>
context import/export operations that vaguely resemble old "freeze_thaw" <br>
by Larry.</p>
<p>SELECT_GOAL is also used for the "[...]" notation for Isar proof methods.</p>
<p>SELECT_GOAL was good old code by Larry in the nostalgic style of 1980-ies <br>
Isabelle until 31-Aug-2001. Then Stefan Berghofer "Tidied function <br>
SELECT_GOAL".  I think before and after the behaviour wrt. newly invented <br>
schematic was the same as it is still now.  Much later I merely modified <br>
its internal terminology and general setup to make it look more like <br>
Subgoal.FOCUS, e.g. using certain "extract" and "retrofit" operations.</p>
<p>Beyond historical anecdotes, I have made one round of experiments to see <br>
if SELECT_GOAL can be converged a bit more towards the way how the (very <br>
sophisticated) Subgoal.FOCUS works, but it breaks various classic tactics. <br>
Reasons still need to be explored, I can say more after the next round of <br>
investigation.</p>
