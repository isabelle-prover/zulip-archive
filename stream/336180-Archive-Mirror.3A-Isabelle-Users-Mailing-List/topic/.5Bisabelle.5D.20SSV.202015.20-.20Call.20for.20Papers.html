Notification: October 30, 2015<br>
Conference: December 7–8, 2015</p>
<p>Topics</p>
<p>Industrial-strength software analysis and verification has advanced in<br>
recent years through the introduction of model checking, automated and<br>
interactive theorem proving, and static analysis techniques, as well as<br>
correctness by design, correctness by contract, and model-driven<br>
development. However, many techniques are working under restrictive<br>
assumptions that are invalidated by complex embedded systems software<br>
such as operating system kernels, low-level device drivers, or<br>
microcontroller code.</p>
<p>The aim of this conference is to bring together researchers and<br>
developers from both academia and industry who are facing real software<br>
and real problems with the goal of finding real, applicable solutions.<br>
By “real” we mean problems such as time-to-market or reliability that<br>
the industry is facing. A real solution is one that is applicable to the<br>
problem in industry and not one that only applies to an abstract,<br>
academic, toy version of it. In this event we will discuss software<br>
analysis and development techniques and tools; this forum will serve as<br>
a platform to discuss open problems and future challenges in dealing<br>
with existing and upcoming systems-level code.</p>
<p>Topics include, but are not restricted to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model checking</li>
<li>Automated and interactive theorem proving</li>
<li>Static analysis and type systems</li>
<li>Automated testing</li>
<li>Model-driven development</li>
<li>Concurrency</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Embedded systems development</li>
<li>Programming languages</li>
<li>Verifying compilers</li>
<li>Software certification</li>
<li>Software tools</li>
<li>Experience reports</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions</p>
<p>Submissions must be made electronically through the EasyChair system<br>
until September 28th, 2015. Papers should be up to 10 pages in pdf<br>
format and formatted in EPTCS style [http://info.eptcs.org]. Additional<br>
details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, which will be read<br>
at the discretion of the program committee. All will be subject to peer<br>
review under normal conference standards. Experience reports and papers<br>
on work in progress are welcome as long as there is a clear<br>
contribution. Submissions which are based or discuss a non-trivial piece<br>
of software are required to make all those non-standard software parts<br>
available, which a referee may need, in order to check the claims of the<br>
submission.</p>
<p>Submitted papers must not have previously appeared in a journal or<br>
conference with published proceedings and must not be concurrently<br>
submitted to any other peer-reviewed workshop, symposium, conference or<br>
archival journal. Any partial overlap with any such published or<br>
concurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated.</p>
<p>Proceedings</p>
<p>Proceedings will be published as an issue in Electronic Proceedings in<br>
Theoretical Computer Science.</p>
