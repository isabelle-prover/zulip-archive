<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I summarize my question first.</p>
<p>I have two theorems, SigmaE_is_unique and SigmaE_is_unique2. In the <br>
first, I end up with "u" as a universally quantified bound variable, <br>
because that's how I specified it in the formula. In the second, I end <br>
up with "u" as a schematic variable, because I left it as a free <br>
variable in the formula.</p>
<p>Which of these do I want? This question also applies to my axiom Sigma_exA.</p>
<p>I read this thread, "Free variables vs schematic variables":</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2012-June/msg00048.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2012-June/msg00048.html</a></p>
<p>I've also read this email, which is an aside:</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2012-June/msg00172.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2012-June/msg00172.html</a></p>
<p>The context of that thread was meta-logic, so when Makarius says, <br>
"Outermost quantifiers are circumvented... there is an explicit core <br>
inference that removes the quantifiers and expresses the generality in <br>
terms of schematic variables", I conclude that he's talking about the <br>
\&lt;And&gt; quantifier. This is because I don't see any removal of \&lt;forall&gt;.</p>
<p>I do notice in proof steps and theorem results, that Isabelle may <br>
rearrange a \&lt;forall&gt; in a formula, such as taking  a \&lt;forall&gt; to the <br>
outside of some parentheses. That's fine with me.</p>
<p>Here, I use my limited knowledge to determine the difference in my two <br>
theorems mentioned above. If all the variables in the theorem are bound, <br>
then the formula in the theorem will simply be used as a fact.</p>
<p>If there are schematic variables in the theorem, then schematic <br>
variables will first be instantiated, and the instantiated formula of <br>
the theorem will be used as a fact.</p>
<p>I don't know why I need variables  to be instantiated to make it more <br>
general, or whether I don't want variables to be instantiated so that <br>
it's tighter.</p>
<p>This also applies to my axiom Sigma_exA. I can strip out all the <br>
universal quantifiers, and everything still works, but I end up with <br>
schematic variables being used, as shown by "thm show_info2", although <br>
it may be the proof step of show_info2 that's really a true reflection <br>
of Sigma_EeA, in which the variables are still free.</p>
<p>I attached the theory, where some names above are rough translations.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
This reply to my email is a basic logic fix, in case it matters to someone.</p>
<p>For my equality axiom, I was using something like this:</p>
<p>(1) "!u. !v. !x. ((x &lt;\in&gt; u &lt;-&gt; x &lt;\in&gt; v) --&gt; u=v)",</p>
<p>with a corresponding theorem like this:</p>
<p>(2) "!u. !x. (~(x \&lt;in&gt; u)  --&gt;  u = Sigma_E)".</p>
<p>The textbook formula came to my mind, so I changed the axiom to:</p>
<p>(3) "!u. !v. ((!x.(x \&lt;in&gt; u &lt;-&gt; x \&lt;in&gt; v)) --&gt; u=v)".</p>
<p>Which then required a corresponding change to my theorem to not get an <br>
error:</p>
<p>(4) "!u. ((!x. ~(x \&lt;in&gt; u))  --&gt;  u = Sigma_E)".</p>
<p>My questions about schematic vs. universal bound variables stay the same.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

I think you should state the theorem without the \&lt;forall&gt;, because it makes it easier to use the theorem later on. For instance, you can say </p>
<blockquote>
<p>... using SigmaE_is_unique[of "foo"]...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to obtain SigmaE_is_unique in the case when u is foo. You can't do this so easily when you have the \&lt;forall&gt; there.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
John,</p>
<p>That sounds like it could be the biggest reason. I was only thinking <br>
about schematic variables being instantiated automatically. The idea of <br>
calling theorems like in a programming language hasn't occurred to me, <br>
until now.</p>
<p>So, I guess I want a schematic variable in a theorem when I know I'm <br>
going to want to instantiate it manually. However, I now have the <br>
question of whether automatic proof methods need the schematic variables <br>
so that they can instantiate them.</p>
<p>It's my healthy paranoia kicking in here. I'm using axioms, so I'm <br>
trying to use everything I know right now to keep from being inconsistent.</p>
<p>Another question I would have for a person is whether I'm protected in <br>
any way by making a variable bound so that it doesn't become a schematic <br>
variable.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>

The best way is not to use axioms then.  In mathematics you define new <br>
things by using old ones, and then prove the desired properties. <br>
Sometimes you work with abstract theories, but that corresponds to a <br>
locale or class definition in Isabelle/HOL, not axiomatization.</p>

I'll try to make a short sales speech here to spin the pro-axiom side of <br>
things.</p>
<p>Suppose there are 10 standard axioms for a language of FOL that have <br>
held up for many years. Then there's no more risk in using those axioms <br>
than there's ever been.</p>
<p>Suppose a person implements those axioms on top of Isabelle/HOL with a <br>
slight modification, and others build a lot of standard math on top of <br>
those axioms, and no inconsistency shows up.</p>
<p>The scenario I just described would be completely beneficial to <br>
Isabelle/HOL as a product. What's done as HOL is just HOL, where HOL is <br>
obviously very useful. But if HOL is used as a meta-language to <br>
implement another standard logic on top of it, in a way that's <br>
reasonably pure, which might require axioms to do, then that's something <br>
different.</p>
<p>I'm interested in certain non-applied math, but with Isabelle I take the <br>
attitude that all math implemented in Isabelle is applied math, with the <br>
application being the attempt to find out how powerful Isabelle is. If <br>
no one successfully uses axioms on top of Isabelle/HOL, then that <br>
potential power of Isabelle/HOL never gets demonstrated.</p>
<p>Church's logic was shown to be inconsistent. The possibility of that <br>
happening is all part of the game.</p>
<p>Giving opinions. That's the easy part.</p>

What you describe is all possible without using axioms (which are <br>
usually just used to initially set up a logic like HOL in Isabelle). <br>
Just use a locale that has all your "axioms" as assumptions and inside <br>
this locale you can work as if you had introduced the axioms. However, <br>
you avoid the risk of anything outside the locale being effected. E.g., <br>
when adding inconsistent axioms to HOL the combination is just <br>
inconsistent (and because of this risk I would not build on any theory <br>
with "unnecessary" axioms). Defining a locale with inconsistent <br>
assumptions just means that the locale itself is useless but does not <br>
effect the whole logic.</p>
<p>The bottom line: avoid using axioms (as long as you are not setting up a <br>
new object logic for Isabelle).</p>

<p>If you use HOL to reason about another logic, you will <em>define</em> (not <br>

<p>Christian, I'd be more than happy to take a disciplined approached, but <br>
how is it possible for a beginner to take a disciplined approach and <br>
develop what normally should be developed by an advanced user? It's not.</p>
<p>However, I don't want anyone to consider me as complaining about <br>
Isabelle, because I've ceased to have any complaints about it. There are <br>
no problems with Isabelle. There are only workarounds, and I can't think <br>
of any significant workaround that I'm having to resort to yet.</p>
<p>I'm also more than happy to be told two things by experts: that a <br>
certain thing has been proved to be wrong or impossible, or that a <br>
particular way is the right way to do something.</p>
<p>You tell me locales is what I want, and I listen to you, and I make it <br>
my goal to learn how to use locales in place of axioms. But I search on <br>
"locale" in prog-prove.pdf and in tutorial.pdf and it doesn't show up. I <br>
open up locales.pdf, which is 20 pages long, and I briefly look at it. I <br>
conclude, locales is m number of months down the road.</p>
<p>You say, "Don't use the GOTO statement." I say, "Okay, then be my <br>
personal tutor, and give me what will take me months to learn on my <br>
own." You say, "I'm a busy person, and everyone has to largely learn <br>
this on their own." I say, "I understand that, but I'm going to use the <br>
GOTO statement until I learn a better way."</p>
<p>I go on at length below, but I take your advice. If you hadn't told me <br>
explicitly that locales is what I really want, then I wouldn't know <br>
today that locales is the goal I'm supposed to shoot for.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Now we're in the territory that what's important to two different people <br>
doesn't necessarily intersect.</p>
<p>You care that your theories don't make Isabelle/HOL inconsistent, and I <br>
want you to care about that because I would hate for you to give me a <br>
HOL product that would allow me to prove everything.</p>
<p>Today, right now, I only care about a particular language of FOL that I <br>
want to "put on top" of HOL with some minimal number of HOL functions <br>
that are required to make it practical.</p>
<p>If I introduce inconsistency (not because of combining HOL axioms with <br>
mine), what difference does it make if I mess up a locale or all of <br>
Isabelle/HOL? I'm not bummed that I messed up HOL. I'm bummed that my <br>
axioms didn't work out.</p>
<p>In fact, it's possible that the best way for me to look for flawed logic <br>
fast is to use axioms, where "fast" is a synonym for Sledgehammer and <br>
Nitpick. I wait to say more about that below.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose there are 10 standard axioms for a language of FOL that have<br>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Right, but combining those axioms with others (say those of HOL) is a risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That idea has occurred to me some. The m number of HOL axioms haven't <br>
been shown to be inconsistent, and my desired 10 axioms haven't been <br>
shown to be inconsistent. I talk about FOL on top of HOL, but I know <br>
that it's really a logic 10 + m axioms, so the question becomes, "Has <br>
anyone proved that the 10 + m axioms together are inconsistent?"</p>
<p>If you tell me the answer is yes, then I listen to you because you have <br>
good credentials. If you tell me, "I don't even know what your 10 <br>
specific axioms are", then I say, "He didn't say yes, the 10 + m axioms <br>
are inconsistent, so I'll take that as meaning no one knows".</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Okay, but it seems to me there's a meta-something in there. HOL is the <br>
language that I use to implement another language, and I hide as much as <br>
possible that HOL is the primary foundation. If nobody imports my theory <br>
with the additional axioms, then the standard Isabelle/HOL distribution <br>
is completely unchanged.</p>
<p>Larry set up Pure so that it's the meta-logic that's used to create the <br>
object-logic HOL. HOL uses axioms. If HOL is built on Pure with axioms, <br>
then why shouldn't I add axioms to HOL to get what I want?</p>
<p>Well, I shouldn't; that's what we're discussing. But now we're back into <br>
end goals and purpose. For your purposes, no axiom should ever be added <br>
to HOL. For my purposes, there is a seed that's been planted which gives <br>
me the thought that I may want axioms in spite of being able to use <br>
locales for the same purpose.</p>
<p>If an expert gives me the right information, I stop thinking that way.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, if I give Sledgehammer a theorem that's only <br>
HOL, and HOL is consistent, then Sledgehammer can only prove that the <br>
theorem is true or that its negation is false. But if I give <br>
Sledgehammer a theorem that's built on axioms, and my axioms are time <br>
tested axioms, but yet they are inconsistent, but yet not because of <br>
their combination with the HOL axioms, then Sledgehammer will try all <br>
sorts of unnatural combinations that a human would never try, with the <br>
possible result that both the theorem and its negation is proved true.</p>
<p>Similarly, Nitpick might prove both the theorem and its negation false. <br>
Now, because at least one of the axioms is "polluted" with a little bit <br>
of HOL, then I have to work really hard to show that the inconsistency <br>
is not because of that, but I might want that challenge.</p>
<p>I've already learned things that I wouldn't have learned if I wouldn't <br>
have been using axioms.</p>
<p>Here, I point out that anything I've said above could be totally flawed. <br>
However, good things can come out of clueless people using software in <br>
unorthodox ways that initially appall the developers.</p>

<p>If you use HOL to reason about another logic, you will <em>define</em> (not<br>
axiomatize) the formulas of this logic as HOL-type and also define its<br>
semantics by HOL-functions. In that way you can talk <em>about</em> the other<br>
logic <em>in</em> HOL.</p>
<p>just my 2 cents,</p>
<p>chris</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so your 2 cents is very valuable due to the exchange rate between my <br>
economy of the beginner and your economy of the expert.</p>
<p>Let's say that due to the weakness of my beginner's economy, 2 cents in <br>
your economy of the expert is worth at least $150 in my economy. I make <br>
that estimate because I figure you could charge $150 an hour working in <br>
U.S. industry as a consultant, maybe more or maybe less, not that a <br>
price can really be put on the value of information provided by an <br>
expert, because it generally takes a person years to obtain expert <br>
knowledge.</p>
<p>So now, you talk about not merely "using a logic" but "reasoning about a <br>
logic". You should understand that a formal, mathematics education <br>
generally only gives a person the bare minimum to "use a logic".</p>
<p>DeMorgan's laws, the equivalence (A --&gt; B)==(~A \/ B), how to negate <br>
statements with quantifiers, proof by induction, proof by contradiction <br>
and little bit more is about all you're taught and all you need to do <br>
typical math. The math gets complicated, but the logic never does, so I <br>
think "reasoning about logic" will be m+n number of months down the road <br>
for me. But I set "reasoning about another logic" as another goal to <br>
achieve based on your advice.</p>

<p>Okay, but it seems to me there's a meta-something in there. HOL is the<br>
language that I use to implement another language, and I hide as much as<br>
possible that HOL is the primary foundation.<br>
Not exactly, you do not implement your 10 axioms <em>in</em> HOL when using <br>

<p>Larry set up Pure so that it's the meta-logic that's used to create the<br>

My feeling is that Pure vs. HOL is a different story from your HOL vs. <br>
10 axioms (but I might be wrong). Pure is the logical framework of <br>
Isabelle which just provides some infrastructure that is typically <br>
needed in interactive theorem provers for many specific logics (like <br>
unification, natural deduction, etc.). In a sense, Pure is "built-in". <br>
For a specific logic (like FOL, HOL, etc.) we give the basic axioms once <br>
and than work on top of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you extend HOL by + 10 axioms I don't see why you could just use <br>
your 10 axioms as the basis for a different logic (but again, I don't <br>
even know your specific axioms). Maybe it would help if you could <br>
describe precisely (and preferably compactly) what it is that you want <br>
to achieve.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make a long story short, if I give Sledgehammer a theorem that's only<br>
HOL, and HOL is consistent, then Sledgehammer can only prove that the<br>
theorem is true or that its negation is false. But if I give<br>
Sledgehammer a theorem that's built on axioms, and my axioms are time<br>
tested axioms, but yet they are inconsistent, but yet not because of<br>
their combination with the HOL axioms, then Sledgehammer will try all<br>
sorts of unnatural combinations that a human would never try, with the<br>
possible result that both the theorem and its negation is proved true.</p>
<p>Similarly, Nitpick might prove both the theorem and its negation false.<br>
Now, because at least one of the axioms is "polluted" with a little bit<br>
of HOL, then I have to work really hard to show that the inconsistency<br>
is not because of that, but I might want that challenge.<br>
You said it yourself "the possible result". Your approach looks like <br>
testing to me. You might find a problem, however if you don't, you <br>
haven't learned anything new.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you use HOL to reason about another logic, you will <em>define</em> (not<br>

Personally, I think there is nothing wrong with asserting some axioms as the foundation of a brand-new development. If they are inconsistent, your work is worthless, but if they are the sole basis of your work, putting them in a locale wouldn't change things even a little bit.</p>
<p>If you already have a sound and working development, that's a different situation altogether. Then it would make sense to encapsulate the axioms.</p>

It helps to know that you don't think it's total loser idea, and "sole <br>
basis" would capture what I care about at this point in time. <br>
Hypothetically, in the future I'll want to be messing around with <br>
concrete numbers, so I certainly wouldn't want to be using a theory with <br>
an axiom which might mess up HOL's binary and decimal number systems.</p>
<p>I try to keep confessions and overflowing praise to a minimum on the <br>
list, but other theorem provers don't even allow axioms to be a point of <br>
contention, because it's set in stone what axioms we can used. Your Pure <br>
setup captures the reality of the freedom that logic gives us, which is <br>
our ability to start with any set of axioms and undefined terms we want, <br>
and see where they lead us.</p>
<p>Also, I've known about Isabelle/ZF and Steven Obua's HOLZF.thy, so I <br>
haven't felt completely free to talk about what it is I'm trying to do <br>
(where doing it is, of course, the hard part; concepts only get me so far).</p>
<p>I did look at Isabelle/ZF some. I didn't understand anything but the <br>
buzz words, but it is where I got the idea that I need 2 and only 2 <br>
types, which are your "i" and "o". It seems like that should be obvious, <br>
but if I didn't get the idea until I looked at Isabelle/ZF, it must not <br>
be accurate to describe it as an obvious idea.</p>
<p>I just now opened Obua's HOLZF.thy, but I closed it real quick. I know <br>
enough now to recognize a little of what he's doing, and I don't want to <br>
see his way right now. I did see axiomatization in it. After about 9 <br>
months, due to this discussion about axioms, I now have an answer as to <br>
why HOLZF is not allowed to be a part of what's imported with "imports <br>
Main".</p>

<p>The terms "meta-language" and "object-language" are fairly imprecise <br>
terms. I'm a generalist, so I've been trying to use those terms instead <br>
of Larry's "meta-logic" and "object-logic". I think I could justify how <br>
I've been using them.</p>
<p>However, you've clarified and made clear to me two important concepts, <br>
which are:</p>
<p>1) extending a logic vs. using it to define a higher-level language,  and<br>
2) reasoning about a logic vs. using a logic.</p>
<p>I know that I'm extending HOL, especially now, but I still want "meta". <br>
Alright, so I try to use "meta" and conform to a reasonable dictionary <br>
meaning. I take the definition of meta- to be "outside of".</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta</a></p>
<p>Is HOL a usable logic? Yes. Are my FOLZFS axioms a usable logic? No. I <br>
need HOL to implement them in a concrete way. So HOL+FOLZFS becomes the <br>
logic, and though both HOL and FOLZFS are inside the logic, the most <br>
important point is that HOL is outside of FOLZFS.</p>
<p>In fact, I say that FOL is embedded in HOL, and because my FOLZFS is <br>
almost exclusively made of FOL formulas, where the rest is made up of <br>
HOL functions, and where every FOL logical symbol is implemented as a <br>
HOL function, can I not think of, for my own purposes, FOLZFS as "on top <br>
of" HOL?</p>
<p>Here, feel free to throw away what you don't want in the above paragraph.</p>
<p>I continue below.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I'm no expert on Pure, but the many papers about Isabelle's meta-logic <br>
emphasize primarily that Pure gives us a minimal logic of \&lt;And&gt;, "==&gt;", <br>
and "==".</p>
<p>By default, with no HOL axioms, we have the three logical operators <br>
above. Would it not be mathematically disciplined to build up all of the <br>
HOL theorems from the logic available from Pure? Are there no theorems <br>
which can be shown to be true with only those three logical operators, <br>
and whatever it is that Pure can prove? So there are theorems that could <br>
be proved, but those three logical operators can only get you so far <br>
without being axiomatically extended. Here, I adopt your phrase above, <br>
"but I might be wrong".</p>
<p>Makarius is basically telling me to build up my theorems only from the <br>
available HOL axioms. It's not that I don't want to, I just don't think <br>
I can ever get my 10 very specific FOL formulas from the m number of HOL <br>
axioms.</p>
<p>I tie into everything this below.</p>

<p>Lots of tangents are getting mixed up here, but yea, part of what I'm <br>

was my script to take a theorem and run 4 different tests on it. When <br>
testing theorems with powerful tools becomes free time-wise, it's <br>
something I want available in my arsenal.</p>
<p>It's like syntax errors. It's not that you can't find them, but you can <br>
work a whole lot faster when the IDE finds the error, takes you to the <br>
code, and highlights the error.</p>

<p>Now I tie back into the first three parts. If you were wrong, that's <br>
fortunate because the two concepts I listed above are important <br>
concepts, especially "extending a logic", where I wasn't even <br>
considering HOL's ability to allow me to reason about another logic. It <br>
turns out that's not what I want at all. No, I need a logic "to use". If <br>
I can't use it, then the best I could do when reasoning about it is to <br>
find out that I can't use it.</p>
<p>As to locales, compartmentalization is a good thing that I want at my <br>
disposal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I try to finish answering your question, "What exactly are you <br>
describing here?"</p>
<p>First, there's the general concept that you take an old, existing <br>
language, and you use it to implement another language.</p>
<p>For example, you take assembly language, and you create C. You take <br>
Pure, and you create Isabelle/HOL or Isabelle/FOL.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be tied into logic. We can take English, and teach <br>
someone Chinese. We find a primitive tribe, and we use the Latin <br>
alphabet and English morphemes to create a written language for the tribe.</p>
<p>There's the meta-language that we have to use, and the object-language <br>
which we cannot create or get access to without the use of the <br>
meta-language, at least in the formative stages.</p>
<p>Whether extending HOL with axioms to get FOLZFS, or coming up with a <br>
novel solution to get the same "model" without any new axioms, HOL is <br>
absolutely essential as the underlying language of logic (having <br>
chosen), and I find it hard not to call HOL the meta-language for both <br>
scenarios.</p>
<p>As to whether I'm misusing vocabulary and language, I'll let you decide, <br>
though I might not agree with your decision.</p>
<p>RUNNING OUT OF STEAM</p>
<p>I've suddenly run out of steam to go into great detail about my <br>
formative ideas of FOLZFS on top of HOL, so I just make a few comments. <br>
If you want info, just ask.</p>
<p>HOL gives me a form of sets, but these sets cannot be used in the same <br>
way ZF sets can be used. I make no moral judgements about that. The <br>
application at hand is merely to explore what is achievable by either <br>
extending HOL with axioms to get FOLZFS or find that elusive novel <br>
solution without using axioms. The axiomatic approach is possibly more <br>
of a no-brainer algorithm. See FOL formula in textbook? Put FOL formula <br>
in Isabelle. Go back to "see FOL" step.</p>
<p>There are 9 axioms and 1 axiom scheme. I say above that "FOL is embedded <br>
in HOL", so my assumption is that if I used 100% FOL formulas with <br>
Isabelle/HOL, then I'm 100% safe.</p>
<p>Without having gone down the road very far, I replace the axiom scheme <br>
with one axiom in which I quantify over "sT =&gt; sT =&gt; bool". One thing <br>
leads to another. If it doesn't work, I try to figure out why, which <br>
will require me to learn something. If I can't figure it out, I go onto <br>
something more productive, and keep that in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>After reading my email over, I remembered some more reasons why I want <br>
HOL. I had deleted the following part of your reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you extend HOL by + 10 axioms I don't see why you could just use <br>
your 10 axioms<br>
as the basis for a different logic (but again, I don't even know your <br>
specific axioms). Maybe<br>
it would help if you could describe precisely (and preferably <br>
compactly) what it is that you<br>
want to achieve.</p>

<p>1) Because nobody will care about my FOLZFS as a standalone logic, but <br>
they might care about it if it's riding on the coattails of <br>
