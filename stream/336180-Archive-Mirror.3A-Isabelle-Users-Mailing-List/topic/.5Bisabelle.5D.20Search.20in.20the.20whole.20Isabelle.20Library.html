<p>From: grechukbogdan &lt;<a href="mailto:grechukbogdan@yandex.ru">grechukbogdan@yandex.ru</a>&gt;<br>
Dear members of Isabelle group</p>
<p>During my trip to Munich, we had an interesting discussion about  search in the Isabelle Library. My point was that I would like to have a search in the whole library (not only imported theories), and we discussed some (complicated) ways for realization. I am thinking whether the following  observation could simplify the situation.</p>
<p>The naive way to use the current search facility in Isabelle to do global search would be to try to import  everything. This, however, does not work directly: for example, if I try to write “imports Library”  and than type lemma “(A :: real set)&lt;B” I have an error, because “B” is reserved for something else. Moreover, even symbol “&lt;” can have different meaning in different places of the library. In other words, Isabelle cannot parse (understand)  mathematical expressions in this case.</p>
<p>As I understand, any search can be divided by two steps. First one is parsing, understanding the search string typed by a user. Second – search for relevant lemmas in the Library. Now, I would imagine the following simple search algorithm. </p>
<p>1) At the level of parsing, look at the imported theories only, as it is now. For example, string  like “(A :: real set)&lt;B” should be correctly understood,  that “user wants to find lemmas where one set of real numbers is a subset of another one”. <br>
2) Next, do the search in such a way as if  the whole Library would be imported.  Now:</p>
<ul>
<li>If in some theory there is a lemma containing “A&lt;B” where A and B are real sets, and “&lt;” means “be a subset”, it will be founded.</li>
<li>If in some theory there is a lemma looking like “A&lt;B”, but with “&lt;” having completely different meaning, it will not be founded, because “user wants to find lemmas where one set of real numbers is a subset of another one”.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I understand, this is just a modification of the current search facility, and should be easier to implement that what we were discussing. Moreover, I would like “auto solve” to work in a similar way – UNDERSTAND the lemma based on imported theories only, but then look in the whole library if exactly such a lemma is already proved. Are there any principal problems with this? </p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Bogdan</p>

A feature I would like to see in Isabelle would be an "import<br>
qualified" option, like Haskell has.</p>
<p>The idea is that you could go ahead and say "import qualified Library"<br>
at the top of your theory file, and it would bring all of the theorems<br>
from that theory into scope (and make them available for<br>
find-theorems, auto-solve, etc.) but it would not bring any more<br>
unqualified constant names into scope, or import any notations or<br>
other syntax. Any constants imported in this way could only be<br>
referred to by their fully-qualified names, as if they had been hidden<br>
by the "hide_const (open)" command. The point is that a qualified<br>
import should not affect the parsing of terms in your theory in any<br>
way.</p>
<p>I think such a feature would let you do all the kinds of theorem<br>
searching you want to do, plus it would be useful in lots of other<br>
situations, too.</p>
<p>Maybe some of the other developers could comment on how difficult this<br>
might be to implement.</p>

<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:Thomas.Sewell@nicta.com.au">Thomas.Sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
One of the things we found useful on the L4.verified project is the <br>
isabelle wwwfind tool, which starts a web server that responds to <br>
find-theorem requests.</p>
<p>It doesn't do anything more than the usual find theorems, but it means <br>
you can have a search context which is wider than your current context <br>
without having to keep two emacses on your desktop. We had an obvious <br>
candidate for the all-the-world image to use, which may not be so <br>
obvious in anyone else's project.</p>
<p>It was also handy on our project to have the server tracking the most <br>
recent stable version, since at any time the all-the-world image was <br>
likely to be broken.</p>
<p>This doesn't solve the problem you're interested in, which is parsing <br>
the search arguments in the current context and then searching in a <br>
wider context. I suspect the tool you want might not be difficult at all <br>
to write - just apply the parser of the existing theorem searcher, code <br>
the patterns again using their long names ("_ &lt; _" becomes <br>
"HOL.ord_class_less _ _") and send that to the web server.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

This is a recurrent theme on isabelle-users or isabelle-dev for several <br>
years already.  It is indeed difficult, but we are moving towards more or <br>
less exactly that for some years, getting closer after each round of <br>
reforms and cleaning up legacy features that are in the way.</p>
<p>It will work via the advanced infrastructure of local theories (and global <br>
specifications will be a special case).  Most likely, this means that once <br>
the infrastructure is up and running, packages that are not "localized" <br>
would still emit their global declarations.</p>
