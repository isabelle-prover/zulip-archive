Second CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>Special issue on Programming Languages and Mechanized Mathematics Systems</p>
<p>Journal of Automated Reasoning</p>
<p>[See HTML version at <a href="http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~carette/jplmms/cfp.html">http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~carette/jplmms/cfp.html</a> ]</p>
<p>Context</p>
<p>This special issue is focused on the intersection of programming<br>
   languages (PL) and mechanized mathematics systems (MMS). The latter<br>
   category subsumes present-day computer algebra systems (CAS),<br>
   interactive proof assistants (PA), and automated theorem provers (ATP),<br>
   all heading towards fully integrated mechanized mathematical assistants<br>
   that are expected to emerge eventually.</p>
<p>The two subjects of PL and MMS meet in many interesting ways, in<br>
   particular in the following main topics of this journal issue.</p>
<p>* Dedicated input languages for MMS: covers all aspects of languages<br>
       intended for the user to deploy or extend the system, both<br>
       algorithmic and declarative ones. Typical examples are tactic<br>
       definition languages such as Ltac in Coq, mathematical proof<br>
       languages as in Mizar or Isar, or specialized programming languages<br>
       built into CA systems. Of particular interest are the semantics of<br>
       those languages, especially when current ones are untyped.</p>
<p>* Mathematical modeling languages used for programming: covers the<br>
       relation of logical descriptions vs. algorithmic content. For<br>
       instance the logic of ACL2 extends a version of Lisp, that of Coq<br>
       is close to Haskell, and some portions of HOL are similar to ML and<br>
       Haskell, while Maple tries to do both simultaneously. Such<br>
       mathematical languages offer rich specification capabilities, which<br>
       are rarely available in regular programming languages. How can<br>
       programming benefit from mathematical concepts, without limiting<br>
       mathematics to the computational worldview?</p>
<p>* Programming languages with mathematical specifications: covers<br>
       advanced "mathematical" concepts in programming languages that<br>
       improve the expressive power of functional specifications, type<br>
       systems, module systems etc. Programming languages with dependent<br>
       types are of particular interest here, as is intensionality vs<br>
       extensionality.</p>
<p>* Language elements for program verification: covers specific means<br>
       built into a language to facilitate correctness proofs using MMS.<br>
       For example, logical annotations within programs may be turned into<br>
       verification conditions to be solved in a proof assistant<br>
       eventually. How need MMS and PL to be improved to make this work<br>
       conveniently and in a mathematically appealing way?</p>
<p>These topics have been addressed in the PLMMS 2007<br>
<a href="http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/plmms07/">http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/plmms07/</a> and PLMMS 2008<br>
<a href="http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/workshops/plmms/">http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/workshops/plmms/</a> workshops<br>
   (associated with Calculemus <a href="http://www.calculemus.net/">http://www.calculemus.net/</a>). While the<br>
   journal issue emerges from that community, submission is open to<br>
   everyone interested in any of these topics!</p>
<p>Submission</p>
<p>Manuscripts should not have been previously published in archival<br>
   journals nor have been submitted to, or be in consideration for, any<br>
   journal or conference. Significantly revised and enhanced papers<br>
   published in workshop or conference proceedings are welcome. All<br>
   submissions will be reviewed according to scholarly standards for<br>
   scientific journal publications. See also the general JAR submission<br>
   policies.</p>
<p>We suggest a page limit of approximately 25 pages, using the LaTeX<br>
   macros ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/svjour3/global/<br>
   provided by Springer. Instead of using the Springer online<br>
   submission system, please submit papers in PDF through EasyChair<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jplmms2008">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jplmms2008</a></p>
<p>Important dates</p>
<p>* Submission deadline: 10th November 2008.<br>
     * Notification: January 16th 2009.<br>
     * Final versions: March 30th 2009.</p>
<p>Editors of the special issue</p>
<p>* Jacques Carette (McMaster University, Canada)<br>
     * Makarius Wenzel (Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Germany)<br>
     * Freek Wiedijk   (Radboud University Nijmegen, Netherlands)</p>
