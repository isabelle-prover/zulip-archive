<p>From: Ferdinand Vesely &lt;<a href="mailto:csfvesely@swansea.ac.uk">csfvesely@swansea.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Dear mailing list,</p>
<p>I'm trying to develop a theory using modular records built from smaller<br>
records in an arbitrary way. That is, I don't want to have to commit to<br>
the order right at the beginning by using the "+" notation for<br>
extending records. This seems to be partly achievable but has<br>
limitations in that, e.g., selectors are not applicable. For example, I<br>
define the component records:</p>
<p>record out = out :: string<br>
  record env = env :: "(string * val) list"</p>
<p>I can then define operations on these smaller records that carry over<br>
to the bigger ones, e.g. a notion of composition:</p>
<p>class composable = <br>
    fixes compose :: "'a =&gt; 'a =&gt; 'a" (infix ";;" 60)</p>
<p>instantiation unit :: composable<br>
  begin<br>
    definition compose_unit_def:<br>
      "u1 ;; u2 = ()"<br>
  ...</p>
<p>instantiation out_ext :: (composable) composable<br>
  begin<br>
  definition compose_out_def: <br>
    "r1 ;; r2 = <br>
     (| out = (out r1) @ (out r2), ... = (out.more r1) ;; (out.more<br>
  r2)  |)"<br>
  ...</p>
<p>instantiation env_ext :: (composable) composable<br>
  begin<br>
    definition compose_env_def:<br>
      "r1 ;; r2 = ( <br>
        if (env r1 = env r2) then<br>
          (| env = env r2, ... |) = (env.more r1) ;; (env.more r2) |)<br>
        else undefined)"<br>
   ...</p>
<p>Now I can have values of combined record types ("env out_ext" or "out<br>
env_ext"), e.g.</p>
<p>value "(| out = ''abc'', env = [ (''x'', v) ] |)"</p>
<p>I can apply the overloaded operations to such values:</p>
<p>value "(| env = [ (''x'', v) ], out = ''abc'' |) ;;<br>
         ;; (| env = [ (''x'', v) ], out = ''def'' |)"</p>
<p>and I can also select the first element:</p>
<p>value "out (| out = ''abc'', env = [ (''x'', v) ] |)"</p>
<p>However, since the selector for, e.g., env is only defined on "'a<br>
env_scheme", I cannot apply it if env is not the first element in the<br>
record:</p>
<p>value "env (| out = ''abc'', env = [ (''x'', v) ] |)"</p>
<p>Is there a way to select any element from such mix-and-match records?</p>
<p>If this is currently not possible, is there an inherent limitation in<br>
the underlying ML implementation of records? I've had a brief look at<br>
"HOL/Tools/record.ML" but didn't have much time to dive into it yet.</p>
<p>It is possible to define an overloaded selector using via type classes<br>
(see attached theory), but this seems too much work.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I think it would also be interesting to have a more<br>
general record definition construct, such as:</p>
<p>record out = ...<br>
  record env = ...<br>
  record big_record = out + env + ...</p>
<p>which would have the effect of:</p>
<p>record out = ...<br>
  record env = out + ...<br>
  record big_record = env + ...</p>
<p>My example theory is attached.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Ferdinand<br>

Hello Ferdinand.</p>
<p>You have an interesting idea there. I have to warn you that interesting<br>
ideas to improve the record package come up from time to time, and are<br>
usually resolved to be too much work.</p>
<p>It would be possible to use class-based polymorphism to allow all<br>
accessors and updators to apply to all relevant record constructions no<br>
matter what order they were constructed in. That would complicate the<br>
formal definitions quite a bit, and the record package is already quite<br>
complicated. There would also remain the fundamental limit that records<br>
can only be constructed as a linear composition of record extensions,<br>
whereas I think some users would like to be able to merge a binary pair<br>
of record environments.</p>
<p>It might be of interest to you to point out that Norbert Schirmer fought<br>
with these restrictions a while ago, and came up with an approach in<br>
which the record type, updators and accessors are simply introduced in a<br>
locale. The locales can then be combined in any manner desired. The<br>
final obligation (left until the proof is complete and assembled) is to<br>
show that the hypothesised super-record, updators and accessors exists.<br>
This only needs to be done once.</p>
<p>I think that the code in the Isabelle repo in "src/HOL/Statespace/"<br>
implements this, but I might be confused about that.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.</p>
