<p>From: Ian Hayes &lt;<a href="mailto:Ian.Hayes@uq.edu.au">Ian.Hayes@uq.edu.au</a>&gt;<br>
The position is part of a new initiative in verified software supported <br>
by generous funding from Oracle. Initially, this will involve playing a <br>
leading role in research on verifying optimization passes of compilers. <br>
For the first three years, the position will have half the standard <br>
teaching duties allowing a greater focus on research and support for two <br>
PhD student scholarships and travel for research collaboration.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this positions is to engage in teaching and <br>
research activities in Software Engineering, and play a pivotal role in <br>
developing software verification technology in the context of <br>
programming language implementation and to contribute to teaching, in <br>
Software Engineering and other related areas, course coordination and <br>
student supervision.</p>
<p>This position is located at our picturesque St Lucia campus, renowned as <br>
one of Australia’s most attractive university campuses, and located just <br>
7km from Brisbane’s city centre. Bounded by the Brisbane River on three <br>
sides, and with outstanding public transport connections, our <br>
114-hectare site provides a perfect work environment – you can enjoy the <br>
best of both worlds: a vibrant campus with the tradition of an <br>
established university.</p>
<p><em>Our Ideal Candidate</em></p>
<p>You should possess a PhD in Computer Science or Software Engineering, or <br>
a related field. You should have significant experience and a successful <br>
record of research achievements in areas including compilers, in <br>
particular, their optimization techniques, program analysis, semantics <br>
of programming languages, formal verification methods in programming, <br>
and the semantics of programming languages.</p>
<p>You should also possess a demonstrable capacity for teaching at both the <br>
undergraduate and postgraduate level, experience in postgraduate <br>
supervision and experience liaising with industry and external partners.</p>
<p>We value diversity and inclusion, and actively encourage applications <br>
from those who bring diversity to the University. Our Diversity and <br>
Inclusion webpage <br>
