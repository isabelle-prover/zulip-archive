<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Greetings,</p>
<p>As a formality, I state that I prefer no feedback, not that anyone wants <br>
to give it, but if given feedback, I'll not respond to it, a suboptimal <br>
formality, but necessary. That others might discuss what I report, I <br>
don't concern myself with that.</p>
<p>This email is to show an example of what I had mentioned, that I can <br>
scroll to the bottom of my THY and no errors show up in the <br>
right-vertical-status-bar, but there are errors in my THY.</p>
<p>Before I was doing periodic session runs, this was a huge source of <br>
consternation. Now that I'm doing sessions runs, it's not a problem at <br>
all, it's a part of finding problems with the normal workflow.</p>
<p>I wouldn't report this, but I don't recall seeing a report about this.</p>
<p>(1) Below, I describe the circumstances surrounding the error, and to <br>
support that, I attach a screenshot.</p>
<p>(2) As a tangent to my talk about defining outer syntax commands, I <br>
state some opinions about the configurability of Isar, as a front-end <br>
language to a powerful logic engine, and front-end to powerful proof <br>
tools, namely Sledgehammer, Nitpick, and the slew of proof methods, <br>
along with the absolute essential ability to perform single proof steps <br>
with natural deduction. But back to the configurability of Isar as a <br>
language,</p>
<p>a) that the configurabilityis a great feature of Isabelle/HOL as a <br>
software product,</p>
<p>b) another feature being the configurability of inner syntax, part of <br>
that being a good selection of graphical symbols,</p>
<p>c) and another feature being a PIDE that allows these features to be <br>
what they are, where from my observations, these front-end features are <br>
near exclusively because of one person, M.Wenzel, with whom I have no <br>
affiliation, formally or informally, and did I forget to mention the <br>
proof language as a front-end feature?</p>
<p>d) There is also the Isar proof language as a front-end feature.</p>
<p>e) Quoting myself from the past, everyone either gets too little <br>
credit, or way too much. You work to blow your horn, and I'll work to <br>
blow mine.</p>
<p>(3) As part of (2), I say that I hope the configurability of <br>
Isar/Isabelle/HOL doesn't get locked down just to try and control the <br>
language. Fragmentation of language is only bad if the fragmentation <br>
destroys good unity or prevents eventual good unity. Locking something <br>
down can prevent innovation, and prevent people experimenting to find <br>
the best way to use a language.</p>
<p><em>DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM</em></p>
<p>What I did was eliminate a custom outer syntax synonym for 'term'. This <br>
resulted in some errors that I was notified about, and I changed those <br>
uses of the eliminated synonym. I then scrolled to the bottom of the <br>
theory, at which time I ran the session command with the very useful <br>
'I.prog'. When I did that, the console notified me of errors.</p>
<p>In the image, it can be seen that the upper part of the <br>
right-vertical-status-bar is light purple. I suppose the light-purple <br>
means that area wasn't rechecked.</p>
<p>As to PIDE options, the only change I remember, concerning this, is <br>
"Editor Reparse Limit 20000", where originally it is '10000'. It seems a <br>
bigger number there would make it better, but it may not matter. Before, <br>
I had it at '100000', and I got these errors, which is why I made an <br>
effort to implement session runs.</p>
<p>It's not a problem. I report it to alert anyone who would care, and so <br>
that M.Wenzel knows, though there's a good chance he already knows about <br>
something like this.</p>
<p><em>ISAR AS A MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE</em></p>
<p>To say much more is to belabor the point of (3) above.</p>
<p>I define any outer syntax I want, to get synonyms for the normal syntax. <br>
Even so, it takes a lot of experimenting to find syntax that actually <br>
adds some value. Part of what I'm trying to achieve is to get a look <br>
similar to mathematical papers published with LaTeX. A big part of that <br>
look is the newtheorem environment.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that when I engage in shameless advertising, M.Wenzel <br>
may not like my configuring the syntax of Isar, and decide to lock the <br>
syntax down.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I assume everyone makes the best possible choices for their <br>
needs, whether personal or corporate, and so I look for independent <br>
solutions, rather than beg for features. It happens to be, I've <br>
discovered that Isabelle has a lot ability to implement solutions with <br>
ML, and did I forget to mention 'Isabelle_System.bash_output', also <br>
provided by M.Wenzel?</p>
<p>Fragmentation of technology can be bad, but it can also be good.</p>
<p>I speak now as the EZProphet. Here's what will happen with the language <br>
and logic of Isabelle/HOL and Isabelle/Isar:</p>
<p>1) The language/syntax will fragment, because when you give people new <br>
tools, they get original and new ideas, some good, but most being bad or <br>
nothing better.</p>
<p>2) After some period of time, there will be consolidation around the <br>
best use of the language/syntax.</p>
<p>3) After that, I don't know. After all, I'm just the EZProphet.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
