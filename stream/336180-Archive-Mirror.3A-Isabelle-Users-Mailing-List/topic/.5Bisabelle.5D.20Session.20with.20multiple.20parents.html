Hi all,</p>
<p>Apologies if this question has already been answered, but I could not<br>
find a nice solution.</p>
<p>Section 3.1 of the Isabelle system manual describes the format<br>
describing a session. The discussion in this section and surrounding<br>
implies that the session hierarchy is a tree and perhaps sessions cannot<br>
have multiple parents. I can construct this relationship by having a<br>
session A with parent B, that also imports a theory from session C. Is<br>
there a nicer way of doing this? Basically I want to write:</p>
<p>session A = B + C + body...</p>
<p>but it seems this is not permissible. Any advice would be greatly<br>
appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Matthew</p>

<p>Yes, the overall hierarchy of sessions is a tree.  The word is mentioned <br>
explicitly on page 19 of the manual, where the form</p>
<p>session A = B + body</p>
<p>is explained.  I see 2 or 3 more occurrences of "tree" in the manual.</p>

<p>Sessions cannot be merged.  Normally you just figure out one main line in <br>
the tree path, and import further theories side-ways by loading the theory <br>
sources again.  (A system of "separate compilation" as available in Coq <br>
would allow such fine-grained merges of precompiled modules, but it has <br>
other performance problems.)</p>
<p>Conceptually, session images are of relatively little importance.  They <br>
are mainly a physical snapshot of a certain situation.  Build and load <br>
times of big applications may be fine-tuned by smart arrangement of <br>
session images -- sometimes it just means to avoid redundant intermediate <br>
images, because these are also synchronization points for parallel proof <br>
processing: one process needs to finish before another can be started.</p>
<p>Just loading everything you need in one big session, e.g. starting from <br>
HOL, might be not as bad as expected.  Historically it was not done by <br>
default due to various technical snags that no longer exist.  E.g. I can <br>
load all of AFP/JinjaThreads comfortably into one big session on my cheap <br>
laptop, starting from HOL-Word, for example.</p>
<p>For AFP as big library the situation is slightly different: certain <br>
session images that are re-used a lot help to speed up the overall build <br>
process.  (The isabelle build tool could be smarter to make such <br>
arrangements automatically.)</p>
