<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>Recently I started working on a small personal project in Isabelle/HOL. The<br>
work evolved from several posts on Stack Overflow and another independent<br>
project on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/AresEkb/Simple_OCL">https://github.com/AresEkb/Simple_OCL</a>). The<br>
aforementioned posts on Stack Overflow are presented in the enumerated list<br>
below:</p>
<p>1. What kind of functions preserve properties of closure?<br>
   &lt;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52565266/what-kind-of-functions-preserve-properties-of-closure/">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52565266/what-kind-of-functions-preserve-properties-of-closure/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>2. How to lift a transitive relation from elements to lists?<br>
   &lt;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52962519/how-to-lift-a-transitive-relation-from-elements-to-lists/">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52962519/how-to-lift-a-transitive-relation-from-elements-to-lists/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>3. How to lift a transitive relation to finite maps?<br>
   &lt;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53580515/how-to-lift-a-transitive-relation-to-finite-maps/">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53580515/how-to-lift-a-transitive-relation-to-finite-maps/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>However, a significant part of the content of the project is not directly<br>
related to the aforementioned posts and the aforementioned repository. The<br>
development of the project (HOL-DS_Ext) that I would like to discuss in<br>
this email is being done in the context of a GitHub repository<br>
&lt;<a href="https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-DS_Ext">https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-DS_Ext</a>&gt; that can be found at<br>
<a href="https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-DS_Ext">https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-DS_Ext</a>.</p>
<p>A description of the project is provided on the front page of the<br>
repository. However, I also provide a brief summary in the form of an<br>
enumerated list below. The main contributions are related to the type<br>
alist from<br>
the theory HOL-Library.DAList and the theory HOL-Library.AList. However,<br>
hopefully, the project contains other useful results.</p>
<p>1. It is indicated with the relevant FIXME comments in the theory<br>
   HOL-Library.DAList that the theory does not provide many results for the<br>
   type alist that already exist in the standard library for the type list.<br>
   The project that I am working on addresses this issue and transfers many<br>
   results about the type list to the type alist.</p>
<p>2. The project makes an attempt to integrate the theories<br>
   HOL-Library.AList and HOL-Library.Permutation by providing congruence rules<br>
   for many functions that are defined in the theory HOL-Library.AList under<br>
   certain mild conditions. Furthermore, the project includes a theory of<br>
   permutation for the type alist.</p>
<p>3. A new type that can be shown to be isomorphic to the type fmap is<br>
   defined as a quotient type of the type alist. This type provides an easy<br>
   way of transferring the results from the type list to the type fmap through<br>
   the results about the type alist. Some of the relevant transfer rules are<br>
   provided and applied to several results about the type list (e.g. the<br>
   induction rule list_all2_induct).</p>
<p>I would like to discuss the project briefly with the Isabelle/HOL community:</p>
<p>1. The subject of the project is closely related to the theories that<br>
   already exist in the standard library of Isabelle. In fact, I believe, the<br>
   project could be seen as a natural extension of the existing theories List,<br>
   HOL-Library.Permutation, HOL-Library.AList, HOL-Library.DAList and<br>
   HOL-Library.FMap. Given that the subject of the aforementioned theories<br>
   falls into the category of general data structures, I can only imagine that<br>
   there would be a substantial amount of interest from many independent<br>
   parties to develop these theories further. I am, somewhat, external to the<br>
   Isabelle/HOL community as a whole (I consider Isabelle/HOL to be a past<br>
   time activity). Thus, I cannot be aware of all ongoing developments outside<br>
   of the official repository. Furthermore, shamefully, I am rediscovering the<br>
   standard library of Isabelle almost every day. Hence, I cannot be entirely<br>
   certain that some of the work that I have done or intend to do in the<br>
   context of this project has not been done or is being done by someone else<br>
   concurrently. Therefore, I would appreciate any comments or advice in<br>
   relation to this matter from the developers of the aforementioned theories<br>
   or anyone else who may be working in this area. In particular, I seek<br>
   answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Have the results that are presented in the repository already been<br>
      formalised somewhere else?</p>
<p>2. Is something similar to the project that is presented in the<br>
      repository already being done in the context of the development of the<br>
      standard library?</p>
<p>3. Is something similar to the project that is presented in the<br>
      repository already being done in the context of the development of an<br>
      independent library on the AFP?</p>
<p>4. Is something similar to the project that is presented in the<br>
      repository already being done by someone privately?</p>
<p>2. If the answers to the questions 1.1-1.4 are "no", then I would also<br>
   like to obtain a preliminary assessment of the relevance of the results<br>
   that I propose in the context of the project. Do you believe that such<br>
   results could make an appropriate subject for an entry in the AFP? If so,<br>
   do you foresee that there could be further interest in adding some of the<br>
   results from the project to the standard library in the future? When/if<br>
   answering these questions please note that the project is still in the<br>
   early stages of the development: many sections are incomplete and some of<br>
   the proofs are of substandard quality (these issues would be addressed and<br>
   further results would be added before making an attempt to submit the<br>
   repository to the AFP).</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

Hi Xanonec,</p>
<p>I am not the right person to answer all yours questions. I just would like<br>
to remark that there is an interesting approach to List and Permuation<br>
using homotopy type theory due to Vladimir Voevodsky. I provide you the<br>
references in Coq:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/UniMath/Combinatorics/Lists.v">https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/UniMath/Combinatorics/Lists.v</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/UniMath/Combinatorics/StandardFiniteSets.v">https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/UniMath/Combinatorics/StandardFiniteSets.v</a></p>
<p>In his lectures at Oxford, Voevodsky explains his approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>all the lectures (see point 9 in the list of lectures):<br>
<a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/vladimir/Lectures">https://www.math.ias.edu/vladimir/Lectures</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this particular lecture talking about permutations:<br>
<a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/vladimir/sites/math.ias.edu.vladimir/files/141126-2.mp4">https://www.math.ias.edu/vladimir/sites/math.ias.edu.vladimir/files/141126-2.mp4</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Coq is not the only way to use HoTT. Here is a link to a project of HoTT in<br>
Isabelle: <a href="https://github.com/jaycech3n/Isabelle-HoTT">https://github.com/jaycech3n/Isabelle-HoTT</a></p>
<p>So, if you are interested in exploring List and Permutations in Isabelle,<br>
following Voevodsky's approach, you have all you need.</p>
<p>Which are the advantages of combinatorics developed from the point of view<br>
of Homotopy Type Theory which respect to his counterpart in Simple Type<br>
Theory? Well, I will speculate a little bit:  Topological Quantum Computing<br>
<a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2016/REUPapers/Lee.pdf">http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2016/REUPapers/Lee.pdf</a></p>
<p>I guess that Homotopy Type Theory will be a natural framework for formal<br>
verification of programs written for a topological quantum computer. Of<br>
course, some skeptic people may disagree. Here is an example of such a<br>
program (an algorithm for knots-invariants):<br>

<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear José Manuel Rodriguez Caballero,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I highly value your comments and the references<br>
that you provided. Indeed, it would be interesting to explore lists and<br>
permutations in Isabelle using HoTT. Nevertheless, this would have to be a<br>
subject for a different project.</p>
<p>I believe that my question may not have been entirely transparent. Within<br>
the context of the project in the repository<br>
&lt;<a href="https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-DS_Ext">https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-DS_Ext</a>&gt;, I am merely transferring certain<br>
existing results about the type list from the theory List to the types<br>
alist (defined in the theory HOL-Library.DAList) and fmap (defined in the<br>
theory HOL-Library.Finite_Map). I am using the project, primarily, to learn<br>
more about the datatype infrastructure and the lifting/transfer package in<br>
Isabelle/HOL. However, I would like to understand if any of the results<br>
from this project may be useful. After all, I believe, some of these<br>
results address the FIXME comments that I noticed in the theory<br>
HOL-Library.DAList.</p>
<p>The type fmap can be viewed as an associative list invariant under the<br>
permutation of its elements, as an fset from the theory HOL-Library.FSet<br>
and as a map from the theory Map. The process of the transfer of the<br>
results from the type map (from the theory Map) to the type fmap has<br>
already been nearly completed in the context of the development of theory<br>
HOL-Library.Finite_Map. However, I believe that many results that can be<br>
found in the standard library about the types list and fset do not have<br>
their equivalents for the type fmap. In general, it is my goal for the<br>
project in the repository to provide for each lemma in the standard library<br>
about the types list and fset, a similar lemma (under some mild<br>
restrictions) for the type fmap using the transfer package. Also, given<br>
that I found that it is convenient to perform the transfer of the results<br>
about the type list to the type fmap using the type alist, there is an<br>
additional benefit of enriching the theory of the type alist with the<br>
results about the type list that have not yet been transferred to the type<br>
alist.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
