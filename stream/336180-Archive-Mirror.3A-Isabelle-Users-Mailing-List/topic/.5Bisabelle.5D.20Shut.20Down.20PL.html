<p>From: Talia Ringer &lt;<a href="mailto:tringer@cs.washington.edu">tringer@cs.washington.edu</a>&gt;<br>
In the United States, the most recent murders of Black people at the hands<br>
of police have prompted international protest that has itself been met with<br>
further police brutality—the latest manifestation of a centuries-old<br>
history of violence and oppression. We in the global programming languages<br>
community acknowledge that every institution in our society is built on a<br>
foundation of white supremacy—and our academic systems and research<br>
industry are no exception. We have the strongest moral imperative to act<br>
not just in this particular moment of political turmoil and uncertainty,<br>
but in lasting, sustainable ways to permanently transform our institutions<br>
against the systemic racism from which they benefit and which they<br>
perpetuate.<br>

<p>On this <em>Wednesday, June 10, 10:00 am - 3:00 pm PDT</em>, we join in the<br>
movement to #ShutdownSTEM &lt;<a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/">https://www.shutdownstem.com/</a>&gt; for a global<br>
#Strike4BlackLives &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Strike4BlackLives">https://twitter.com/hashtag/Strike4BlackLives</a>&gt;. We call<br>
on anyone in the global programming languages community to come listen,<br>
work, and plan to actively reject racism from the systems we create and the<br>
systems within which we exist. We know that one day of action is not<br>
enough: our goal is to both achieve small immediate change, and to<br>
facilitate the planning of broader systemic change across the world of<br>
programming languages research.</p>
<p>We will be holding a virtual day of conversation and focused group action.<br>
We encourage you to attend for all or most of the day, but we will be happy<br>
to welcome you if you can only be there some of the time. Our schedule<br>
(subject to change at the desire of participants):</p>
<p>10:00 - 10:30 PDT: Introduction, opening, setting intentions<br>
10:45 - 12:00 PDT: Break into smaller self-determined groups<br>
12:30 -  1:00 PDT: Progress check-in, discussion<br>
1:15  -  2:30 PDT: Second round of focused small group work<br>
2:30  -  3:00 PDT: Closing discussion</p>
<p>We want to note: both of the organizers of #ShutdownPL (Talia and Kenny)<br>
are white, and we do not want to demand labor of Black voices on a day that<br>
is focused on sustainable allyship. However, the last thing we want is a<br>
day of non-Black researchers speaking for and taking actions on the behalf<br>
of Black researchers without their input. Accordingly, we will ensure all<br>
our commitments to act begin from a place of listening to the Black<br>
community within and beyond programming languages research.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you there,</p>
<p>Kenny Foner &lt;<a href="https://very.science/">https://very.science/</a>&gt;, Talia Ringer<br>
&lt;<a href="https://tlringer.github.io/">https://tlringer.github.io/</a>&gt;, et. al.</p>
