You should look at the documentation on the induct/induction proof methods. They achieve the effect of performing induction on a formula such as</p>
<p>"\&lt;forall&gt;i::nat . P i \&lt;longrightarrow&gt; Q i"</p>
<p>while completely hiding the tedious manipulations of these logical connectives that would normally be required.</p>

<p>This is what I suggested to you 3 weeks back:</p>

document is the relatively new Programming and Proving in Isabelle/HOL, which<br>
does cover structured proofs (which is why I wrote it). The Tutorial is now only<br>
second choice because of the foucus on "apply"."</p>
<p>That is also where you find the induction method.</p>

<p>Is there a single, up to<br>

<p>Yes, the reference manual (more or less).</p>

<p>Indeed, for inductions, the most convenient way is stating them as implications<br>
(with ==&gt;). The manuals above will also tell you about the naming conventions of<br>
assumptions in each case.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
A few more hints on the version that happens to be behind this inversion <br>
link right now:</p>
<p>* 'definition' with Pure equality (==) is quite old-fashioned.  Normally<br>
     you just use HOL = or its abbreviation for bool &lt;-&gt; here, as you would<br>
     for 'primrec', 'fun', 'function'</p>
<p>(In contrast HOL --&gt; and ! are old-fashioned/cumbersome, where Pure<br>
     ==&gt; and !! would do the job better.)</p>
<p>* I recommend to put the whole 'head' of some definition on one line,<br>
     this works best with jEdit folding:</p>
<p>definition a :: A<br>
       where "a = t"</p>
<p>fun b :: B<br>
       where "b x = t"</p>
<p>Where the 'where' goes depends on the length of A and t; it is not<br>
     informative for the head, so I prefer to have it second by default.</p>
<p>* 'done' should be indented like the 'apply' script.  Don't ask why,<br>
     Isar indentation is an arcane discipline, and still awaits tool<br>
     support in Isabelle/jEdit.</p>
<p>BTW, the shortest structured proof that is not a script looks like<br>
     this:</p>
<p>lemma A unfolding a_def b_def c_def auto</p>
<p>instead of your apply unfold, apply auto, done</p>
<p>* About your funny comments (* by contradiction *): according to the<br>
     Isar philosophy, you always strive to make things clear by formal<br>
     means, and avoid comments.  Thus can be done by putting a suitable<br>
     "proof (rule ...)" standard step here.</p>
<p>According to my experience, informal or semi-formal people often have<br>
     problems to understand what not-introduction, not-elimination, and<br>
     classical reasoning means.  The following examples explore this in the<br>
     formal playground:</p>
<p>notepad<br>
begin</p>
<p>have "¬ A"<br>
   proof (rule notI)<br>
     assume A<br>
     then show False sorry<br>
   qed</p>
<p>next</p>
<p>have "¬ A" sorry<br>
   have A sorry<br>
   from <code>¬ A</code> and <code>A</code> have C by (rule notE)</p>
<p>from <code>¬ A</code> and <code>A</code> have C by contradiction<br>
   from <code>A</code> and <code>¬ A</code> have C by contradiction</p>
<p>next</p>
<p>have C<br>
   proof (rule ccontr)<br>
     assume "¬ C"<br>
     then show False sorry<br>
   qed</p>
<p>next</p>
<p>have C<br>
   proof (rule classical)<br>
     assume "¬ ?thesis"<br>
     then show ?thesis sorry<br>
   qed</p>
<p>next</p>
<p>have C<br>
   proof (rule classical)<br>
     assume "¬ ?thesis"<br>
     then have False sorry<br>
     then show ?thesis by (rule FalseE)<br>
   qed</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Here the rule steps with notI, notE, FalseE have been made explicit for <br>
illustration: these default rules are normally omitted, i.e. you would <br>
just write 'proof' without anything or '..' in instead of 'by (rule ...)'.</p>
<p>The Isar method "contradiction" allows to present to two preconditions in <br>
either order -- this often happens in practice.  For notE the negated <br>
formula has to come first, to eliminate it properly.</p>
<p>There is nothing special behind any of these intro/elim steps so far: just <br>
plain intuitionistic natural deduction.  Nonetheless, people sometimes <br>
think that notI is "proof by contradiction", because they have to show <br>
False in the end.</p>
<p>This might also stem from the ccontr rule above, which is often seen in <br>
text books (without this Isabelle-specific name).  I usually prefer the <br>
one called "classical", because it lacks the builtin False step and <br>
illustrates the brutality of classical reasoning in a pure way: you may <br>
assume that the thesis does not hold, then you have to show that it holds. <br>
The latter proof often works "by contradiction" in the above formal sense, <br>
to explain once more while you might get confused informally.</p>
<p>Formally, everything should be clear at this pure Isar level, because <br>
there is no magic built-in apart from higher-order unification and <br>
proof-by-assumption to solve trivial "end-games" in natural deduction.</p>
<p>Makarius</p>

Thanks, that's very helpful!</p>
<p>For readability I'd sometimes like to make it explicit to what <br>
assumption I'm referring when there is more than one.</p>
<p>When explicitly restating them with 'assume "... (Suc n) ..."' that's no <br>
problem.  With "Suc" I found, e.g., Suc.prems(1) to work.  A symbolic <br>
name, e.g. Suc.prems(foo), if the original statement says 'assumes foo: <br>
"..."', would be even nicer – but that's not possible, I suppose.</p>

<p>This should have read »Why care about »==« anyway?«.  The statement is<br>
that end-users need not to even now about »==« in most situations (the<br>
only exception known to me are rules like split_paired_All (all?) where<br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Using == for definitions is one of these things that can be explained only <br>
historically.  Many many years ago, you would have used consts/defs or <br>
even consts/axioms or even consts/rules to spell out definitional axioms <br>
using directly the == primitive of Pure.  Larry explained it &gt; 20 yeas ago <br>
as "Pure == is used to represent definitions".</p>
<p>If you look at modern times, a "definitional package" is some mechanism <br>
that accepts a specification (via terms or propositions) about what should <br>
be provided by the system by means of some derived definitional concept. <br>
So in 'primrec' and 'fun' you state equations, and the system will give <br>
them you as theorems (and more things), in 'inductive' you write rules <br>
about some relation, and you get them as theorems for introduction (and <br>
more things for elimination and induction).</p>
<p>Long ago, the old 'defs' primitive has been superseded by such a <br>
definitional package called 'definition', to do the same for basic <br>
definitions without pattern matching or recursion.  So 'definition' is <br>
more like 'function' or 'theorem' than the primitive def that happens at <br>
the bottom.  That foundation of the definition does use Pure == <br>
internally, but the user never has to see it in practice.  In Isabelle2012 <br>
these primitive defs behind 'definition' are particulary hard to retrieve, <br>
and nobody has noticed so far :-)</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Restating case/assume is not a big deal, it is done occasionally and not <br>
bad style, only a bit redundant and less formally checked than could be <br>
done otherwise.</p>
<p>To make it more tight, you can do it via literal fact references or the <br>
corresponing "fact" method like this:</p>
<p>notepad<br>
begin</p>
<p>fix n :: nat</p>
<p>have "P n"<br>
   proof (induct n)<br>
     case 0<br>
     then show ?case sorry<br>
   next<br>
     case (Suc n)<br>
     then show ?case sorry<br>
   qed</p>
<p>have "P n"<br>
   proof (induct n)<br>
     case 0<br>
     show "P 0" sorry<br>
   next<br>
     case (Suc n)<br>
     from <code>P n</code> show "P (Suc n)" sorry<br>
   qed</p>
<p>have "P n"<br>
   proof (induct n)<br>
     case 0<br>
     show "P 0" sorry<br>
   next<br>
     case (Suc n)<br>
     have "P n" by fact<br>
     then show "P (Suc n)" sorry<br>
   qed</p>
<p>have "P n"<br>
   proof (induct n)<br>
     case 0<br>
     show "P 0" sorry<br>
   next<br>
     case (Suc n)<br>
     assume "P n"<br>
     then show "P (Suc n)" sorry<br>
   qed</p>
<p>have "P n"<br>
   proof (induct n)<br>
     show "P 0" sorry<br>
   next<br>
     fix n<br>
     assume "P n"<br>
     then show "P (Suc n)" sorry<br>
   qed</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>BTW, according to the way the logical framework works, you can have <br>
redundant 'assume' statements in your proof body, but not redundant 'fix'. <br>
The "fix n" is already part of the case (Suc n). Another fix n would <br>
postulate a different hyptothetical entity in the context, that is not the <br>
same, and its assumptions unrelated to what you have already after <br>
invoking the case.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that textbook logicians often omit the formal "fix n" <br>
altogether.  I've seen this even in some implementations of logic, where <br>
the global absence of a declaration over the whole text is taken as an <br>
implicit fix of a local variable.</p>

<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:c-sterna@jaist.ac.jp">c-sterna@jaist.ac.jp</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Christoph,</p>
<p>Consider the proofs:</p>
<p>lemma 1:<br>
   "ALL i. i &lt; length xs --&gt; xs ! i = hd (drop i xs)"<br>
proof<br>
   fix i<br>
   show "i &lt; length xs --&gt; xs ! i = hd (drop i xs)"<br>
   proof<br>
     assume "i &lt; length xs"<br>
     then show "xs ! i = hd (drop i xs)"<br>
       by (induct i arbitrary: xs) (case_tac xs, simp_all)+<br>
   qed<br>
qed<br>
thm 1<br>
thm 1 [rule_format]</p>
<p>lemma 2:<br>
   "!!i. i &lt; length xs ==&gt; xs ! i = hd (drop i xs)"<br>
proof -<br>
   fix i<br>
   assume "i &lt; length xs"<br>
   then show "xs ! i = hd (drop i xs)"<br>
     by (induct i arbitrary: xs) (case_tac xs, simp_all)+<br>
qed<br>
thm 2</p>
<p>lemma 3:<br>
   assumes "i &lt; length xs"<br>
   shows "xs ! i = hd (drop i xs)"<br>
   using assms<br>
     by (induct i arbitrary: xs) (case_tac xs, simp_all)+<br>
thm 3</p>
<p>I hope the example proofs still cover the structure that was important <br>
to you (I changed them only to have some lemma I could actually prove). <br>
Note the following points:</p>
<p>1) In lemma 3 we do not explicitly all-quantify i, thus it is handled as <br>
"arbitrary but fixed" throughout the proof (and implicitly <br>
all-quantified after the proof is finished; in fact "thm 2" and "thm 3" <br>
give exactly the same result). This can always be done when we do not <br>
need to vary/instantiate i inside the proof itself.</p>
<p>2) The attribute [rule_format] turns (some) HOL connectives into Pure <br>
connectives (which are used to present natural deduction style rules in <br>
Isabelle, hence the name).</p>
<p>3) For Isar proofs (i.e., structured proofs, as opposed to <br>
proof-scripts) the style of lemma 3 is the most idiomatic, if such a <br>
style is not possible (since we need to generalize a variable like i), <br>
then the style of lemma 2 is the next most idiomatic. As Larry already <br>
pointed out, the style of lemma 1 is the least idiomatic nowadays.</p>
<p>hope that helps,</p>
<p>chris</p>
