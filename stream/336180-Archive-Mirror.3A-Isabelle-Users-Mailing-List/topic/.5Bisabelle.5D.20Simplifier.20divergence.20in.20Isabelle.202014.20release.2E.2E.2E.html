<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au">thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
Hello Isabelle users.</p>
<p>I've been putting a little time into updating the l4.verified proofs to <br>
isabelle-2014 (partly because I wanted to know what fraction of the <br>
problems would be caused by my hypsubst change). I've had a few problems <br>
I will soon report on. The simplest problem to report involves the <br>
simplifier.</p>
<p>I haven't been following closely, but I take it the simplifier is now a <br>
bit more aggressive in figuring out how to instantiate assumptions. This <br>
is probably a good thing, and has shrunk a few of the proofs in the <br>
repository already.</p>
<p>The problem is that this new mechanism sometimes leads to divergence, <br>
and I don't know how to turn it off. Here's an example I came across (or <br>
see the attached theory):</p>
<p>theory Scratch imports Main begin</p>
<p>lemma foo:<br>
   "⋀a aa b ba ab bb bc.<br>
        pasDomainAbs initial_aag (cur_domain b)<br>
        ∈ subjectReads (pasPolicy initial_aag) (OrdinaryLabel a) ⟹<br>
        u = Partition a ⟹<br>
        s = ((aa, b), ba) ⟹<br>
        s' = ((ab, bb), bc) ⟹<br>
        states_equiv_for<br>
         (λx. pasObjectAbs initial_aag x ∈ subjectReads (pasPolicy <br>
initial_aag) (OrdinaryLabel a))<br>
         (λx. pasIRQAbs initial_aag x ∈ subjectReads (pasPolicy <br>
initial_aag) (OrdinaryLabel a))<br>
         (λx. pasASIDAbs initial_aag x ∈ subjectReads (pasPolicy <br>
initial_aag) (OrdinaryLabel a))<br>
         (λx. pasDomainAbs initial_aag x ∈ subjectReads (pasPolicy <br>
initial_aag) (OrdinaryLabel a))<br>
         (λx. ptr_range x 12) b bb ⟹<br>
        pasDomainAbs initial_aag (cur_domain b)<br>
        ∈ subjectReads (pasPolicy initial_aag) (OrdinaryLabel a) ⟶<br>
        cur_domain b = cur_domain bb ∧<br>
        globals_equiv b bb ∧<br>
        scheduler_action b = scheduler_action bb ∧<br>
        work_units_completed b = work_units_completed bb ∧<br>
        equiv_irq_state (machine_state b) (machine_state bb) ∧<br>
        (user_modes ba ⟶ aa = ab) ∧<br>
        ba = bc ∧ equiv_for (λx. pasObjectAbs initial_aag x = SilcLabel) <br>
kheap b bb ⟹<br>
        pasDomainAbs initial_aag (cur_domain bb)<br>
        ∈ subjectReads (pasPolicy initial_aag) (OrdinaryLabel a) ⟶<br>
        cur_domain b = cur_domain bb ∧<br>
        globals_equiv b bb ∧<br>
        scheduler_action b = scheduler_action bb ∧<br>
        work_units_completed b = work_units_completed bb ∧<br>
        equiv_irq_state (machine_state b) (machine_state bb) ∧<br>
        (user_modes ba ⟶ aa = ab) ∧<br>
        ba = bc ∧ equiv_for (λx. pasObjectAbs initial_aag x = SilcLabel) <br>
kheap b bb ⟹<br>
        (user_modes ba ⟶ aa = ab) ∧ ba = bc<br>
   "</p>
<p>This is just a copy of a goal that came up in a proof somewhere. I don't <br>
know what any of this means either, and it turns out it doesn't matter. <br>
The behaviour is the same in a scratch theory with none of the constants <br>
defined.</p>
<p>This problem will cause "simp" or "(simp only: )" to loop. It will be <br>
solved immediately by clarify or blast. It can be solved by metis if we <br>
adjust the problem a little to ensure the type variables all have sorts.</p>
<p>The news file suggests that [[simp_legacy_precond]] might be relevant to <br>
this issue, but it doesn't seem to change anything.</p>
<p>In detail, this problem is solved by simplifying the implication whose <br>
premise is already known, i.e. apply (drule(1) mp). It happens the <br>
script "apply (drule(1) mp, simp)" solves the goal.</p>
<p>This weakness of simp is quite frustrating. To generate the above goal, <br>
I had to work around the possible simp divergence by simplifying in stages:<br>
   apply (simp add: uwr_def sameFor_def sameFor_subject_def)<br>
   apply clarify<br>
   apply (simp(no_asm_use))<br>
   apply clarify</p>
<p>I'm willing to accept the argument that this is not a bug but rather a <br>
tradeoff, with the default behaviour now being to solve more problems <br>
but sometimes time out more often. However I'd really like a way to turn <br>
this off. I've already had to dance around the problem in a couple of <br>
places, and it seems to be a generally unpleasant experience. My usual <br>
workarounds (simp only: ) and (simp(no_asm_use)) can't help me here.</p>
<p>I attach my scratch theory with this problem.</p>
<p>I hope there's a simple fix.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.<br>

Dear Thomas,</p>
<p>I just tried your file with Isabelle2013-2 and simp looped. This corroborates<br>
your experience that [[simp_legacy_precond]] doesn't do anything, because the<br>
divergence is not related to it. In any case, the only simplifier change I am<br>
aware of relates to the handling of conjunctions in the premises of conditional<br>
rewrite rules, and [[simp_legacy_precond]] switches that off.</p>
<p>Tobias</p>

<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au">thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
It's been pointed out to me that this particular behaviour of the <br>
simplifier predates Isabelle2014.</p>
<p>Apologies to everyone. I assumed that the extracted example was <br>
representative because it also caused the simplifier to loop. Instead it <br>
looks like the context somehow previously allowed the simplifier not to <br>
loop, and this has changed. I will have to investigate further.</p>
<p>Apologies once again,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au">thomas.sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
The mystery deepens. This problem is somehow my fault.</p>
<p>It is the presence of the three completely redundant equalities "u = <br>
Partition a" "s = ((aa, b), ba)" "s' = ((ab, bb), bc)" which causes the <br>
simplifier to loop. These have been preserved by the hypothesis <br>
substitution change.</p>
<p>In either case, the simplifier initially loops on the assumption it has<br>
   "pasDomainAbs initial_aag (cur_domain b)<br>
        ∈ subjectReads (pasPolicy initial_aag) (OrdinaryLabel a) ⟶<br>
        cur_domain b = cur_domain bb"</p>
<p>But in the old world, the simplifier goes down the rabbit hole - up to a <br>
recursive depth of 100 - then realises it is stuck, gives up, and solves <br>
the problem instead.</p>
<p>In the new world, the simplifier does the same things. But once it has <br>
done that, it starts thinking about the preserved subgoal containing <br>
"aa" which provides a use for one of the conditional rewrites "aa = ab" <br>
floating around. Somehow the simplifier has multiple options now, so <br>
instead of running to a depth of 100 and then giving up and coming back, <br>
it starts backtracking different approaches, and will never finish.</p>
<p>In hindsight this all makes sense, and is entirely my problem. I hope <br>
noone else has to deal with anything this awful as a result of this change.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for listening to me talk to myself about simplifier <br>
mysteries.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This thread seems to be resolved for now.  I just want to make sure that <br>
there is nothing left to reconsider for the Isabelle2014 release, which <br>
will be shipped next week.</p>
<p>Some months ago there was a similar surprise about simplifier depth limit <br>
concerning simprocs.  See the subject line "Product_Type.split_beta fails" <br>
in October 2013 with the conclusion here: <br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2014-February/msg00056.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2014-February/msg00056.html</a></p>
<p>The changeset mentioned there is:</p>
<p>changeset:   55375:d79c057c68f0<br>
user:        wenzelm<br>
date:        Mon Feb 10 13:04:08 2014 +0100<br>
files:       src/Pure/raw_simplifier.ML<br>
description:<br>
more elementary put_simpset: exchange the simplifier configuration <br>
outright, which is particularly relevant concerning cumulative depth, e.g. <br>
for Product_Type.split_beta in the subsequent example:</p>
<p>lemma "P (\&lt;lambda&gt;s. (case s of (x, y) \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; c))"<br>
     using [[simp_depth_limit = 1]]<br>
     apply simp<br>
     oops</p>
<p>It falls in the interval between the last release Isabelle2013-2 and the <br>
emerging one Isabelle2014.  Thus it might be relevant concerning potential <br>
regressions of Simplifier behaviour due to a change that was meant to <br>
improve the situation.</p>
