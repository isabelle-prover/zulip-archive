Hi,</p>
<p>Embarrassing mistakes are embarrassing, but green and blue variables can <br>
help prevent them, at least if you don't tell others.</p>
<p>It's in the story below that I tell about going from vaguely noticing <br>
blue variables when I edit a formula, to discovering another great <br>
feature of jEdit, that green variables are bound variables and blue <br>
variables are free variables. Did I know that? If I did, I forgot it.</p>
<p>Color coded variables even help with respectable mistakes, like when I <br>
go through and change all my variables for a different naming convention.</p>
<p>Since starting this email, I noticed another blue variable that <br>
should've been green. Yet, in spite of the misnamed variable, the <br>
theorem was still true.</p>
<p>It's always a scary thought when Sledgehammer proves a theorem which <br>
isn't what I think it is.</p>
<p><em>FORMAL PROOFS FORCING THE EXPLICIT USE OF THE SEPARATION AXIOM</em></p>
<p>(This is a tangent. I had led into it from the last section, but then I <br>
deleted a lot of the last section. It follows the general pattern of, <br>
"Dude, this is great stuff.")</p>
<p>In real life, there's the Axiom of Separation, which requires we use a <br>
set which already exists to create new sets, but most every one is <br>
oblivious to it.</p>
<p>Set theorists are a rare breed of people, but I know one who was a <br>
former professor. I emailed him and asked, "Trey, everyone is oblivious <br>
to the Axiom of Separation, which requires both an existing set and a <br>
property, but most people mindlessly only specify the property. How many <br>
proofs do you think are out there where they think they're using a set, <br>
but they're really using a class?"</p>
<p>He emailed me back a simple response. He said, "Well, most people are <br>
working in the big areas of math, like algebra and real analysis, so the <br>
sets they're using have been proved to exists, so those people are safe."</p>
<p>The great thing about formal proofs, as things are turning out, is that <br>
I can force the code to always require the explicit use of the Axiom of <br>
Separation.</p>
<p>Do you want to use my set builder notation? Then you have the choice of <br>
{A. P} or the more traditional notation {x IN A. P x}. Either way, you <br>
explicitly have to specify the set A that you're going to get your <br>
elements from, where A is tied into the axiom</p>
<p>!A. !P. ?B. (!x. x IN B &lt;-&gt; (x IN A &amp; P x)).</p>
<p>BACK TO THE BLUE VARIABLE</p>
<p>So for a simple example, I had,</p>
<p>!q. empty_set not_in {x IN u. x notEq empty_set}</p>
<p>where "u" was blue. It turned out the same, since "q" wasn't used and <br>
"u" is a free variable, but it's definitely bad style.</p>
<p><em>NON-EMPTY SETS &amp; SLEDGE NOT MAKING THE CLASSIC HUMAN MISTAKE</em></p>
<p>Today, the blue variable awareness came because I ran Sledgehammer on an <br>
existence theorem. Like many times, multiple ATPs gave multiple results, <br>
where the axioms and theorems used by the different ATPs fell into groups.</p>
<p>First, here's the ATPs which regularly produce results for the FOL heavy <br>
theorems I'm doing:</p>
<p>metis, vampire, e, spass_new, remote_e_sine, z3_tptp, and z3.</p>
<p>And frequent enough to notice:</p>
<p>satallax, cvc3.</p>
<p>And not frequent, but not totally absent, like other ATPs:</p>
<p>yices.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think it was vampire which proved the existence of unordered <br>
pairs using only the existence of the empty set.</p>
<p>I said, "That's no good. What a classic mistake, to forget about the <br>
trivial case of the empty set."</p>
<p>I added the condition that my set is non-empty, and I had a "by(auto)" <br>
below them theorem, and auto proved the theorem after I edited it.</p>
<p>I said, "That's no good."</p>
<p>Well, I had made another classic mistake. There were two "z"s, where one <br>
was outside the scope of the quantifier, where it originally had been <br>
inside the scope.</p>
<p>It was at this point that I noticed one green "z" and one blue "z". I <br>
thought, "That Makarius, giving us green variables and blue variables, <br>
is that great, or what?"</p>
<p><em>A BLUE VARIABLE EXAMPLE ANSWERS A FORMER QUESTION</em></p>
<p>This eventually tied into me trying to sort out some set notation.</p>
<p>From Set.thy, I got this the basic idea for this notation for my <br>
ordered pairs function, S_se ::  "sT =&gt; (sT =&gt; bool) =&gt; sT":</p>
<p>"{q. P}" == "CONST S_se q P"<br>
     "{x : q. P_x}" =&gt; "{q. (%x. P_x)}"</p>
<p>This is simple stuff, but everything is hard until you understand it, so <br>
I was working through some examples where I was starting with the set <br>
builder notation, {x : q. P_z}, and translating into the two other <br>
equivalencies, where it's all related to the formula</p>
<p>!q. !z.  z IN {x : q. P_x} &lt;-&gt;  (z IN q /\ (%x. P_x) z) &lt;-&gt;  z IN <br>
{q. P}.</p>
<p>One of the main things I was trying to explain was the relationship <br>
between P_x and P.</p>
<p>Basically, P_x is a first-order formula with a free variable x, so what <br>
happens if I make a mistake? And don't name my free variable x?</p>
<p>I worked up my trivial examples, the first being</p>
<p>(1) theorem  "{0} = {x : {0}. x = 0}"<br>
           by(metis singleton_as_a_separation_set),</p>
<p>where 0 is the empty set, and  P_x == (x = 0)</p>
<p>Now, my fluency in the Isar proof language is comparable to my fluency <br>
in Spanish, where I know how to say "by auto" and "by metis", along with <br>
"burrito", "taco", hombre, and adios. So I'm much more ahead in Spanish <br>
than I am in Isar, but I'm learning things about Isabelle that I need to <br>
learn anyway, and I'm not stuck now completely in tutorial purgatory.</p>
<p>Sledgehammer makes mincemeat out of (1), so I messed it up so there's a <br>
blue variable, y, which results in a false variation of (1):</p>
<p>(2) theorem  "~(!y. {0} = {x : {0}. y = 0})"<br>
           by(metis (mono_tags) Ax_P separation_set_uniqueness).</p>
<p>I put the quantifer in to show effectly what happens when my P_x == (y = <br>
0), which results in no free variable x in P_x.
*
THIRD BIG LESSON: FIRST-ORDER ATPs WANT FIRST-ORDER LOGIC*</p>
<p>There was the lesson on remembering to consider the trivial case of the <br>
empty set.</p>
<p>There was the lesson of getting visual feedback to see if my variables <br>
are bound or free.</p>
<p>The third lesson had to do with my past question, up until today, of <br>
whether to leave a variable free, or make it a bound universally <br>
quantified variable.</p>
<p>This was no small question, and my inclination was to go through the <br>
formalities for a while of explicitly using universal quantifiers, and <br>
then loosening up and using free variables.</p>
<p>It's all the same, right?</p>
<p>No. All the ATPs above that easily proved (2) timed out on the version <br>
that has a free variable, which is this theorem:</p>
<p>theorem  "~({0} = {x : {0}. y = 0})"</p>
<p>Maybe there's something I'm missing, but what I'm thinking is that the <br>
ATPs that are good at proving FOL, work best when they're given explicit <br>
FOL.</p>
<p>If that's what they want, who am I to deny them what they want? I do <br>
what I can to make ATPs happy, so they'll help me out.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
This has occurred to me. That the reason the ATPs may not be able to <br>
prove the theorem with the free variable, rather than the universally <br>
quantified variable, is because all my previous theorems are done with <br>
universal quantifiers rather than free variables.</p>
<p>To find out if that's true, I would need to change all the theorems so <br>
that they use free variables.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
