<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Members of the Research Community,</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce that the software implementation of the mathematical <br>
logic R0, a further development of Peter B. Andrews' logic Q0, is now <br>
available. The syntactic features provided by R0 are type variables <br>
(polymorphic type theory), the binding of type variables with the abstraction <br>
operator and single variable binder λ (type abstraction), and (some of) the <br>
means necessary for dependent types (dependent type theory).</p>
<p>The software implementation can be downloaded (license restrictions apply) at<br>
<a href="http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.3">http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.3</a></p>
<p>The logic R0 does not only allow quantification over types with quantifiers, as <br>
specified in [Andrews, 1965] and [Melham, 1993b], but, moreover, the binding of <br>
type variables with lambda (type abstraction), as suggested by Mike Gordon for <br>
HOL: "[...] 'second order' [lambda]-terms like \a. \x:a. x, perhaps such terms <br>
should be included in the HOL logic." [Gordon, 2001, p. 22]</p>
<p>The expressiveness of the formal language obtained with type abstraction allows <br>
for a natural formulation of group theory [cf. p. 12 of <br>
<a href="http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.2]">http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.2]</a>. With the set (type) of Boolean values o, the <br>
exclusive disjunction XOR, and an appropriate definition of groups Grp [p. <br>
362], the fact that (o, XOR) is a group can be expressed in lambda notation <br>
with [p. 420]<br>
        Grp o XOR</p>
<p>This enhancement of the expressiveness of the formal language overcomes the <br>
"limitation of the simple HOL type system [...] that there is no explicit <br>
quantifier over polymorphic type variables, which can make many standard <br>
results [...] awkward to express [...]. [...] For example, in one of the most <br>
impressive formalization efforts to date [Gonthier et al., 2013] the entire <br>
group theory framework is developed in terms of subsets of a single universe <br>
group, apparently to avoid the complications from groups with general and <br>
possibly heterogeneous types." [Harrison, Urban, and Wiedijk, 2014, pp. 170 f.]</p>
<p>While in both Andrews' Q0 and Gordon's HOL the universal quantifier is defined <br>
as<br>
    ALL  :=  [\p. p = [\x.T] ]<br>
[Andrews, 2002, p. 212; Gordon and Melham, 1993], in R0, with type abstraction, <br>
the type is made explicit:<br>
    ALL  :=  [\t. [\p. p = [\x.T] ] ]<br>
with p of type (ot), or t -&gt; o [p. 359 of <a href="http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.2]">http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.2]</a>.<br>
Then, the set-theoretic proposition<br>
    ALL n : NAT . n+1 &gt; 0<br>
in type theory can be expressed very naturally by<br>
    ALL NAT [\n . n+1 &gt; 0]</p>
<p>Furthermore, the enhanced expressiveness provided by R0 avoids the <br>
circumlocutions connected with preliminary solutions like axiomatic type <br>
classes recently developed and discussed for Isabelle/HOL. The expressiveness <br>
of type abstraction also replaces the notion of compound types, which in HOL <br>
are used for ordered pairs (the Cartesian product, cf. [Gordon and Melham, <br>
1993]), that in R0 can be formalized without compound types [cf. pp. 378 f. of <br>
<a href="http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.2]">http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.2]</a>.</p>
<p>R0 has an intuitive method of type introduction, which does not require the <br>
additional axioms of the HOL type introduction mechanism: "Whenever a theorem <br>
of the form p{oa}e{a} is inferred [...] (which in set theory is expressed by e <br>
∈ p) [...] p is acknowledged as a type" [p. 11 of <br>
<a href="http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.2]">http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.2]</a>.</p>
<p>Mike Gordon's HOL developed at Cambridge University is, like Andrews' logic Q0, <br>
based on the Simple Theory of Types (1940) developed by Alonzo Church, Andrews' <br>
Ph.D. advisor at Princeton University. Among the HOL group, there has always <br>
been the awareness that besides automation, there is the philosophical <br>
(logical) desire to reduce the means of the logic to a few principles. In the <br>
HOL handbook, Andrew M. Pitts wrote the legendary sentence: "From a logical <br>
point of view, it would be better to have a simpler substitution primitive, <br>
such as 'Rule R' of Andrews' logic Q0, and then to derive more complex rules <br>
from it." [Gordon and Melham, 1993, p. 213]</p>
<p>In the same spirit, Mike Gordon wrote on the genesis of HOL: "[T]he terms [...] <br>
could be encoded [...] in such a way that the LSM expansion-law just becomes a <br>
derived rule [...]. This approach is both more elegant and rests on a firmer <br>
logical foundation, so I switched to it and HOL was born." [Gordon, 2000, p. <br>
173]</p>
<p>The general principle of reducing the logic (including the language) to a few <br>
principles is the main criterion for the design of Q0 (having only a single <br>
primitive rule of inference, Rule R), which is summarized by Peter B. Andrews <br>
as follows: "Therefore we shall turn our attention to finding a formulation of <br>
type theory which is as expressive as possible, allowing mathematical ideas to <br>
be expressed precisely with a minimum of circumlocutions, and which is as <br>
simple and economical as is possible without sacrificing expressiveness. The <br>
reader will observe that the formal language we find arises very naturally from <br>
a few fundamental design decisions." [Andrews, 2002, pp. 205 f.]</p>
<p>R0 "follows Andrews' concept of expressiveness (I also use the term <br>
reducibility), which aims at the ideal and natural language of formal logic and <br>
mathematics." [p. 11 of <a href="http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.2]">http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.2]</a> Therefore R0 is, <br>
unlike most other implementations, a Hilbert-style system, opting for <br>
expressiveness instead of automation.</p>
<p>R0 implements the philosophical program of Russell's and Whitehead's 'Principia <br>
Mathematica', logicism, i.e., the reduction of mathematics to formal logic, and <br>
even more, generalizes this idea by reducing formal logic itself to a few <br>
principles.</p>
<p>Like John Harrison's HOL Light, R0 has an extremely small logical kernel. Being <br>
a Hilbert-style system, it has the smallest number of rules of inference among <br>
the programs implementing a fixed logic (not regarding logical frameworks with <br>
another kind of expressiveness). R0 resembles Norman Megill's Metamath, which <br>
"attempts to use the minimum possible framework needed to express mathematics <br>
and its proofs." [http://us.metamath.org/] With a size of less than 100 KB, it <br>
is the smallest proof checker or interactive theorem prover, including the <br>
current versions of John Harrison's HOL Light, Mark Adams' HOL Zero, Norman <br>
Megill's Metamath, and Freek Wiedijk's reimplementation of Automath.</p>
<p>Like Q0, R0 uses the description operator, avoiding the problems of the epsilon <br>
operator for HOL already discussed by Mike Gordon himself: "It must be admitted <br>
that the ε-operator looks rather suspicious." [Gordon, 2001, p. 24] "The <br>
inclusion of ε-terms into HOL 'builds in' the Axiom of Choice [...]." [Gordon, <br>
2001, p. 24]</p>
<p>R0 and PVS are the only implementations based on classical type theory with <br>
some form of dependent types. Also, R0 and PVS are the only implementations <br>
based on classical type theory with mathematical entities that may have <br>
different types (or which have at least some form of subtyping).</p>
<p>Unlike in Coq, in R0, no use is made of the Curry-Howard isomorphism, favoring <br>
a direct (unencoded, and hence, natural) expression rather than the encoding of <br>
proofs. For the same reason, it is an object (fixed) logic and not a logical <br>
framework (such as Larry Paulson's Isabelle and Norman Megill's Metamath). Like <br>
in Cris Perdue's Prooftoys [http://prooftoys.org, http://mathtoys.org] - a <br>
natural deduction variant of Andrews' Q0 - in R0, the turnstile symbol is <br>
replaced by the logical implication [p. 12 of <a href="http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.2]">http://doi.org/10.4444/100.10.2]</a>.</p>
<p>R0 is, together with HOL Zero [Adams, 2016, p. 34], the only proof checker or <br>
interactive theorem prover which has the property of Pollack-consistency, <br>
namely "being able to correctly parse formulas that it printed itself" <br>
[Wiedijk, 2012, p. 85]. R0 is the only proof checker or interactive theorem <br>
prover which can correctly parse whole proofs (and not only formulas) that it <br>
printed itself. Finally, R0 has the property of "faithfulness, where internal <br>
representation and concrete syntax correctly correspond. A printer that printed <br>
false as true and true as false might be Pollack-consistent but would not be <br>
faithful." [Adams, 2016, p. 21]</p>
<p>R0 is, like Automath, a mere proof checker (practically without any automation <br>
at all).</p>
<p>A full treatment of R0 shall be announced at<br>
