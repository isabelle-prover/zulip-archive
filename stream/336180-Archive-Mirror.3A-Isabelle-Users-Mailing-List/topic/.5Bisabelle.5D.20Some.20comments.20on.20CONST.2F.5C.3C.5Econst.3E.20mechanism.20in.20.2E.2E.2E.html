Sorry to be slow to the party, but the significance of the way the  <br>
definition/notation mechanism now works has only just started to sink  <br>
in. How do I find out more about it?</p>
<p>The mechanism seems to finally properly address the problem of  <br>
properly identifying and distinguishing constant and variables that  <br>
share names. This is really cool.</p>
<p>My question is as to how far this mechanism has penetrated the  <br>
pre-2008 world. It seems that datatype constructors are not included  <br>
in the new mechanism? Is there anyway include a const declared in the  <br>
old way, say because it is being defined by extension rather than  <br>
intension? Are type names included or planned for inclusion is a  <br>
similar scheme?</p>

<p>What you have discovered here is called "authentic syntax" in internal <br>
jargon.  It merely means that things work as expected, i.e. the syntax is <br>
really attached to certain entities in a robust fashion.</p>
<p>Right now, the dividing line for unrobust legacy syntax and authentic <br>
syntax is mostly the "local theory" interface.  Thus newer commands like <br>
'definition' and 'notation' already benefit on it, as well as 'inductive', <br>
'function' etc.  As we move on to make old packages fit for the local <br>
theory concept, syntax will also improve, although this is only a small <br>
thing compared to the full power of local theories.  (Both of these <br>
renovations coincide mostly by accident, though.)</p>
<p>Anyway, upgrading to authentic syntax is not completely trivial due to old <br>
syntax translations, which usually expect syntactic const names in the <br>
(fragile) unqualified form.  Right now you can already use the <br>
@{const_syntax foo} antiquotation in ML, or "CONST foo" in translation <br>
rules, to make things fit for the future.</p>

<p>You can try it like this:</p>
<p>abbreviation "foo == old_foo"  (mixfix)</p>
<p>which will produce an authentic const "foo", corresponding to some other <br>
term, which happens to be based on non-authentic syntax (or no syntax at <br>
all).</p>

<p>In the end, yes.  It will probably happen in the next round, when we <br>
provide typedecl/typedef interfaces for local theories (this is a bit <br>
tricky, because local theories do not really support type constructors).</p>
