<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Andrei Popescu, dear Ramana Kumar,<br>
dear Members of the Research Community,</p>
<p>As a matter of fairness, I have to correct one of my earlier statements.</p>
<p>Andrei Popescu correctly pointed out at<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-December/msg00059.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-December/msg00059.html</a><br>
that neither "being based on a meta-logic" (i.e., a logical framework) nor <br>
"featuring a natural deduction system" creates a problem.<br>
There has been a misunderstanding on my part.<br>
However, I have to say that Paulson's definition of the turnstile as a symbol <br>
for the predicate "hfthm" in<br>
"inductive hfthm :: "fm set =&gt; fm =&gt; bool" (infixl "⊢" 55)"<br>
<a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Incompleteness/SyntaxN.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Incompleteness/SyntaxN.html</a><br>
somewhere hidden in the proof files without being prominently announced in his <br>
articles is strongly misleading and inevitably creates misinterpretations. <br>
Usually (such as in [Andrews, 2002]), the turnstile is used to indicate the <br>
provability of a theorem of the logic in which the proof is undertaken, not the <br>
provability of theorems of the embedded logic. Also, for the predicate of <br>
provability of theorems of the embedded (represented, formalized) logic, a <br>
label is usually used, not a symbolic notation (e.g., Goedel uses "Bew" - for <br>
"beweisbare Formel", the German expression for "provable formula" -, and <br>
O'Connor in Coq uses "SysPrf"). Moreover, without some short introduction to <br>
the notation and the type system it is nearly impossible to analyze the proof <br>
in detail unless one has advanced experience with the Isabelle proof assistant, <br>
leaving aside that with a logical framework there are not only three, but four <br>
language levels involved, all of which one would ideally need to understand in <br>
order to verify the proof.</p>
<p>The result of the formal proof<br>
    ~Bew(g) /\ ~Bew(not g)<br>
can be interpreted in the sense that it is possible to construe a formula with <br>
the form of a sentence (i.e., a boolean-valued well-formed formula with no free <br>
variables) neither provable nor refutable.<br>
Nevertheless, the claim of "incompleteness" depends on a philosophical <br>
assumption.<br>
One who shares the semantic view (model theory) will conclude that there is a <br>
meaningful (and true) sentence that is neither provable nor refutable, and will <br>
call the discrepancy between syntax and semantics "incompleteness".<br>
But one who shares the syntactic view will conclude that it is possible to <br>
create a meaningless formula which has the form of a syntactically correct <br>
sentence (similar, in natural language, to a grammatically correct but <br>
meaningless statement like "mathematics is liquid").</p>
<p>Concerning the two objections of Ramana Kumar at<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-December/msg00061.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-December/msg00061.html</a><br>
the first one was a misunderstanding clarified at<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-January/msg00029.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-January/msg00029.html</a><br>
But the second, Ramana Kumar's claim that type "tm" can be defined like type <br>
"nat", is not correct. Andrews' logic Q0, being an improved variant of Church's <br>
original simple type theory, only allows the types iota (i) and omicron (o), <br>
and combinations of them.<br>
Andrews' type "nat" is such a combination ( nat := (o(oi)) ). On the contrary, <br>
Paulson's type "tm" is an inductively defined type, which is not possible in Q0:<br>
"nominal_datatype tm = Zero | Var name | Eats tm tm"<br>
<a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Incompleteness/SyntaxN.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Incompleteness/SyntaxN.html</a><br>
In an e-mail, Paulson basically argued that there should be ways to introduce <br>
further types (instead of restricting oneself to combinations of 'i' and 'o'). <br>
This is, of course, correct, but doesn't justify the specific mode of type <br>
introduction used here, namely the Backus-Naur form (BNF). The BNF was designed <br>
to specify formal grammars in computer science, but (mathematical) types are <br>
objects that must have certain logical properties, such as being non-empty. <br>
Thus the introduction of additional mathematical types should be subject to <br>
proof, and not a matter of mere declaration via the BNF.</p>
<p>With some more knowledge about the concept of the current proof assistants, I <br>
can answer Ramana Kumar's question at<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00149.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00149.html</a><br>
concerning the motivation of my project announcement at<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html</a><br>
from his perspective now.<br>
Current proof assistants seem to follow the semantic approach, in which the <br>
theory is distinguished from a specific linguistic (formal) formulation, or use <br>
of model theoretic notions like satisfiability is made. For example, in <br>
Isabelle there are implementations of both axiomatic set theory (Isabelle/ZF) <br>
and type theory (Isabelle/HOL), but neither one is explicitly preferred, and <br>
the question of which is more adequate for representing mathematics is not even <br>
raised. (Although, unlike in informal mathematics, in formalized proofs type <br>
theory seems to prevail, e.g., within Isabelle the logic Isabelle/HOL, a <br>
polymorphic version of Church's simple type theory.)<br>
If one follows the syntactic approach, then there is a desire for something <br>
like the ideal formulation or the natural language of formal logic and <br>
mathematics. The main criterion is expressiveness [cf. Andrews, 2002, p. 205], <br>
or, vice versa, the reducibility of mathematics to a minimal set of primitive <br>
rules and symbols. If we leave away for a moment the restrictions of Q0 of <br>
still being a formulation of simple type theory (i.e., without type variables <br>
and dependent types), all of formal logic and mathematics can be expressed on <br>
the basis of only a "single rule of inference (substitution, from which the <br>
rule of modus ponens is derived)" and "only two basic types (individuals and <br>
truth values) and only two basic constants (identity/equality and its <br>
counterpart, description)"<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html</a><br>
Paulson argued that natural deduction is far superior to Hilbert-style systems <br>
for automated proof. This is, of course, correct, since Hilbert-style <br>
metatheorems become symbolically representable in natural deduction as regular <br>
theorems (and not just metatheorems), but this only reflects the engineer's <br>
perspective with the pragmatic aim of quickly obtaining proofs. For the <br>
philosopher it is not proof automation but expressiveness that is the main <br>
criterion, such that the method with the least amount of rules of inferences, <br>
i.e., a Hilbert-style system, is preferred, and all other rules become derived <br>
rules.<br>
Hence, from the perspective of the syntactic view, Andrews' elegant logic Q0 is <br>
the natural point to start with. Overcoming its restrictions by extending it to <br>
a polymorphic (with type variables) and dependent type theory (with dependent <br>
types) is the motivation of my logic R0, which I hope to be able to publish <br>
soon. A preliminary excerpt with some definitions and a sample proof is <br>
available online at<br>

In particular, there is this sentence of yours: "...this only reflects <br>
the engineer's perspective with the pragmatic aim of quickly obtaining <br>
proofs. For the philosopher it is not proof automation but <br>
expressiveness that is the main criterion..."</p>
<p>I completely understand the issue of low status vs. high status, and the <br>
importance of trying to assert one's status, by bandying about labels, <br>
with the hopes that labels will stick.</p>
<p>I myself, at one time, aspired to be a philosopher, and mind you, no <br>
mere philosopher, but the mother-of-all-philosophers, as this would give <br>
me the ability to bandy about the mother-of-all-condensations, along <br>
with, certainly, the mother-of-all-condescensions.</p>
<p>Having aspired, I steeled myself, and struck the philosopher's pose, <br>
after which, my arm fell asleep. Surely, if I could have endured even 5 <br>
more minutes, the answer would have come, "42", and therefore, the <br>
prize. It was not to be.</p>
<p>Reevaluating my aspirations, I lowered them, and aspired to be an <br>
engineer, so that I could at least condescend to technicians.</p>
<p>Being a man of action, I went out and bought a little train set, and <br>
spent hours and hours painting the little cars, in intricate detail.</p>
<p>But one day, when I was engineering my little train set, saying, "choo, <br>
choo, choo" to the little train cars, the little kids next door heard <br>
me, because the window was open, and they started laughing at me.</p>
<p>Do you know how bad it hurts to have little kids laugh at you, when <br>
you're saying, "choo, choo, choo"?</p>
<p>So in one massive swoop, I destroyed my little train set, to show those <br>
little kids what a bad martial artist I was, MMA style.</p>
<p>They just kept laughing.</p>
<p>It was no great loss. I was actually only aspiring to be a bad martial <br>
artist, MMA style.</p>

No serious discussion what supposed to ensue, and it's not supposed to <br>
start with my reply here. Your short sentence tells me that maybe you <br>
didn't focus on my jokes.</p>
<p>Any seriousness was supposed to get swamped by my attempt at creative <br>
writing. The attempt at creativity was for the purposes of ridiculing an <br>
idea. There was actually no need for a defense to be made. Writing <br>
nothing would have been better, maybe.</p>
<p>Ken wants to compare his raw ideas, valid or not (I wouldn't know), with <br>
Larry Paulson's work, which is the foundation for what has ended up <br>
being more than 30 years work, founded on Robin Milner's ML, drawing <br>
from Mike Gordon's work, propelled further by Tobias Nipkow et al.</p>
<p>I'm nobody's friend here, but I gotta figure that Isabelle, its logic <br>
included, simply represents what Larry Paulson decided to commit to as a <br>
public work, that its not the totality of his mind.</p>
<p>As to "what", "how", and "why", it's not like he hasn't been exposed to <br>
a full gamut of ideas, including that which is pure and impractical.</p>
<p>People want to attack the purity of Isabelle/Pure, but without providing <br>
a serious alternative. Maybe it's the "30 years work thing", that a <br>
serious work takes.</p>

<p>Well, "valid or not" is indeed the question, nothing else.</p>
