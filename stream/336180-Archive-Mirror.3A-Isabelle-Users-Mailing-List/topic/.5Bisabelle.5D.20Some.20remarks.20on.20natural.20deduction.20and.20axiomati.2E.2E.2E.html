<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Gottfried Barrow and List Members,</p>
<p>Thank you for your comment at<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-December/msg00023.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-December/msg00023.html</a></p>
<p>concerning my note available at<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-December/msg00018.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-December/msg00018.html</a></p>
<p>Let me respond to the last three paragraphs of your comment quoted below which <br>
summarize the most important questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no relation between a simple minimum core logic and the <br>
expressiveness of the formal language. A modular software design guarantees a <br>
clear separation of functionality such that the logic is concentrated in the <br>
logical core and no enhancements of other software layers (i.e., user <br>
interface, proof tactics) will have an effect on the correctness of the logic. <br>
This concept is, according to Andrei Popescu, shared by all implementations in <br>
discussion here: "A small logic kernel is an implementation-independent virtue <br>
of Isabelle/HOL as well as of all the Gordon-HOL systems."</li>
</ol>
<p>"It is the logical reliability due to reduction that builds the core of the <br>
LCF-approach to theorem proving (or LCF-style full expansiveness [cf. Gordon, <br>
2000, p. 178]): 'All proofs are ultimately performed in terms of a small set of <br>
primitive inferences, so provided this small logical kernel is correct the <br>
results should be reliable.' [Harrison, 2009, p. 60]" [Kubota, 2015a, pp. 12 f.]</p>
<p>The idea behind the LCF-approach appealing also to those who do not share <br>
metatheoretical concepts such as the semantic approach (model theory) is to <br>
reduce the set of rules and elements, such that the logical core is minimized <br>
without loss of expressiveness. I called it the "The Principle of Reductionism" <br>
[Kubota, 2015a, p. 11].</p>
<p>In Peter B. Andrews' logic Q0 this principle is - by the use of syntactical <br>
means only - consequently carried out, such that the basic means of the <br>
language are reduced without loss of expressiveness to</p>
<ul>
<li>a single rule of inference,</li>
<li>a single variable binder,</li>
<li>only two constants and</li>
<li>only two types,<br>
obtaining "definability of all of the propositional connectives, as well as all <br>
of the quantifiers (universal, existential and uniqueness quantifier)" and <br>
derivability of all other rules including the rule of modus ponens as mentioned <br>
earlier at<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, with this simple minimum core logic of Q0 all of formal logic <br>
and large parts of mathematics, and with type variables (polymorphic type <br>
theory) and the binding of type variables with lambda (dependent type theory), <br>
presumably all of mathematics can be construed, expressed and proved purely <br>
syntactically. Due to its simplicity, the logical kernel becomes extremely <br>
small and logically robust, i.e., mathematically safe.</p>
<p>In the R0 implementation, the propositional connectives therefore are not part <br>
of the logical core, but their definitions are "outsourced" into a file and, <br>
for example, the rule of modus ponens into a separate proof template file. In <br>
fact, the expressiveness of R0 as a logistic system is stronger than that of <br>
Isabelle/HOL. Isabelle/HOL allows for type variables and therefore has the <br>
expressiveness of polymorphic type theory, but only R0 allows, in addition to <br>
that, the binding of type variables with lambda as abstraction operator and <br>
therefore enables the construction of types required for dependent type theory.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Any axiom schema requires a meta-level for instantiation. Since my <br>
philosophical background rejects any sort of metatheories (I prefer to speak of <br>
arithmetization of mathematics instead of metamathematics, refuting any <br>
foundational or legitimating role of metatheories), an axiom schema - like any <br>
other meta-construction - always reveals a deficit. Whereas Andrews' logic Q0 <br>
requires an "Axiom Schema 3" [Andrews, 2002, p. 213] (with "syntactical <br>
variables ranging over type symbols" [Andrews, 2002, p. 210]) for the Axiom of <br>
Extensionality, R0 uses regular type variables for this axiom [cf. Kubota, <br>
2015a, pp. 39, 351], which were not available in Q0 being a simple type theory, <br>
i.e., without type variables.</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, axiomatic set theory as a whole is subject to critique: "Axiomatic <br>
set theory uses axioms to justify the existence of certain sets. Unless the <br>
proof of existence from these axioms is provided, any construction cannot be <br>
introduced into the domain of discourse. This approach, however, is not <br>
systematic and subject to arbitrary conditions. For example, the most common <br>
formulation, the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), <br>
comprises axioms for the empty set, union, one-element sets, power sets etc., <br>
trying to cover the standard sets used in mathematics. But there always remain <br>
legitimate sets not contained by these axioms; for example it is well known <br>
that large cardinal numbers and certain universes cannot be treated within ZFC <br>
(without assuming additional axioms), although from a purely logical point of <br>
view there is no difference between the mathematical objects covered by ZFC and <br>
those not covered.</p>
<p>This problem has its origin in the approach itself, as axiomatic set theory <br>
makes use of non-logical axioms to establish sets, thus trying to avoid <br>
paradoxes via content restrictions instead of the proper specification of the <br>
formal language. Opting this method, axiomatic set theory including ZFC is <br>
bound to remain a preliminary and auxiliary approach, but not the foundation of <br>
mathematics." [Kubota, 2015a, p. 18].</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Russell's paradox ("the set of all sets that are not members of themselves", <br>
or originally: "Let w be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be <br>
predicated of itself. [...] Likewise there is no class (as a totality) of those <br>
classes which, each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves." <br>
[Russell, 1902, p. 125]) with the two constitutive properties of antinomies, <br>
self-reference and negativity (negation), ruled out Cantor's naive set theory <br>
as a foundation of mathematics. If Goedel's construction of a proposition <br>
involving self-referencing negativity ("I am not provable", or originally: "We <br>
therefore have before us a proposition that says about itself that it is not <br>
provable" [Gödel, 1931, p. 598]) has to be considered as an antinomy, further <br>
research will have to find out whether it rules out natural deduction <br>
(including sequent calculus) for the foundation of mathematics as a whole or <br>
whether a clear distinction of the object language and the meta-language can be <br>
introduced into natural deduction.</li>
</ol>
<p>The strict distinction of the object language and the meta-language was so <br>
important to Church that he emphasized it a second time in his article: "We <br>
must, of course, distinguish between formal theorems, or theorems of the <br>
system, and syntactical theorems, or theorems about the system, this and <br>
related distinctions being a necessary part of the process of using a known <br>
language (English) to set up another (more exact) language." [Church, 1940, p. <br>
61]</p>
<p>In natural deduction, as for example in Isabelle, metatheorems (in terms of <br>
Hilbert-style systems) become part of the formal language (the object language) <br>
itself. So from the point of view of axiomatic (Hilbert-style) deductive <br>
systems, the expressiveness in natural deduction is shifted towards the <br>
meta-level, possibly at the cost of expressiveness at the object level. This <br>
caused me to introduce an own terminology with the notions of "object logic" <br>
and "meta-logic" in my second publication on Goedel [cf. Kubota, 2015] until <br>
realizing that the definitional line between "object logic" and "meta-logic" is <br>
identical with that between axiomatic (Hilbert-style) deductive systems and <br>
natural deduction, having found the number of allowed occurrences of the <br>
deduction symbol (turnstile) in a theorem as a formal criterion. The <br>
translation mechanism from a theorem to the existence of its proof (or vice <br>
versa) in Goedel's First Incompleteness Theorem is in Paulson's presentation <br>
his theorem 'proved_iff_proved_PfP' - called (P) in my article -, in Andrews' <br>
presentation the implicit rule used for step 7101.4. Whereas in Andrews' system <br>
this implicit rule immediately results in inconsistency [cf. Kubota, 2015, pp. <br>
10 f.], I am not sure whether this applies to natural deduction, too. Because <br>
of a limited expressiveness at the object level, the antinomy might be <br>
construed without causing an openly visible inconsistency in the formal <br>
language, since "the two occurrences of the deduction symbol [...] remain an <br>
obstacle for obtaining a paradox [i.e., an inconsistency] in the metalogic <br>
[i.e., in natural deduction]" [Kubota, 2015, p. 14]. Then, "Gödel's first <br>
incompleteness theorem: If consistent, our theory is incomplete." (Paulson) is <br>
rendered from a hypothetical judgement to a trivial tautology in the form of a <br>
conclusio ex falso, since the theory under consideration is actually <br>
inconsistent. However, an antinomy (paradox) should not be expressible at all <br>
(in formal logic and mathematics).</p>
<p>If natural deduction is ruled out for the foundation of mathematics, there <br>
would be no other "fix" for Isabelle than switching to an axiomatic <br>
(Hilbert-style) deductive system. Then, if one does not want to downgrade from <br>
higher-order logic (which would artificially limit the expressiveness of the <br>
language) and prefers to remain in the realm of Russell's invention, namely <br>
type theory [cf. Russell, 1908], basically three options would be left:<br>
a) Church's Hilbert-style system of 1940 [cf. Church, 1940] (simple type <br>
theory, i.e., without type variables)<br>
b) Andrews' logic Q0 [cf. Andrews, 2002, pp. 210-215], an improved formulation <br>
with identity (equality) as the main notion (also simple type theory, i.e., <br>
without type variables), first published in 1963 as a simplification of <br>
Henkin's variant of Church's formulation [cf. Andrews, 1963, pp. 345 f., 350<br>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Ken,</p>
<p>I am addressing you some, but not soley. I think I've said enough to <br>
make it clear that I'm not a representative, in any way, of the <br>
professional community that surrounds Isabelle.</p>
<p>It is my goal to follow through and not have my name end up here much, <br>
but everyone serves their purpose, and there are things of value I can <br>
bring attention to, even if it's mixed in with a lot of noise. The <br>
existence of a meta-logic and object-logic in Isabelle is an endless <br>
source of confusion for newcomers, and a few basics can clear that up. <br>
My last email served to bring attention to that once again, along with <br>
the reference to "Logic and Computation", by Paulson.</p>
<p>Here is the thesis of this email: proof assistants are a game-changer. I <br>
will try to bring my points back around to that.</p>
<p>Ken, please don't miss the part below, in my lecture on etiquette,where <br>
I say this:</p>
<p>If, in a reply to me, you add emails to people who weren't party to the <br>
discussion, you are a gross violator of decent etiquette.</p>
<p><em>2ND THING 1ST, PUT UP OR...</em></p>
<p>The last email, I thought that I bordered on being rude, relative to the <br>
normal professionalism here, but it didn't get through to you.</p>
<p>With proof assistants, for formal logic it now becomes "deeds not <br>
words". I say that as a buffer to the rude form: "put up or shut up". It <br>
could be my "put up or shut up" theme doesn't deserve to get through to <br>
the mailing list.</p>
<p>When we criticize someone's software, there's a simple comeback for the <br>
author, which is some variation of "If you're so smart, then why don't <br>
you go ahead and fix it?"</p>
<p>If you're so bold as to say that the logic of Isabelle may be <br>
inconsistent, then why don't you "put up" by showing that it's <br>
inconsistent. Otherwise, "shut up" about it. Deeds not words.</p>
<p>Meta-think is obviously needed to set up or analyze an object language <br>
or an object-logic (and even a meta-logic).  Consequently, it may appear <br>
that the domain of the meta-think remains domain of the human mind.</p>
<p>Not at all. (I'm polluting my point somehow. Semantics anyone? But for <br>
meta-thinkers only. Syntax is sufficient for object-think.) Any smart <br>
meta-thinker who can program should be able to code up the meta-ideas, <br>
and proof assistants move the expectations to "You're boring me with <br>
your talk. Code it up, so we have something fixed to talk about".</p>
<p>If you're so bold as to claim that Isabelle is imperfect, then "put up" <br>
and implement the perfect logic. Well, you appear to have coded up the <br>
basics of something. And the world now is supposed to stop and jump on <br>
your logic wagon?</p>
<p>The problem with "put up" is that it's subjective. I'll state my <br>
opinion. You haven't. I'll leave the "shut up" as implied.
*
1ST THING 2ND, LEARN SOME DECENT ETIQUETTE*</p>
<p>What I say now is at least as important as what I just said.</p>
<p>I myself abuse etiquette, but I don't add email addresses in a reply to <br>
people who haven't been party to a thread.</p>
<p>Your first email was to 6 people plus the user list. I responded back <br>
only to the user list address. That was a very intentional act on my part.</p>
<p>You could have at least addressed it to "Dear List Members and Gottfried <br>
Barrow".</p>
<p>I am not in the same class as "List Members". List members in general <br>
most likely have a PhD and are qualified, or more qualified than me to <br>
be meta-thinkers. I have a B.S. in math and am qualified to potentially <br>
be a respectable object-thinker.</p>
<p>We're all a team, and we don't even have to like each other. It's <br>
object-think-users who are needed here, not meta-thinkers.</p>
<p>But even object-thinkers can recognize basic mistakes in thinking, like <br>
a person making a big deal about a theorem holding under one set of <br>
axioms, but not under another set of axioms, where I'm assuming I don't <br>
have a total misunderstanding of what you've said.</p>
<p>There is no need for me to be a meta-thinker. I want to do math, not <br>
forever be bogged down in foundations. First-order logic comes for free <br>
with HOL. With functional-prog-logic, I'm way ahead of the Z-Crowd <br>
already, with their 5 millimeters. I need true, false, and the Law of <br>
Excluded Middle. The Axiom of Choice? Of course. But your stuff? I need it?</p>
<p>Don't diss the team, dude, and don't spam the team leaders, or those <br>
external, while also making me a part of it.But don't worry, I'm a <br>
nobody. Nothing will be lost by not including me with all the other people.</p>
<p>If, in a reply to me, you add emails to people who weren't party to the <br>
discussion, you are a gross violator of decent etiquette. (I heavily <br>
watered that sentence down, to also try and respect the professionals here.)</p>
<p><em>QUOTE? LINKS INSTEAD, CONCERNING PURITY</em></p>
<p>I guess I had a point to make. I'll go ahead and pull a quote of yours, <br>
after all:</p>
<p>"Since my philosophical background rejects any sort of metatheories... "</p>
<p>Hmm. Sounds like a heavy burden to carry. My philosophical background is <br>
the extent to which I've spoken philosophically, and I only require that <br>
to the extent I've said stupid things, I don't say them again.</p>
<p>So you're talking about purity. I guess I don't care here, so I don't <br>
need to speak for Larry Paulson, and say whether he is or isn't a purist.</p>
<p>I do know he takes practical things into consideration, as demonstrated <br>
by a recent comment he made on the FOM mailing list, which I link to below.</p>
<p>Where is there room here for me to speak of the <br>
"all-or-nothing-requirement", for people more picky than me, about what <br>
they need to get them to abandon their 5 millimeter mechanical pencils? <br>
It all has to be good.</p>
<p>For mechanized proof, where math is literature, a great logic is useless <br>
without the-rest-of-it, which you ain't got.</p>
<p>If you want purity, in the way you want purity, code it up, and suffer <br>
the impracticalities of your own product. But syntactically, how can <br>
anything be pure, when programming languages have to be used, with the <br>
thousands of details involved? The absence of details is actually part <br>
of the current illusion-of-elegance for traditional logics, as if <br>
there's more than one in force.</p>
<p>Anyway,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2015-October/019312.html">http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2015-October/019312.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2015-October/019282.html">http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2015-October/019282.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2015-October/date.html">http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2015-October/date.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2015-September/date.html">http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2015-September/date.html</a></p>
<p>Pay attention, or not, to Larry Paulson:</p>
<p>It looks like I need to clarify my remark about “imposing unreasonable costs”.<br>
   Under this I do not include the difficulty of implementing a proof assistant,<br>
   because our job is to build things and let the computer do the work. The costs<br>
   rather are those imposed on users who have to work within the free logic. I<br>
   often compare theorem proving in a formal logic to building a ship in a bottle,<br>
   and nobody wants to make the bottle any smaller, or the ship any bigger. To be<br>
   more precise, I have seen proof-theoretic work showing that very small changes<br>
   to a proof calculus can increase the length of a formal proof, in the worst case,<br>
   by a non-elementary factor. It isn’t obvious that the use of a free logic would<br>
   be as costly as that, but I get the impression that users who have tried such<br>
   systems have not been happy with the effort involved. I don’t believe that good<br>
   automation could entirely eliminate this effort.</p>
<p>*PAYING HOMAGE TO A MATHEMATICIAN WHO CARED
*
I forgot how I was supposed to use this, but it's about Robert M. Solovay.</p>
<p>Steven Obua published "Partizan Games in Isabelle/HOLZF":</p>
<p><a href="https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1094432/1094432.pdf">https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1094432/1094432.pdf</a></p>
<p>In it, he references Robert Solovay as saying that axioms added to <br>
Isabelle/HOL will be consistent. That gave me enough confidence to <br>
consider it wouldn't be a waste of my time to mess around with adding <br>
the axioms, similar to how Obua does it.</p>
<p>Initially, I couldn't find the reference, then one day, I searched <br>
again, and it came up:</p>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/fa.isabelle/fKOEdb7uqJk/qYY1-MNxwSsJ">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/fa.isabelle/fKOEdb7uqJk/qYY1-MNxwSsJ</a></p>
<p>Solovay writes:</p>
<p>This alternative is certainly possible, but [if I understand it <br>
correctly]<br>
   is not what I'm interested in.</p>
<p>Your version: [HOL in ZFC] has the same consistency strength as ZFC.</p>
<p>My version [ZFC in HOL] would have consistency strength considerably<br>
   greater than ZFC [just a shade less than Zermolo + Choice + "There is an<br>
   inacessible cardinal].</p>
<p>How can I tie this into you, Ken?</p>
<p>You think you're the only one with ideas? Ideas are a dime a dozen. <br>
Ideas aren't a problem. Time is a problem, with the upper limit of <br>
mortality being the ultimate arbiter of time.</p>
<p>In overstating things, I said no one cares about a raw logic. I can also <br>
say that I'm interested in everything, but have time for nothing.</p>
<p><em>THE NEW GAME</em></p>
<p>The new game for logic will be proof assistants. The game will not be <br>
played in full force until people can get educated in the rules of the <br>
game, in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>When the game is in full force, cheap talk won't be tolerated much, but <br>
then, the idea of wanting to engage in cheap talk will be foreign to the <br>
vast number of people who want to play the game of logic.</p>
<p>These days, find a bunch of programmers, doing meta-talk. In general, <br>
they're doers. They all write programs. They talk about what others have <br>
done, or what they've done. Talk and do. They do them both.</p>
<p>That'll be the future of the game of mathematics. Whether low or high, <br>
there will be no place for cheap and undeserved glory.</p>
<p><em>DISCO, TRUST ME ON THIS ONE</em></p>
<p>I hate giving away my potential secrets to success, but I'm a benevolent <br>
person.</p>
<p>Logic? Meta-think? Definitely crowded games to play, since the last mods <br>
for fixing naive sets was, when? Yea, not recent.</p>
<p>Hopeless situation? No, not with the trifecta-of-potential-success for <br>
True Artistes: dance, trance, and disco.</p>
<p>That's not to say that some things don't stay the same.</p>
<p>For example, you never want show up on the dance floor and start dissin' <br>
John Travolta, and not have, at least, disco <br>
