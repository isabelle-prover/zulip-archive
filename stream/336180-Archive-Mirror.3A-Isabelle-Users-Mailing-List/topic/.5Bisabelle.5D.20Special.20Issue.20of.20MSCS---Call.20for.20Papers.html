Call for Papers<br>
Special Issue of Mathematical Structures in Computer Science<br>
in Celebration of the Sixtieth Birthday of Dale Miller</p>
<p>Papers are invited to a special issue of Mathematical Structures in<br>
Computer Science, a journal published by Cambridge University Press. This<br>
special issue is being collated in celebration of the sixtieth birthday of<br>
Professor Dale Miller. To be appropriate for this collection, papers must<br>
be broadly related to one or more of the areas that have been spanned by<br>
the work of Professor Miller to-date. These areas include structural proof<br>
theory, proof search and computation, foundations of logic programming,<br>
higher-order unification, reasoning about relational specifications and<br>
certification of proofs. This list is meant to be illustrative and is not<br>
exhaustive; if you are interested in submitting a paper and would like to<br>
ascertain its relevance to the theme of the special issue, please feel free<br>
to contact the editors of the issue.</p>
<p>Papers that are submitted for consideration of publication must be prepared<br>
in LaTeX and should use the MSCS style file that can be downloaded from<br>
<a href="http://ftp.cup.cam.ac.uk">ftp.cup.cam.ac.uk</a>.<br>
Please also follow the layout and other manuscript format related<br>
instructions with the exception of double spacing that you will find  at<br>
<a href="http://z.umn.edu/mscsformat">http://z.umn.edu/mscsformat</a>.<br>
Manuscripts should also be limited to about 25 pages. While this is not a<br>
hard constraint, the reason why a paper exceeds this limit must be apparent<br>
to the editors from an inspection of its content, else it may be declined<br>
without review.</p>
<p>To ensure timeliness of publication, strict deadlines and an expedited<br>
reviewing process will be followed in the preparation of this special<br>
issue. To be considered for publication, manuscripts must be submitted by<br>
May 31, 2017. The first round of reviews will be completed by July 31,<br>
2017. Revised versions of manuscripts that are deemed to be of acceptable<br>
quality will be due by August 21, 2017 and final acceptance decisions will<br>
be made by September 11, 2017.</p>
<p>To submit a manuscript to the special issue, please use the ScholarOne site<br>
for MSCS at<br>
<a href="https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/mscs">https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/mscs</a>.<br>
Once you are at this site, you will need to create an account if you do not<br>
have one already. Once you are logged in, select the "Author" tab and<br>
follow the instructions. At the end of the page, under the "Special Issue"<br>
heading, select "Miller Festschrift" prior to submission. Please note that<br>
at this stage we will need only a PDF file prepared as indicated above. The<br>
LaTeX source will be required after the manuscript has been accepted.</p>
