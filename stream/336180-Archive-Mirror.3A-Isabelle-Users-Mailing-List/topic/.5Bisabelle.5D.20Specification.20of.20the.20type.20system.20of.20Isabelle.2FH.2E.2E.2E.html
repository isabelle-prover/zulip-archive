<p>Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Let me first comment on the <br>
manuals before getting back to the type system.</p>
<p>It would be desirable to have such information - on the nature of the <br>
"datatype" declarations - as well as on the low-level routines for type <br>
inference and type introduction available in the manuals. Also, in order to <br>
avoid misunderstanding, it should be pointed out that "BNF" is an abbreviation <br>
of "Bounded natural functor" and not "Backus-Naur form".</p>
<p>For any type theory, including Isabelle/HOL, the type system is essential. <br>
Hence, one would wish for a concise specification of the logical core, i.e., <br>
both the type system and the rules of inference. For example, Andrews' system <br>
Q0 - the type system, symbols, wffs, axioms, and the single rule of inference - <br>
is fully specified in a very precise manner on only a few pages [cf. Andrews, <br>
2002, pp. 210-215].</p>
<p>Moreover, one would wish for a tutorial on how to inspect both the types <br>
introduced by the datatype declarations as well as the type of any well-formed <br>
formula, such that the user can look behind the surface and examine the <br>
(actual) type system. In my R0 implementation, it is possible to display the <br>
fully typed expression of any wff (including that of any primitive or derived <br>
type), e.g., the logical AND (&amp;), with a simple print command, which yields the <br>
type (e.g., o -&gt; o -&gt; o [written as "{{o,o},o}", lambda is denoted by '\', and <br>
lambda application is denoted by '_']):<br>
":print &amp;</p>
<h1>wff      47 :  [\x.[\y.((=_[\g.((g_T)_T)])_[\g.((g_x)_y)])]]</h1>
<h1>:=  &amp;</h1>
<h1>w typd   47 :  [\x{o}{o}.[\y{o}{o}.((={{{o,@},@}}_[\g{{{o,o},o}}{{{o,o},o}}.((</h1>
<p>g{{{o,o},o}}{{{o,o},o}}_T{o}){{o,o}}_T{o}){o}]{@}){{o,@}}_[\g{{{o,o},o}}{{{o,o},<br>
o}}.((g{{{o,o},o}}{{{o,o},o}}_x{o}{o}){{o,o}}_y{o}{o}){o}]{@}){o}]{{o,o}}]</p>
<h1>{ {{o,o},o} }</h1>
<h1>:=  &amp;</h1>
<p>type     #   0:  {{o,o},o}                                   =  35"<br>

<p>Concerning the type system, the most informative explanation I could find in <br>
the documentation was at the very beginning of Part III (Isabelle/HOL) of The <br>
Isabelle/Isar Reference Manual (February 17, 2016):<br>
"Andrews'[ ] book [1] is a full description of the original Church-style <br>
higher-order logic, with proofs of correctness and completeness wrt. certain <br>
set-theoretic interpretations. The particular extensions of Gordon-style HOL <br>
are explained semantically in two chapters of the 1993 HOL book [50]."<br>
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle2016/doc/isar-ref.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle2016/doc/isar-ref.pdf</a> (p. 236)</p>
<p>Again, a brief description of the type system in the online documentation, <br>
instead of only literature references, would be desirable.<br>
Please allow me a minor correction here. In both the first edition [Andrews, <br>
1986] referenced by the manual as well as the current second edition [Andrews, <br>
2002] Andrews does not only provide a "full description of the original <br>
Church-style higher-order logic", but, more exactly, a description of his own <br>
system Q0, which is roughly equivalent, but much more elegant. For example, in <br>
Church's simple type theory, Modus Ponens is a primitive rule (the fifth of <br>
altogether six rules) [cf. Church, 1940, p. 60; Andrews, 2014, available online <br>
at<br>
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/type-theory-church/#AxiRulInf">http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/type-theory-church/#AxiRulInf</a><br>
], whereas in Andrews' Q0, Modus Ponens is a derived rule [cf. Andrews, 2002, <br>
p. 224 (5224)] obtained from the single rule of inference of Q0. The type <br>
system is identical, allowing only 'i' (iota) and 'o' (omicron), and <br>
combinations of them (i.e., simple type theory, having no type variables).<br>
In the dependent type theory R0, not only type variables, but also an <br>
additional type inference mechanism is implemented, which seems to resemble <br>
"Gordon['s] [...] facility to introduce new types as semantic subtypes from <br>
existing types"<br>
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle2016/doc/isar-ref.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle2016/doc/isar-ref.pdf</a> (p. 261)<br>
: "Whenever a sentence of the form p_(oα)c_(α) is inferred [...], type p is <br>
added to c, such that c_p becomes a well-formed formula." [Kubota, 2015, p. 32] <br>
If it isn't already, p becomes (also) a type, by additionally assigning the <br>
type of types (tau) to it.</p>
<p>The abstract of the article by Traytel et al. you referred to via the DOI link<br>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LICS.2012.75">http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LICS.2012.75</a><br>
starts as follows: "Interactive theorem provers based on higher-order logic <br>
(HOL) traditionally follow the definitional approach, reducing high-level <br>
specifications to logical primitives." This elegant formulation on the <br>
"definitional approach" coincides with what Andrews calls "expressiveness" <br>
[Andrews, 2002, p. 205], except that the reduction (or, in turn, the <br>
expressiveness of the few primitive symbols and rules) does not only apply to <br>
symbols, but also to the rules, such that the basis of Q0 consists of only</p>
<ul>
<li>two primitive symbols (identity and description),</li>
<li>
<p>two primitive type symbols (the type of propositions 'o' and the type of <br>
individuals 'i'),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and only a single rule of inference (substitution),<br>
from which everything can be expressed (within the limits of simple type <br>
theory).<br>
For extending expressiveness to dependent type theory, in R0, type iota ('i') <br>
is replaced by type omega (the universal type), and type tau (the type of <br>
types) is introduced. Furthermore, it is possible to bind type variables with <br>
lambda.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If one consequently follows Andrews' approach of expressiveness at all levels, <br>
then Hilbert-style deductive systems are preferred, since they allow the rules <br>
to be reduced to a single rule of inference. An extra rule for induction such <br>
as that given at<br>
<a href="https://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/papers/lausanne2009.pdf">https://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/papers/lausanne2009.pdf</a> (p. 5)<br>
can be avoided by making induction part of the definition of N [cf. Andrews, <br>
2002, p. 260]. In the same spirit, a primitive type for natural numbers can be <br>
avoided by using a combination of 'i' and 'o' as carrier type ( nat := (o(oi)) <br>
) [cf. ibid.].<br>
The pairing operation used by Andrews [cf. Andrews, 2002, p. 208] (see also the <br>
definition of the logical AND (&amp;) above, wff 47) is better suited for lambda <br>
calculus than the one suggested at<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-175.pdf">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-175.pdf</a> (p. 13),<br>
and in R0, it can be used to form both a type restricted as well as a <br>
polymorphic pairing operator (by the use of type omega).</p>
<p>According to this approach, a proliferation of primitive types and type <br>
inference mechanisms should be avoided, and rules should be kept as simple as <br>
possible, e.g., as quoted above: "Whenever a sentence of the form p_(oα)c_(α) <br>
is inferred [...]."<br>
In one of the manuals it is stated:<br>
"If you introduce a new type axiomatically, i.e. via typedecl and <br>
axiomatization (§5.5), the minimum requirement is that it has a non-empty <br>
model, to avoid immediate collapse of the logical environment."<br>
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle2016/doc/isar-ref.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle2016/doc/isar-ref.pdf</a> (p. 115)<br>
But what does this mean exactly, having "a non-empty model"? Is this the same <br>
as the existence of a proven theorem of the form "p_(oα)c_(α)", which shows <br>
that p is non-empty?</p>
<p>It will take some time until I am able to read through the article by Traytel <br>
et al., but at first glance a more complex semantic reasoning seems to be <br>
behind it:<br>
"An inductive definition specifies the least predicate or set R closed under <br>
given rules: applying a rule to elements of R yields a result within R. For <br>
example, a structural operational semantics is an inductive definition of an <br>
evaluation relation.<br>
[...]<br>
Both inductive and coinductive definitions are based on the Knaster-Tarski <br>
fixed-point theorem for complete lattices. The collection of introduction rules <br>
given by the user determines a functor on subsets of set-theoretic relations."<br>

<p>Please allow me, where appropriate, to postpone answers, as I would like to <br>
focus on my forthcoming publication of R0 [Kubota, 2015].</p>
