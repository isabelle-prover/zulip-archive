A note of caution.</p>
<p>The if_split/split_if rule caused some headaches for us in l4v, and is<br>
globally removed from the split set for a number of the theories (which<br>
causes secondary headaches). It's possible if_split_asm would be the<br>
same, though, as you've probably observed, if statements in assumptions<br>
are probably a lot rarer than in conclusions in any case.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

<p>From: Tobias Nipkow &lt;<a href="mailto:nipkow@in.tum.de">nipkow@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Currently simp/auto split if-then-else terms if they occur in the conclusion by <br>
default but not if they occur in the assumptions of a goal. The motivation was <br>
the following: inductive proofs of propositions involving "if" often go astray <br>
if the "if" in the IH is split. However, this situation is not very frequent <br>
(the "if" is typically hidden in some definition) but I frequently need to <br>
modify my simp/auto calls with</p>
<p>split: if_split_asm (* was named split_if_asm until recently *)</p>
<p>Hence I intend to enable "if_split_asm" by default, just like "if_split", and <br>
would like your feedback on this, if you have any.</p>
<p>Why is this not clear cut? According to my tests, the effect is largely positive <br>
(see below). But there is the following usage aspect:</p>
<p>Realizing that if_split_asm should be added is much easier than realizing that <br>
it should be removed: the presence of "if" in an assumption is the indicator.</p>
<p>Of course this only applies if the user is aware of the existence of if_split_asm!</p>
<p>The empirical side look like this. I have converted all of HOL (locally) with <br>
the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of lines mentioning if_split_asm has dropped from 334 to 112.</li>
<li>
<p>The number of lines deleting if_split_asm has gone up from 18 to 54</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In about 15 theories if_split_asm had to be disabled globally because it broke <br>
too much. Typically these are long apply-style proofs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise local "split del" modifiers did the job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a few places proofs became simpler.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the AFP I only tested 2 articles.<br>
Launchbury: the 4 occurrences of if_split_asm could be removed, that's all.<br>
Jinja: the 56 occurrences of if_split_asm could be removed, 1 local split del <br>
had to be added.</p>
<p>Any views?</p>
