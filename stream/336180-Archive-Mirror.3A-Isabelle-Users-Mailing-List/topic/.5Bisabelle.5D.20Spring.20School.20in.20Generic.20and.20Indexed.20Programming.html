SPRING SCHOOL ON GENERIC AND INDEXED PROGRAMMING<br>
Wadham College, Oxford, 22nd to 26th March 2010</p>
<p>TOPIC</p>
<p>"Generic programming" is about making programs more widely applicable<br>
via exotic kinds of parametrization - not just along the dimensions of<br>
values or of types, but of things such as the shape of data, algebraic<br>
structures, strategies, computational paradigms, and so on. "Indexed<br>
programming" is a lightweight form of dependently typed programming,<br>
constraining flexibility by allowing one to state and check<br>
relationships between parameters: that the shapes of two arguments<br>
agree, that an encoded value matches to some type, that values<br>
transmitted along a channel conforms to some protocol, and so on.</p>
<p>The two forces of genericity and indexing balance each other nicely,<br>
simultaneously promoting and controlling generality.  The EPSRC-funded<br>
Generic and Indexed Programming project at Oxford has been exploring<br>
their interaction over the period 2006 - 2010; this school is the<br>
closing activity of the project.</p>
<p>LECTURERS</p>
<p>Six lecturers from the Programming Languages community, each an<br>
acknowledged expert in their specialism, will cover various aspects of<br>
generic and indexed programming. Each will give about four hours'<br>
lectures, distributed throughout the week.</p>
<p>Nate Foster (Princeton University)<br>
  "Bidirectional Programming"</p>
<p>Ralf Hinze (University of Oxford)<br>
  "Generic Programming with Adjunctions"</p>
<p>Oleg Kiselyov (Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center)<br>
  "Typed Tagless Interpreters"</p>
<p>Simon Peyton Jones (Microsoft Research Cambridge)<br>
  "Type Functions"</p>
<p>Jeremy Siek (University of Colorado at Boulder)<br>
  "Concepts in C++"</p>
<p>Stephanie Weirich (University of Pennsylvania)<br>
  "Generic Programming with Dependent Types"</p>
<p>PREREQUISITES</p>
<p>The school is aimed at doctoral students in programming languages and<br>
related areas; however, researchers and practitioners will be very<br>
welcome, as will strong masters students with the support of a<br>
supervisor. It will be assumed that participants have a good<br>
understanding of typed functional programming, as in Haskell or<br>
O'Caml.</p>
<p>DATES</p>
<p>Registration deadline: 19th February<br>
School:                22nd March (0900) to 26th March (lunchtime)</p>
<p>VENUE</p>
<p>Lectures will be held and accommodation provided in Wadham College in<br>
the centre of Oxford. The college celebrates its 400th anniversary in<br>
2010; notable past members include Sir Christopher Wren, the founder<br>
of the Royal Society, and notable present ones Marcus du Sautoy, the<br>
mathematician and TV presenter.</p>
<p>COSTS</p>
<p>Costs will be kept low, thanks to support from EPSRC. There will be a<br>
nominal registration fee, and B&amp;B accommodation in college will be<br>
about 55 per night. (Precise costs are yet to be determined.)</p>
<p>FURTHER INFORMATION</p>
<p>Further information, including instructions on how to register,<br>
will be available soon at the website:</p>
