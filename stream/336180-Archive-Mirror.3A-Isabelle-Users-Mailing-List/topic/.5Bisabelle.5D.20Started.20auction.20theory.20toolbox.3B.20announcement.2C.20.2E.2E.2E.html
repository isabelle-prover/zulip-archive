Depends what you mean by "modern" and "editor".</p>
<p>jEdit is a very capable "programmer's editor" is it advertizes itself, but <br>
not a word processor.  Program text is hardly ever soft-wrapped, so <br>
relatively little has been invested in this area.  It you take Isar <br>
sources, things like {* ... *} are a separate token anyway, like " ... ". <br>
Would you expect from a source-code editor to wrap lines within string <br>
literals?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I can myself imagine Isabelle/jEdit doing something for<br>
text {* ... *} blocks within Isar source, but that has to be specific to <br>
the language, meaning I have to sit down and provide that functionality.<br>
(As I did already for many other things.)</p>

Great stuff, look forward to more of this.</p>
<p>A small random point: the definition</p>
<p>definition in_range ::<br>
  "nat \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; nat \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; bool" where<br>
  "in_range n i \&lt;equiv&gt; 1 \&lt;le&gt; i \&lt;and&gt; i \&lt;le&gt; n"</p>
<p>excludes 0. Unless you have some very good reason for starting at 1, I would<br>
start at 0, which typically makes things smoother. For a start, you can just<br>
write "i&lt;n" instead of "in_range n i".</p>

<p>Have you seen section 8.5.2 of tutorial.pdf in Isabelle's doc folder?<br>
Perhaps there's also other documentation in another file; if so, I hope<br>
someone else knows where and points you to it.</p>
<p>I'm quite interested in what you're doing; after working with Isabelle<br>
for my Master's project, I'm now musing about auction theory:<br>
<a href="http://wp.me/p2IaW7-W">http://wp.me/p2IaW7-W</a>  (I'm not trained in economics, so please be<br>
gentle, but please do comment on my musings if you think I'm in error,<br>
or if you have anything else to say about them.)  Consequently, I<br>
decided to have a look at your Vickrey theory.  In preparation for this,<br>
I tried running Isabelle's document preparation system on Vickrey.thy<br>
(see chapter 4 of isar-ref.pdf, and possibly other parts of Isabelle's<br>
documentation).  Unfortunately, it didn't work at first, for a couple of<br>
reasons.</p>
<p>First, Vickrey.thy didn't end with "end", which was easy to fix.</p>
<p>Second, your "text {* ... *}" portions don't always contain valid LaTeX.<br>
 I made minimal changes to get your document to compile, but I haven't<br>
had time to read it yet.  I've attached my edited version of your<br>
Vickrey.thy, so you can see what changes I've made.  I've made almost no<br>
effort to make it look as you intended --- only to make it compile.</p>

<p>From: "Tim (McKenzie) Makarios" &lt;<a href="mailto:tjm1983@gmail.com">tjm1983@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
I've had a look at your work, and found it interesting.</p>
<p>One thing that I noticed was that you defined what it means to be a<br>
second_price_auction, and you proved various things about functions that<br>
satisfy this definition, but you never showed that the definition was<br>
satisfiable.</p>
<p>This isn't an inconsequential detail; at first, I thought you'd got the<br>
definition wrong, and that "second_price_auction n x p" implied n &lt; 2.<br>
When I tried to prove it, I finally noticed that your allocation and<br>
payment functions depend on the set of bids.  But it is easy to write<br>
definitions that aren't satisfiable, or that imply trivialities.</p>
<p>So I decided to prove that your second_price_auction was satisfiable for<br>
n &gt; 0.  See attached for the proof.</p>
<p>Also, you made a comment about removing an element from a set.  Given a<br>
set A, the set of all the elements of A except x can be written as<br>
"A - {x}"</p>
<p>I have a feeling that there was something else I was going to comment<br>
on, but I should go and have lunch, and write again if I remember it.</p>

<p>@All: Let me slowly resume the discussion of your feedback about our <br>
formalisation.  The earlier feedback sent by others (thanks once more!) <br>
is not forgotten, I will get back to this next week, but the points in <br>
this mail are good for me to start with, as they don't require me to <br>

<p>Well, I actually didn't try to be as "formal" as possible, but I did not <br>
yet know how to do it right.  In several lemmas I started with a simpler <br>
statement, e.g. just the right side of an implication, and put the left <br>
side into "assumes" declarations, but then I wasn't able to reuse these <br>
assumptions in the proof as expected.  In the cumbersome way I ended up <br>
doing it I got the work done at least – but of course I'll be excited to <br>
learn about the nicer way of doing it, and how to avoid such pitfalls as <br>
I mentioned.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>OK, I will try; it should be possible to introduce line breaks where it <br>
semantically makes sense.</p>
<p>But actually I'd like to blame half of the problem on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>jEdit is not very good at soft line-breaks,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not having much previous jEdit experience I simply had hoped that a <br>
modern editor would be good at that (even recent versions of dinosaurs <br>
such as Emacs are), and somehow denied that it didn't work so well after <br>
all.</p>
<p>End of rant; I don't want to start an editor war here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and it is better to layout<br>
your formal sources explicitly yourself.  (The jEdit indentation<br>
facilities still need to be activated for Isar sources, like I did many<br>
years ago for Proof General / Emacs.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me report a problem related to that: I tried at least to enable <br>
auto-indentation, so that any new line would be indented as much as the <br>
previous line.  But with that I found that Isabelle didn't pick up the <br>
changes I made.  (This is roughly what I remember from trying it a few <br>
weeks ago; if you'd like me to do some experiments and give a more <br>
detailed report, I'm happy to do so.)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Christoph</p>
