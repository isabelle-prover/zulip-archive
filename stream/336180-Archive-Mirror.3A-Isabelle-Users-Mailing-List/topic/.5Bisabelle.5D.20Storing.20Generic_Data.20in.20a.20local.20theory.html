Hello Florian,</p>
<p>thanks for your reply!</p>

<p>The background for this is that I had my data stored in a Theory_Data struct<br>
before, so my ``workaround'' just does exactly what I did before, except it's<br>
now wrapped in a generic context. Which somehow does not seem to be what I<br>
want.</p>
<p>My "dream" here was that the generic context would magically convert between<br>
theory data and proof data for me, which was maybe a bit too much to whish<br>
for.</p>
<p>In general I think I'm fine with just having the data in the background theory<br>
only, the main problem is that I need to somewhat awkwardly extract it when<br>
I'm in a local theory context.</p>

<p>I will look into this. I had seen the morphisms before, but given the lack of<br>

<p>The application is the ``open inductive'' [1] [2] package that I developed for<br>
my master's thesis. It is in a working (but not pretty) state right now, what<br>
I am trying to do is refine the code as best as I can, so it can be submitted<br>
to the AFP in a somewhat maintainable state.</p>

Hello again,</p>
<p>I managed to implement the suggested morphsim variant to some success now,<br>
thanks to your example!</p>
<p>What somewhat worries me is that I end up ignoring the morphism argument<br>
completely, since it can contain thms and terms and (I think) they do not<br>
affect the outcome of my commands, since they are just storing data.</p>
<p>When I figure out which additional thms may affect my commands though, this<br>
way at least the infrastructure is in place in contrast to just storing in the<br>
background theory as I did before [1], so I think I stick with this for now.</p>
<p>In the last part of the linked commit, I have a local_theory_to_proof command.<br>
What I do now is store the result I get in after_qed using background_theory,<br>
I could not get declaration to work here: No matter how I produce the initial<br>
generic context, either from the local or the background theory, I somehow<br>
always end up needing the other variant in the end.</p>

Dear Richard,</p>
<p>I just glanced quickly over your code, so the following might not be 100% accurate, but <br>
here are my observations nevertheless.</p>
<p>Your data structure for the open theorems looks rather unusual, because as far as I can <br>
see, you are storing the literal string input rather than the parsed terms and theorems. <br>
Of course, there is no infrastructure in Isabelle to apply the morphisms to strings.<br>
 From what I know about open inductive, I can see why you store the strings, but I am <br>
pretty sure that this will eventually get you into trouble. Ultimately, you have to parse <br>
the strings, but the context may have changed in between -- just think of deleting a <br>
notation and installing the same notation for some other constant. That is, you probably <br>
get parsing with respect to dynamic contexts. because you no longer have access to the old <br>
context. So I recomment that you immediately convert the strings into logical entities <br>
(terms, types, theorems) and push them through the morphism as intended.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

Hi Richard,</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>text representation of entities like terms, theorems are indeed always<br>
parsed at the very place of their occurence in a theory text.  The whole<br>
machinery in the background then proceeds with proper internalized ML<br>
values of type term, thm, etc.</p>
<p>So I would suggest to modify this accordingly and come back here for<br>
further counsel.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
These are very important observations.  I've point out some of this <br>
already privately.</p>
<p>The whole complex of "locality" in Isabelle is rather complex; it is not <br>
easily disassembled to understand how it really works.  Ultimately, it is <br>
all about "abstract concepts" of contexts, morphisms, declarations etc.</p>
<p>The main strategies of survival are:</p>
<p>(1) Study published documents (the "implementation" manual with cited<br>
       papers) about the concepts themselves.  I know that the manual is<br>
       not finished in that respect yet, but it does contain some<br>
       information, notably some references to papers by Chaieb, Haftmann,<br>
       Wenzel.</p>
<p>(2) Figure out the canonical way to do it, by looking closely at<br>
       existing examples.  Find such examples, by asking the question<br>
       "Which existing things are close to what I need?".  Then look<br>
       through the sources, and make educated guesses about their quality,<br>
       ask experts about them etc.</p>
<p>Often people say "I don't understand localization so I better stick with <br>
old-fashioned global theory contexts".  This only works in limited <br>
situations, and usually turns into a much harder problem to make it work <br>
in general: both locality and globality need to be understood, instead of <br>
just using locality in the proper way.</p>

<p>From: Richard Molitor &lt;<a href="mailto:gattschardo@googlemail.com">gattschardo@googlemail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>I have a question concerning the usage of Generic_Data in conjunction with an<br>
Outer_Syntax.local_theory command. The parameter to my handler function is of<br>
type local_theory, which can be used initialize a generic context using<br>
Context.Proof, which can then be used to store some data:</p>
<p>fun test_thy_cmd name =<br>
        Context.Proof #&gt; Data.put name #&gt; Context.proof_of</p>
<p>val _ = Outer_Syntax.local_theory @{command_spec "test_thy"}<br>
        "test" (<a href="http://Parse.name">Parse.name</a> &gt;&gt; test_thy_cmd)</p>
<p>I would expect to have it stored back in the background theory when the<br>
command completes, so using it like this:</p>
<p>test_thy foo</p>
<p>ML_val {* Data.get (Context.Theory @{theory}) *}</p>
<p>I would expect to get "foo" back, but i stays at the default value.</p>
<p>The workaround I found was wrapping the whole function in background_theory<br>
and initializing the generic context from the theory:</p>
<p>fun test_prf_cmd name =<br>
        Local_Theory.background_theory (Context.Theory #&gt; Data.put name #&gt; Context.theory_of)</p>
<p>val _ = Outer_Syntax.local_theory @{command_spec "test_prf"}<br>
        "test" (<a href="http://Parse.name">Parse.name</a> &gt;&gt; test_prf_cmd)</p>
<p>Using this:<br>
      test_prf bar</p>
<p>ML_val {* Data.get (Context.Theory @{theory}) *}</p>
<p>I get "bar" back.</p>
<p>Is this behaviour intended? If modify the local theory in other ways (i.e.<br>
note theorems) the data seems to be transferred as I expect (in my first<br>
example above).</p>
<p>Kind regards<br>
Richard</p>
<p>P.S.: A full working example is attached<br>

Hi Richard,</p>
<p>my answer is twofold.</p>
<p>a) Your »workaround« with Local_Theory.background_theory is correct – as<br>
long as you want to store data in background theories only.  There are a<br>
couple of applications where this indeed is feasible, but it is usually<br>
not what you want.</p>
<p>b) The established pattern to store data generically is</p>
<p>Local_Theory.declaration (fn phi =&gt; …)</p>
<p>As a simple example, you might study src/HOL/Tools/functor.ML.</p>
<p>The idea is basically the following:</p>
<p>fun foo … lthy =<br>
  let<br>
    (We are relative to some local theory lthy here<br>
    and have some entities (terms t, theorems thm, …) relative<br>
    to lthy flying around as ML values here)<br>
    fun decl phi =<br>
      let<br>
        (We are called for each instance (interpretation)<br>
        of the original lthy, including lthy itself; the<br>
        logical difference is represented by morphism phi,<br>
        which we can apply (using Morphism.…) to transform our<br>
        original entities t, thm to obtain their appropriate<br>
        shape to do something with them relative<br>
        to the current instance)<br>
      in Data.put (a data record resulting from suitable) end;<br>
  in<br>
    lthy<br>
    |&gt; Local_Theory.declaration decl<br>
  end;</p>
<p>Put differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your data is of a certain type T.</li>
<li>
<p>You explain how a fundamental morphism phi is applied to a value of<br>
type T by giving a suitable lifting f :: morphism -&gt; T -&gt; T</p>
</li>

    fun decl phi = Data.put (f phi x)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no elaborate section on this in the<br>

more concrete description than this generic abstract nonsense can be given.</p>

Hi Richard,</p>
<p>as far as I discern, these are indeed the relevant patterns, although I<br>
personally prefer to think about this without historic references like<br>
»old way« ;-).</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
    Florian<br>

Sorry for resurrecting this somewhat dated thread. It seems the same saying<br>
that applies to PhD thesis also applies to Masters: They are never finished,<br>
only abandoned.</p>
<p>The strings are now out of my implementation, (actually for several months<br>
now) and all my usages of the global Local_Theory.background_theory are now<br>
replaced by using generic contexts and calls to Local_Theory.declaration, as<br>
was suggested here. ^1</p>
<p>Studying some other occurences in the code as suggested by Makarius I made the<br>
following observations for "How to converted global to localized code" in this<br>
setting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the command needs to store Generic_Data, Local_Theory.declaration is a<br>
   drop-in replacement for the old way (provided terms are parsed and not kept<br>
   as strings), as explained here before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the command transitions to the proof state and needs to store<br>
   Generic_Data afterwards, the call to Local_Theory.declaration needs to be in<br>
   the after_qed continuation function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Generic_Data is not to be modified by the command, reading it can be<br>
   accomplished by instantiating a generic context explicitly e.g. using<br>
   Context.Proof ^2</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have attached a theory file that demonstrates these on a toy example. I<br>
think that these are the appropriate solutions, but please point out any<br>
errors if I have gone wrong somewhere. Otherwise I hope these example may be<br>
helpful to others that want to update their older Isabelle/ML code.</p>
<p>Kind regards<br>
Richard</p>
