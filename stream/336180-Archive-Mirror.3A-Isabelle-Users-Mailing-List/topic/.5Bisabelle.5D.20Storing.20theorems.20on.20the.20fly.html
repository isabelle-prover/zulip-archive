<p>From: Ognjen Maric &lt;<a href="mailto:ognjen.maric@gmail.com">ognjen.maric@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm writing some Isabelle/ML code which, given a term, generates<br>
theorems about it. This is essentially a recursive function which<br>
generates theorems for the subterms and then combines them. A single<br>
subterm might appear many times, and I'd like to store the generated<br>
theorems to avoid repeating the work. Clearly, they could be manually<br>
threaded through the recursive calls, but I'd like to avoid doing the<br>
plumbing myself, especially since I'd like to be able to retrieve them<br>
later (outside of the function) as well.</p>
<p>So I assume I should be using one of the context.*_Data structures to<br>
store the theorems in an Item_Net (indexed by the terms). Questions:</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Right now I'm trying to do this from an ML {* *} block within Isar<br>
text, using Generic_Data and then storing the generated theorems with<br>
Context.&gt;&gt;. However, it appears that the theorems only actually get<br>
stored after the whole ML {* *} block is executed. Is this a feature,<br>
and if so, how to get around to it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could this be done within a proof tactic, and how?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Ognjen</p>

<p>Probably not.  Depends what you actually need.  Tactical proof steps <br>

<p>I wouldn't use "stateful" and "straightforward" in the same sentence. <br>
Even without the omnipresent parallelism in Isabelle, it is better to say <br>
explicitly how you fiddle with your values and updated environment.</p>
<p>See again section 0.3 "Canonical argument order" in <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2012/doc/implementation.pdf">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2012/doc/implementation.pdf</a> -- it <br>
is one of the success stories of Isabelle/ML.  We gradually eloborated <br>
this purely functional combinator style for aesthetic reasons over the <br>
years, and later we found ourselves in the lucky situation to be able to <br>
get on the multicore train early, with minimal cleanup of the code base.</p>
<p>Sequentialism is a very strong assumption that is better not imposed on <br>
any serious program today.</p>

<p>I've seen the AFP entry Refine_Monadic occasionally from a distance, but <br>
am not familiar with it.</p>
<p>Generally, it depends a lot how you want to organize things, or rather how <br>
you need to organize things.</p>
<p>Within a tactical expression or Isar proof method, you can access the <br>
Proof.context only as a local immutable value (of course it can be updated <br>
in a functional manner).  The context might contain funny quasi-functional <br>
elements, such as lazy values or caches of values, but that is <br>
semantically still functional.  You cannot have a tactic do some ad-hoc <br>
poking in a non-monotonic manner.</p>
<p>Within a proof, you can have commands updating the context according to <br>
its block structure.  The most basic approach is to make an attribute (see <br>
the 'attribute_setup' command in the isar-ref manual) and use that with <br>
'note' or other fact producing commands in the proof.  Whatever you do, it <br>
will be local to the proof.  Proofs are formally irrelevant, i.e. you <br>
cannot export anything from them.  The main result is specified before, <br>
and already determined before commencing the proof.</p>
<p>Within the theory context, you can have commands of the form "theory -&gt; <br>
theory" or "local_theory -&gt; local_theory".  You can store whatever you <br>
want in the theory context, as long as it is plain functional data in any <br>
of the senses above.</p>
<p>You could try to move results you discover within a proof back to the <br>
toplevel context, by exporting it in some logical obvious way.</p>
<p>In a trivial manner, this happens all the time when you work with <br>
Isabelle:</p>
<p>lemma B<br>
       .<br>
        .<br>
         .<br>
         fix x<br>
         assume "A x"<br>
         .<br>
         txt {* Oh, I need "lemma C x" *}</p>
<p>At that point you merely go back in the text and prepend this <em>before</em> it:</p>
<p>lemma<br>
     fixes x<br>
     assumes "A x"<br>
     shows "C x"</p>
<p>with its proof.  So you re-assemble the text in the editor, without funny <br>
tricks about implicit context extension in the middle of the other proof.</p>
<p>In more specific, or more complex situations, one could consider making <br>
this assembly of properly ordered proof documents supported by some tool. <br>
It is up to your imagination.</p>

<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:lammich@in.tum.de">lammich@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Sounds interesting. I have a similar problem, when trying to<br>
automatically refine terms to more executable versions (replacing sets<br>
by red-black-trees, etc.). Once the basic operations are proven,<br>
refining more complex terms is straightforward. However, in order to<br>
refine a term that contains defined constants (procedures in your<br>
speaking), one either has to prove a separate refinement lemma for each<br>
constant manually, or unfold all such constants beforehand (one then<br>
gets one big term, and looses the structure), or do something like you<br>
propose, i.e., extract those constants from the term first, and<br>
automatically generate refined versions.</p>
<p>We have experimented with the first two options already, and they are<br>
not too bad for our use-cases. For the third option, I thought about<br>
implementing it as an outer-level command, something like: <br>
  "refine constant as name", that would generate the refinement of<br>
constant (and, recursively, of all constants used in the term that need<br>
to be unfolded), then define a new constant name, and generate a<br>
refinement lemma name.refine: "new-constant refines constant".</p>
<p>Note the similarity of this problem to code generation: Also the<br>
code-generator collects code-theorems for constants and, recursively,<br>
for constants that are used in those code-theorems.</p>
