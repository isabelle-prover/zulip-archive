I have been annoyed by this behavior as well. To understand what is going<br>
on, it is helpful to look at the intermediate proof state using "next":</p>
<p>lemma "R n m = R' n m"<br>
proof (rule iffI)</p>
<p>The initial proof state is what you would expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>goal (2 subgoals):<br>
 1. R n m ==&gt; R' n m<br>
 2. R' n m ==&gt; R n m</p>
</blockquote>
<p>show "R n m ==&gt; R' n m" sorry<br>
next</p>
<p>Now the proof state is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>goal (2 subgoals):<br>
 1. R n m ==&gt; R n m<br>
 2. R' n m ==&gt; R n m</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of solving the first subgoal, it just replaced it with another one.<br>
Basically, it has applied "R n m ==&gt; R' n m" to the first subgoal, as an<br>
introduction rule.</p>
<p>show "R' n m ==&gt; R n m" sorry<br>
next</p>
<p>After this step, the proof state is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>goal (2 subgoals):<br>
 1. R n m ==&gt; R' n m<br>
 2. R' n m ==&gt; R n m</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently, it applied "R' n m ==&gt; R n m" to the first subgoal, which<br>
returns us to the original proof state. If it had applied the rule to the<br>
second subgoal instead, then qed would have worked. Evidently, Isar works by<br>
applying the rule to the first subgoal that matches.</p>
<p>By the way, I just realized that your proof script works if you prove the<br>
subgoals in the opposite order:</p>
<p>lemma "R n m = R' n m"<br>
proof (rule iffI)<br>
  show "R' n m ==&gt; R n m" sorry<br>
  show "R n m ==&gt; R' n m" sorry<br>
qed</p>
<p>Using "next" just before the "qed" shows the proof state to be nothing but<br>
trivial implications, which can be discharged by "qed".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>goal (2 subgoals):<br>
 1. R n m ==&gt; R n m<br>
 2. R' n m ==&gt; R' n m</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, it seems that using "show" with a meta-implication (==&gt;)<br>
discharges the first subgoal that matches the conclusion, and adds new<br>
subgoals corresponding to each assumption. I would be surprised if this is<br>
an intentional feature of Isar; my guess is that it is an accidental feature<br>
of the way Isar proofs are implemented.</p>
<p>Here's a proof script that I came up with that takes advantage of this<br>
"feature".</p>
<p>lemma "Q &amp; P ==&gt; P &amp; Q"<br>
proof -<br>
  show "P ==&gt; Q ==&gt; P &amp; Q" by (rule conjI)<br>
  show "Q &amp; P ==&gt; P" by (rule conjunct2)<br>
  show "Q &amp; P ==&gt; Q" by (rule conjunct1)<br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This surprising behaviour is mostly due to a misunderstanding how Isar <br>
works, and due to old-style tactic goal output that does not fully fit <br>
into the picture.</p>
<p>Whenever you see a subgoal like</p>
<p>!!x. A x ==&gt; B x</p>
<p>the system tells you that you may assume A x for some fixed x, and need to <br>
show B x in the end.  So your standard answer will be like that:</p>
<p>fix x<br>
   assume "A x"<br>
   show "B x"</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, framework connectives !! / ==&gt; rarely show up in <br>
structured texts at all (specifications and proofs).  It is a bit like <br>
lambda abstraction in functional programming languages: most of the time <br>
you don't see them, even though they are present in the guts of the <br>
system.</p>
<p>So this is how to prove an equivalence:</p>
<p>lemma "A &lt;-&gt; B"<br>
   proof<br>
     assume A then show B &lt;proof&gt;<br>
   next<br>
     assume B then show A &lt;proof&gt;<br>

Hello Christian,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma "R n m = R' n m"<br>
proof (rule iffI)<br>
  show "R n m ==&gt; R' n m" sorry<br>
  show "R' n m ==&gt; R n m" sorry -- "*"<br>
qed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem here is that you use meta-implication "==&gt;" within the <br>
"show" statement. "show" only tries to match the assumptions made by <br>
"assume" and the conclusion of the "show" with the goals to decide which <br>
goal to solve. Since you have no assumes, "R' n m" unifies with the <br>
first goal and the assumptions in the "show" statement become your new <br>
proof goals. However, the solved goal contained the assumption "R n m", <br>
so this is normally not a problem as qed can discharge this.</p>
<p>If you look at the proof state after the first sorry, you see the two goals:</p>
<p>"R n m ==&gt; R n m"<br>
"R' n m ==&gt; R n m"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your next "show" has the conclusion "R n m", which <br>
unifies with the first goal, so the first goal gets solved again instead <br>
of the second.</p>
<p>A simple solution would be to insert "prefer 2" between your two proofs, <br>
but it would be better style to use proper assumes:</p>
<p>lemma "R n m = R' n m"<br>
proof (rule iffI)<br>
   assume "R n m" thus "R' n m" sorry<br>
next<br>
   assume "R' n m" thus "R n m" sorry<br>
qed</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Andreas Lochbihler</p>
