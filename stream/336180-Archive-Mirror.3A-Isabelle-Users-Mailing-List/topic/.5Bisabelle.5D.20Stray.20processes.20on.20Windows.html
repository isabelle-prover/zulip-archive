<p>In principle, I made several things in the process management more robust. <br>
Some of that could cause new problems nonetheless.</p>
<p>Isabelle2013-1 also has an updated version of Cygwin, which could in <br>
principle be less reliable than the one we've had before.  This has <br>
happened before, but so far there is no proof for that.</p>

<p>After I closed jEdit, a bunch of processes terminated, including a poly.exe, <br>

<p>poly.exe<br>

bash.exe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks like the normal collection of processes for the prover backend. <br>
Normally, stopping jEdit and its Isabelle/jEdit plugin should terminate <br>
the processes as well.  There is also a global JVM shutdown handler: <br>
regular termination of the Java runtime should dispose any add-on <br>
processes.</p>
<p>This does not work though, if the JVM is in bad state and needs to be <br>
terminated the hard way, i.e. the light is switched of with the hammer.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm pretty sure the two things always go together. If a poly.exe process <br>
is still running after I exit Isabelle/jEdit, it's because it got <br>
orphaned somehow when Isabelle/jEdit was running. As to "additional <br>
instances", I frequently see multiple instances of poly.exe running, <br>
sometimes starting up, and then being shut down, so I don't know under <br>
what circumstances a poly.exe process is supposed to be running. There's <br>
two running right now, and there's nothing wrong.</p>
<p>You go into the differences between Sledgehammer and the code generator <br>
below. All I associate these non-terminated processes to is when Isar <br>
commands stay purple for a long time; that is, that some heavy <br>
processing is going on. In the case of the code generator, it has to do <br>
a bunch of processing to generate the code, and then to write it to <br>
disk. That's all I associate it with.</p>
<p>(Here, I go on a "Isabelle/jEdit" tangent. In the last sentence, I had a <br>
need to refer to Isabelle/jEdit twice. The result was that the <br>
characters I used from using "Isabelle/" twice make up about 10% of the <br>
sentence. These days, I now understand that Isabelle/jEdit is a <br>
significant deviation from jEdit, and that it deserves a different name, <br>
however, there is the need for language to be efficient.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that you use a "path/filename" naming scheme, and <br>
it's a universal practice for people to drop the "path" in <br>
"path/filename" when the context is clear. That doesn't actually apply <br>
to me anymore because, as I said, I now understand that Isabelle/jEdit <br>
deserves a separate name from jEdit, and likewise for Isabelle/ML. As to <br>
Isabelle/Scala, I don't understand that at all, because I don't see that <br>
you've tweaked the standard distribution of Scala. I only see that you <br>
use it and distribute it.</p>
<p>This is sort of a complaint, but you don't need to respond to it. At <br>
this point, there are no good solutions when I have a need to refer to <br>
Isabelle/jEdit many times is a short amount of space. I can call it <br>
"it", but I need to be more explicit most of the time. I can call it <br>
"jEdit," but I know it's not supposed to be called "jEdit," because it's <br>
not "jEdit". My solution, maybe, is to start calling it "PIDE". That's 4 <br>
characters, which is efficient, as long as the meaning is clear.)</p>

<p>I think these things happen more when I'm typing something new, <br>
commenting out something, or uncommenting something. Basically, when <br>
demanding processes are going back and forth between getting started and <br>
terminated, because of the three things I just mentioned, and them <br>
happening a lot withing a short period of time.</p>
<p>The fact that Isabelle2012 and Isbelle2013 were good at shutting down <br>
processes got me in the habit of not even thinking about causing any <br>
problems, but I can start turning the prover on and off before I do <br>
things that will invoke all these automatic processes.</p>

<p>"PIDE" is fine -- it is the umbrella term for the "Prover IDE" concepts <br>
and implementations, and covers all particular implementations, e.g. <br>
Isabelle/jEdit, Isabelle/Eclipse (Newcastle), clide (Bremen).</p>
<p>The confusion of the "Isabelle/jEdit" prover IDE with the "jEdit" text <br>
editor is particularly critical, since "jEdit" is a well-known brand in <br>
certain communities.  Posting about Isabelle/jEdit on Stackoverflow or on <br>
the jedit mailing lists, but calling it just "jEdit" would cause <br>
unnecessary problems.</p>
<p>And yes, Isabelle/jEdit adds so much to the basic jEdit substrate that it <br>
deserves its own branding.  (I did not anticipate so much extra work when <br>
I started the project around 2008.)</p>

OK, I have learned something about 'export_code': using SML as target <br>
language seems to run a separate Isabelle/ML process to check the result. <br>
(In your example you've hand only Scala and Haskell, though.)</p>
<p>I have experimented with export_code in SML myself, but did not manage to <br>
see left-over processes after 10-20 times reloading of the example theory <br>
(Windows 2008, 4 cores).</p>
<p>Since you see poly.exe processes in particular, there might be a new <br>
problem introduced in the way I start Poly/ML 5.5.1 in Isabelle2013-1, <br>
instead of Poly/ML 5.5.0 in Isabelle2013.  This is just another theory, as <br>
alternative to postulate a problem with the Cygwin update.</p>
<p>To try it yourself, you can downgrade Isabelle2013-1 to Poly/ML 5.5.0 as <br>
follows:</p>
<p>* Open $ISABELLE_HOME/etc/components in Isabelle/jEdit (the file name<br>
     can be typed like that in the file browser).</p>
<p>* Replace the line "polyml-5.5.1-1" by "polyml-5.5.0-3" (without<br>
     touching anything else).</p>
<p>* Quit Isabelle/jEdit and run Isabelle2013-1\Cygwin-Terminal.bat</p>
<p>* On the command line run "isabelle components -a", which will download<br>
     and unpack the requested Poly/ML version.</p>
<p>Now you can close the terminal and restart Isabelle/jEdit -- it will <br>
rebuild your standard logic image, which is normally "HOL".  In this new <br>
situation, the starting of external poly.exe processes works more like in <br>
Isabelle2013.</p>

<p>I'm not having problems now, but then, I'm not demanding much of the <br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
A few more remarks, after looking once again over the external process <br>
management of Isabelle/Scala and Isabelle/ML.</p>
<p>Process management according to POSIX only allows flat (non-nested) <br>
process groups and asynchronous (unacknowledged) signals to kill another <br>
process.  To give the appearance of managed hierarchies of processes, the <br>
Isabelle framework implements certain common-sense heuristics that usually <br>
work, but implicitly depend on a reasonable degree of reactivity.</p>
<p>Under heavy load, though, a process that is signalled to terminate, but <br>
remains unresponspive for too long, is killed the hard way.  Thus it has <br>
no chance to terminate its sub-processes properly.</p>
<p>This explains why an abrupt termination of the outermost PIDE application <br>
can leave some external processes at the bottom of the hierarchy behind.</p>

I recently learned that recent linux kernels (&gt;=3.4) allow setting the<br>
PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER flag on a process. Basically this means that all<br>
(indirect) children of this process will be reparented to it instead of<br>
PID 1, when their parent dies.</p>
<p>So this would allow better management of processes, but is of course not<br>
yet very portable. I would be willing to investigate this further, if<br>
there is any interest in that.</p>

Linux has many interesting things that are not generally known nor used.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds has recently given an interview with two notable points: <br>
(1) most people ignore the really good things of the Linux kernel -- for <br>
portability reasons, and (2) Linux desktop projects are all really bad, <br>
and the continuous forking of projects works against the whole movement <br>
towards total world domination.</p>
<p>Anyway, when I say "POSIX", it means the intersection of Mac OS X, Windows </p>
<ul>
<li>Cygwin, and Linux.  In this equation, Linux is more and more getting on <br>
the fringe, due to the bad state of major Linux distributions in the past <br>
1-2 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing it this time, I was just surprised how nice and stable Ubuntu 10.04 <br>
was compared to current versions (not just Ubuntu, also other Linux <br>
distributions).  I still need to get my own machine back into shape, and <br>
will probably try Centos next.  (At the danger of missing messed-up <br>
Debian/Ubuntu packages of basic Unix tools the next time.)</p>

This should be resolved in Isabelle2013-2-RC3 -- I won't blame Stephan <br>
Schulz again for his creative signal handlers in the C code of E Prover.</p>
<p>As long as you stay within Isabelle/jEdit, external processes should be <br>
terminated eventually.  When you close the Windows application while the <br>
prover process is really busy with external loads, there is the old danger <br>
of dangling tail ends of such processes.</p>
<p>What is missing here for future releases: a proper PIDE application <br>
shutdown phase that notiates with the prover process via the PIDE <br>
protocol, not crude POSIX signals.</p>

This side-remarked greatly helped to figure out that a paractical problem <br>
was still remaining, until I addressed that in the present <br>
Isabelle2013-2-RC3 --- 2 days left for testing.</p>
