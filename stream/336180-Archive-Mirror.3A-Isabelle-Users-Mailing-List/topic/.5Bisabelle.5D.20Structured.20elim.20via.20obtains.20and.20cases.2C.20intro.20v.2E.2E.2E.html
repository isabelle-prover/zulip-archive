<p>From: Gidon Ernst &lt;<a href="mailto:gidon.ernst@unimelb.edu.au">gidon.ernst@unimelb.edu.au</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>I have feedback wrt. documentation and a question (I guess a feature request).<br>
Sorry if these points have been raised before.</p>
<p>I really like obtains in lemmas with the ability to specify multiple cases.<br>
It helped to streamline my Isar proofs a lot and I think it should be advertised more in the documentation.<br>
The documentation could be more explicit about the fact(s) "that" which you can use to prove such lemmas (e.g. in Sec 2.2.2), as I found out about it accidentally via sledgehammer only (it is mentioned in fact somewhere at the very end of the manual, but hard to spot).<br>
Also, I'd note that "that" in an inductive lemma<br>
  assumes A obtains B using A proof (induction ...)<br>
refers to the outer context, not the properly generalized one, and is therefore useless. Could this be fixed somehow?</p>
<p>Secondly, how about a similar construct for introduction rules?<br>
Applying an introduction lemma for C<br>
 assumes a: "!!x. A ==&gt; B" shows C<br>
could generate a structure comparable to a cases rule that does the "fix x assume a: A show B" for you, possibly extending to multiple assumptions.<br>
Is there a mechanism for this? It would amount to multiple "case ..." with <em>different</em> conclusions, which I understand does not work currently.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot and best regards,<br>
  Gidon</p>

<p>A proof method mainly operates on the goal state, but local facts are<br>
not part of that. The "cases" / "induct" family of proof methods make an<br>
exception in providing named cases as small local proof contexts to be<br>
activated later. This is a concession to the requirements of complex<br>
induction schemes.</p>

<p>Thanks for the pointer. I've seen obtain and used it occasionally, and<br>
it permits one to name facts as in "obtain x where a: A".<br>

<p>Having names for conclusions of lemmas that "shows a: A B" that get<br>

there is no need to spell out "A" or refer to it by position "a(1)" when<br>

<p>That would be great! (Do you still remember why you dismissed that<br>

<p>That said, I've been using Isabelle for ~6 month now and I quite enjoy it.</p>

<p>"lemma obtains" corresponds to "consider" within a proof body: it states <br>
an elimination (possible) with case split. "obtain" is for a one-arm <br>
case split where the rule is used on the spot to augment the local <br>
context, and later dispose the assumptions again thanks to the proven rule.</p>

<p>"lemma shows" is merely a syntactic device of the long form of rule <br>
statements "fixes-assumes-shows". The name attached there is the name of <br>
the overall conclusion of the lemma.</p>

<p>The generic problem is to find just the right amount of explicitness in <br>
proofs that they become readable and maintainable. Being too implicit <br>
can destroy this delicate balance (e.g. via automatic name bindings for <br>
obscure goal artifacts); the same can happen by being too explicit (e.g. <br>
big generated goal statements copied into the text, without symbolic <br>
abbreviations for certain sub-terms).</p>
<p>Existing Isar (the current version from 2016) already spans a broad <br>
range of possibilities: it is often just a matter of style how to use it <br>
in applications. The language also tolerates "improper" elements like <br>
"apply" or "supply" and semi-proper ones like "subgoal" and "goal_cases" <br>
(see the index of the isar-ref manual).</p>
<p>In particular, the last two might help in your applications, but it is <br>
hard to tell without looking at the applications concretely.</p>
