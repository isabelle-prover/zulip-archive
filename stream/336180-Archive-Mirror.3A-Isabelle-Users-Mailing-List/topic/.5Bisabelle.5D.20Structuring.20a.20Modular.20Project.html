Hi All,</p>
<p>I'm working on a medium-sized project with two libraries, call them A and<br>
B, and a main project P which uses A and B. A and B are both general enough<br>
that many other projects could use them, i.e. I want them to be treated<br>
like static libraries. Eventually I would like to post A, B, and P on<br>
Github so that others can use A and B independently, or use P with A and B.<br>
Right now it looks like these are my two options:</p>
<p>1. Configure A and B each with a Makefile which performs, for example,<br>
   $ isabelle build -b -d . A</p>
<p>2. Expect any project which uses A and/or B to import them by providing<br>
   a path in the preamble, for example<br>
   theory P imports "&lt;path-to-A&gt;/A" "&lt;path-to-B&gt;/B" begin</p>
<p>I'm not fond of option 1 because it requires building two heaps which<br>
amount to ~500MB, and requires the user to invoke Isabelle/JEdit from the<br>
command line with paths to A and/or B. I'm also not fond of option 2<br>
because then the user must hardcode into .thy file in his/her own project<br>
the path to A or to B. Thus source code will become less portable. Are<br>
there any better options?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Scott Constable</p>

There are two more:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>&lt;path-to-A&gt; can be a relative path and you could expect the user to put A and B in specific relative locations to where they are used (e.g. using symlinks).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use "$A_HOME/A” in the import statement (i.e. a variable) and expect the user to have that variable set</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cheers,<br>

Hi,</p>
<p>the upcoming Isabelle 2016-1 release features "incremental" heap images;<br>
that is, heaps won't be cumulative anymore. That will drastically reduce<br>
the total size of your ".isabelle" directory.</p>
<p>Note that it is impossible to "join" two different heap images: Each<br>
Isabelle session must have exactly one parent. So when you want to<br>
declare a "ROOT" file for your project "P", you have to choose either<br>
"A" or "B" as the parent (or choose "HOL" instead). The other theories<br>
then have to be imported, as Gerwin indicated, by either relative or<br>
parametrized paths.</p>
<p>In the AFP, it is customary to use the relative path convention <em>inside</em><br>
the repository. But from the outside, users usually register the AFP as<br>
a "component", so that they can write</p>
<p>imports "$AFP/Collections/..."</p>
<p>If looks like in your case, relative paths seem to be the way to go. You<br>
could also consider using Git submodules for "A" and "B" in "P"; that<br>
way, your users don't have to manually clone "A" and "B" to the expected<br>
locations.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>

<p>The canonical way is to post things to the Archive of Formal Proofs<br>
<a href="https://www.isa-afp.org">https://www.isa-afp.org</a> -- once they have reached a certain maturity and<br>
stability.</p>
<p>Material on AFP has the advantage that it follows changes of Isabelle<br>
"automagically". Sometimes people have tried to follow Isabelle releases<br>
independently (e.g. see<br>
<a href="https://staff.aist.go.jp/y-isobe/CSP-Prover/CSP-Prover.html">https://staff.aist.go.jp/y-isobe/CSP-Prover/CSP-Prover.html</a>), but<br>
usually there comes a point where isolated projects are longer updated<br>
and thus fall into decay. (Luckily the CSP-Prover guys seem to have made<br>
it again for Isabelle2016, after some years stagnation.)</p>

<p>What is the purpose of the Makefile here? Dependencies are already<br>
managed by isabelle build and the ROOT files. Also note that "make"<br>
tools are not portable and merely cause problems to users. We managed to<br>
get rid of make in Isabelle2012.</p>
<p>Generally, Isabelle session heap images should not be taking too<br>
seriously. This is not a C compiler that turns .c into .o files. It is<br>
more like a "dumped world snapshot" like in the old LISP times. This<br>
aspect might become again more visible, when the Isabelle Prover IDE<br>
supports its own model of persistence, without command-line builds<br>
getting in the way.</p>
<p>In Isabelle2016 we still see a bit of a hybrid of quasi-static builds,<br>
but the general move is away from it. Think of it is a formal word<br>
processor that somehow provides ways to make system snapshots persistent.</p>

<p>From: scott constable &lt;<a href="mailto:sdconsta@syr.edu">sdconsta@syr.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks to everyone for the responses. The reason I'm using a Makefile is<br>
because several of the theories are being generated by ott, and Make helps<br>
to coordinate that process; at the moment I don't see a feasible<br>
cross-platform option.</p>
<p>The solution I'm leaning towards is one where A, B, and P can be their own<br>
standalone git repositories, but the use of P expects A and B to be cloned<br>
within P at pre-specified locations. This is analogous to the way the<br>
LLVM/clang project is set up: LLVM and clang must be cloned in specific<br>
locations relative to one another.</p>
