<p>From: Tambet &lt;<a href="mailto:qtvali@gmail.com">qtvali@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
So I have this:</p>
<p>inductive cf :: "nat =&gt; nat =&gt; bool" where<br>
 cnf[intro!]:<br>
  "cnat n ==&gt; cf (cn n) n" |<br>
 cff[intro!]:<br>
  "cf m n ==&gt; cf (cn m) n"</p>
<p>fun cfe :: "nat =&gt; nat =&gt; bool" where<br>
  "cfe m n = ((m = n) | (cf m n))"</p>
<p>And want to show these:</p>
<p>lemma cfef:<br>
   assumes "cnat a"<br>
   assumes "cf b a"<br>
   shows "cfe b (cn a)"</p>
<p>lemma cfff:<br>
   assumes "cnat a"<br>
   assumes "cf b a"<br>
   assumes "cf c b"<br>
   shows "cf c a"</p>
<p>I did search similar proofs for Nat.thy, but what I found were rather<br>
cryptic and didn't show their inner structure (as they were all using<br>
tactics). I did not find proof for "a &lt; b &amp; b &lt;= c ==&gt; a &lt; c", which would<br>
have been probably most direct match. Also I would like to know, how to name<br>
those lemmas according to Isabelle's standards and style guidelines. Second<br>
one of those is more needed, but first one seems to be simpler.</p>
<p>I would be happy to get any or all of these:</p>
<p>- Way(s) to prove this using structured Isar proof.<br>
   - Way(s) to prove this using automated tactics.<br>
   - Explanation about those tactics.<br>
   - Link to manual pages, which do not assume too wide knowledge about<br>
   Isabelle as prerequisite (but the ones, which do, would also be better than<br>
   nothing).</p>
<p>As it is very commonly needed thing to prove things about similar functions,<br>
I would like to catch the underlying logic, thus a few words of explanation<br>
would be very nice.</p>

<p>I tried to prove this by induction:</p>
<p>lemma cfef: "cf b a ==&gt; cnat a ==&gt; cfe b (cn a)"<br>
proof(induct rule: cf.induct)<br>
  case cnf show ?case by simp<br>
next<br>
  case (cff m n) thus ?case<br>
apply auto</p>
<p>But this leads to the goal</p>
<ol>
<li>[| cf (cn n) n; cnat n; cn (cn n) ~= cn n |] ==&gt; cf n (cn n)</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't see how to prove this. In fact, I doubt that the lemma is<br>
provable: the def of cf never forces cn into the second argument, but<br>
your lemmas requires to show that cn shows up in the second argument.<br>
Maybe it is provable given the actual definition of cn.</p>
