Hi,</p>
<p>if I have a common problem, in many programming languages the problem<br>
can be solved by typing it into google. Unfortunately, this isn't the<br>
case with isabelle. Therefore, I suggest to collect common isabelle<br>
user question in the wiki, such that they can be indexed by google. As<br>
an example, I created two pages with such problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community/Category:Tips_and_Tricks">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community/Category:Tips_and_Tricks</a></p>
<p>I find myself to look at my code very often to remember how to<br>
instantiate an existential quantifier in apply style. The great thing<br>
about a wiki is, that you can warn there, that apply style is somewhat<br>
deprecated. Also, I found that I reimplemented filter to remove<br>
elements from a list (thanks Peter for pointing that out!). I guess,<br>
others might have similar problems?</p>
<p>Collecting these common questions in the wiki, indexable by google,<br>
would be a great thing.</p>
<p>Regards<br>
  Cornelius</p>

<p>The Isabelle mailing lists are also indexed by search engines like <br>
google, a more common problem is that either the question was not asked <br>

Just do it.  These community platforms don't depend on central decrees to <br>
work. It merely requires on a critical mass of people moving in a certain <br>
direction.</p>

<p>I thought I had something to contribute to the wiki as well (at least<br>
after my next, upcoming paper deadline).</p>
<p>Off-list Makarius had pointed out some anti-patterns to me, which I had<br>
used in a formalisation.  So I thought why not put such examples on a<br>
wiki page and explain how to do them right.</p>
<p>I know stackexchange but rather just as a reader so far.  I am a wiki<br>
expert but also know that it's no use using them without a critical mass<br>
of participants.</p>
<p>OK, now I wonder how to put "facts" on stackexchange.  I am not, at<br>
least not in this case, planning to ask questions and wait for them to<br>
be answered, nor am I planning to answer questions in this case, but: I<br>
had done something (i.e. written some Isabelle code), I got feedback on<br>
it how to improve it, and this whole result of "instead of &lt;foo&gt; do<br>
&lt;bar&gt; because …" I would like to share with the rest of the world.  (And<br>
of course I wouldn't mind a further discussion thread getting appended<br>

<p>Is there any easy pattern for doing this on stackexchange?</p>

<p>This depends. Stackexchange is really a Q&amp;A format. If you can phrase <br>
your problem as a real question and then subsequently answer it <br>
yourself, this is fine (you can look on <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.org">meta.stackoverflow.org</a> for <br>
guidelines).</p>
<p>However, if there is not a real question, it is off-topic there. This <br>
holds in particular for things where there is no "correct" answer.</p>
<p>Please don't refrain from writing this down somewhere, just because some <br>
consider the status of the wiki unclear.</p>

<p>For me, it is often not about the answers, but about the questions.<br>
Different people approach problems from different angles. A reference <br>
manual will be organized by the inner structure of the software. A <br>
tutorial is about getting an overview, not about solving concrete problems.</p>
<p>We need users to pose their own questions. And usually, the answer will <br>
not just be a pointer to the official documentation. The answers may get <br>
out of date (which is a much bigger problem for the system internals <br>
than for the Isar level), but if they are on platforms where editing is <br>
possible, we can always comment on that, if we find that users get confused.</p>
<p>Whether this is on the wiki or an services like stackexchange[1], I <br>
don't really care. And I think neither of them needs an endorsement of <br>
the project leaders, just enough users contributing. And none of them<br>
could replace the mailing list, because they are not made for discussions.</p>

<p>Currently, of the stackexchange sites, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> would be the <br>
site where questions to using Isabelle are on-topic. This probably <br>
excludes questions regarding the logical foundations.</p>

Note that historically, I was the one to initiate the server (for a <br>
different purpose), later handed over its administration to someone else, <br>
and supported the plan for rededication as Isabelle community wiki.  I <br>
also encouraged people on isabelle-users more than once to contribute <br>
there.</p>
<p>My complaints about the wiki only started when it was used for internal <br>
administrative information about the hard process to keep Isabelle <br>
running.  (You are in fact yourself one of the very few people involved in <br>
that administration.)</p>
<p>What is also depressing for me is to see old emails of mine from <br>
isabelle-dev (about Isabelle build) pasted there out-of-context.  In the <br>
meantime I had spent several weeks to update Isabelle READMEs and manuals <br>
to cover the new build tool.  Instead of pointing out omissions in the <br>
published documentation, there is this cloning of outdated information.</p>

You are actually one of those few who have answered questions under the <br>
"isabelle" tag on stackexchange already.</p>
<p>I have started looking myself yesterday.  I do see a difference in the <br>
structure compared to raw wiki (MediaWiki) -- which is indeed <br>
old-fashioned as was pointed out before this thread was moved from <br>
isabelle-dev to isabelle-users.</p>
<p>Stackexchange is not just this chaotic editing by anyone, and later the <br>
reader needs to sort out archeological layers himself, to learn who said <br>
what at some point in history, and how relevant or trustworthy the <br>
information.  It has a little bit of organization of these layers of <br>
editing, voting up or down etc.</p>
<p>Of course, I can hardly say how it works out in practice, being there <br>
member for less than 24 h, but my first impressions are quite good. <br>
Yesterday I was at 1 point reputation and had 1 bronce badge (for reading <br>
the introductory documentation).  Just looking again I've already got +30 <br>
points and a "teacher" badge. So I won't have to go out and slay some <br>
monsters in this game, to get more points :-)</p>
