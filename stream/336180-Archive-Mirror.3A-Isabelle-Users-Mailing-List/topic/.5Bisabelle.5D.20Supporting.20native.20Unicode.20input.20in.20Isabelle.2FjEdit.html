<p>From: Christoph LANGE &lt;<a href="mailto:math.semantic.web@gmail.com">math.semantic.web@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle community,</p>
<p>in a private conversation with Makarius I had asked the following<br>
question, which I should rather share on this list:</p>
<p>I wonder why Isabelle/jEdit does not support native Unicode input, but<br>
only uses Unicode for display?  Are there historical reasons, or is it a<br>
deliberate design choice?  Nowadays, where Unicode is widely supported,<br>
there are ways of directly entering a wide range of characters.  I<br>
mapped, e.g., “ ” … – on keys of my keyboard, which is why I'm also<br>
using them in LaTeX.  Some people go further; consider e.g. the Neo<br>
keyboard layout <a href="http://www.neo-layout.org/">http://www.neo-layout.org/</a> (for English see<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_keyboard_layout#Neo">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_keyboard_layout#Neo</a>), which even has a<br>
plane for mathematical symbols.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Christoph</p>

<p>Taking this question in isolation, it actually should work both for input <br>
and display.  The prover sources are stored in a certain text format as <br>
Isabelle "symbols", but that is treated as "encoding" by jEdit, so you <br>
will edit the text in UTF-16 of the JVM.  This is not fundamentally <br>
different from having external files in UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 etc. all <br>
recoded to the UTF-16 of Java before editing it.</p>
<p>It is up to the JVM, jEdit, or other input methods to produce such unicode <br>
glyphs.  Copy-and-paste should also work as long as you stay within the <br>
Unicode image of the prover sources.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, I used this myself two times:</p>
<p>* In one of the private mails to you, I made some Isar proofs that were <br>
copied from Isabelle/jEdit into the terminal where my mail client was <br>
running.  This worked sometimes but not always: the combination of <br>
terminal + alpine had sometimes problems coping with the multibyte UTF-8 <br>
version of the text, so in the end I was not 100% sure if you actually <br>
received the proof in a way I had in mind.</p>
<p>* Posting a small Isar proof on stackoverflow, via the same copy-paste <br>
technique JVM -&gt; Firefox, it worked without problems.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There is a long story behind that, some of it is discussed in my MKM 2011 <br>
paper, see section 2.1 in <br>
<a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/papers/isabelle-doc.pdf">http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/papers/isabelle-doc.pdf</a></p>
<p>In short, I do not subscribe to the "universality" of Unicode, there are <br>
just a bit too many problems with it.  The approach in Isabelle/Scala and <br>
Isabelle/jEdit is to use it as "poor man's mathematical rendering" in the <br>
front-end -- so your funny keyboard should work with it after some <br>
convincing.  The prover itself is free from Unicode worries, and the <br>
ongoing evolution of the Unicode standards in the past decades.  Theory <br>
sources are stored persistenly in a unicode-free manner, but it tolerates <br>
native UTF-8 to some extent.</p>
<p>After the experience of struggling with the many faces of Unicode in the <br>
past 3 years, I would go as far to say that an LCF-style prover should <br>
<em>not</em> allow Unicode at its kernel.  There are just too many dangers of <br>
getting things utterly wrong (e.g. code-points being swapped or normalized <br>
according to strict rules of the standard, which are sometimes implemented <br>
in this way or that way.)</p>

<p>Indeed it does.  I'm no longer sure how I came up with this question a<br>
few months back.  Maybe it didn't work in the 2012 version?  I don't<br>
remember.</p>

<p>Given all these different encodings I agree that it does not make sense<br>
to arbitrarily choose one of them as the preferred one for *.thy files,<br>
as this does not ensure that there won't be some text editor messing it<br>
up, e.g. an editor that only supports UTF-8 and that assumes any file to<br>
be in UTF-8.</p>
