Hi all proof lovers,</p>
<p>After the Isar reference, I typed this in Isabelle/jEdit:</p>
<p>notepad<br>
   begin<br>
     fix n :: nat<br>
     have "P n"<br>
     proof (induct n)<br>
       case 0<br>
         show ?case sorry<br>
     next<br>
       case (Suc n)<br>
         from Suc.hyps show ?case sorry<br>
    qed<br>
   end</p>
<p>As the syntax from the PDF is not always exact (mainly characters issues),  <br>
I though there was an error there too, and felt “(Suc n)” should be  <br>
enclosed in quote, as an HOL expression. But doing so, I get this in the  <br>
Output pan:</p>
<p>Unknown case: "(Suc n)"</p>
<p>Is “(Suc n)”, and HOL or Isar expression? If that's an HOL expression as I  <br>
believe, then why do I get that error report?</p>

<p>I got it, that's in “Synopsis.thy”, and modulo the indentation, that's the  <br>
same, there is no quote too:</p>

     fix n :: nat<br>
     have "P n"<br>
     proof (induct n)<br>

<p>So, what's the expression type of “(Suc n)” at the line whose text is  <br>
“case (Suc n)”? Isn't “(Suc n)” an HOL expression? It appears in the text  <br>
as if it was an Isar expression, but I feel sure it's not. I'm lost with  <br>
that point.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I don't know much more than you, so you should keep that in mind for the <br>
future.</p>
<p>"Suc" is the successor function, and it comes from <br>
"Isabelle2012/src/HOL/Nat.thy". This is where those "declare" commands <br>
come in handy. I attach "I.thy". It has all the declare and print <br>
commands I found that looked useful. Delete what you don't want, or <br>
don't use any of it. I keep it open in jEdit all the time, that's why it <br>
has a short name.</p>
<p>In particular, I used:</p>
<p>declare[[names_unique=true]]   declare[[show_consts=true]]</p>
<p>In the output panel, it shows me:</p>
<p>constants:<br>
   prop :: (prop ⇒ prop)<br>
   Nat.Suc :: (Nat.nat ⇒ Nat.nat)</p>
<p>Isar as a language is independent of HOL. Isar can be used in any logic, <br>
such as Isabelle/ZF.</p>
<p>HOL is one of the many logics in Isabelle2012/src, although it's the <br>
most popular one.</p>
<p>"Expression" is an ambiguous word that can be used in lots of different <br>
ways.</p>
<p>Isar, as I understand it, is a link between the "inner syntax" and the <br>
"outer syntax", where HOL expressions would be "inner syntax". This is <br>
covered in Chapter 3 of isar-ref.pdf, and on Page 5 of prog-prove.pdf. I <br>
think "outer syntax" is related to the meta-logic which comes from <br>
"src/Pure". Isar is tied into Pure, and Pure is the foundation for <br>
logics such as HOL.</p>
<p>Putting in extraneous information here, where I use the ambiguous term <br>
"expression", I'll go out on a limb and say, "A HOL expression is always <br>
an Isar expression, but an Isar expression is not always a HOL expression."</p>
<p>I attach a screen shot to show you the useful information you get from <br>
five of the declare commands being true.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:c-sterna@jaist.ac.jp">c-sterna@jaist.ac.jp</a>&gt;<br>
To answer the original question:</p>
<p>Here 'case (Suc n)' as well as 'case 0' (above) are part of Isar not <br>
HOL. We could also just use 'case 0' and 'case Suc', then it is more <br>
clear that we are just giving names of facts (those names are <br>
automatically established when starting with 'proof (induct n)'). The <br>
variant 'case (Suc n)' of 'case Suc' is just a nicety to allow giving <br>
explicit names to variables (which makes proofs more robust). If you <br>
want to see to what fact 'Suc' refers, just use 'from Suc' directly <br>
below the 'case' line.</p>
<p>cheers</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Christian already gave you the answer, but I was hot on the trail <br>
because it occurred to me to use "print_theorem" under "case (Suc n)", <br>
which Christian had given as a tip some days ago. This all ties into <br>
differentiating between Isar and HOL.</p>
<p>"case" is an Isar command that's described on page 129 of isar-ref.pdf. <br>
If you try to put quotes like this:</p>
<p>case ("Suc n")</p>
<p>then you get the error:</p>
<p>Outer syntax error: name declaration expected, but keyword ) was found</p>
<p>The outer syntax error substantiates that "case" is not HOL syntax, <br>
because HOL syntax is inner syntax.</p>
<p>Put "print_theorems" under "case (Suc n)", and you get this:</p>
<p>facts:<br>
&lt;unnamed&gt;: ((P∷(Nat.nat ⇒ HOL.bool)) (n∷Nat.nat))<br>
   local.Suc: ((P∷(Nat.nat ⇒ HOL.bool)) (n∷Nat.nat))</p>
<p>Somebody like me might not know what it means, but it definitely tells <br>
me that "Suc" isn't the the HOL function "Nat.Suc::(nat =&gt; nat)", like I <br>
had told you. You can't always know what something means, but you can <br>
know what it isn't sometimes.</p>
<p>Page 45 of prog-prove.pdf explains "case".</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

Chris,</p>
<p>Is this right? There's Isar syntax, which is defined in Pure. There's <br>
HOL syntax, which is defined using Isar keywords. And there is the HOL <br>
logic which is a combination of Isar syntax and HOL syntax.</p>
<p>What I'm thinking about in particular is that the proof of a HOL theorem <br>
is a HOL proof, but it may contain Isar commands.</p>

Dear Gottfried,</p>
<p>I would really prefer to hand this question over to a wizard ;)</p>
<p>But let me give it a try. What I think (but that does not necessarily <br>
mean that it's true) is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure is a kind of minimal logic independent from Isar.</li>
<li>
<p>Isar syntax is not part of Pure, but the "Isar-language" is <br>
well-integrated on top of Pure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HOL syntax is defined via commands (not sure whether those are really <br>
part of Isar or rather independent; my guess would be that they are just <br>
convenience tools built on top of the Isabelle/ML layer... but then, <br>
what is not?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HOL as a logic is independent from Isar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proofs are irrelevant, thus they can't be part of the logic, i.e., <br>
they are not part of HOL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the end, a proof is just a step-wise manipulation of the abstract <br>
data type 'thm' through a well-defined interface (sometimes called the <br>
trusted Kernel).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>cheers</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Chris, thanks for the explanation. There's lots of interesting <br>
information there, but I reduced everything down to this statement, "I <br>
just want to know what word to use for Isabelle's programming language". <br>
I was in doubt for a while, and then it occurred to me, "Oh yea, it is <br>
called the Isar reference manual".</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, page 76, it says, "Isabelle/Isar theories are defined via <br>
theory files..." It then says that "theory" and "end" are Isar commands.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, everything between "theory" and "end" is the <br>
Isar programming language. There is the ML in the "ML{ ... }", but other <br>
than that, it's all Isar to me now.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>From: Lars Noschinski &lt;<a href="mailto:noschinl@in.tum.de">noschinl@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
The Isar command "case" (in its long form) takes a case name and a list <br>
of inner syntax expressions (probably what you mean with HOL <br>
expressions). The case name "Suc" happens to be the same as the name of <br>
the constructor "Suc"; but this is just coincidence:</p>
<p>notepad<br>
   begin<br>
   fix n :: nat and P<br>
   proof (induct n rule: nat.induct[case_names Foo Bar])<br>
     case Foo show ?case sorry<br>
   next<br>
     case (Bar n) show ...</p>

<p>Isar/Pure outer syntax.<br>
*)</p>
<p>So Isar/Pure outer syntax is used to define inner syntax (I guess), such <br>
as HOL's inner syntax, because in that file there are the usual Isar <br>
commands that are documented in isar-ref.pdf:</p>
<p>line 154: Outer_Syntax.command ("judgement<br>
line 158: Outer_Syntax.command ("consts<br>
line 207: Outer_Syntax.command ("axioms<br>
line 219: Outer_Syntax.command ("defs<br>
line 228: Outer_Syntax.command ("definition<br>
line 249: Outer_Syntax.local_theory ("notation<br>
etc.</p>
<p>Well, life is not so simple. "datatype" is not specific to Isar. It's <br>
defined in ~/src/HOL/Datatype.thy, and is somehow defined with <br>
~/src/HOL/Tools/Datatype/datatype.ML.</p>
<p>I type "datatype" without typing anything else, and I get the error <br>
"Outer syntax error".</p>
<p>That's enough of that stuff for now.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>HOL as a logic is independent from Isar.</li>
<li>Proofs are irrelevant, thus they can't be part of the logic, i.e., <br>
they are not part of HOL.</li>
<li>In the end, a proof is just a step-wise manipulation of the abstract <br>
data type 'thm' through a well-defined interface (sometimes called the <br>
trusted Kernel).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yea, so I guess we could do it all in ML, where ML is the language of <br>
the foundation.</p>
<p>Your second two statements are the "something to think about".</p>

This calls for a "dude expression" using "dude syntax" interpreted with <br>
standard "dude semantics", as in, "Man, dude, if you (meaning me) would <br>
only open the source files and do some brainless scrolling around, you <br>
wouldn't clutter up the list with as many emails for a single subject."</p>
<p>At the bottom of ~/src/HOL/Tools/Datatype/datatype.ML, we get this:</p>
<p>val _ =<br>
   Outer_Syntax.command @{command_spec "datatype"} "define inductive <br>
datatypes"<br>
     (Parse.and_list1 spec_cmd</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(Toplevel.theory o (snd oo add_datatype_cmd <br>
Datatype_Aux.default_config)));</p>

<p>So some HOL syntax is defined with Isar commands, and some HOL syntax is <br>
defined with ML, where some HOL syntax is added as outer syntax.</p>

"HOL syntax" is not a very useful term here. In Isabelle/Isar, we <br>
distinguish between outer and inner syntax. The inner syntax is the <br>
syntax used to input terms (and types). Apart from trivial cases, inner <br>
syntax needs to be quoted.</p>
<p>The outer syntax is everything else. Most of it is already part of Pure <br>
(i.e. independent of any logic), mainly everything which makes up proof <br>
and document structure; but logics often add additional commands for <br>
logic-specific operations (e.g. "fun" and "inductive" for HOL).</p>
<p>Both syntaxes can be extended, but after bootstrapping, the outer syntax <br>
usually stays pretty static; where as the inner syntax is changed with <br>
any definition or syntax annotation you issue. I think, by default there <br>
is no tool on the Isar level which would modify the outer syntax (just <br>
as there is no construct on the term level, which would modify the inner <br>
syntax).</p>

<p>But if you can't combine "HOL syntax" with "inner syntax" and "outer <br>

There's the HOL specific outer syntax "datatype". I want to call that <br>

<p>I'm going to call "Outer_syntax.command" an Isar command, and it's used <br>

an Isar command, then what am I going to call it? If I call it an ML <br>

<p>Larry, thanks. I'm making some progress here. I've acquired some <br>
resolution for the word "language". A language that's used on a computer <br>
is not necessarily a "programming language". Sounds reasonable. I guess. <br>
It's hard for me not to think of a sequence of instructions as a program.</p>
<p>Now all I have to do is figure out exactly what the "Isar proof <br>
language" is, and what between "theory" and "end" isn't Isar.</p>
<p>It gets a little difficult to sort it all out. ML is a programming <br>
language which is used to implement Isar, which is a formal language, <br>
but not a programming language, and Isar is used to implement HOL, which <br>
is a programming language, and the syntax for Isar and "HOL syntax" is <br>
all intertwined, where you occasionally drop down into the ML <br>
programming language to use an "Isar command", like <br>
"Outer_syntax.command", to define syntax for the HOL programming language.</p>
<p>I'll check out on this thread, and store away any other comments that <br>
come in for future reference.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The content of a theory file between 'theory' and the final 'end' is by<br>
   definition the Isar source language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isar is a general framework to define "domain-specific formal<br>
   languages".  It allows to nest various sub-languages easily, most<br>
   notably the Isar proof language.  Other more exotic language embeddings<br>
   are here:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>notepad<br>
begin<br>
   (* Isar proof language here *)<br>
   fix a b :: nat<br>
   fix n :: nat<br>
   assume a: "⋀m. n + m &gt; 0"<br>
     ML_val {*<br>
       (* ML inside Isar proof context here *)</p>
<p>(* antiquotation of logical entities here:*)<br>
       fun foo th = th RS @{thm a}</p>
<p>(* further nesting: term language inside fact language: *)<br>
       fun bar th = th RS @{thm a [of "a + b"]}<br>
     *}<br>
end</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>* Note that above the Prover IDE markup will tell you about the formal<br>
     entities occurring in the nested sublanguages.  E.g. CTRL-hover over<br>
     "a + b" parts will do the same as if they would occur directly as<br>
     terms within the main Isar source language (statements, proofs).</p>
<p>* ML has a special role in the game: it is the platform for first<br>
     bootstrapping the Isar language framework, and later gets re-embedded<br>
     into the Isar source language, with the above antiquotation<br>
     mechanisms to get some parts of Isar back into ML.  E.g. like this:</p>
<p>ML {*<br>
       val my_thm = @{lemma "⋀x. x = x" by (rule refl)}<br>
     *}</p>
<p>* Formal latex is another special sub-language.  For example, it allows<br>
     to embed ML with embedded formal entities like this:</p>
<p>text {*<br>
        blah blah; this is mainly {\LaTeX}, but with some antiquotations<br>
        @{ML "<br>
          (* this is again ML inside the Isar context *)<br>
          let val my_thm = @{lemma \"⋀x. x = x\" by (rule refl)}<br>
          in Thm.prop_of my_thm end"}<br>
      *}</p>
<p>Here the incremental parser of Isabelle/jEdit sometimes gets problems<br>
     with the nested quotes, but in the end you should get proper formal<br>
     markup of everything to hover over, and understand this formal<br>
     gibberish.</p>
<p>* Outer_syntax.command that was left somewhat myterious above is not<br>
     very special.  It is just an Isabelle/ML function that defines new<br>
     Isar commands.  Similar to the ML function Method.setup to define<br>
     proof methods, but the latter also has an Isar source language<br>
     counterpart called method_setup; both Method.setup and<br>
     method_setup take an ML expression for the method implementation as<br>
     argument: ML that is embedded into Isar in the usual way.</p>
<p>It is just a historical accident, that Outer_syntax.command is still<br>
     not fully-integrated into the self-defining self-embedding game of<br>
     formal languages.  (Just today I've made further stepts towards that,<br>
     and found out that only 'theory' needs to be given from outside; all<br>
     other Isar commands can be defined inside the Isar framework.)</p>
<p>On now to make sophisticated specifications and serious proofs in <br>
Isabelle/HOL ...</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I think I have it.</p>
<p>HOL imports pure, therefore it inherits the Isar language and a default <br>
set of Isar outer syntax commands, where new outer syntax can be defined <br>
with "Outer_syntax.command". Everything in a .thy file is Isar syntax <br>
and everything is HOL syntax, so there's no need to talk about HOL <br>
syntax, since, again, everything is HOL syntax. We could, however, <br>
compare Isabelle/HOL syntax with Isabelle/FOL syntax, where they would <br>
both share the default Isar outer syntax commands.</p>
<p>The word "term" doesn't have a lot of significance to me. I assume you <br>
mean "lambda calculus term", but I see very little lambda calculus in <br>
expressions between double quotes, so it doesn't completely help me to <br>
know what to put in double quotes.</p>
<p>However, it is useful to know that if I see something in double quotes, <br>
I know it must be either a type or a lambda calculus term, even if the <br>
lambda calculus doesn't look like lambda calculus.</p>

Except for the technical details about which I didn't investigate, I feel  <br>
to understand about the same as I read documents explaining Isabelle  <br>
(actually, Markus Wenzel's thesis you pointed to, a captivating document):  <br>
the distinction between inner and outer syntax, does not map the  <br>
distinction between Isabelle‑Pure and the rest. If all is defined by  <br>
extension in terms derived and derived‑derived from the Isabelle‑Pure  <br>
core, and if extension can apply to both the outer and inner syntax, then  <br>
the distinction is not that meaningful. Finally, may inner syntax is for  <br>
some kind of expressions, and expressions which are not lexically atomic.  <br>
Perhaps that's a layout choice inspired by simplifying parsing. Can we say  <br>
what is a value (ex. contains variables of all kinds) and is not lexically  <br>
atomic (or is lexically atomic, but whose name is not a simple name), have  <br>
to be written in quotes? Just that?</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I've been totally focused on the frontend languages, ML, Isar, and HOL, <br>
while knowing nothing about what the backend prover does with them.</p>
<p>I now have a way to make sense of it all being Isar syntax, the HOL <br>
syntax being a part of the Isar syntax, and HOL not being dependent on Isar.</p>
<p>It could be that Isar is a framework that HOL uses to state lambda <br>
calculus terms, and the backend strips away all the outer syntax, where <br>
all that's left is the HOL lambda calculus terms. That idea lines up <br>
with Christian saying that proofs are irrelevant.</p>
<p>Now I sit on the two ideas and wait to see if I read something that <br>
supports one of the two ideas, that HOL inherits Isar and makes it its <br>
own, or Isar is a framework that gets stripped away by the backend. <br>
Today, right now, I'm leaning towards the idea that much of the Isar <br>
gets stripped away.</p>
<p>(I do see "framework" in "Chapter 2 The Isabelle/Isar Framework", which <br>
is where I must have gotten "framework". I don't see "stripped away" <br>
anywhere yet. There's a lot I haven't read yet.)</p>
<p>I don't really care to know the details of what the backend does, it <br>
would take years to learn about it, but it's nice to make sense of <br>
important high-level concepts.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

I believe HOL inherits/use Isar, but I can't prove it (cheese).</p>
<p>Along with this, for others interested in the original question too, here  <br>
is an evidence that what you write in quotes, is not specifically HOL: you  <br>
write lemma's conclusion to prove in quotes, and that's obviously not HOL,  <br>
which I believe is object logic only. Ex. the “==&gt;” is meta‑level logic.</p>
<p>So here comes an updated definitions perhaps, of what you have to put in  <br>
quotes: you write in quotes, every expressions which involves mix‑fix  <br>
notations (I don't know any of these outside of quotes), to which is to be  <br>
added previously mentioned type expressions when not syntactically atomic  <br>
and names when not simples (ex. containing dash, math symbols and the  <br>
like).</p>
<p>P.S. I've not read all replies to that thread in deep details so far, so I  <br>
apologies for any contradictions with what others may have said if ever  <br>
there are some.</p>
