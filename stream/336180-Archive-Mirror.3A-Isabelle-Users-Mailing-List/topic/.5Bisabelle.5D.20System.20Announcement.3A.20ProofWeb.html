SYSTEM ANNOUNCEMENT: PROOFWEB</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce the availability of our ProofWeb<br>
system for teaching logic and using proof assistants through<br>
the web.  For details go to the ProofWeb home page at:</p>
<p><a href="http://proofweb.cs.ru.nl/">http://proofweb.cs.ru.nl/</a></p>
<p>Attached to this mail is the text on the ProofWeb home page.</p>

<p>WHAT IS PROOFWEB?</p>
<p>ProofWeb is both a system for teaching logic and for using<br>
proof assistants through the web.</p>
<p>ProofWeb can be used in three ways.  First, one can use the<br>
guest login, for which one does not even need to register.<br>
Secondly, a user can be a student in a logic or proof<br>
assistants course.  We are hosting courses free of charge.<br>
If you are a teacher and would like to host your course on<br>
this server, send email to <a href="mailto:proofweb@cs.ru.nl">proofweb@cs.ru.nl</a>.  Thirdly,<br>
if teachers do not want to trust us with their students'<br>
files, they can freely download the ProofWeb system and<br>
run it on a server of their own.</p>
<p>LOGIC ON THE WEB</p>
<p>ProofWeb is a system for practising natural deduction on the<br>
computer.  It is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike the<br>
Jape system.  ProofWeb is based on the Coq proof assistant<br>
and runs inside any modern web browser.  To use ProofWeb<br>
one does not need to install software locally, not even a<br>
plugin: a web browser is all one needs.  With ProofWeb one<br>
runs logic exercises on a web server, just like gmail keeps<br>
all mail messages on its server.  This means that students<br>
will be able to access their exercises wherever they have<br>
a web browser, and that teachers at any time can see the<br>
status of their students' work.</p>
<p>ProofWeb comes with a database of basic logic exercises<br>
that are graded according to difficulty.  The ProofWeb<br>
system automatically grades the exercises of the students.<br>
To the students this is presented as a traffic light:<br>
their goal is to get a green light for all their exercises.</p>
<p>A ProofWeb user talks to the Coq system on the server<br>
without any translation.  There just are a few additional<br>
tactics to make Coq's behavior follow the logic textbooks.<br>
This means that in ProofWeb the full power of Coq is<br>
available, even to beginner students.  On the other hand<br>
ProofWeb tries hard to present deductions exactly the way<br>
they look in the textbooks.  In particular ProofWeb exactly<br>
follows the conventions of a well-known logic textbook,<br>
"Logic in Computer Science: Modelling and Reasoning about<br>
Systems" by Michael Huth and Mark Ryan, published by<br>
Cambridge University Press.  For this reason ProofWeb is<br>
especially attractive for courses that use this textbook.<br>
ProofWeb both supports Gentzen-style natural deduction in<br>
which proofs look likes trees with the conclusion at the<br>
root, and Fitch-style natural deduction in which proofs<br>
consist of lines grouped together with boxes or "flags".</p>
<p>PROOF ASSISTANTS ON THE WEB</p>
<p>ProofWeb is a system that allows anyone to try out proof<br>
assistants without installing anything.  It is almost, but<br>
not quite, entirely unlike the Proof General interface for<br>
proof assistants.  ProofWeb was designed to be used with<br>
Coq, but the interface has been successfully extended to<br>
other proof assistants, and in particular it supports the<br>
Isabelle system.</p>
<p>Although ProofWeb was designed for teaching logic to<br>
undergraduate computer science students, it also has been<br>
successfully used to teach proof assistant courses to<br>
graduate students.</p>
<p>RELATED PROJECTS</p>
<p>The ProofWeb interface has been used and extended in various<br>
projects.  The main ones are a prototype by Cezary Kaliszyk<br>
and Pierre Corbineau of a system that combines ProofWeb<br>
with a mathematical encyclopedia in the style of Wikipedia,<br>
and PC-Extra, an arbitrary precision calculator by Cezary<br>
Kaliszyk, based on the PhD work of Russell O'Connor.</p>
<p>ABOUT PROOFWEB</p>
<p>ProofWeb was developed in 2006 and 2007 in the education<br>
innovation project "Web deduction for education in formal<br>
thinking" which was financed by Surf Foundation, the Radboud<br>
University Nijmegen and the Free University Amsterdam.<br>
The main developer of the system was Cezary Kaliszyk, after<br>
ideas by Freek Wiedijk.  The ProofWeb exercise database<br>
and a first version of the natural deduction tactics were<br>
developed by Maxim Hendriks.  ProofWeb was refined based<br>
on experiences with the system in courses given by Femke<br>
van Raamsdonk, Hanno Wupper and Roel de Vrijer.</p>
