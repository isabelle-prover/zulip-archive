TABLEAUX 2019<br>
The 28th International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods<br>
London, UK, September 3-5, 2019<br>

Contact: <a href="mailto:chair@tableaux2019.org">chair@tableaux2019.org</a></p>
<p>Due to requests from potential authors and from current authors wishing to polish their papers, we have extended the submission deadlines. The new deadlines are:</p>
<p>1 May 2019 (abstract), 8 May 2019 (paper)</p>
<p>Authors who have a good paper and are in doubt whether to send it to TABLEAUX may note some highlights of this year's edition: two affiliated workshops, two affiliated tutorials, a financially supported best paper award for young researchers, five outstanding invited speakers (to be announced soon) and some support for young researchers traveling to the conference (including widely available cheap accommodation). We hope to see many of you this September in London -- in the beautiful campus of the Middlesex University, located 40 minutes from the city center and 20 minutes from Camden Town's iconic music venues!</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br>
The 28th International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods (TABLEAUX 2019) will take place in London. It will be hosted by the Department of Computer Science at the Middlesex University London, on 3-5 September 2019.<br>
TABLEAUX is the main international conference at which research on all aspects -- theoretical foundations, implementation techniques, systems development and applications -- of the mechanization of tableaux-based reasoning and related methods is presented. The first TABLEAUX conference was held in Lautenbach near Karlsruhe, Germany, in 1992. Since then it has been organized on an annual basis; in 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018 as a constituent of IJCAR.<br>
TABLEAUX 2019 will be co-located with the 12th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS 2019). The conferences will provide a rich programme of workshops, tutorials, invited talks, paper presentations and system descriptions.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF CONFERENCE<br>
Tableau methods offer a convenient and flexible set of tools for automated reasoning in classical logic, extensions of classical logic, and a large number of non-classical logics. For many logics, tableau methods can be generated automatically. Areas of application include verification of software and computer systems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its required inference engines, teaching, and system diagnosis.<br>
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>* tableau methods for classical and non-classical logics (including first-order, higher-order, modal, temporal, description, hybrid, intuitionistic, substructural, fuzzy, relevance and non-monotonic logics) and their proof-theoretic foundations;<br>
   * sequent calculi and natural deduction calculi for classical and non-classical logics, as tools for proof search and proof representation;<br>
   * related methods (SMT, model elimination, model checking, connection methods, resolution, BDDs, translation approaches);<br>
   * flexible, easily extendable, light-weight methods for theorem proving; novel types of calculi for theorem proving and verification in classical and non-classical logics;<br>
   * systems, tools, implementations, empirical evaluations and applications (provers, proof assistants, logical frameworks, model checkers, etc.);<br>
   * implementation techniques (data structures, efficient algorithms, performance measurement, extensibility, etc.);<br>
   * extensions of tableau procedures with conflict-driven learning;<br>
   * techniques for proof generation and compact (or humanly readable) proof representation;<br>
   * theoretical and practical aspects of decision procedures;<br>
   * applications of automated deduction to mathematics, software development, verification, deductive and temporal databases, knowledge representation, ontologies, fault diagnosis or teaching.<br>
We also welcome papers describing applications of tableau procedures to real-world examples. Such papers should be tailored to the tableau community and should focus on the role of reasoning and on logical aspects of the solution.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES<br>
Submissions are invited in three categories:<br>
(A) research papers reporting original theoretical research or applications, with length up to 15 pages excluding references;<br>
(B) system descriptions, with length up to 9 pages excluding references;<br>
(C) position papers and brief reports on work in progress, with length up to 9 pages excluding references.<br>
Submissions will be reviewed by the PC, possibly with the help of external reviewers, taking into account readability, relevance and originality. Any additional material (going beyond the page limit) can be included in a clearly marked appendix, which will be read at the discretion of the committee and must be removed for the camera-ready version.<br>
For category A submissions, the reported results must be original and not submitted for publication elsewhere. For category B submissions, a working implementation must be accessible via the internet. Authors are encouraged to publish the implementation under an open source license. The aim of a system description is to make the system available in such a way that people can use it, understand it, and build on it. Accepted papers in categories A and B will be published in the conference proceedings. Accepted papers in category C will be published as a Technical Report of the Middlesex University London.<br>
Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be submitted electronically as PDF files via the EasyChair system: <a href="http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tableaux2019">http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tableaux2019</a><br>
For all accepted papers at least one author is required to attend the conference and present the paper. A title and a short abstract of about 100 words must be submitted before the paper submission deadline. Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files can be obtained at <a href="http://www.springer.com/br/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">http://www.springer.com/br/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a></p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>
Abstract submission: 1 May 2019<br>
Paper submission: 8 May 2019<br>
Notification of paper decisions: 6 Jun 2019<br>
Camera-ready papers due: 1 Jul 2019<br>
TABLEAUX conference: 3-5 Sep 2019</p>
<p>PUBLICATION DETAILS<br>
The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI/LNCS).</p>
<p>BEST PAPER AWARDS<br>
The program committee will select (1) the TABLEAUX 2019 Best Paper and (2) the TABLEAUX 2019 Best Paper by a Junior Researcher, of which the latter will be supported by 500 Euros. Researchers will be considered junior if either they are students or their PhD degree date is less than two years from the first day of the meeting. "Paper by a Junior Researcher" means that the paper's main author(s) is/are junior; this information should be indicated by adding a star (*) at the submission's title and at the submission's junior author(s) name(s). The two awards will be presented at the conference.</p>
<p>SUPPORT FOR STUDENT AND YOUNG RESEARCHER PARTICIPATION<br>
We have some limited funding for supporting students and young researchers traveling to the conference -- courtesy of direct sponsorship from Amazon and Springer and indirect sponsorship from the Association for Symbolic Logic. In addition, some funding will be available through the EUTypes COST action website. In all cases, authors of accepted papers will be given precedence. Please see the conference website for more details.<br>
In addition, the Middlesex University is offering accommodation at a £30 daily rate in some excellently maintained shared flats located close to the conference venue (<a href="https://www.mdx.ac.uk/student-life/accommodation/platt-hall">https://www.mdx.ac.uk/student-life/accommodation/platt-hall</a>).</p>
