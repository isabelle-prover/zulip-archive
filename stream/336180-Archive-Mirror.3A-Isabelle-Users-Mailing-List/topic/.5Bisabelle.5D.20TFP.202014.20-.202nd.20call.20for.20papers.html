<p>======== TFP 2014 ===========</p>
<p>15th Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming<br>
May 26-28, 2014<br>
Utrecht University<br>
Soesterberg, The Netherlands<br>

<p>The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an international<br>
forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of functional <br>
programming,<br>
taking a broad view of current and future trends in the area. It aspires to<br>
be a lively environment for presenting the latest research results, and <br>
other<br>
contributions (see below), described in draft papers submitted prior to the<br>
symposium. A formal post-symposium refereeing process then selects a subset<br>
of the articles presented at the symposium and submitted for formal<br>
publication.</p>
<p>Selected revised papers will be published as a Springer Lecture Notes in<br>
Computer Science (LNCS) volume.</p>
<p>TFP 2014 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming events.<br>
The other is the International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming<br>
in Education (TFPIE). TFPIE will take place on May 25th. Its website is <br>
located<br>
at <a href="http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~jlc/tfpie14/">http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~jlc/tfpie14/</a></p>
<p>The TFP symposium is the heir of the successful series of Scottish <br>
Functional<br>
Programming Workshops. Previous TFP symposia were held in<br>
Edinburgh (Scotland) in 2003, in Munich (Germany) in 2004,<br>
in Tallinn (Estonia) in 2005, in Nottingham (UK) in 2006,<br>
in New York (USA) in 2007, in Nijmegen (The Netherlands) in 2008,<br>
in Komarno (Slovakia) in 2009, in Oklahoma (USA) in 2010, in Madrid <br>
(Spain) in<br>
2011, St. Andrews (UK) in 2012 and Provo (Utah, USA) in 2013.<br>
For further general information about TFP please see the TFP homepage.</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>
<p>TFP is pleased to announce talks by the following two invited speakers:</p>
<p>John Hughes of Chalmers, Goteborg, Sweden, is well-known as author of<br>
Why Functional Programming Matters, and as one of the designers of <br>
QuickCheck<br>
(together with Koen Claessen); the paper on QuickCheck won the<br>
ICFP Most Influential Paper Award in 2010. Currently he divides his time <br>
between<br>
his professorship and Quviq, a company that performs property-based <br>
testing of<br>
software with a tool implemented in Erlang.</p>
<p>Dr. Geoffrey Mainland received his PhD from Harvard University where he was<br>
advised by Greg Morrisett and Matt Welsh. After a two year postdoc with the<br>
Programming Principles and Tools group at Microsoft Research Cambridge, <br>
he is<br>
now an assistant professor at Drexel University. His research focuses on<br>
high-level programming language and runtime support for non-general purpose<br>
computation.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various routes.<br>
As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the<br>
following five article categories. High-quality articles are solicited <br>
in any<br>
of these categories:</p>
<p>Research Articles: leading-edge, previously unpublished research work<br>
     Position Articles: on what new trends should or should not be<br>
     Project Articles: descriptions of recently started new projects<br>
     Evaluation Articles: what lessons can be drawn from a finished project<br>
     Overview Articles: summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</p>
<p>Articles must be original and not submitted for simultaneous publication to<br>
any other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming:<br>
theoretical, implementation-oriented, or more experience-oriented.<br>
Applications of functional programming techniques to other languages are<br>
also within the scope of the symposium.</p>
<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include:</p>
<p>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing<br>
     Functional programming in the cloud<br>
     High performance functional computing<br>
     Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs<br>
     Dependently typed functional programming<br>
     Validation and verification of functional programs<br>
     Using functional techniques to reason about <br>
imperative/object-oriented programs<br>
     Debugging for functional languages<br>
     Functional programming in different application areas:<br>
       security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded <br>
systems,<br>
       global computing, grids, etc.<br>
     Interoperability with imperative programming languages<br>
     Novel memory management techniques<br>
     Program analysis and transformation techniques<br>
     Empirical performance studies<br>
     Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages<br>
     (Embedded) domain specific languages<br>
     New implementation strategies<br>
     Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</p>
<p>If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of TFP,<br>
please contact the TFP 2014 program chair, Jurriaan Hage at <a href="mailto:J.Hage@uu.nl">J.Hage@uu.nl</a>.</p>
<p>BEST PAPER AWARDS</p>
<p>To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper<br>
accepted for the formal proceedings.</p>
<p>TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students,<br>
acknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new subject<br>
trends. A student paper is one for which the authors state that the paper<br>
is mainly the work of students, the students are listed as first authors,<br>
and a student would present the paper. A prize for the best student paper<br>
is awarded each year.</p>
<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize.<br>
In case the best paper happens to be a student paper, that paper will then<br>
receive both prizes.</p>
<p>SPONSORS</p>
<p>TFP is financially supported by NWO (Netherlands Organisation for <br>
Scientific<br>
Research), Well-Typed and Erlang Solutions.</p>
<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>Acceptance of articles for presentation at the symposium is based on a<br>
lightweight peer review process of extended abstracts (4 to 10 pages in<br>
length) or full papers (16 pages). The submission must clearly indicate<br>
which category it belongs to: research, position, project, evaluation,<br>
or overview paper. It should also indicate whether the main author or<br>
authors are research students. In the case of a FULL STUDENT paper, the<br>
draft paper will receive additional feedback by one of the PC members <br>
shortly<br>
after the symposium has taken place.</p>
<p>We use EasyChair for the refereeing process.</p>
