<p>Trends in Functional Programming in Education</p>
<p>Gothenburg, Sweden, 14 June 2018</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/heather/tfpie2018/">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/heather/tfpie2018/</a></p>
<p>(co-located with TFP 2018)<br>

======================================================================</p>
<p>The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, teachers and professionals that use,<br>
or are interested in the use of, functional programming in education. TFPIE aims<br>
to be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas and work-in-progress on<br>
the use of functional programming in education are discussed. The one-day<br>
workshop will foster a spirit of open discussion by having a review process for<br>
publication after the workshop. The program chair of TFPIE 2018 will screen<br>
submissions to ensure that all presentations are within scope and are of<br>
interest to participants. After the workshop, presenters will be invited to<br>
submit revised versions of their articles for publication in the journal<br>
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).</p>
<p>Scope<br>
=====</p>
<p>TFPIE 2018 welcomes submissions describing techniques used in the classroom,<br>
tools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any creative use of<br>
functional programming (FP) to aid education in or outside Computer Science.<br>
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>FP and beginning CS students</li>
<li>FP and Computational Thinking</li>
<li>FP and Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>FP in Robotics</li>
<li>FP and Music</li>
<li>Advanced FP for undergraduates</li>
<li>FP in graduate education</li>
<li>Engaging students in research using FP</li>
<li>FP in Programming Languages</li>
<li>FP in the high school curriculum</li>
<li>FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics</li>
<li>FP and Philosophy</li>
<li>The pedagogy of teaching FP</li>
<li>FP and e-learning: MOOCs, automated assessment etc.</li>
<li>Best Lectures – more details below</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to papers, we are requesting best lecture presentations. What’s your<br>
best lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a fun way to present FP<br>
concepts to novices or perhaps an especially interesting presentation of a<br>
difficult topic? In either case, please consider sharing it. Best lecture topics<br>
will be selected for presentation based on a short abstract describing the<br>
lecture and its interest to TFPIE attendees.</p>
<p>Submissions<br>
===========</p>
<p>Potential presenters are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-6 pages) or a<br>
draft paper (up to 16 pages) in EPTCS style. The authors of accepted<br>
presentations will have their preprints and their slides made available on the<br>
workshop's website. Papers and abstracts can be submitted via EasyChair at the<br>
link below.</p>
<p>After the workshop, presenters will be invited to submit (a revised version of)<br>
their article for review. The PC will select the best articles for publication<br>
in the journal Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).<br>
Articles rejected for presentation and extended abstracts will not be formally<br>
reviewed by the PC.</p>
