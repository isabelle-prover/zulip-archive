<p>THedu'11 Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>This workshop intends to gather the research communities for Computer Theorem <br>
proving (CTP), Automated Theorem Proving (ATP),  Interactive Theorem Proving <br>
(ITP) as well as for Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) and Dynamic Geometry <br>
Systems (DGS).<br>
The goal of this union is to combine and focus systems of these areas and to <br>
enhance existing educational software as well as studying the design of the <br>
next generation of mechanised mathematics assistants (MMA). Elements for <br>
next-generation MMA's include:</p>
<p>* Declarative Languages for Problem Solution: education in applied sciences <br>
and in engineering is mainly concerned with problems, which are understood as <br>
operations on elementary objects to be transformed to an object representing a <br>
problem solution. Preconditions and postconditions of these operations can be <br>
used to describe the possible steps in the problem space; thus, ATP-systems can <br>
be used to check if an operation sequence given by the user does actually <br>
present a problem solution. Such "Problem Solution Languages" encompass <br>
declarative proof languages like Isabelle/Isar or Coq's Mathematical Proof <br>
Language, but also more specialized forms such as, for example, geometric <br>
problem solution languages that express a proof argument in Euclidean Geometry <br>
or languages for graph theory.</p>
<p>* Consistent Mathematical Content Representation:  libraries of existing <br>
ITP-Systems, in particular those following the LCF-prover paradigm, usually <br>
provide logically coherent and human readable knowledge. In the leading <br>
provers, mathematical knowledge is covered to an extent beyond most courses in <br>
applied sciences. However, the potential of this mechanised knowledge for <br>
education is clearly not yet recognised adequately: renewed pedagogy calls for <br>
enquiry-based learning from concrete to abstract --- and the knowledge's <br>
logical coherence supports such learning: for instance, the formula 2.pi <br>
depends on the definition of reals and of multiplication; close to these <br>
definitions are the laws like commutativity etc. Clearly, the complexity of the <br>
knowledge's traceable interrelations poses a challenge to usability design.</p>
<p>* User-Guidance in Stepwise Problem Solving: Such guidance is indispensable <br>
for independent learning, but costly to implement so far, because so many <br>
special cases need to be coded by hand. However, CTP technology makes automated <br>
generation of user-guidance reachable: declarative languages as mentioned <br>
above, novel programming languages combining computation and deduction, methods <br>
for automated construction with ruler and compass from specifications, etc --- <br>
all these methods 'know how to solve a problem'; so, using the methods' <br>
knowledge to generate user-guidance mechanically is an appealing challenge for <br>
ATP and ITP, and probably for compiler construction!</p>
<p>In principle, mathematical software can be conceived as models of mathematics: <br>
The challenge addressed by this workshop is to provide appealing models for <br>
MMAs which are interactive and which explain themselves such that interested <br>
students can independently learn by inquiry and experimentation.</p>

<p>Submission</p>
<hr>
<p>THedu'11 seeks papers and demos presenting original unpublished work which is <br>
not been submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>
<p>Both, papers and demos, are submitted as extended abstracts first (29 Apr <br>
2011), which must not exceed five pages. The abstract should be new material. <br>
Demos should be accompanied by links to demos/downloads and [existing] system <br>
descriptions. Availability of such accompanying material will be a strong <br>
prerequisite for acceptance.</p>
<p>The authors of the extended abstracts and system descriptions should submit to <br>
easychair [2] in PDF format generated by EPTCS LaTeX style [3] . Selected <br>
extended abstracts and system descriptions will appear in CISUC Technical <br>
Report series (ISSN 0874-338X, [1]).</p>
<p>At least one author of each accepted paper/demo is expected to attend THedu'11 <br>
and to present her or his paper/demo, and the extended abstracts will be made <br>
available online.</p>
<p>After presentation at the conference selected authors will be invited to submit <br>
a substantially revised version, extended to 10-14 pages, for publication by <br>
the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS). <br>
Papers/system descriptions will be reviewed by blind peer review and evaluated <br>
by three referees with respect to relevance, clarity, quality, originality, and <br>
impact.</p>
<p>Revised versions are submitted in LaTeX according to the EPTCS style guidelines <br>
[3] via easychair [2].</p>
