<p>From: Joe Hurd &lt;<a href="mailto:joe.hurd@comlab.ox.ac.uk">joe.hurd@comlab.ox.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
TPHOLs 2007</p>
<p>CALL FOR BIDS</p>
<p>It is a long-standing custom that the host (in year "n") of Theorem<br>
Proving in Higher Order Logics (TPHOLs) helps select the host of<br>
TPHOLs for year "n+1". However, TPHOLs is merging with IJCAR in 2006,<br>
and so it was decided at the business meeting of TPHOLs 2005 that the<br>
organizers of TPHOLs 2005 would organize the bidding for TPHOLs 2007.<br>
There are two phases: solicitation of bids, and voting.</p>
<p>This message concerns the first phase. Bids are sought to host TPHOLs<br>
in 2007. Previous bids may be accessed through past TPHOLs webpages:<br>
please refer to the conference history section of this website.</p>
<p>TPHOLs is not usually held on the same continent two years in a row.<br>
At the business meeting of TPHOLs 2005 it was decided that the merging<br>
of TPHOLs with IJCAR in 2006 would count under this rule, and<br>
therefore no bids to host TPHOLs 2007 in North America will be<br>
accepted. TPHOLs is traditionally held in August or September.</p>
<p>Bids should be sent to <a href="mailto:tphols2005@comlab.ox.ac.uk">tphols2005@comlab.ox.ac.uk</a> and should include<br>
at least the following information:</p>
<p>* name and email address of a contact person;<br>
    * names of other people involved;<br>
    * address of website for the bid;<br>
    * approximate dates the conference will be held;<br>
    * format of the conference; and<br>
    * colocation details (if any).</p>
<p>Deadline for all bids is 31 December 2005. Shortly after that, the<br>
bids will be made public and the voting phase will take place. The<br>
people eligible to vote are those who are seriously thinking of<br>
attending TPHOLs 2007, and the voting system used will be Single<br>
Transferable Vote between all received bids.</p>
