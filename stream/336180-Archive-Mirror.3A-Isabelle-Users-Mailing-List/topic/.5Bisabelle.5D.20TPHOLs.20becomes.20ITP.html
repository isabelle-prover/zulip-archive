<p>From: Tobias Nipkow &lt;<a href="mailto:nipkow@in.tum.de">nipkow@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
The steering committee and business meeting of TPHOLs 2008 in Montreal <br>
last week agreed on the following change of names: TPHOLs will become <br>
ITP (Interactive Theorem Proving) not just in 2010 (as had already been <br>
agreed) but that name change will become permanent after 2010. It was <br>
felt that the broader scope of ITP is a more accurate reflection of the <br>
actual focus of TPHOLs and its openness to other communities like ACL2 <br>
users.</p>
<p>Note that although ITP 2010 formally incorporates the TPHOLs and ACL2 <br>
Workshop series, no such commitment has been made beyond 2010; the new <br>
agreement is only about changing the name.</p>
<p>This is not a formal vote, but if you have strong objections to this <br>
decision, please address them to the TPHOLs Steering Committee by <br>
replying to this email. We will try to take your arguments into account.</p>
<p>Tobias Nipkow<br>
TPHOLs Steering Committee chair</p>
