Dear Isabelle List,</p>
<p>Tableaux 2015 is now waiting for submissions -- on a variety of topics, including the intersection between automatic and interactive theorem proving.</p>
<p>All the best,<br>

<p>SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>TABLEAUX 2015</p>
<p>24th International Conference on Automated Reasoning with<br>
Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods</p>
<p>Wroclaw, Poland, September 21-24, 2015</p>
<p><a href="http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl/">http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl/</a></p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br>
TABLEAUX 2015 is the 24th in the series of international meetings<br>
on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods,<br>
and will be held in Wroclaw, Poland, during September 21-24, 2015.</p>
<p>TABLEAUX 2015 will be co-located with the 10th International Symposium<br>
on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS 2015).</p>
<p>The computer science institute of Wroclaw has a large experience<br>
in hosting international conferences. It has hosted<br>
the IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2007),<br>
the 24th International Conference on Automated Deduction<br>
(CADE 2011), and the 22nd European Symposium on Algorithms (ALGO 2014).</p>
<p>TOPICS<br>
Tableaux methods offer a convenient and flexible set of tools<br>
for automated reasoning in classical logic, extensions of classical<br>
logic, and a large number of non-classical logics. For large<br>
groups of logics, tableaux methods can be generated automatically.<br>
Areas of application include verification of software and computer<br>
systems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its required<br>
inference engines, teaching, and system diagnosis.<br>
The conference series aims to bring together researchers interested in all<br>
aspects of tableaux - theoretical foundations, applications,<br>
and implementation techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tableaux methods for classical and non-classical logics<br>
(e.g. modal, temporal, description, intuitionistic, substructural,<br>
fuzzy, paraconsistent logics) and their proof theoretic<br>
foundations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>related methods (model elimination, model checking, connection<br>
methods, resolution, BDDs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sequent calculi for classical and non-classical logics,<br>
as tools for proof search and proof representation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flexible, easily extendable, light weight methods for theorem proving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>novel types of calculi for theorem proving and verification<br>
in classical and non-classical logics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systems, tools, implementations and applications (provers,<br>
logical frameworks, model checkers, ... ).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementation techniques (data structures, efficient algorithms,<br>
performance measurement, extendibility, ... ).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extensions of tableaux procedures with conflict-driven learning,<br>
generation of proofs; compact (or humanly readable) representation<br>
of proofs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>decision procedures, theoretically optimal procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>applications of automated deduction to mathematics, software<br>
development, protocol verification, or teaching.</li>
</ul>
<p>TABLEAUX 2015 also welcomes papers describing applications of tableaux<br>
procedures to real world examples. Such papers should be tailored to<br>
the tableaux community and should focus on the role of reasoning,<br>
and logical aspects of the solution.</p>
<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>
Submissions are invited in two categories:</p>
<p>A Research papers, which describe original theoretical research,<br>
original algorithms, or applications, with length<br>
up to 15 pages.<br>
B System descriptions, with length up to 10 pages.</p>
<p>Submissions will be reviewed by the PC, possibly will help of<br>
external reviewers, taking into account readability, relevance<br>
and originality.</p>
<p>For category A, theoretical results and algorithms must be original,<br>
and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions will be reviewed<br>
taking into account correctness, theoretical prettyness, and possible<br>
implementability.</p>
<p>For category B submissions, a working implementation<br>
must be available on the internet, which includes sources.<br>
The aim of a system description is to make the system available<br>
in such a way that users can use it, understand it, and build on it.</p>
<p>Accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference<br>
proceedings (within the LNAI series of Springer).</p>
<p>For accepted papers in both of the categories, at least one author<br>
is required to attend the conference and present the paper.</p>
<p>Further information and instructions about submissions can be found<br>
on the conference website http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl&lt;<a href="http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl/">http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>Abstract submission deadline: May 8th, 2015<br>
Paper submission deadline: May 15th, 2015<br>
Author Notification: July 1st, 2015<br>
Final Version: July 17th 2015<br>
Conference: September 21st-24th, 2015</p>
