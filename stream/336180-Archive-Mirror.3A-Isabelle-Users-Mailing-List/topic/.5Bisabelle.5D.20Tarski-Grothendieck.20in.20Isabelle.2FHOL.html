<p>From: Mikhail Chekhov &lt;<a href="mailto:mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com">mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Joshua Chen/All,</p>
<p>This post is a reply to Joshua Chen’s comment in the following thread:<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2020-May/msg00075.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2020-May/msg00075.html</a>.<br>
However, I believe, it is best provided as an explicit thread, as it is<br>
concerned exclusively with <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cezaryka/tyset/src">https://bitbucket.org/cezaryka/tyset/src</a> and not<br>
the main topic of my previous question.</p>
<p>Firstly, thank you for letting me know about this development. It is very<br>
useful to know about it.</p>
<p>In this context, I have to mention that I have started a couple of personal<br>
applied formalization projects around “ZFC in HOL”. However, I kept<br>
encountering and trying to solve some of the more fundamental limitations<br>
related to the interplay of logic/type theory/set theory and the existing<br>
‘tools’ infrastructure for Isabelle/HOL (e.g., see<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2020-April/msg00071.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2020-April/msg00071.html</a><br>
and<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2020-April/msg00117.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2020-April/msg00117.html</a>,<br>
but there are many other issues). Also, I have an ever-growing desire to be<br>
able to consider larger and larger entities without sacrificing convenience<br>
(e.g. in “ZFC in HOL” one needs to deal with “V set set”, “V set” and V if<br>
one is to provide a notion similar to that of a conglomerate and operations<br>
on conglomerates).</p>
<p>Having had a brief revision of the content of the repository, I am<br>
converging on the conclusion that this development makes an attempt to<br>
address many of the problems that I am struggling with at the moment (and<br>
more) in a structured manner and with much support. It does feel that,<br>
eventually, it will make my current efforts in “ZFC in HOL” redundant (in<br>
fact, some of the theories I developed for “ZFC in HOL” are almost in 1-1<br>
correspondence from the perspective of the content with what can be found<br>
in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cezaryka/tyset/src">https://bitbucket.org/cezaryka/tyset/src</a>). Therefore, I have several<br>
questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Would you consider contributions to the project from external entities,<br>
such as myself? If so, what kind of workflow would you expect/prefer? Would<br>
you agree to share your own plans for this development?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I understand correctly, at the moment, there is no license attached<br>
to the repository. To the best of my knowledge, this means that<br>
non-contributors can not legally redistribute any part of the content of<br>
the repository. Is this intended? Would you consider distributing the<br>
content under an open-source license in the future? If so, when do you<br>
anticipate to do so?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regretfully, I was not able to build the content associated with either<br>
master or dev. I tried both the latest Isabelle-dev and Isabelle2020 stable<br>
release (the first error that appears is “exception FAIL NONE raised (line<br>
161 of "General/scan.ML")” in String.thy in the first local_setup block).<br>
Perhaps, I am not using the needed version of Isabelle? Otherwise, unless<br>
the cause is apparent, I am sure I will be able to figure it out on my own:<br>
there is no need to worry on my behalf (my time spent looking at the<br>
content can still be measured in minutes at the time of writing this email).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naturally, the development introduces a number of new axioms in addition<br>
to the axioms of HOL. I am curious if anything can be said with confidence<br>
about the consistency of the new system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I liked the idea of the notion of an object provided in the repository.<br>
However, it seems that there are two independent theories: Object.thy and<br>
Object_Old.thy. Does this mean that the notion of the object, as specified<br>
in Object_Old.thy, will be abandoned in favor of another entirely different<br>
implementation (as opposed to extended/built upon into what is shown at the<br>
beginning of Object.thy) that is not yet available?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
Mikhail Chekhov</p>
