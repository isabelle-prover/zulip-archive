Hi Scott,</p>
<p>This is nonterminating in general, unless the obj type is finite. So <br>
there can't be just a simple "measure".</p>
<p>If your application does not require the functional view (like for code <br>
generation), you best define all_children as an inductive set or <br>
predicate, which avoids all termination issues and is usually much simpler.</p>
<p>You can define partial functions in Isabelle (see the function tutorial <br>
for a small example), but this introduces explicit domain predicates and <br>
in particular prevents code generation unless your function is <br>
tail-recursive (this is how it is done in Stefan's formalization...)</p>
<p>But if you really just need all_children defined somehow, then just use <br>
"inductive"</p>

Basically you'll have to take the complement of your set "seen" with <br>
respect to the set of reachable nodes (i.e., the transitive closure of <br>
the children function from the node "src"). And yes, you'll have to <br>
prove that transitive closure to be a finite set, otherwise the function <br>
wouldn't terminate.</p>
<p>We have recently formalized a very similar function in the context of an <br>
automaton construction for model checking, and I could send you the <br>
theories and a paper (off-list) if you are interested.</p>

Hello all,</p>
<p>I have recently been trying to write a function, which Isabelle would <br>
like to know terminates. The basic task is to find reachability, but I <br>
don't have an explicit graph, I have a function which returns children <br>
of the current node.</p>
<p>So I recursively define this function to essentially be something like:</p>
<p>all_children :: obj =&gt; obj set =&gt; obj set<br>
all_children src seen =<br>
   if src \&lt;in&gt; seen<br>
     then seen<br>
     else<br>
       foldr all_children (children src) (seen \&lt;union&gt; {src})</p>
<p>I can't for the life of me figure out what the measure function should <br>
be in this case. Been thinking on it for a few days and I don't know how <br>
to state a termination proof in a way that Isabelle will understand. I <br>
should preface that by saying I only know of the "measure" method... and <br>
even then, not really well.</p>
<p>If anyone could provide some hint on how to go about this, then that <br>
would be great.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Scott</p>

Hello Scott,</p>
<p>when defining the above function with "fun", you also have to supply<br>
a suitable congruence rule for foldr in order to be able to prove<br>
termination. However, it might actually be easier to define all_children<br>
without using foldr, i.e. by turning the first parameter into a list<br>
of objects that still have to be inspected:</p>
<p>all_children :: obj list =&gt; obj set =&gt; obj set<br>
   all_children [] seen = seen<br>
   all_children (src # srcs) seen =<br>
     if src \&lt;in&gt; seen<br>
       then all_children srcs seen<br>
       else<br>
         all_children (children src @ srcs) (seen \&lt;union&gt; {src})</p>
<p>This approach is used in the formalization of depth first search<br>
by Nishihara an Minamide, which you can find in the AFP:</p>
<p><a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Depth-First-Search.shtml">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Depth-First-Search.shtml</a></p>
<p>I recently generalized this formalization a little (using locales),<br>
allowing the user to freely choose the representation of "obj set",<br>
as well as the implementation of the children, \&lt;union&gt;, and \&lt;in&gt;<br>
operators. You can currently find the generalized version at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.in.tum.de/~berghofe/papers/automata/DFS.thy">http://www.in.tum.de/~berghofe/papers/automata/DFS.thy</a></p>

Well, I am not really sure if there are any. But I've created a small <br>
example, that I think addresses your problem. Instead of using foldr <br>
explicitly and to avoid the problems arise with congruence rules, I've <br>
just used mutual recursion <br>
(<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle/doc/functions.pdf">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle/doc/functions.pdf</a>, Chapter 5) <br>
to achieve the same behavior. In my example (see Test.thy) the function <br>
'f' is similar to your 'all_children' function, the (abstract) function <br>
'g' is somewhat similar to your 'children' function.<br>
After the function definition is established and the completeness is <br>
proofed, the termination proof is considered, which relies on the fact, <br>
that there is an function called 'lim' which computes an upper bound for <br>
'f' (and therefore for its second argument). So far, 'lim' is not really <br>
defined in my example (that's up to you), but requires some properties <br>
to be true (for example finiteness, etc.)<br>
After that a special partial termination property (called 'subset_prop') <br>
for the function 'f' and its mutual recursive counterpart 'foldr_f' is <br>
proofed, since it is required in the termination proof. This property is <br>
important and I don't think you can get a similar property when you use <br>
'foldr' directly (but I've not verified that!)<br>
At the end the termination proof is established using a special <br>
termination ordering (called 'my_term_ord'), which is a lexicographical <br>
combination of 'finite_psubset' and the 'less_than' relation. The latter <br>
is needed since in my mutual recursive version the termination of the <br>
foldr replacement have to also to be proofed.</p>

Just try using the mutual recursive version that I've suggested in the <br>
example. After finishing the termination it is probably possible to <br>
proof, that the mutual recursive (helphing) funciton 'foldr_f' is in <br>
fact (in some sense) equal to the ordinary 'foldr' function, so that it <br>
can be replaced.</p>
