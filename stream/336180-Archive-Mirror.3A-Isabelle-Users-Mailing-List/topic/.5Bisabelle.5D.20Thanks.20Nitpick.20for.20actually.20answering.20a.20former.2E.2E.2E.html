<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>It's not like I call up Bill Gates to learn about Windows 7, and if it <br>
sounds like I'm complaining, that would be a sound similar to <br>
complaining. I'm not complaining. I'm just talking because I'm allowed to.</p>
<p>Like two months ago, I specifically asked, in a fairly precise way, <br>
"What's the difference between free variables and universally quantified <br>
variables, and is there a reason I shouldn't use free variables?"</p>
<p>I will now give you a reasonably close, informal, one sentence answer.</p>
<p>ANSWER: A universally quantified bound variable is a logical statement, <br>
where a free variable is an argument to a function.</p>
<p>That's kind of huge difference don't you think? But two months ago, <br>
based on the zero answers like the above, I eventually started treating <br>
free variables like universally quantified variables.</p>
<p>Who straightened me out? Nitpick.</p>
<p>So I looked at the tutorials again, and "instantiation of free <br>
variables" became more clear. However, if I didn't write the software, <br>
how was I supposed to know how the proof engine is instantiating free <br>
variables when proving a theorem? Who's to say that it's not <br>
instantiating them in way that makes them equivalent to a universally <br>
quantified variable? Obviously not.</p>
<p>This substantiates my general guiding principle that it's a fool who <br>
picks a field of study or a software product that doesn't provide enough <br>
documentation and tools for people to be self-sufficient. To clarify, I <br>
haven't played the fool in this context.</p>
<p>So I had four forms of an axiom that I thought were logically <br>
equivalent. For my own reasons, I was going to axiomatize all four of <br>
them. However, being properly paranoid, I was trying to prove they were <br>
equivalent, which led to me trying to disprove what had been for me a <br>
basic logic error, which led to counter examples on both the theorem and <br>
its negation, which led to me understanding how free variables work.</p>
<p>Thank you Nitpick, for automating the holding of my hand.</p>

I really don't understand what you mean. Bound variables are not logical statements. And whether a variable is free or bound has no bearing on whether or not it can appear as a function's argument.</p>

<p>From: Tjark Weber &lt;<a href="mailto:webertj@in.tum.de">webertj@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
I believe a more helpful insight here is simply that a formula with<br>
free variables may be contingent (i.e., its truth value may depend on<br>
the interpretation of the free variables, so that neither the formula<br>
nor its negation are theorems), while a formula without free variables<br>
is either true or false.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic</a> (especially the first<br>
three sections) for further background.</p>

Dear Isabelle users</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Whenever I see this kind of discussion I remember that I am  actually<br>
interested in  the (logical ) difference [in Isabelle]<br>
between unknown variables and universally quantified variables,</p>
<p>For instance, the different roles of variables in the following    two<br>
propositions :</p>
<p>all x. all y. all y. (x+y)+z =  x + (y+z)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>(?x + ?y) + ?z = ?x + (?y + ?z).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From what I read, the operational meaning of the second matches the<br>
semantics of the first. But from a logical point of view, in the second<br>
proposition the variables are free, while in the first they are bound,<br>
so I get confused about it. I believe I "understand" this,  but then reality<br>
strikes and I think "who am I kidding"?</p>

<p>From: Lawrence Paulson &lt;<a href="mailto:lp15@cam.ac.uk">lp15@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Your question is about logic, not Isabelle.</p>
<p>The formula (?x + ?y) + ?z = ?x + (?y + ?z) expresses a property about three quantities denoted by ?x, ?y and ?z. It is a convention in logic that any theorem involving free variables denotes the "universal closure" of that formula, here</p>
<p>"all x. all y. all y. (x+y)+z =  x + (y+z)".</p>
<p>Isabelle is designed to work best a minimum of logical symbols, hence the preference for stating theorems like</p>
<p>P1 ==&gt; … Pn ==&gt; Q.</p>
<p>Hardly any mathematics paper states such theorems as</p>
<p>!x1 … xm. P1 &amp; … &amp; Pn —&gt; Q.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Lars,</p>
<p>And Makarius had talked some about outermost quantifiers in an email, <br>
and how they get stripped away.</p>
<p>Using Isabelle as a logic calculator, the basic idea is, "GB, with your <br>
logic calculator, check yourself compulsively on the most basic of logic <br>
ideas, before claiming what is wrong. They will be embarrassed for you."</p>
<p>However, I didn't have utmost confidence that, for the free variable <br>
formula, there was an equivalent formula with bound variables, and that <br>
I just needed to discover the rules, because I thought Nitpick had <br>
taught me the rules, when all it had done was slap my hand.</p>
<p>In this case, my logical calculator doesn't help me use trial and error, <br>
with a little understanding, to prove the equivalency of a "free <br>
variable formula" with its equivalent "bound variable formula".</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<p>theorem "(!a. P a) &lt;-&gt; (!b. P b)" apply auto done</p>
<p>I want to make "b" a free variable so that I can prove, stated <br>
informally here,</p>
<p>"(!a. P a) &lt;-&gt; (P b)"</p>
<p>But once I make "b" free, I explicitly end up with,</p>
<p>theorem "!b. (!a. P a) &lt;-&gt; (P b)" apply auto oops</p>
<p>My logic calculator can never show me how free variables are implicitly <br>
quantified. I just have to know. (I get in trouble when I make emphatic <br>
claims.)</p>
<p>I can prove these two equivalent forms of a theorem, one with free <br>
variables, and one with bound:</p>
<p>theorem<br>
--"3 implications proves 3 propositions are equivalent."<br>
   "!A B C.(A --&gt; B) &amp; (B --&gt; C) &amp; (C --&gt; A) &lt;-&gt;   (A &lt;-&gt; B) &amp; (A &lt;-&gt; C) <br>
&amp; (B &lt;-&gt; C)"<br>
by auto</p>
<p>theorem<br>
--"Now with free variables."<br>
   "(A --&gt; B) &amp; (B --&gt; C) &amp; (C --&gt; A) &lt;-&gt;   (A &lt;-&gt; B) &amp; (A &lt;-&gt; C) &amp; (B <br>
&lt;-&gt; C)"<br>
by auto</p>
<p>But I can't use the safety net of mechanized proofs to make sure that <br>
I'm using free variables the way I think I'm using them, which I would <br>
do, even if something looked obvious.</p>
<p>If you say, "You've proved they're equivalent," then I say, "No, I've <br>
only proved that they're both true." I have to take your word for it <br>
that, in the software, they are logically equivalent.</p>
<p>Oh, well. Faith is required when I can't read the source code.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Tjark,</p>
<p>I think I'm straightened out, but the least little difference in what <br>
people say can make me wonder if I'm straightened out.</p>
<p>I think what confused me is that I was assuming that how Nitpick uses a <br>
formula in a theorem, such as,</p>
<p>theorem "~((A --&gt; B --&gt; A) --&gt; (A &lt;-&gt; B))"<br>
oops</p>
<p>is the same way the prover engine uses it. (I still wouldn't know what <br>
the software is doing.)</p>
<p>If you had said before my email, "GB, the truth value of '~((A --&gt; B --&gt; <br>
A) --&gt; (A &lt;-&gt; B))' cannot be determined until you assign truth values to <br>
A and B", then at worst, I would have said, "Tjark, I remember that now. <br>
I used to be so good at thinking in terms of truth tables before <br>
Isabelle started overloading me with information."</p>
<p>Anyway, I always get a little extra out of these exchanges, even if I <br>
don't start them off right.</p>
<p>Whatever is actually happening in Nitpick's engine and the provers <br>
engine, I now know that with free variables, I can consider that Nitpick <br>
is checking a "theorem" like this:</p>
<p>definition false_formula::"bool =&gt; bool =&gt; bool" where<br>
     "false_formula A B == ~((A --&gt; B --&gt; A) --&gt; (A &lt;-&gt; B))"<br>
value "false_formula True True" (*Output panel: "False" :: "bool" *)</p>
<p>That helps a lot, because I was in this mindset that when Nitpick found <br>
counterexamples for both a "theorem" and its negation, that it had found <br>
an inconsistency.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I now consider that the prover engine has converted <br>
my theorem above to</p>
<p>theorem "!A B. ~((A --&gt; B --&gt; A) --&gt; (A &lt;-&gt; B))"<br>
oops</p>
<p>even though Makarius has talked about quantifiers getting stripped away.</p>

all the theorems are stated with proper quantification, albeit expressed in<br>

<p>Whenever I see this kind of discussion I remember that I am  actually<br>

I'm not complaining. I'm just talking because I'm allowed to.</p>
<p>Like two months ago, I specifically asked, in a fairly precise way,<br>
"What's the difference between free variables and universally quantified<br>

<p>I will now give you a reasonably close, informal, one sentence answer.</p>
<p>ANSWER: A universally quantified bound variable is a logical statement,<br>
where a free variable is an argument to a function.</p>
<p>That's kind of huge difference don't you think? But two months ago,<br>
based<br>
on the zero answers like the above, I eventually started treating free<br>
variables like universally quantified variables.</p>
<p>Who straightened me out? Nitpick.</p>
<p>So I looked at the tutorials again, and "instantiation of free<br>
variables"<br>
became more clear. However, if I didn't write the software, how was I<br>
supposed to know how the proof engine is instantiating free variables<br>
when<br>
proving a theorem? Who's to say that it's not instantiating them in way<br>
that makes them equivalent to a universally quantified variable?<br>
Obviously<br>
not.</p>
<p>This substantiates my general guiding principle that it's a fool who<br>
picks<br>
a field of study or a software product that doesn't provide enough<br>
documentation and tools for people to be self-sufficient. To clarify, I<br>
haven't played the fool in this context.</p>
<p>So I had four forms of an axiom that I thought were logically<br>
equivalent.<br>
For my own reasons, I was going to axiomatize all four of them. However,<br>
being properly paranoid, I was trying to prove they were equivalent,<br>
which<br>
led to me trying to disprove what had been for me a basic logic error,<br>
which led to counter examples on both the theorem and its negation,<br>
which<br>
led to me understanding how free variables work.</p>
<p>Thank you Nitpick, for automating the holding of my hand.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This was about the Pure connectives !! and ==&gt; which are not the same as <br>
HOL ! and --&gt; (and more), even though sometimes people prefer to smash <br>
that distinction.  The point of Pure connectives is to describe the <br>
structure of a rule statement declaratively, so that the system knows what <br>
is meant and how to compose the rules (by back-chaining and unification).</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the usual FOL view on logic with many connectives, <br>
and application-specific operations (set-theory, lattices etc.). <br>
Automated tools turn all this object-logic material <em>and</em> the Pure !! and <br>
==&gt; into hash-brown, and try to serve that to the user.  This often works, <br>
but is no longer Pure logic, the one underlying Isar proofs.</p>
<p>So when you state</p>
<p>lemma "!x y. A x --&gt; B y"</p>
<p>your result is again compact "!x y. A x --&gt; B y" (with its implicit <br>
Trueprop wrapping).</p>
<p>But when you state</p>
<p>lemma "!!x y. A x ==&gt; B y"</p>
<p>your result is schematic "A ?x ==&gt; B ?y".  You can get the same rule by <br>
writing the statement with explicit "eigen-context" as follows:</p>
<p>lemma fixes x y assumes "A x" shows "B y"</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>lemma assumes "A x" shows "B y"</p>
<p>in most situations, where x and y are implicitly free and thus ready to be <br>
fixed at the outermost level.</p>
<p>In the latter two forms, the resulting rules emerge naturally, without <br>
navigating through logical connectives first.</p>
