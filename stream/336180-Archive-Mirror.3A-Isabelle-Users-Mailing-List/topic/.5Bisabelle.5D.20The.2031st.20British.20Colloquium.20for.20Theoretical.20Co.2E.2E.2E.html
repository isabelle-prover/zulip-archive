<p>British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science<br>
                    Middlesex University, Hendon, London, UK<br>
                             14th--18th September 2015<br>

<p>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION</p>
<p>The 31st British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science will be<br>
hosted by the Foundations of Computing Group, Department of<br>
Computer Science, Middlesex University, from 14th to 18th September,<br>
2015.</p>
<p>Associated with the meeting, on Thursday 17th September, is the<br>
London Mathematical Society (LMS) Algorithms &amp; Cryptography Day. The<br>
LMS will celebrate its 150th anniversary as BCTCS celebrates its 30th<br>
with its first visit to the capital.</p>
<p>The purpose of BCTCS is to provide a forum in which researchers in<br>
theoretical computer science can meet, present research findings, and<br>
discuss developments in the field. It also aims to provide an<br>
environment in which PhD students can gain experience in presenting<br>
their work, and benefit from contact with established researchers.</p>
<p>The scope of the colloquium includes all aspects of theoretical<br>
computer science, including automata theory, algorithms, complexity<br>
theory, semantics, formal methods, concurrency, types, languages and<br>
logics. Both computer scientists and mathematicians are welcome to<br>
attend, as are participants from outside of the UK.</p>
<p>The colloquium features both invited and contributed talks.  This year<br>
the invited speakers currently include the following:</p>
<p>Samson Abramsky, Oxford University, UK.<br>
   Timothy Gowers, Cambridge University, UK.<br>
   Tony Hoare, Microsoft Research, UK.<br>
   Thomas Hales, University of Pittsburgh, USA, (LMS Keynote).<br>
   Per Martin-Lof, Stockholm University, Sweden.<br>
   Joseph Sifakis, University of Grenoble, France.</p>
<p>The LMS meeting on Thursday also has eminent speakers.</p>
<p>Lance Fortnow, Georgia Tech, USA.<br>
   Shafi Goldwasser, MIT, USA.<br>
   Jon Kleinberg, Cornell University, USA.<br>
   Mike Paterson, University of Warwick.<br>
   Adi Shamir, Weizmann Institute, Israel.<br>
   Nigel Smart, University of Bristol.</p>
<p>Registration is now open from the following link:</p>

<p>The registration fee is £140 plus £40 for the conference dinner (note<br>
the receipt will not be itemised). We are grateful for support from the<br>
Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research which will provide<br>
bursaries for 18 students to cover registration fees and accommodation.<br>

abstracts of talks to g.primiero@mdx.ac.uk&lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:g.primiero@mdx.ac.uk">g.primiero@mdx.ac.uk</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>The deadline for registration is 27th August.</p>
<p>We have reserved a number of rooms at Hendon Hall Hotel at £110 per<br>
night (please contact barnabymartin@gmail.com&lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:barnabymartin@gmail.com">barnabymartin@gmail.com</a>&gt;). However, there is the<br>
possibility to stay at many hotels within a short bus journey and these<br>
rooms are cheaper when booked by individuals.</p>
