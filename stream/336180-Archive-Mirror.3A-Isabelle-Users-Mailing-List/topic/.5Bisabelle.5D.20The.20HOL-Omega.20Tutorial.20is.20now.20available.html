<p>From: Peter Vincent Homeier &lt;<a href="mailto:palantir@trustworthytools.com">palantir@trustworthytools.com</a>&gt;<br>
I am pleased to announce that, as promised, the HOL-Omega Tutorial is now<br>
available, at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trustworthytools.com/holw/tutorial.pdf">http://www.trustworthytools.com/holw/tutorial.pdf</a></p>
<p>The HOL-Omega system is a significant extension of the popular and mature<br>
HOL4 theorem prover, which has been under development for twenty-five<br>
years. The HOL-Omega logic is virtually completely backwards compatible<br>
with HOL4, so that libraries, applications, and developments written for<br>
HOL4 will work in HOL-Omega without any changes, with very few exceptions.</p>
<p>HOL4 users are thus encouraged to investigate HOL-Omega without any loss of<br>
functionality.</p>
<p>But HOL-Omega adds significant new power of interest to all users of<br>
theorem provers, primarily centered around two key ideas, and what flows<br>
from each:</p>
<p>(1) Types can be abstracted by type variables (similar to how terms are<br>
abstracted by term variables in the lambda calculus).</p>
<p>--- Type operators are curried, so that they may take one argument at a<br>
time.</p>
<p>--- Every type has a {\it kind}; kinds determine which type applications<br>
are sensible.</p>
<p>--- Type variables can represent type operators.</p>
<p>(2) Terms can be abstracted by type variables (similar to System F).</p>
<p>--- The type of such an abstraction is a universal type.</p>
<p>--- Such an abstraction may be applied as a function to a type argument.</p>
<p>--- Such applications are managed by classifying all types into ranks.</p>
<p>These extensions of traditional higher order logic in a classical setting<br>
were thought impossible for many years, proven to be inconsistent according<br>
to Girard's paradox. But by the careful structuring of the type system by<br>
ranks, soundness is maintained and Girard's paradox is defeated.</p>
<p>This means that unlike other advanced-logic theorem provers that restrain<br>
their logics to an intuitionistic logic, HOL-Omega is a higher order logic<br>
in a fully classical setting, where the law of the excluded middle holds,<br>
equality of functions or predicates can be proven by extensionality, the<br>
Hilbert epsilon operator is available for non-deterministic choice, and all<br>
types are inhabited, supporting traditional HOL theorems like |- (!x. P x)<br>
==&gt; (?x. P x).</p>
<p>The effect of these design choices is that the HOL-Omega logic is much more<br>
congenial, intuitive, and easy to work in than an intuitionistic logic,<br>
while still providing the powerful new forms of abstraction listed above.</p>
<p>If the reader is interested and would like to try it, instructions for<br>
obtaining and installing theHOL-Omega system may be found at</p>

<p>From: Peter Vincent Homeier &lt;<a href="mailto:palantir@trustworthytools.com">palantir@trustworthytools.com</a>&gt;<br>
There was a bug in the previous version of the HOL-Omega system which<br>
prevented it from building with Poly/ML 5.5, the current version of Poly/ML.</p>
<p>This has been fixed and posted to the public repository for HOL-Omega, and<br>
the current version should build correctly. If anyone has tried building HOL<br>
-Omega and been frustrated, please try again with this new version of HOL-<br>
Omega.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Robert Solovay for reporting this bug.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Peter V. Homeier</p>
