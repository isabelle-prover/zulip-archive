<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi John, Cris, Mark, Rob, and Roger,</p>
<p>Before going into the details of John's e-mail on the motivation for HOL Light, <br>
from which I included a larger passage, let me reply to the other comments <br>
concerning the overview at <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4444/100.111">http://dx.doi.org/10.4444/100.111</a></p>
<p>The following paragraph was added (plus a list of links):<br>
"Neither the graph nor the above list are comprehensive. Further logics are <br>
William M. Farmer's Q0u and Q0uqe (extensions of Andrews' Q0 with <br>
undefinedness), and further systems are TPS by Peter B. Andrews et al., HOL <br>
Zero by Mark Adams (designed for trustworthiness, and rather a proof checker <br>
like Automath and the R0 implementation), and IMPS by William M. Farmer et al. <br>
(with partial functions and subtypes). Historically, "[t]he original LCF team <br>
at Stanford consisted of Robin Milner, assisted by Whitfield Diffie" [Gordon, <br>
2000, p. 169] - now known for the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange in <br>
cryptography. Both Rob Arthan and Roger Bishop Jones generously credit each <br>
other for having the main rôle in the creation of ProofPower."</p>
<p>It's difficult to add more systems to the graph. Further are included in the <br>
new list and are in good company with Andrews' TPS, which I hesitated to add to <br>
the graph, as it would distract from the much more important Q0.</p>
<p>Due to the suggestions of Rob Arthan, I have included a footnote for HOL with <br>
the three references given. I am not sure whether the mechanism is already <br>
implemented in HOL4, see section 2.5.5 of<br>
<a href="http://freefr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/hol/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf">http://freefr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/hol/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf</a></p>
<p>In case the article on Isabelle/HOL by Ondrej Kuncar and Andrei Popescu will be <br>
printed again elsewhere, I would like to suggest two modifications of the part <br>
quoted in my overview: 1. Gordon's proposal was rather in the eighties than in <br>
the nineties (release of HOL88 in 1988, Gordon's technical report of 1985).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The formulation "Classical Higher-Order Logic" seems the be more common <br>
than "Classic Higher-Order Logic".</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks to Cris Perdue, Mark Adams, Rob Arthan, and Roger Bishop Jones for the <br>
hints.</p>
<p>If you still miss any important information, please do not hesitate to send a <br>
notice via the mailing lists.</p>
<p>John's e-mail on the motivation for HOL Light and his comparison with Andrews' <br>
systems is highly interesting. I would suggest an article "On the Logical <br>
Foundations of HOL Light" or similar to make the information persistent, as the <br>
policy of the mailing list provider may change. For now, I have quoted from the <br>
publicly available e-mail via the online link.</p>
<p>I totally agree that the derivation of higher-order logic (and of mathematics <br>
in general) on the basis of the notion of equality is "quite satisfying". When <br>
I met Andrews, he told me that he chose the letter 'Q' in the name of his <br>
system Q0 because it is based on the notion of equality. For philosophical <br>
reasons, I would prefer the word 'identity', but mathematically it doesn't make <br>
a difference.</p>
<p>As most people do not look behind the definitions (e.g., of the quantifiers), <br>
these definitions first might look "intricate", but logically they are simply <br>
the result of spelling out their inner logic (i.e., following Andrews' concept <br>
of "expressiveness", which I also call "reducibility").</p>
<p>In higher-order logic, where propositions are not a separate syntactic category <br>
anymore, the "conventional notation ∀x. P[x] [maps] down to ∀(λx. P[x])".<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/tutorial_220.pdf">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/tutorial_220.pdf</a> (p. 218),<br>
or similarly<br>
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mjcg/papers/HolHistory.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mjcg/papers/HolHistory.pdf</a> (p. 10).<br>
With type abstraction, also types are not a separate syntactic category <br>
anymore, but terms of type tau.<br>
Then the quantifiers have the type as an argument, such that the expression is <br>
not just ALL (\x. P[x]), but ALL t (\x. P[x]), where 't' is the type (or a type <br>
variable), meaning "for all x of type t, P holds", for example<br>
    ALL t (\z.((x z) =&gt; (y z)))<br>
in the definition of the subset or<br>
    ALL o (\x.(g x))<br>
in Axiom 1 of R0 (Law of Excluded Middle, like Axiom 1 of Q0), see:<br>
<a href="http://www.kenkubota.de/files/R0_draft_excerpt_with_definitions_and_groups.pdf">http://www.kenkubota.de/files/R0_draft_excerpt_with_definitions_and_groups.pdf</a> (p. 357)<br>
<a href="http://www.kenkubota.de/files/R0_draft_excerpt_with_axioms_and_proof_of_C_function.pdf">http://www.kenkubota.de/files/R0_draft_excerpt_with_axioms_and_proof_of_C_function.pdf</a> (p. 351)</p>
<p>I much appreciate that in HOL Light the basic logical notions including the <br>
quantifiers are independent of the "suspicious" epsilon operator. Eventually, <br>
maybe with the introduction of type abstraction (already suggested by Gordon), <br>
in the HOL systems the epsilon operator should be eliminated and replaced by <br>
the description operator, as in Andrews' Q0. For example, Gordon's definition <br>
of "the conditional term Cond" in Gordon's 2001 paper at<br>
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.27.6103&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.27.6103&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a> (p. 24)<br>
can be replaced by Andrews' definition of C, see Andrews' theorem 5313 and its <br>
formal verification (here with type abstraction) at<br>

<p>Thank you very much for this interesting information, John.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
