<p>From: Joachim Breitner &lt;<a href="mailto:breitner@kit.edu">breitner@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>this is slightly off topic and in no way related to the recent<br>
discussion about foundations and certification, but I created a new<br>
theorem prover.</p>
<p>But first things first:<br>
(The following text is also on my blog at <a href="https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/682">https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/682</a>)</p>
<p>In a few weeks, I will have the opportunity to offer a weekend workshop<br>
to selected and motivated high school students to a topic of my choice.<br>
My idea is to tell them something about logic, proofs, and the joy of<br>
searching and finding proofs, and thegratification of irrevocable<br>
truths.</p>
<p>While proving things on paper is already quite nice, it is much more<br>
fun to use an interactive theorem prover, such as Isabelle, Coq or<br>
Agda: You get immediate feedback, you can experiment and play around if<br>
you are stuck, and you get lots of small successes. Someone once called<br>
interactive theorem proving “the worlds most geekiest videogame”.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t think one can get high school students without<br>
any prior knowledge in logic, or programming, or fancy mathematical <br>
symbols, to do something meaningful with a system like Isabelle, so I <br>
need something that is (much) easier to use. I always had this idea in <br>
the back of my head that proving is not so much about writing text (as <br>
in “normally written” proofs) or programs (as in Agda) or labeled <br>
statements (as in Hilbert-style proofs), but rather something involving<br>
facts that I have proven so far floating around freely, and way to <br>
combine these facts to new facts, without the need to name them, or put<br>
them in a particular order or sequence. In a way, I’m looking for <br>
labVIEW wrestled through the Curry-Horward-isomorphism.</p>
<p>So I set out, rounded up a few contributors, implemented this idea, and<br>
now I proudly present:</p>
<p>The Incredible Proof Machine<br>
<a href="http://incredible.nomeata.de/">http://incredible.nomeata.de/</a></p>
<p>This interactive theorem prover allows you to do perform proofs purely<br>
by dragging blocks (representing proof steps) onto the paper and <br>
connecting them properly. There is no need to learn syntax, and hence<br>
no frustration about getting that wrong. Furthermore, it comes with a<br>
number of example tasks to experiment with, so you can simply see it as<br>
a challenging computer came and work through them one by one, learning<br>
something about the logical connectives and how they work as you go.</p>
<p>For the actual workshop, my plan is to let the students first <br>
try to solve the tasks of one session on their own, let them draw their<br>
own conclusions and come up with an idea of what they just did, and<br>
then deliver an explanation of the logical meaning of what they did.</p>
<p>The implementation is heavily influenced by Isabelle: The software does<br>
not know anything about, say, conjunction (∧) and implication (→). To <br>
the core, everything is but an untyped lambda expression, and when two <br>
blocks are connected, it does unification of the proposition present on<br>
either side. This general framework is then instantiated by specifying<br>
the basic rules (or axioms) in a descriptive manner. It is quite<br>
feasible to implement other logics or formal systems on top of this as<br>
well.</p>
<p>At this point I must thank Tobias for writing up his pattern<br>
unification algorith so nicely back then:<br>
<a href="http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/lics93.html">http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/lics93.html</a></p>
<p>Another influence of Isabelle is the non-linear editing: You neither <br>
have to create the proof in a particular order nor have to manually <br>
manage a “proof focus”. Instead, you can edit any bit of the proof at <br>
any time, and the system checks all of it continuously.</p>
<p>As always, I am keen on feedback. Also, if you want to use this for<br>
your own teaching or experimenting needs, let me know. We have a<br>
mailing list for the project, the code is on GitHub, where you can also<br>
file bug reports and feature requests. Contributions are welcome! All<br>
aspects of the logic are implemented in Haskell and compiled to<br>
JavaScript using GHCJS, the UI is plain hand-written and messy<br>
JavaScript code, using JointJS to handle the graph interaction.</p>
<p>Obviously, there is still plenty that can be done to improve the <br>
machine. In particular, the ability to create your own proof blocks, <br>
such as proof by contradiction, prove them to be valid and then use<br>
them  in further proofs, is currently being worked on. And while the<br>
page will store your current progress, including all proofs you create,<br>
in your browser, it needs better ways to save, load and share tasks,<br>
blocks and proofs. Also, we’d like to add some gamification, i.e.<br>
achievements  (“First proof by contradiction”, “50 theorems proven”),<br>
statistics, maybe a “share theorem on twitter” button.</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>
Joachim<br>

Nice work.</p>
<p>Just one experience when I played around with it, which puzzled me, and<br>
might severely puzzle your students: I tried A&amp;B&amp;C ==&gt; A&amp;C, my attempt<br>
is attached.</p>
<p>As I did not know whether &amp; binds to left or right, I ended up attaching<br>
the line to the wrong exit. But then, I got an error on the line from<br>
the start, which was fine previously. I.e., when I attach something to a<br>
block, I may get an error at a seemingly unrelated point.</p>
<p>Moreover, if I have something like<br>
  A&amp;B&amp;C ---&gt; (dest-AND) </p>
<p>I would like to "see" which propositions are available at the outputs.</p>

<p>Right. One of my ideas is to keep track of the order in which<br>
connections have been added (or been changed), and apply unification in<br>
that order. In fact, I think I forgot that I planned to do this, so I<br>
better create an issue for it:<br>

<p>You can always “pull out” a connection (without connecting it to<br>
something else) and see what’s on it. But it would be more convenient<br>
to see something right away; this is also planned:<br>

<p>Dear Joachim,</p>
<p>nice work! This reminds me of two things:</p>
<p>1) I saw something similar (?) a few month ago (IIRC for plain<br>
propositional logic and implemented via first-order unification),<br>
which was the result of a student project supervised by Vincent van<br>
Oostrom (who I CC'ed). AFAIK it is only available as non-free iPhone<br>
app. Anyway, maybe there are ideas that could be exchanged?</p>
<p>2) Since you mentioned the nice paper by Tobias (on higher-order<br>
pattern unification). Did you also implement the "devar" optimization<br>
of the same paper? Just recently, Julian Nagele (a PhD student in our<br>
group; who I also CC'ed), stumbled upon a problem with "devar" when<br>
implementing the same algorithm. I do not remember the details (maybe<br>
Julian could comment), only that a little bit of hg-digging revealed<br>
the following changeset:</p>
<p>changeset:   12232:ff75ed08b3fb<br>
user:        berghofe<br>
date:        Mon Nov 19 17:34:02 2001 +0100<br>
summary:     Replaced devar by Envir.head_norm</p>
<p>(referring to src/Pure/pattern.ML)</p>
<p>I'm curios to whether others already had a similar experience with<br>
"devar" and what the intention behind this change was?</p>
<p>cheers</p>

<p>Are you referring to “§9 Minimizing new variables” in the paper? Since<br>
this seems to be part of the ML code in <br>

<p>Sorry, I really can't remember the details, but I'm pretty sure that<br>
it was just about the concrete implementation of the "devar" function<br>
(section 6; so it should not be related to section 9).</p>
