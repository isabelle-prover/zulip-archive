<p>From: Ken Kubota &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@kenkubota.de">mail@kenkubota.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi John,</p>
<p>Thanks for the additional information. I will need some time to digest the <br>
papers you refer to.</p>
<p>Concerning the definitional principles of HOL, already in the past I have spent <br>
some thoughts about how to express the same in Q0/R0, and consider including <br>
some remarks in my R0 publication.</p>
<p>To avoid misunderstandings, let me refer to the extensions of the logic as <br>
discussed in sections 2.5.1 - 2.5.4 of the current HOL4 manual at:<br>
<a href="http://freefr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/hol/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf">http://freefr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/hol/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf</a></p>
<p>2.5.1 Extension by constant definition (John: "new_definition")</p>
<p>In the R0 implementation, definitions are not implemented as part of the <br>
logical kernel, but are labels attached to well-formed formulae (wffs) used for <br>
parsing and printing. I consider definitions simply as abbreviations, hence <br>
there is no need to make them part of the logical reasoning by introducing <br>
theorems for them. Consequently, definitions (abbreviations) can be removed and <br>
introduced again at any time without consequences for the reasoning itself, and <br>
without the danger of causing an inconsistency. (The wff to be abbreviated <br>
doesn't even need to be a closed term.) See the following R0 log, where <br>
comments start with (##) and output with (#):</p>
<h2>print universal quantifier ALL (A)</h2>
<h2>(short and long - fully typed - version)</h2>
<p>A</p>
<h1>wff      29 :  [\t.[\p.((=_[\x.T])_p)]]                   :=  A</h1>
<h1>w typd   29 :</h1>

g_x)]))</p>
<p>2.5.2 Extension by constant specification (John: "new_specification")</p>
<p>The specification example in the manual<br>
    ¬(b1 = b2)<br>
or<br>
    not (b1 = b2)<br>
with b1 and b2 of type bool could be introduced as a hypothesis h.</p>
<p>Then we would have theorems<br>
    h |- t1<br>
    h |- t2<br>
etc.</p>
<p>If h would be inconsistent (h |- F), we could prove: not h.</p>
<p>Otherwise (the consistent case), the variables (b1 and b2) in h are free, e.g.,<br>
    not (b1 = b2) |- t1<br>
    not (b1 = b2) |- t2<br>
such that the restrictions on free variables in the set of hypotheses for Rule <br>
R' [Andrews, 2002, p. 214] apply, and hence, the "variables" practically behave <br>
like constants, as in HOL. Note that neither the Rule of Universal <br>
Generalization (5220) nor the Rule of Substitution (5221) are applicable due to <br>
their restrictions on free variables in the set of hypotheses [cf. Andrews, <br>
2002, p. 222], which means that b1 and b2 could not be instantiated if they <br>
would appear as free variables in t1 or t2.</p>
<p>2.5.3 Remarks about constants in HOL</p>
<p>This passage, according to my memory the same as the original by Andy Pitts, <br>
discusses the "dependency on type variables", arguing that "explicitly <br>
recording dependency of constants on type variables makes for a rather <br>
cumbersome syntax".<br>
However, with type abstraction, types are not a separate syntactic category <br>
anymore, but terms of type tau. This means that the type variables are subject <br>
to the same restrictions of Rule R' as regular variables, resulting in a <br>
uniform treatment of both regular and type variables, and in addition to that, <br>
the binding of type variables with lambda preserves dependency information.<br>
With the means of type abstraction, explicit tracking of the dependency on type <br>
variables can be expressed very naturally with the means of the formal <br>
language, as (in general) intended by Russell.</p>
<p>2.5.4 Extension by type definition</p>
<p>The corresponding mechanism in R0 was described recently:</p>
<p>"In R0, the interpretation of types is that of (nonempty) sets. Naturally, one <br>
would see, for example,<br>
the number 3 as a natural number, and therefore has its type:<br>
    3 : N   (or "3_N" in Tex/LaTeX notation)<br>
[...]<br>
The consequence is, of course, that a mathematical entity may have several <br>
types, as naturally<br>
one would like to express 3 : N, 3 : S5, or 3 : R (three is a real number).<br>
[...]<br>
Since terms like [\x.x&lt;5] (S5, the set of the numbers smaller than 5), can <br>
become a type, the strict<br>
distinction between terms and types is removed, as when a theorem like<br>
    (S5 3)<br>
is obtained, S5 becomes a type by adding the types of types (tau) to it, and<br>
to the number 3 the new type S5 is added."<br>

<p>The advantage in comparison to the HOL mechanism is, as I believe, that new <br>
types are introduced very naturally, no axioms have to be assumed, and there <br>
is no duplication of mathematical structures (linked with a bijection / an <br>
isomorphism).</p>
<p>In summary, the definitional principles of HOL can be equivalently expressed by</p>
<ul>
<li>allowing wffs to be printed (and parsed) by shorthands attached to them,</li>
<li>
<p>Andrews' Rule R' (with a uniform treatment of regular variables and type <br>
variables),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and a simple, natural mechanism for introducing new types.<br>
Forgive me if I made a mistake while quickly writing down my ideas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Concerning HOL Light, I recall that in the current R0 draft (from May 18, <br>
2015), HOL Light is the main reference, as it has the same underlying concept <br>
of an extremely small logical kernel:<br>
"The axioms of R0 are only logical axioms. For a number of reasons discussed <br>
below no non-logical axioms (those not necessary for formal logic) are allowed <br>
in R0. HOL Light has 'three mathematical axioms' [Harrison, 2009, p. 62], and <br>
two of them are non-logical axioms: the axiom of choice and the axiom of <br>
infinity.<br>
In summary, if 'HOL Light is [...] a clean and simplified version of Mike <br>
Gordon's original HOL system' [Harrison, 2009, p. 60], then R0 is even cleaner <br>
and simpler than HOL Light and follows consequently the path of maximising <br>
logical rigor by reductionism." [Kubota, 2015, p. 14 f.]<br>
(Maybe the comparison is slightly unfair, since R0 is not designed for <br>
automation, opting for Hilbert-style like Q0.)</p>
<p>Also, other design decisions for HOL Light and R0 are identical.<br>
For example, having to decide between variable names and a numbering system for <br>
variables (like de Bruijn indices), I opted for names in order to make the <br>
logical reasoning as explicit as possible (besides better readability).<br>
Similarly, you wrote on HOL Light: "I reimplemented all the prelogic <br>
completely, abandoning de Bruijn terms in favour of a return to name-carrying <br>
syntax."<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/tutorial_220.pdf">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/tutorial_220.pdf</a> (p. 222)</p>
<p>Maybe it is best to continue discussion after the publication of R0, when <br>
comparisons can be made easier.</p>
