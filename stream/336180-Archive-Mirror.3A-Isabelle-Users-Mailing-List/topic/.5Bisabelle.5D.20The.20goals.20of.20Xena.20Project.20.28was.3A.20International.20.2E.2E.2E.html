<p>Last Friday I solved a mathematical problem from the Putnam Mathematical<br>
Competition and immediately after I formally verified my solution in<br>
Isabelle/HOL. It was nearly 5 hours of work (including solution and formal<br>
verification). I stopped for a coffee and food. So, I think that an<br>
International Olympiad in Isabelle will be possible in such conditions.</p>
<p>The problem was ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS in the following link:<br>
<a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~wwu/riddles/putnam.shtml">https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~wwu/riddles/putnam.shtml</a></p>
<p>My solution is here (it is not the most elegant formalization, because I<br>
was in a hurry trying to be as fast as possible):<br>

<p>After the formal verification, my understanding of the problem was much<br>
better than before.</p>
<p>I hope that one day the goals of the so-called Xena Project, i.e.,<br>
mathematical education with proof assistants, will be a current reality in<br>
most of universities of the world:<br>

<p>Competition is the best way to motivate people to do something new.</p>

<p>Dear José,</p>
<p>we had a similar idea for a "proving contest", implemented a prototype<br>
version<br>
and tested it with the Isabelle group here in Munich.<br>
Simon and I wrote up a few pages documenting the idea:<br>
<a href="http://www21.in.tum.de/~haslbema/documents/provingcontests_draft18.pdf">http://www21.in.tum.de/~haslbema/documents/provingcontests_draft18.pdf</a></p>
<p>We are planning to push this further in future.<br>

<p>Hello,<br>
  I just want to suggest, as an abstract possibility, that in order to<br>
introduce proof-assistants in popular culture, to organize an<br>
International<br>
Olympiad in Isabelle could be a good strategy. I imagine such an Olympiad<br>
as many high school students in a room, in front of their computers,<br>
trying<br>
to mechanize the proof of a hard theorem from elementary mathematics that<br>
is written on a blackboard, e.g., a theorem due to Erdos or Ramanujan. To<br>
use papers to write the arguments is forbidden: the proof should go from<br>
their brain to Isabelle in a direct way. The first student who finishes<br>
the<br>
proof win (this can be checked in an automatic).</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
José M.<br>
