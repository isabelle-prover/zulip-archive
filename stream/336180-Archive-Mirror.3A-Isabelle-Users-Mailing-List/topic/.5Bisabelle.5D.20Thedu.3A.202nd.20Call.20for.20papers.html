<p>THedu'12 Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>This workshop intends to gather the research communities for computer<br>
Theorem proving (TP), Automated Theorem Proving (ATP), Interactive<br>
Theorem Proving (ITP) as well as for Computer Algebra Systems (CAS)<br>
and Dynamic Geometry Systems (DGS). The workshop tries to combine and<br>
focus systems of these areas to enhance existing educational software<br>
as well as studying the design of the next generation of mechanised<br>
mathematics assistants (MMA). Elements for next-generation MMA's<br>
include:</p>
<p>* Declarative Languages for Problem Solution: education in applied<br>
       sciences and in engineering is mainly concerned with problems,<br>
       which involve operations on elementary objects to be transformed<br>
       to an object representing a problem solution. Preconditions and<br>
       postconditions of these operations can be used to describe the<br>
       possible steps in the problem space; thus, ATP-systems can be used<br>
       to check if an operation sequence given by the user does actually<br>
       present a problem solution. Such "Problem Solution Languages"<br>
       encompass declarative proof languages like Isabelle/Isar or Coq's<br>
       Mathematical Proof Language, but also more specialized forms such<br>
       as, for example, geometric problem solution languages that express<br>
       a proof argument in Euclidian Geometry or languages for graph<br>
       theory.</p>
<p>* Consistent Mathematical Content Representation: Libraries of<br>
       existing ITP-Systems, in particular those following the LCF-prover<br>
       paradigm, usually provide logically coherent and human readable<br>
       knowledge. In the leading provers, mathematical knowledge is<br>
       covered to an extent beyond most courses in applied<br>
       sciences. However, the potential of this mechanised knowledge for<br>
       education is clearly not yet recognised adequately: renewed<br>
       pedagogy calls for inquiry-based learning from concrete to<br>
       abstract --- and the knowledge's logical coherence supports such<br>
       learning: for instance, the formula 2.pi depends on the definition<br>
       of reals and of multiplication; close to these definitions are the<br>
       laws like commutativity etc. However, the complexity of the<br>
       knowledge's traceable interrelations poses a challenge to<br>
       usability design.</p>
<p>* User-Guidance in Stepwise Problem Solving: Such guidance is<br>
       indispensable for independent learning, but costly to implement so<br>
       far, because so many special cases need to be coded by<br>
       hand. However, TP technology makes automated generation of<br>
       user-guidance reachable: declarative languages as mentioned above,<br>
       novel programming languages combining computation and deduction,<br>
       methods for automated construction with ruler and compass from<br>
       specifications, etc --- all these methods 'know how to solve a<br>
       problem'; so, use the methods' knowledge to generate user-guidance<br>
       mechanically, this is an appealing challenge for ATP and ITP, and<br>
       probably for compiler construction!</p>
<p>In principle, mathematical software can be conceived as models of<br>
mathematics: The challenge addressed by this workshop series is to<br>
provide appealing models for MMAs which are interactive and which<br>
explain themselves such that interested students can independently<br>
learn by inquiry and experimentation.</p>

submitted in PDF format. They must conform to the EPTCS style<br>
guidelines [3].</p>
<p>At least one author of each accepted extended abstract/demo is<br>
expected to attend THedu'12 and presents her or his extended<br>
abstract/demo.</p>
<p>The post-proceedings (full papers, 20 pages max) will be published in<br>
the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS)<br>
series [4].</p>
