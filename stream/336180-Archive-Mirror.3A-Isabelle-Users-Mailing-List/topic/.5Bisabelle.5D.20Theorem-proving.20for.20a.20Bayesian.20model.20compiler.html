I'm trying to figure out if Isabelle is the right theorem prover /  <br>
proof assistant for my needs, or if I should use something else. I'm  <br>
writing a Bayesian model compiler, something that will turn a  <br>
specification of a joint probability distribution plus indication of  <br>
what variables are observed into Markov chain Monte Carlo code for  <br>
estimating the parameters.  There are existing software packages that  <br>
do something similar -- WinBUGS/OpenBUGS, JAGS, and hbc -- but they  <br>
all have limitations that are unacceptable for my purposes, and it  <br>
appears that I'll need some sort of theorem proving to overcome those  <br>
limitations.</p>
<p>Here are the features I'm looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interactive theorem proving (Isabelle seems to do this very well).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to write new proof tactics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to do derivational proofs where I know the form of what I  <br>
want to prove but don't know exactly what I'm proving until I reach  <br>
the end.  For example, I'm doing a chain of A1 = A2 = ... An, and only  <br>
when I reach an An that has the form I want do I know I'm done and  <br>
know that A1 = An is what I'm proving.  Likewise, I might be trying to  <br>
find a usable upper bound: B1 &lt;= B2 &lt;= ... Bn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to call the theorem prover as a software module in a larger  <br>
system (no user interaction). This would be for tasks simple enough to  <br>
fully automate with appropriate tactics, or to spit out subgoals for  <br>
which the user will need to provide proofs in harder cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How does Isabelle rate on these?  Would a different theorem prover /  <br>
proof assistant better fill these requirements?</p>
<p>(BTW I'm also looking at  HOL Light and HOL 4, which appear have the  <br>
last three features above, but my impression is that Isabelle is  <br>
easier to use for interactive proof and that the finished proofs are  <br>

<p>I only developed two small tactics in Isabelle, so I'm not very<br>

in ProofGeneral. Open a new theory and write </p>

<p>ML {*<br>
    fun .....<br>
  *}</p>
<p>theorem "..."<br>
    apply (tactic {* ML code *})</p>
<p>This is a very nice playground for ideas, later you can of course move<br>
your code to its own ML-file.</p>
<p>A introduction on how to write tactics is found in the Isabelle<br>
Cookbook:<br>

<p>Some proof methods in Isabelle work in this way. The most often used<br>
proof method (simp) works in this way. The user states a goal, applies<br>
the simplifier and gets back the simplified goal where he can apply<br>
further tactics. (This should also answer the previous question.)</p>

<p>I have no experiences with HOL Light or HOL 4. When you write your<br>
proofs in Isar (Isabelle's proof language) they are more readable.<br>
However I assume the OCaml / ML internals of HOL Light / HOL 4 are<br>
easier to understand.</p>

<p>The HOL systems are not fundamentally different.  There is mainly a <br>

Mike Gordon has a snappy description of the differences between the systems: Isabelle provide a better out-of-the-box experience, while HOL is better as an API for writing code that performs inference.</p>
<p>The various versions of HOL are much simpler internally than Isabelle, which simplifies programming. On the other hand, HOL provides less automation and its proof scripts are unintelligible.</p>

Lets say these systems are closer to the bare metal, so it is easier to <br>
read through the full sources and get an impression how it works.</p>
<p>In contrast, Isabelle is more like a Linux kernel over the bare logic, so <br>
you need to understand some higher structuring principles.  I would <br>
nonetheless call it simple, in the same way a modern operating system is <br>
"simple".</p>
<p>BTW, the APIs of Isabelle have been cleaned up a lot in recent years, so <br>
the simplicity is now easier to see, without the historical baggage <br>
getting in the way.</p>

<p>In addition to measure / probability theory, I'll need some linear  <br>

standard probability density functions (gamma, normal, multivariate  <br>
normal, etc.).  A lot of what I'll be doing looks a lot more like  <br>
computer algebra (transforming a function into an equivalent function,  <br>
where equivalent means the same up to a constant of proportionality,  <br>
and deriving gradients of multivariate functions), along with  <br>
establishing some upper bounds and proving some arithmetic results on  <br>
array indices.</p>
<p>I don't expect to be proving anything very deep. Mostly, I'm looking  <br>
to automate (at least partially) a process that is currently done by  <br>
doing the math by hand following some pretty standard patterns; I need  <br>
to be able to automate new patterns as they arise; and I need to be  <br>
highly confident that the results are correct.</p>

<p>From: Timothy McKenzie &lt;<a href="mailto:tjm1983@gmail.com">tjm1983@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
I'm a little surprised that no-one has yet mentioned the "also ... <br>
also ... finally ..." constructions in Isabelle/Isar.  There's an <br>
example in isar-overview in the documentation provided with <br>
Isabelle, and more technical documentation in isar-ref.  It can be <br>
used with both = and &lt;= (and, I think, even mixing the two), but <br>
it behaves unusually with &gt;=, because this is an abbreviation for <br>
&lt;=, and the abbreviation seems to be expanded before Isabelle <br>
decides which is the left-hand side and which is the right-hand <br>
side for the purposes of the next step.</p>
<p>And if you don't know exactly what you want to prove before you've <br>
proven it, you can make the statement of the lemma almost <br>
arbitrary until you've figured out what you want to prove, and <br>
then go back and change it.  I haven't used the other HOLs, but I <br>
understand that they work backwards, manipulating the goal until <br>
it becomes "True", so in those you'd need to state the lemma <br>
correctly before you begin.</p>

Isar calculations are parameterized by a collection of rules that are <br>
declared as "trans" and can be inspected via print_trans_rules.  This is a <br>
very general mechanism to combine relations in a forward manner. It also <br>
works with substitution of equalities or inequalities (with some care <br>
