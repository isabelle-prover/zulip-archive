<p>From: Joachim Breitner &lt;<a href="mailto:breitner@kit.edu">breitner@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Dear List,</p>
<p>in order to get a better handle on my formalizations I’d like to build<br>
some tools, similar to unused_thms, that can aid guide my reorganization<br>
of lemmas and theories. The data I need for that are the theory graph<br>
and the lemma dependencies.</p>
<p>I found this code to extract the list of theorems used by a particular<br>
theorem:<br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2006-March/msg00091.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2006-March/msg00091.html</a><br>
which I adjusted to today’s definition of PThm.</p>
<p>In that thread it is noted that "-p 1" has to be used. Is that<br>
information still valid in 2014? I could not find a mention of this<br>
option in the systems manual nor "isabelle jedit --help". Note that I do<br>
not care about the dependencies on lemmas in the underlying heap (if<br>
that makes a difference).</p>
<p>It seems that adding<br>
        ML "Proofterm.proofs := 2"<br>
to the top of my developments makes the code above actually do something<br>
useful, but not ":= 1", which I presume corresponds to what "-p 1" used<br>
to be. Is this mode "1" still supported?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Joachim<br>

<p>thanks for the pointer. I often forget about the Cookboook. Is there a<br>
good reason it is not included with the other documentation that comes<br>
with Isabelle?</p>
<p>Based on the information there I came up with this code that traverses<br>
the tree of used theorems, stopping at those that have a name:</p>
<p>fun thms_used_by_thm thm =<br>
  let<br>
  fun used_by_proof_body (PBody {thms, ...}) = thms |&gt; map #2 |&gt; map go |&gt; List.concat<br>
  and go ("", _, pbodyf) = pbodyf |&gt; Future.join |&gt; used_by_proof_body<br>
    | go (s, _, _) = [s]<br>
  in thm |&gt; Thm.proof_body_of |&gt; Proofterm.strip_thm |&gt; used_by_proof_body<br>
  end;</p>

<p>The Cookbook is generally lagging behind in accuracy and quality.  Many <br>
things in it have a point and many things are very odd or outright wrong. <br>
I have pointed out small and big mistakes quite often in the past, but it <br>
did not improve much.  Moreover, Isabelle has changed quite substantially <br>
since the start of the Cookbook, but it did not catch up.</p>

<p>PThm names are always stored since about 2008.  None of this really works, <br>
though.  Even 'unused_thms' remained unfinished over many years until <br>
today, and has a bunch of conceptual problems.</p>
<p>There is no point to make 2-3 half-working variants of something that <br>
needs to be done right once and for all.  Anything else is just a waste of <br>
time -- it actually prevents to get things right eventually.</p>
