Applications are now invited for participation in the</p>
<p>Third DeepSpec Summer School (DSSS'20)<br>
         New Haven, CT, July 13-24, 2020<br>

<p>Overview</p>
<hr>
<p>Can critical systems be built according to functionally precise<br>
specifications of of their constituent components (processor,<br>
operating system, crypto library,..) and development tools (compilers,<br>
synthesis tools)? This may seem a pipe dream, but the past decade has<br>
seen remarkable advances in the technology required to realize it. The<br>
DeepSpec summer school will provide students with knowledge and<br>
experience necessary for understanding the state of the art and for<br>
contributing to ongoing research efforts, based on the interactive<br>
proof assistant Coq. The school is supported by generous funding from<br>
the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>DSSS'20 will consist of two parts with the first week being devoted to<br>
introductory topics and the second week covering current research<br>
efforts.</p>
<p>July 13-15 (Mon-Wed)    Coq intensive; CertiKOS design &amp; spec<br>
July 16-17 (Thu-Fri)    Fundamental proof techniques and project overviews<br>
July 20-24 (week 2)     Advanced topics in system verification</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Week 1 begins with a Coq Intensive, introducing our favorite proof<br>
  assistant (used in almost all other lectures), with no assumption of<br>
  formal-methods experience.  A mix of lecturers (who will also<br>
  present research lectures later in the program) will cover this<br>
  material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For participants who already know the Coq Intensive material, we<br>
  will offer a Week 1 parallel track taught by Zhong Shao, on the<br>
  CertiKOS operating-system framework, focused on the compositional<br>
  specification and implementation of C modules, setting up to learn<br>
  how to prove these modules in Week 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Week 1 ends with lectures by Andrew Appel, on verified functional<br>
  algorithms; and Joe Tassarotti, on theory and computer-systems<br>
  applications of the Iris verification framework for concurrency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Week 2 includes lectures by Adam Chlipala, on connecting proofs of<br>
  hardware and software components for embedded systems; Benjamin<br>
  Pierce, on random testing and an application to web servers; Zhong<br>
  Shao, on operating-system verification; Matthieu Sozeau, on the<br>
  MetaCoq framework and (as a representative of the Coq team at Inria)<br>
  recent improvements in and latest roadmap for Coq; Stephanie<br>
  Weirich, on verifying functional algorithms written in Haskell; and<br>
  Steve Zdancewic, on the Interaction Trees formalism and its<br>
  applications to compilers and testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be ample opportunity for self-study/homework, student<br>
  presentations, and other activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Prerequisites</p>
<hr>
<p>DSSS'20 is aimed at a wide range of participants, including graduate<br>
students, academics, and industrial engineers and researchers.</p>
<p>The Coq proof assistant will serve as a lingua franca for all the<br>
lectures. Participants who are not familiar with Coq at the level of<br>
Software Foundations (Volume 1) should plan on attending the Coq<br>
Intensive. Participants unfamiliar with volumes 2 and 3 may benefit<br>
from attending the last 3 days of week 1.</p>
<p>Participants of DSSS'17 and DSSS'18 are likely to be admitted for<br>
participation in week 2 only.</p>
<p>Application and participation</p>
<hr>
<p>Participation in DSSS'20 is by invitation only, based on an<br>
application process that is open to anybody. To apply, please fill<br>
this application form</p>
<p><a href="https://cvent.me/xqlq0G">https://cvent.me/xqlq0G</a></p>
<p>preferably no later than March 27, 2020. Accepted participants will be<br>
notified shortly thereafter, and will be invited to confirm their<br>
participation by registering.</p>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of NSF, we will be able to provide<br>
substantial financial assistance to all participants. We will not<br>
charge a registration fee, and will offer free dorm accommodation on<br>
the campus of Yale University. In addition, we expect to<br>
subsidize travel expenses for the majority of participants, based on<br>
their geographic origin, qualification, and financial needs. To help<br>
us allocating these funds, the application form includes the option to<br>
enter estimated travel costs etc.</p>
<p>Late applications will be handled on a case-by-case basis.  </p>
