A Formalization of Assumptions and Guarantees for Compositional Noninterference<br>
Sylvia Grewe, Heiko Mantel, Daniel Schoepe</p>
<p>Research in information-flow security aims at developing methods to identify<br>
undesired information leaks within programs from private (high) sources to<br>
public (low) sinks. For a concurrent system, it is desirable to have<br>
compositional analysis methods that allow for analyzing each thread<br>
independently and that nevertheless guarantee that the parallel composition of<br>
successfully analyzed threads satisfies a global security guarantee. However,<br>
such a compositional analysis should not be overly pessimistic about what an<br>
environment might do with shared resources. Otherwise, the analysis will reject<br>
many intuitively secure programs.</p>
<p>The paper "Assumptions and Guarantees for Compositional Noninterference" by<br>
Mantel et. al. presents one solution for this problem: an approach for<br>
compositionally reasoning about non-interference in concurrent programs via<br>
rely-guarantee-style reasoning. We present an Isabelle/HOL formalization of the<br>
concepts and proofs of this approach.</p>

<p>A Formalization of Strong Security<br>
Sylvia Grewe, Alexander Lux, Heiko Mantel, Jens Sauer</p>
<p>Research in information-flow security aims at developing methods to identify<br>
undesired information leaks within programs from private sources to public<br>
sinks. Noninterference captures this intuition. Strong security from Sabelfeld<br>
and Sands formalizes noninterference for concurrent systems.</p>
<p>We present an Isabelle/HOL formalization of strong security for arbitrary<br>
security lattices (Sabelfeld and Sands use a two-element security lattice in the<br>
original publication). The formalization includes compositionality proofs for<br>
strong security and a soundness proof for a security type system that checks<br>
strong security for programs in a simple while language with dynamic thread<br>
creation.</p>
<p>Our formalization of the security type system is abstract in the language for<br>
expressions and in the semantic side conditions for expressions. It can easily<br>
be instantiated with different syntactic approximations for these side<br>
conditions. The soundness proof of such an instantiation boils down to showing<br>
that these syntactic approximations imply the semantic side conditions.</p>

<p>A Formalization of Declassification with WHAT-and-WHERE-Security<br>
Sylvia Grewe, Alexander Lux, Heiko Mantel, Jens Sauer</p>
<p>AbsResearch in information-flow security aims at developing methods to identify<br>
undesired information leaks within programs from private sources to public<br>
sinks. Noninterference captures this intuition by requiring that no information<br>
whatsoever flows from private sources to public sinks. However, in practice this<br>
definition is often too strict: Depending on the intuitive desired security<br>
policy, the controlled declassification of certain private information (WHAT) at<br>
certain points in the program (WHERE) might not result in an undesired<br>
information leak.</p>
<p>We present an Isabelle/HOL formalization of such a security property for<br>
controlled declassification, namely WHAT&amp;WHERE-security from<br>
"Scheduler-Independent Declassification" by Lux, Mantel, and Perner. The<br>
formalization includes compositionality proofs for and a soundness proof for a<br>
security type system that checks for programs in a simple while language with<br>
dynamic thread creation.</p>
<p>Our formalization of the security type system is abstract in the language for<br>
expressions and in the semantic side conditions for expressions. It can easily<br>
be instantiated with different syntactic approximations for these side<br>
conditions. The soundness proof of such an instantiation boils down to showing<br>
that these syntactic approximations imply the semantic side conditions.</p>
