<p>Session batch-builds still lack PIDE markup (and status) information. I<br>

<p>Yes, when PIDE markup becomes available in batch-mode builds.</p>

Hello isabelle-users, and implementors.</p>
<p>I have a query about what might be possible with timing data.</p>
<p>Isabelle proofs sometimes go into infinite loops, leading to session <br>
builds that run forever. The isabelle build process has a per-session <br>
timeout option, which can be specified in ROOT files. I don't know how <br>
common it is to use this. Our test apparatus also has a crude mechanism <br>
for killing a test after some length of time, and I guess that's pretty <br>
common.</p>
<p>A timeout result is our least desirable outcome. We learn very little. <br>
If our apparatus kills the build, we don't get a log file. When the <br>
timeout option fires, I haven't found any useful information in the log <br>
file.</p>
<p>My main question is, is there some way we could track slow commands <br>
during session builds?</p>
<p>In interactive mode, commands that are running for a while are <br>
highlighted in the "Running" colour in jEdit (usually deep purple). My <br>
understanding is that roughly the same PIDE infrastructure is in place <br>
during session builds. Would it be possible to log information about <br>
slow commands (e.g. those running more than one minute)? Could we set a <br>
flag to send such information to an extra log file?</p>
<p>Reporting (roughly) which line the infinite loop is in would be a <br>
substantial improvement. Even reporting which theory the loop was in <br>
would help.</p>
<p>Would this be useful to other users?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

Thanks Makarius.</p>
<p>Indeed, a hardwired timeout is an imprecise approach. We've used very <br>
generous<br>
timeouts rather than fiddling with per-machine expectations. The point <br>
is to ensure<br>
that test runs finish eventually, since otherwise we'd have to keep <br>
fiddling with the<br>
test apparatus by hand.</p>
<p>As you say, an external timeout is the same as an Isabelle timeout, for <br>
Isabelle builds.<br>
Our test runs test a mix of Isabelle builds and other things, so we have <br>
a similar<br>
mechanism in the test-control script.</p>
<p>I was confused a little about the batch builds. The overall framework <br>
(Isabelle/Scala<br>
and protocol) is the same during builds, but the kinds of protocol <br>
messages exchanged<br>
are different.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I've got around to implementing a version on the ML <br>
side. It's just a<br>
simple task that runs every few seconds (via Event_Timer.request) and <br>
blogs (to a file)<br>
a report about what's running and which tasks have been running for a <br>
while. It's not<br>
very accurate but the log can still be interesting when a session times <br>
out. I was going<br>
to test it a bit more at this end before asking if anyone else wanted a <br>
copy.</p>
<p>This is just a make-do solution. I'm sure you'd rather move toward a <br>
more canonical<br>
implementation with session builds running more of the document protocol <br>
and a Scala<br>
module producing similar output. I don't understand the Scala layer well <br>
enough to<br>
try that though.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The PIDE protocol is still not used at all in batch-builds. This would<br>
require some reworking in various respects, e.g. full parallel proof<br>
checking in PIDE.</p>
<p>Getting that all into proper shape has a high priority for me, but it<br>
means it could happen next week / month / year / decade.</p>
<p>The current intermediate approach has some rudiments of<br>
protocol_message, which are not PIDE messages. See<br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/annotate/Isabelle2017/src/Pure/Tools/build.ML#l75">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/annotate/Isabelle2017/src/Pure/Tools/build.ML#l75</a></p>
<p>There is actually some Markup.command_timing information that ends up in<br>
the build db file. Here is an example to access that in Isabelle/Scala<br>
(Isabelle2017):</p>
<p>$ isabelle scala<br>
  import isabelle._<br>
  val store = Sessions.store(system_mode = false)<br>
  val name = "HOL"<br>
  val database = store.find_database(name).get<br>
  val db = SQLite.open_database(database)<br>
  val command_timings = store.read_command_timings(db, name)</p>
<p>The purpose of that is to fine-tune parallel checking of proofs in batch<br>
mode. It does not handle the case of non-terminating commands, nor does<br>
it take GC time into account.</p>
