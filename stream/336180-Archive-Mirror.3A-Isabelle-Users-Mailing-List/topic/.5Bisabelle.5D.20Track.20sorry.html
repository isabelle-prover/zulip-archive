Hi,</p>
<p>is there a tool (or similar) to track which theorems in a development <br>
depend in some way upon "sorry"? I've to assess student developments and <br>
doing this manually is a pain. ;) I'd imagine an Isabelle/jEdit "plugin".</p>
<p>Best<br>

This information is stored in a theorem. I think when you "using" this<br>
theorem, it is shown with a trailing "[!]".</p>

For a quick and dirty check, I usually just use the hypersearch of jEdit, <br>
which is one of the big assets of that text editor.  The keywords "sorry" <br>
and "axiomatization" are the two main things to check.</p>
<p>Further note that the Prover IDE is not obliged to be 100% authentic, <br>
although it tries its best to be so -- there might be optical illusions <br>
even if the system works properly. At the end of the day only batch builds <br>
count, with quick_and_dirty = false.</p>
<p>The following discussion from last year about "Sandboxed evaluation of <br>
Isabelle theories?" might be also of interest: <br>

This will only tell the user whether all theorems are valid; when<br>
grading student exercises it is often valuable to know which theorems<br>
can be trusted despite having some (invalid) sorry'd theorem present.</p>

<p>Above I propose two conceptually different ways to check some Isabelle <br>
development;</p>
<p>(1) In the Prover IDE, using hypersearch to look at the concrete syntax.</p>
<p>(2) In batch mode, by using knowledge about the LCF kernel works.</p>
<p>When Lars says "This will only tell the user whether all theorems are <br>

hypersearch tool of jEdit.</p>

<p>I second this, I've always found that very useful. Unfortunately, the <br>
[!] marker seems to have been removed in one of the recent versions. I <br>
don't know exactly when or even whether it's just me, but I remember it <br>
being there two years ago, and it's gone now. Unfortunately, the NEWS <br>
file only mentions its introduction.</p>

<p>I read two times "Unfortunately" here, and two times wrong. See also <br>
Isabelle2013/NEWS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theorem status about oracles and unfinished/failed future proofs is<br>
no longer printed by default, since it is incompatible with<br>
incremental / parallel checking of the persistent document model.  ML<br>
function Thm.peek_status may be used to inspect a snapshot of the<br>
ongoing evaluation process.  Note that in batch mode --- notably<br>
isabelle build --- the system ensures that future proofs of all<br>
accessible theorems in the theory context are finished (as before).</li>
</ul>
<p>Printing of conceptually inaccesible kernel derivations has been removed <br>
gradually since parallel processing became routine in Isabelle2008. I <br>
don't think you really want to go back to the old sequential times, with <br>
full information about low-level inferences produced in a painfully slow <br>
way. (HOL4 and Coq do this until today, but the Coq guys slowly discover <br>
that it might be done differently.)</p>

Hypersearch doesn't help when the theorem is declared as simp (or<br>
similar). And building a transitive closure using hypersearch is cumbersome.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
So we are back to the initial question, ``which theorems in a development <br>
depend in some way upon "sorry"'' and if the Prover IDE could show that. <br>
Of course it could, but it still doesn't.  It is one of the many things I <br>
would have liked to see already some years ago.</p>
<p>What is conceptually missing here is a way to "wrap up" the content of the <br>
interactive document model, like "isabelle build" does in batch mode.</p>
<p>Moreover the resulting graph of formal entities, or failure to produce <br>
them, could be visualized, but the student project that was meant to <br>
replace the old graph browser by something that works with Scala and Swing <br>
did not produce anything apart from wasting substantial time.</p>
<p>I need to emphasize explicitly here that the "keen student" rarely works <br>
as wild-card: first one needs to find one, then one needs to turn the <br>
result into generally usable form, beyond mere experiments.</p>
