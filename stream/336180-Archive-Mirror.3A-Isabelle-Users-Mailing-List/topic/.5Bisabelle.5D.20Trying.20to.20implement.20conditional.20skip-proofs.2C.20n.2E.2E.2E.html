<p>From: Thomas Arthur Leck Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:tsewell@cse.unsw.EDU.AU">tsewell@cse.unsw.EDU.AU</a>&gt;<br>
Hello there.</p>
<p>I've been using Isabelle for some while, and have become a tad frustrated <br>
with the amount of time which is spent re-running proof scripts as I move <br>
from file to file. Many of these proofs have been unchanged in my<br>
repository for years now, and have presumably been re-executed thousands <br>
of times.</p>
<p>The idea is to use the proof-recording mechanism to get a list of <br>
dependencies when a theorem is proved, which goes in to some kind of <br>
cache. When a theorem is stated, we can check whether it hits anything in <br>
the cache, and if so, whether the assumptions exist in the current context <br>
and match term-for-term. If all of this is true, we can skip the proof, <br>
since it would probably have succeeded anyway. It's not perfect, and you'd <br>
certainly have to do regression tests regularly, but it could make a big <br>
difference to the cost of manipulating a large proof repository.</p>
<p>The checks seem fairly straightforward, but I'm stuck on hooking this <br>
thing into Isar. It's fairly clear that the hook for skipping the proof <br>
should be in begin_proof in toplevel.ML, where skip_proofs is checked <br>
already. The information available at this point (in a Proof.state) does <br>
not, however, tell us exactly what the final theorem will look like. <br>
Instead we have an intermediate theorem and a list of assumptions.</p>
<p>One option was to work entirely in terms of the intermediate theorem, <br>
giving us a good match for our skip hook. However, in a proof that ends<br>
"by auto", the final Proof.state, the one manipulated by end_proof, is the <br>
one that existed before auto was run, and doesn't have a complete list of <br>
dependencies.</p>
<p>The next step down the abstraction chain seems to be to try to work with a <br>
Context.proof, at which point the just-proved theorem seems to become<br>
anonymous, and I get totally lost.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a sensible idea for where to put the hook for trapping<br>
completed theorems? Additionally, if this is done after the theorem is<br>
converted from its intermediate to its final form, is there an easy way to <br>
check one against the other? (This may be a related question, since one <br>
thing we can certainly do when deciding whether to skip is to skip and <br>
complete the proof, and see what gets caught at our hooks).</p>
<p>I appreciate that this may not be possible, and will be interested in the <br>
discussion regardless.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
    Thomas.</p>
