<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I've set up a bunch of simp rules, and I'm getting lots of 1 step proofs <br>
with "by(simp)".</p>
<p>However, there's one common proof which I can't figure out how to get in <br>
1 step, which is set equality for the case where I have to prove "A is a <br>
subset of B and B is a subset of A", which I have to do because the auto <br>
provers can't prove "A = B" directly.</p>
<p>The problem is that my "A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A" is my <br>
main equality "A=B", so I'm blank on how I can automate the connection <br>
between the two.</p>
<p>I attach a PDF. On page 7, Notation 3.1.10, I create an abbreviation for <br>
"A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A". On page 8 is my Theorem <br>
3.1.12 which shows that "A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A" is <br>
equivalent to "A=B".</p>
<p>My theory is filling up with proofs to theorems in which I state a proof <br>
step with my "equal subsets" operator, prove it with "by(simp)", and <br>
then have to finish it off with the Theorem 3.1.12.</p>
<p>Starting on page 37, there's 6 out of 7 theorems where I do that. Then <br>
on page 39, there's the examples that show how I can get equality with <br>
my "equal subsets" operator, but not with the normal "=".</p>
<p>That's related to the main reason I care, which is that I'd like to show <br>
finite set equality using only one automatic proof method command.</p>
<p>If anyone can tell me how to do that, I'd appreciate it.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB<br>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I'll simplify my question.</p>
<p>I have a very common theorem and proof pattern which uses "=", a binary <br>
operator "seO", and a theorem "ssO":</p>
<p>theorem "A = B"<br>
proof- have<br>
   "A seO B"<br>
   by(simp)<br>
   thus<br>
   "A = B"<br>
   by(metis ssO_eq)<br>
qed</p>
<p>I'm learning proof techniques on an as-need basis, where Sledgehammer <br>
and metis have dramatically reduced the "need" in "as-need".</p>
<p>Is there some way I can automate that specific proof template?</p>
<p>Can I do that in ML? Is there an example somewhere that will show me how <br>
to do it?</p>
<p>I can't set up a simp rule for the formula "(A seO B) = (A = B)" because <br>
it's exactly "(A seO B)" that I have to prove to get "(A = B)".</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I guess the answer might be in the The Isabelle Cookbook.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.inf.kcl.ac.uk/staff/urbanc/Cookbook/">http://www.inf.kcl.ac.uk/staff/urbanc/Cookbook/</a></p>
<p>Maybe in chapter 6, Tactical Reasoning.</p>
<p>So far, I've enjoyed only needing a bare bones structured proof, or only <br>
a "by(metis...)" proof that Sledgehammer found for me.</p>
<p>But having to frequently have 7 lines for a proof, which is really only <br>
about 4 or 5 lines of proof, that's weighing heavy on me.</p>
<p>If someone wants to give me the ML to implement the 7 lines of proof <br>
below, that would be good, but then, maybe to automate it, tactics are <br>
needed. I wouldn't know anything about tactics.</p>

Can't you prove "(A seO B) ==&gt; (A = B)" and then use that theorem as a rule?</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Ramana,</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip. I proved something like this:</p>
<p>theorem name [simp]:<br>
"(A seO B) ==&gt; (A = B)"<br>
by(metis foo)</p>
<p>It then caused some non-terminating things to start happening.</p>
<p>However, doing all of that helped me realize that it has to be a two <br>
step proof. The flow has to be</p>
<p>(A = B) ====&gt; (A seO B) --&gt; (A = B),</p>
<p>where "====&gt;" means I have to convert (A=B) into the form (A seO B) <br>
before anything can be proved, and I can't get the simplifier to convert <br>
(A=B) to something like (A seO B), which I suppose is for good reason, <br>
since "=" is used everywhere. (In a manner of speaking, I manually <br>
convert (A=B) to (A seO B) as the first step in the proof.)</p>
<p>My simp rule expands "seO" into the formula</p>
<p>"(x IN A --&gt; x IN B) &amp; (x IN B --&gt; x IN A)".</p>
<p>The simp rules then expand formulas like "x IN {a,b}" into the formula <br>
"(x = a | x = b)".</p>
<p>With all the expansion, lexicographic ordering, and other simp rules, <br>
things get simplified and proved. All the work is done in the processing <br>
of the statement</p>
<p>"(A seO B)" apply(simp).</p>
<p>Unless someone tells me the way to do it, I'll someday check into how to <br>
program tactics, and see if that's the way to do it. Whatever the case, <br>
the simp or auto methods have to be used, as far I can tell. I don't see <br>
how the simplifier could be replaced.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>

You could a conditional rewrite rule "A &lt;= B; B &lt;= A ==&gt; A = B".</p>
<p>BTW: Having one of your central operators be an abbreviation (especially <br>
one which is likely to be modified by simp/auto) will probably do more <br>
harm than good, as automated tactics will often modify your goal in a <br>
way, where your Lemmas do not apply directly anymore.</p>
<p>BTW2: Having (minimal, working) theory files instead of PDFs makes it <br>
often easier to come up with good suggestions.</p>

Actually, this kind of thing is good use case for introduction rules. <br>
Given a rule X: "A se0 B ==&gt; A = B", you could perform the proof with</p>
<p>by (rule X) simp</p>
<p>or, for a structured proof:</p>
<p>proof (rule X)<br>
   ...<br>
qed</p>
<p>If declared with [intro?], rule (and hence proof) will automatically <br>
pickup this rule.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Lars,</p>
<p>Speaking in an informal manner, as one engaging in street banter on the <br>
streets of downtown San Diego, Dallas, or some other large metropolis, <br>
such as, say, even Munich, you be da man.</p>
<p>I'm back to simp or auto one-liners that should be one-liners, which is <br>
the case for these types of proofs with my "esO" (which I was calling <br>
seO). My operator esO "is" equality, so with the way that Isabelle has <br>
conditioned me, if I can prove "A esO B", the software should make it <br>
look effortless to get that extra step "A = B".</p>
<p>I get duplicate emails sometimes off of the mailing list, so I didn't <br>
read your second answer for a while. Consequently, I was studying simple <br>
test cases of what the Set.thy subset_eq operator is capable of doing <br>
when intersections are involved.</p>
<p>I attached three images for a total of 79Kbytes.</p>
<p>The image 130228__Lars bibliography.png is the bibliography entry to <br>
your answer. The section that uses Christian's bibliography entry is out <br>
for the moment.</p>
<p>With infinite time, I'd be happy to do my homework and work through all <br>
the tutorials on proof techniques, but given the choice between proving <br>
what interests me, with a small but powerful set of proof methods, and <br>
laboring through tutorials, I keep choosing to be less educated in Isar <br>
proof techniques.</p>
<p>The image 130228__esO_meta_eq_lecture.png shows how I incorporated your <br>
suggestion.</p>
<p>The image 130228__esO_meta_eq_for_sets.png shows how I was trying to <br>
understand the basic concepts that Set.subset_eq uses to prove equality <br>
of sets when one side of the equation is an intersection.</p>
<p>This thing with intersections is what led to all this. Equality of <br>
unions is easy to prove because you don't have to know anything about <br>
the sets. If an element is in one set, then it's in the union.</p>
<p>But with intersections, you need to prove that two elements aren't <br>
equal, which can't be claimed in general.</p>
<p>So the point doesn't get lost, what I'm saying in this last part is <br>
about the semi-magic of the HOL engine. It's not total magic, maybe 99% <br>
magic, because I know some of the 1% that's happening because of my rules.</p>
<p>But part of the magic is that in the examples in the 3rd image, my "=" <br>
at the bottom of the image is getting results from rules that are more <br>
general than the "=" for the set of type "nat set" at the top. From <br>
looking a little at the simp trace, I see that it's using the properties <br>
of how the natural numbers have been defined. For those constants I <br>
defined, I've made no special rules to get equality for those sets. I <br>
did cheat and use "sorry" to get two theorems that need to be used to <br>
get equality for the pattern that those constant sets use, but those are <br>
two theorems I would want to prove regardless of their use there.</p>
<p>As far as using "definition" for operators rather than "abbreviation", <br>
the reason I had done that originally is because the need for something <br>
like "esO_def" cluttered up the metis proofs. Discovering the use of <br>
"simp" made that a mute point.</p>
<p>I did convert my subset operators over to "definition", but as it turns <br>
out, I only do it to make it clear when they're being used in the simp <br>
trace.</p>
<p>After defining them, I immediately convert them to their formulas with a <br>
simp rule, because it's their formulas that allow the logic to make a <br>
lot of decisions. I experimented some with using them before their simp <br>
conversion rule, but I decided to try and keep it simple, and so far <br>
it's working that way.</p>
<p>What the future holds, I can only speculate about that.</p>
<p>As to why I put up the PDF instead of the THY, I could explain that, but <br>
it would make the email longer.</p>
<p>I could even tie this all into Stackexchange (which I do a little). <br>
Suppose I would have posted my original question on Stackexchange, and <br>
then posted an email to this mailing list to notify people of the <br>
question, where I provided a link to the Stackexchange question.</p>
<p>I got that idea specifically from some things said in this thread. But <br>
right now, I'm thinking it would have been a bad idea, and it's because <br>
I got the perfect answer to my question, which I didn't expect to get.</p>
<p>With just the right circumstances, if a person asks an involved, <br>
application specific question on this mailing list, they will get an <br>
answer, and it largely has to do with whether the experts have time to <br>
think about the question.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm thinking that if I would have split up things between <br>
this mailing list and Stackexchange, it would have been a distraction, <br>
and I wouldn't have gotten the perfect answer, and it would have taken <br>
me months to get the answer on my own.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe I'll try doing the duplicate Stackexchange <br>
thing in the future.</p>
<p>But now I'm again saying, "No".</p>
<p>I asked a question. Ramana took the time to offer a tip. Lars comes in <br>
and responds to what was my response to Ramana, not my response to Lars. <br>
So, if Ramana had gone to Stackexchange and made the comment, and I had <br>
replied to Ramana only on Stackexchange, which would have been the case, <br>
and Stackexchange wasn't in Lars's loop, or Lars didn't have the time to <br>
make Stackexchange a priority, but always does make this mailing a high <br>
priority, because it's official, and he's at TUM, what would have been <br>
the result?</p>
<p>We know. Pain. Suffering. The absence of automation. Multiple proof <br>
steps wasting precious ASCII characters, not to mention the overhead of <br>
Unicode graphical characters being converted from \&lt;in&gt;, <br>
\&lt;subset&gt;\&lt;^sub&gt;\&lt;iota&gt;, along with even more ASCII keywords, such as qed.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:Thomas.Sewell@nicta.com.au">Thomas.Sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
I think that the problem with providing "A &lt;= B; B &lt;= A ==&gt; A = B" as a <br>
conditional rewrite rule is that the simplifier will (probably) see this <br>
as a rule for rewriting A into B rather than a rule for rewriting "A = <br>
B" into True. This is too general, it will be applied anywhere there is <br>
an A with an appropriate type.</p>
<p>One solution is to resolve your rule with Eq_TrueI, for instance, "thm <br>
equalityI[THEN Eq_TrueI]". Your rule should then look like "A &lt;= B; B &lt;= <br>
A ==&gt; (A = B) == True", which strongly suggests to the simplifier that <br>
it should be used only for rewriting actual equalities.</p>
<p>For some reason the system seems to figure this out by itself when given <br>
the equalityI rule from HOL, which may invalidate this comment.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>

Thomas,</p>
<p>Thanks for the input.</p>
<p>Extraordinarily simple stuff can be a real show stopper for the novice. <br>
I tried "A &lt;= B; B &lt;= A ==&gt; A = B" after Lar's comment, and it gave me a <br>
syntax error, and after searching for documentation on how to use <br>
conditional rewrite rule syntax, particularly how to use the semicolon, <br>
I couldn't find any, so I gave up.</p>
<p>This time I tried a little harder, doing searches and stuff, looking for <br>
that semicolon, and finally I decided it must be an operator, so I <br>
finally tried \&lt;and&gt;, which got me to the next step.</p>
<p>As an aside, the syntax for two other operators that have never worked <br>
for me in jEdit  are "/\" and "\/", but they're listed in the symbols panel.</p>
<p>I could talk about Stackexchange more also, about whether this comment <br>
would have gotten made if the replies were split up.</p>
<p>Anyway, the conditional rewrite rule looked a little promising, because <br>
it might be onerous to have to type "(rule)" if I knew I could set <br>
things up without having to do that.</p>
<p>However, the performance of either of "A &lt;= B; B &lt;= A ==&gt; A = B" or "A <br>
&lt;= B; B &lt;= A ==&gt; (A = B) == True"  is very slow.</p>
<p>I have some examples of sets which are nested about 11 levels deep. It's <br>
obvious now that Ramana gave me the same formula, but with my own <br>
notation. I told him it was creating some non-termination, but that's <br>
not the case. It's just that it takes forever for simp to simplify these <br>
nested sets. Each level of nesting adds at least twice the time to <br>
simplify it.</p>
<p>At 7 levels it takes about 15 to 20 seconds, where without this <br>
conditional simp rule in, it takes no time, and those examples don't <br>
even need that rule.</p>
<p>Conditional rewriting will come in handy now that I've made the <br>
connection between "conditional" and the conditional "==&gt;". That wasn't <br>
an easy connection to make. Information overload or just a lack of the <br>
necessary amount of hand holding.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion,<br>
GB</p>
