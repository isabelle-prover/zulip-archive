CALL FOR PARTICIPATION</p>
<p>Applying Mechanised Reasoning in Economics – Making Reasoners Applicable<br>
for Domain Experts<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/events/informatik2013/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/events/informatik2013/</a></p>
<p>Tutorial at Informatik 2013 – Computer science adapted to humans,<br>
organization and the environment, 43rd annual meeting of the German<br>
Informatics Society (Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. (GI)<br>
<a href="http://informatik2013.de/">http://informatik2013.de/</a></p>
<p>17 September 2013, 14:00-17:30<br>
Koblenz, Germany</p>
<p>AUDIENCE</p>
<p>Our audience comprises computer scientists developing or using<br>
mechanised reasoning systems, or interested in learning how to use them.<br>
The message of this tutorial is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are interesting nails (problems) out there in economics,<br>
waiting for hammers (tools) from computer science to be applied to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those domain experts who have the interesting problems do not speak<br>
the same language as computer scientists do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it takes some effort to make computer science tools<br>
applicable in such domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>giving meaningful feedback on errors,</li>
<li>writing application-oriented documentation,</li>
<li>trying hard to support users who understand textbook mathematics<br>
but not proof calculi, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>MOTIVATION (ECONOMIST'S PERSPECTIVE)</p>
<p>We have a vision of increasing confidence in economics' models and<br>
mechanisms. Auction designs are under constant evolution as they seek to<br>
incorporate lessons learned and to recognise specific features of the<br>
markets in which they are run. Similarly, current models for financial<br>
risk measurement are too large and change too quickly to be checked by<br>
hand. These challenges affect not only the economics sector itself, but<br>
also the government as it regulates the economy, and thus the general<br>
public. Since the software used is mission critical it should be<br>
verified to a high level of reliability.</p>
<p>We believe that such problems can be addressed by representing the<br>
underlying knowledge in a formal, explicit way that is accessible to<br>
mechanised reasoning tools. These have already been applied to<br>
economics, albeit by computer scientists rather than the economists<br>
themselves.</p>
<p>Many economists have postgraduate training in mathematics; historically,<br>
it has been less common for them to have training in computer science.<br>
Therefore, despite a growing interface (consider, e.g., the ACM<br>
Transactions on Economics and Computation), they lack awareness of the<br>
existence of reasoning tools and their appropriateness for tasks in<br>
economics. Moreover such tools are still challenging to use. The<br>
objective of our ForMaRE project (formal mathematical reasoning in<br>
economics) is to raise awareness and to enable economists to work with<br>
the languages and tools of their choice.</p>
<p>RESEARCH CONTEXT (Computer Science Perspective)</p>
<p>How can we make formal methods familiar to economists? Concretely, we<br>
are developing a basic Auction Theory Toolbox of formalisations, on top<br>
of which auction designers can formalise and verify their own auction<br>
designs, and we are getting started with applying similar techniques to<br>
matching markets and financial risk management. This tutorial reports on<br>
our experience and insights from carrying out this research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From a computer science perspective, our “toolbox building” approach<br>
requires</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>identifying the right language to formalise the theory (i.e. being<br>
sufficiently expressive while still supporting efficient proofs), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying a a mechanised reasoning system whose input and output<br>
are comprehensible to economists, who usually do pen-and-paper proofs<br>
and are familiar with mathematical textbook notation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We have so far gained experience with the languages/systems Isabelle/HOL<br>
and its jEdit IDE, Theorema, CASL and its Hets IDE and the System on<br>
TPTP web service, Mizar, as well as Prover9 and Mace4.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Economists may find it appealing that the structure of an Isabelle or<br>
Mizar proof resembles the structure of a paper proof, that Theorema is<br>
an add-on to the familiar Mathematica CAS with its textbook-like<br>
notebook interface, or that Hets allows for uniformly feeding one<br>
formalisation into a wide range of highly efficient automated theorem<br>
provers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may deter them that little documentation for these tools is<br>
available, or that it requires strong background knowledge, and that the<br>
investigation of unsuccessful automated proof attempts requires a good<br>
understanding of the underlying calculus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>INTERACTIVE MATCHMAKING</p>
<p>The last part of the tutorial involves an interactive matchmaking<br>
session. We will try to match tutorial participants who are developers<br>
or experienced users of tools (if you are, please contact us in<br>
advance!) and economics problems to which consider these tools may be<br>
applicable. We will briefly present the respective problem and ask the<br>
respective participant for a brief voluntary presentation of his or her<br>
tool. From our connections in the economics community (cf. our research<br>
collaborators and our organisation of the AISB 2013 symposium on<br>
Enabling Domain Experts to use Formalised Reasoning) we have a portfolio<br>
of around a dozen potentially matching problems.</p>
