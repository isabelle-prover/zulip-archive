<p>You shouldn't.  On isabelle-users you always refer implicitly to the <br>
latest release without saying that explicitly.  Only if you use an older <br>
(official) release you should say that.</p>
<p>In contrast, if you are testing Isabelle repository versions, you should <br>
discuss your observations on the isabelle-dev mailing list (including the <br>
all-important Mercurial changeset id), not on isabelle-users.</p>

<p>Isabelle release cycles vary between 6-10 months, but the year has <br>
invariably 12 months.  So the next one is likely to be Isabelle2013-1 <br>
before the end of 2013, not Isabelle2014.</p>
<p>When working profesionally and productively with Isabelle you normally use <br>
the latest official release.  Only if you have a special situation, and <br>
some extra time to follow the ongoing development process quickly, you may <br>
consider testing repository versions instead (see above).</p>
<p>Note that repository snapshots between the releases become outdated more <br>
quickly than the stable stepping stones.  It is particularly bad to "get <br>
stuck" on some old snapshot while the official releases have moved on 1 or <br>
2 steps already.</p>

<p>From: Christoph LANGE &lt;<a href="mailto:math.semantic.web@gmail.com">math.semantic.web@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle community,</p>
<p>I am currently working with lists constructed from finite sets, and I'm<br>
missing the following two lemmas that would really help me to get my<br>
work done.  At the moment my Isabelle experience is not sufficient for<br>
proving them myself, plus I think it would make sense if they were part<br>
of the library (List.thy).</p>
<p>lemma sorted_list_of_set_not_empty [simp] :<br>
  assumes "finite S" and "S ≠ {}"<br>
  shows "sorted_list_of_set S ≠ []"<br>
sorry</p>
<p>lemma sorted_list_of_set_distinct [simp] :<br>
  shows "distinct (sorted_list_of_set S)"<br>
sorry</p>
<p>Would any of the developers feel up to proving them, or alternatively<br>
teaching me how to do it?</p>
<p>BTW, for my work I actually don't need these lists-from-sets to be<br>
_sorted_.  However sorted_list_of_set is the only result that</p>
<p>find_consts "'a set ⇒ 'a list"</p>
<p>gives me.  Efficient computation is not yet that crucial for my work,<br>
but would it be possible to provide a list-from-set constructor that<br>
does not guarantee sorting?  I mean something that simply rearranges the<br>
internal data structure of a finite set (which is not guaranteed to be<br>
sorted either) into a list.</p>
<p>Finally, lists-from-sets are probably not even what I need to get my<br>
actual work done.  I.e. if you think that there is no good reason for me<br>
using them, I'm willing to abandon them.  Originally I'm working with<br>
finite sets, but I defined a custom Max-like operation on them, which<br>
recursively folds the comparison of two elements over the whole<br>
set/list.  As I'm not yet capable of understanding the internals behind</p>
<p>definition (in linorder) Max :: "'a set ⇒ 'a" where<br>
  "Max = fold1 max"</p>
<p>in Big_Operators.thy (which seem to depend on certain idempotence laws<br>
that max satisfies), but wanted to prove some properties of my Max-like<br>
operation and got stuck in my initial attempt to use finite_ne_induct, I<br>
resorted to converting my finite sets to lists and using<br>
list_nonempty_induct – which did the job, except for the two missing<br>
lemmas mentioned above.</p>
<p>Cheers, and thanks in advance for your help,</p>
<p>Christoph</p>

<p>Sledeghammer is able to find a proof after unfolding <br>
sorted_list_of_set_def. A nicer proof however is to prove the following <br>
first:</p>
<hr>
<p>lemma sorted_list_of_set_remove':<br>

   shows<br>
     "sorted_list_of_set A = insort x (sorted_list_of_set (A - {x}))"<br>

   from assms have "insert x (A - {x}) = A" by blast<br>
   then have "sorted_list_of_set A = sorted_list_of_set (insert x (A - <br>

   finally show ?thesis .<br>
qed</p>
<hr>
<p>then your proof goes through with</p>
<p>using assms by (auto simp: sorted_list_of_set_remove')</p>
<p>BTW, a nicer lemma would be:</p>
<p>lemma sorted_list_of_set_eq_Nil_iff:<br>

<p>lemma sorted_list_of_set_distinct [simp] :<br>

</blockquote>
<p>This property does not hold in Isabelle 2013, as Finite_Set.fold is only <br>
defined for finite sets (i.e., we cannot prove anything about infinite <br>
sets). So you need to district your lemma to finite sets. Then the proof <br>
is easy:</p>
<p>lemma sorted_list_of_set_distinct [simp] :<br>
   assumes "finite S" shows "distinct (sorted_list_of_set S)"<br>
   using assms sorted_list_of_set by auto</p>
<p>(In the next version of Isabelle, Finite_Set.fold will probably return <br>
the initial argument for infinite sets).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, lists-from-sets are probably not even what I need to get my<br>
actual work done.  I.e. if you think that there is no good reason for me<br>

<p>As sets have no order, fold is only well-defined if the operation you <br>

Hi Lars, hi Brian,</p>
<p>thanks for your quick help; let me answer all remaining points at once.</p>

<p>Oh, I see.  Sorry, I should have said that I'm using the Isabelle2013<br>
release version.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That's indeed a good lesson for me as a, still, relative newbie.  So far<br>
I had been doing this "unfolding some_def sledgehammer" step with<br>
definitions of my own, whereas I had never thought of doing it with<br>
definitions from the library.</p>

<p>Thanks (to Brian, too)!</p>
<p>For now I copied these into my formalisation.  Is it right that as soon<br>
as I switch to Isabelle2014 or to the development version I will be able<br>
to remove this code?</p>

<p>Thanks, and thanks for pointing out that I had forgotten to assume<br>

<p>Indeed.  Still I have no idea whether it will be _easy_ to use<br>
finite_ne_induct in my case.  Folding is actually not applicable to my<br>
Max-like function, which is actually rather a variant of "arg max" in<br>
that it returns the index of the maximum component of a vector, where<br>
the index is an element of those finite "nat set"s that I'm using. –<br>
Anyway, just some thoughts.  Your solutions work fine for me, and allow<br>
me to focus on my actual problem (proving that a certain auction<br>
formalisation determines a unique winner – soon to become public at<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/code/auction-theory/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/code/auction-theory/</a>).</p>

<p>Here is what I tried unsuccessfully.  I posted in on stackoverflow, as<br>
it's a proper question.</p>

<p>if you are not desparate for executability, here is a two stage approach: first<br>
get all the indices where the function has its maximum (which you can get via<br>
Max), then select some element from it via SOME. although SOME can be a bit<br>
tricky to reason about, this is a fairly abstract approach. something like</p>
<p>let M = {x. v x = Max(v ` finite domain of v)}<br>
in SOME x. x : M &amp; some tie breaker</p>
<p>where the tie breaker could be something like ALL y : M. t x y</p>
