John Harrison has recently (in March 2018) proposed a return to set theory<br>
in a presentation with the title    "Let’s make set theory great again!"<br>

(mentioning the inflexibility of the type systems of HOL and Isabelle/HOL)<br>
which I would like to comment, and use this occasion to reply to Jan Burse<br>
concerning Q0/R0 vs. ZFC as a foundation of mathematics.</p>
<ol>
<li>Type Theory vs. Set Theory (Reply to Jan Burse)</li>
</ol>
<p>Both Russell's type theory and Zermelo's set theory were published in 1908<br>
to solve the problem with Russell's antinomy causing inconsistency.<br>
In order to decide which approach is appropriate, the philosophical reason<br>
for this antinomy and the formal system's adequateness for representing<br>
mathematics should be taken into account.</p>
<p>Philosophically, Russell correctly stated that self-reference is responsible<br>
(but didn't recognize that negation is the second component for an antinomy:<br>
the set of all sets that do NOT contain THEMSELVES).</p>
<p>Mathematically, Russell draw the correct conclusion and drafted a formal system<br>
(type theory) in which the language doesn't allow one to express such constructions.<br>
In other words, the syntactic means of the language are the key to the solution.<br>
This means that all of mathematics can be expressed, and only those<br>
constructions involving self-reference and negation are excluded.</p>
<p>Set theory (e.g., ZFC, the variant of Zermelo set theory in use today)<br>
takes a very different approach by giving the class status by default,<br>
and giving the set status only to those constructions often used.<br>
Compared with the type theoretic approach this means that the set theoretic<br>
solution is to simply forbid all reasoning first, and then to allow only certain<br>
constructions (a positive list).<br>
The result (ZFC) is a not systematic solution of the problem (Russell's antinomy),<br>
but a preliminary solution based on the explored fields of mathematics at that time.<br>
For example, ZFC is not sufficient to handle large cardinals (which require an<br>
additional axiom), and it should be easy to construe other examples not covered<br>
by ZFC by introducing other axioms.<br>
This means that the (from a logical point of view) arbitrary set of axioms in ZFC<br>
(containing both logical and non-logical axioms) can cover only parts of mathematics,<br>
but not (all of) mathematics in general, and, furthermore, this limitation cannot<br>
be circumvented by adding further axioms (resulting in another arbitrary set of axioms).</p>
<p>A systematic solution can consist only in shaping the syntactic means of the<br>
formal language (finding the grammar of mathematics) such that they correctly<br>
preserve dependencies and, hence, prohibit constructions involving both<br>
self-reference and negation.<br>
Jean van Heijenoort has described both approaches (type theory and set theory)<br>
properly: "The two responses are extremely different; the former is a far reaching<br>
theory of great significance for logic and even ontology, while the latter is an<br>
immediate answer to the pressing needs of the working mathematician.”<br>

<p>Note that Q0 and R0 have the five logical axioms only<br>

<a href="http://doi.org/10.4444/100.3">http://doi.org/10.4444/100.3</a> (pp. 353 ff.),<br>
and non-logical axioms such as the three axioms of group theory are not<br>
introduced as axioms, but are expressed in the form of a definition:<br>
<a href="http://doi.org/10.4444/100.3">http://doi.org/10.4444/100.3</a> (p. 362).<br>
The introduction of any further non-logical axioms (in the form of a definition)<br>
will not cause the inconsistency of the system, but only prove the emptiness<br>
of the set obtained by this definition (since no mathematical entity can<br>
satisfy contradictory properties).</p>

<li>Type Theory vs. Set Theory (Reply to John Harrison)</li>
</ol>
<p>John Harrison correctly states that the current type systems suffer either from<br>
inflexibilities (HOL, Isabelle/HOL) or from too complex rules (Coq) in a<br>
presentation from March with the title "Let’s make set theory great again!"<br>
available online at<br>
<a href="http://aitp-conference.org/2018/slides/JH.pdf">http://aitp-conference.org/2018/slides/JH.pdf</a></p>
<p>The same critique was already expressed by Freek Wiedijk, see<br>
section 3 of <a href="http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/fom.pdf">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/fom.pdf</a></p>
<p>In a private email from January, John considered both HOL as well as<br>
the axiomatic type classes in Isabelle as not solving the problem due to<br>
the "lack of quantification over types in HOL".</p>
<p>Up to this point I fully agree, but I clearly disagree with set theory<br>
being the solution, since it would be nothing else than a fallback<br>
to a workaround (ZFC) based on a rather arbitrary set of axioms<br>
involving non-logical axioms, too, and incapable of systematically<br>
representing all of mathematics; van Heijenoort: "immediate answer<br>
to the pressing needs of the working mathematician."</p>
<p>The inflexibilities mentioned above only show that the syntactic means<br>
of the language (of current type theory, i.e., HOL and Isabelle/HOL) are<br>
not developed enough to fully represent all of the dependencies.</p>
<p>But the problems mentioned by John can be easily solved with explicit<br>
quantification over types (i.e., binding type variables with lambda),<br>
as done in R0:</p>
<ol>
<li>John: "For example, if you prove something generic about groups over a type,<br>
you may not be able to instantiate it later to a group over a subset of a type." (p. 21)</li>
</ol>
<p>In R0, any non-empty set (hence, any non-empty subset) is<br>
automatically considered (and introduced as) a type (cf. p. 11 of<br>
<a href="http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf</a> ),<br>
and instantiating general properties of a group to a specific group is actually<br>
the main example for demonstrating the power of quantification over types<br>
in R0, cf. pp. 12 (explanation), 362 (definition of group). The uniqueness of<br>
the identity element (p. 421, GrpIdElUniq) is used in combination with fact<br>
that &lt;o, XOR&gt; is a group (p. 422, theorem "Grp o XOR") to obtain<br>
by substitution (without having to carry out the proof of uniqueness of the<br>
identity element in a group again) the uniqueness of the<br>
identity element of the specific group &lt;o, XOR&gt; (p. 423, XorGrpIdElUniq).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>John: "Thinking of F as a base type, we have jumped up a couple of levels<br>
in the type hierarcy just to adjoin one root.<br>
If we want to construct the algebraic closure of a field we have to do<br>
this transfinitely ..." (p. 24)</li>
</ol>
<p>This has already been discussed in July 2017 at<br>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/hol/mailman/message/35962259/">https://sourceforge.net/p/hol/mailman/message/35962259/</a><br>
A transfinite type theory Q was presented by Andrews in his 1965 PhD thesis<br>
(based on his Q0 first published in 1963).<br>
R0 avoids the stratification (the type hierarchy) of Q by its flexible handling of types,<br>
allowing top-down definitions (similar to ZFC) rather than just the classical bottom-up<br>
type hierarchy, since any non-empty set is a type in R0.</p>
<p>The key feature of R0 is internal type referencing, which preserves the<br>
dependencies when quantifying over types (or, more exactly: binding type<br>
variables with lambda). A quote on this is attached below.</p>
<p>Let me finally note that there is a minor flaw in John's presentation.<br>
Metamath is, like Isabelle, a logical framework, and capable of coding<br>
type theory, too. There is an implementation of Q0 in Metamath:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/tirix/q0.mm">https://github.com/tirix/q0.mm</a><br>
(For further links, see 1.1. in <a href="http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/fom.pdf">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/fom.pdf</a> )</p>
<p>Therefore, on pp. 6 and 7 there should be written<br>
    Simple type theory (HOL family, Isabelle/HOL, Metamath/Q0)<br>
instead of<br>
    Simple type theory (HOL family, Isabelle/HOL)</p>
<p>and on p. 7 there should be written<br>
    Metamath/ZFC<br>
    Isabelle/ZF (but much less popular than Isabelle/HOL)<br>
instead of<br>
    Metamath<br>
    Isabelle/ZF (but much less popular than Isabelle/HOL)</p>
