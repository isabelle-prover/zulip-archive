<p>From: Holden Lee &lt;<a href="mailto:hl422@cam.ac.uk">hl422@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
In Isabelle, (A) what can be done using locales that can't be done using<br>
typeclasses, and (B) what can be done using locales that would be<br>
inconvenient with typeclasses?</p>
<p>I've read about both of them, but am still trying to find a clear-cut<br>
answer, and hoping some discussion will clarify things. Here are some of my<br>
thoughts, which might or might not be correct, so comment and add your own<br>
thoughts.</p>
<p>I'm mostly interested in constructions from abstract algebra. Here are some<br>
examples to draw on: (a) ring homomorphism, (b) the product of 2 arbitrary<br>
rings, (c) the polynomial algebra R[X_1,...,X_n] over R, (d) the finite<br>
fields F_p, (e) the localization S^{-1}R (a ring constructed from R and a<br>
multiplicative subset S of R, or any subset, if you prefer), combinations<br>
and reinterpretations of these (ex. the vector space F_p[X_1,...,X_n] over<br>
F_p)</p>
<p>1. In general, locales are more powerful, but lack the automatic<br>
   type-checking that types give.</p>
<p>2. Anything involving types that depend on 2+ types cannot be expressed<br>
   using typeclasses (ex. (a)-(b), a product of 2 arbitrary rings cannot be<br>
   interpreted as a type of class ring, "arbitrary" meaning I haven't chosen a<br>
   specific instance). Anything depending on 1 type can be expressed using<br>
   typeclasses, if the representation has to be done using typeclasses every<br>
   step of the way. Are there more theoretical restrictions?</p>
<p>3. You can't use a parameter to construct a type (ex. finite field F_p).<br>
   (i) Using locales, this isn't a problem because you can certainly construct<br>
   a ring_scheme, etc. from a parameter, using an ordinary function. (ii)<br>
   Using typeclasses, you would have to "bake in" a parameter, for instance<br>
   have a function card_Fp::'a=&gt;nat discarding the input of type 'a and just<br>
   giving the cardinality of the field (actually here you can sidestep this<br>
   and just return the CARD of 'a, but you can't do this in general, like<br>
   recovering S in (e)).</p>
<p>4. However, there is no automated way to construct instances of<br>
   typeclasses (creating classes is allowed only at top-level, so there is no<br>
   dependence on parameters) or talk about their existence. Using a typeclass<br>
   representing finite fields, you can't say "for every prime p, there exists<br>
   a field F_p with p elements," you can only say "given a finite field with p<br>
   elements..." This is mathematically a bit odd because you hypothesize<br>
   everything you need about the type you want (ex. finite fields) as<br>
   assumptions in the class (including everything necessary to recover the<br>
   original input data), whereas in the locale case you can construct it<br>
   first, and then prove that it satisfies the assumptions you want.</p>
<p>5. A result proven with locales can always be converted to the<br>
   equivalent result with typeclasses by interpretation. However, a result<br>
   proved with typeclasses cannot be converted to locales, because<br>
   instantiation of a typeclass is not allowed inside a proof.</p>

Dear Holden,</p>
<p>In your situation of abstract algebra, locales are better than type classes, as you want <br>
to talk about carriers, sub-structures, and existence of structures. However, some of your <br>
comments need some refinement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2. Anything involving types that depend on 2+ types cannot be expressed<br>
    using typeclasses (ex. (a)-(b), a product of 2 arbitrary rings cannot be<br>
    interpreted as a type of class ring, "arbitrary" meaning I haven't chosen a<br>
    specific instance).<br>
This is not correct. You can define a type ('a, 'b) prod_ring (e.g., via typedef) and do <br>
an instance declaration for ring:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>instantiation prod_ring (ring, ring) ring begin<br>
(* definition of ring operations on product *)<br>
instance (* proof *)<br>
end</p>
<p>This declaration is valid for any two types with the ring structure without saying which <br>
ring they are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4. However, there is no automated way to construct instances of<br>
    typeclasses (creating classes is allowed only at top-level, so there is no<br>
    dependence on parameters) or talk about their existence. Using a typeclass<br>
    representing finite fields, you can't say "for every prime p, there exists<br>
    a field F_p with p elements," you can only say "given a finite field with p<br>
    elements..."<br>
You can phrase a statement like "for every prime p, there exists a field F_p with p <br>
elements" on the type level as follows. Define prime :: "nat =&gt; nat" as the distinct <br>
enumeration of all the primes, e.g., prime n is the n-th prime. Then, define a type 'a F_p <br>
as a type that contains prime CARD('a) elements. Then, you can do</p>
</blockquote>
<p>instantiation F_p (finite) field begin</p>
<p>Since Isabelle has types with exactly n elements for any natural number n &gt; 0, you get <br>
what you want. But I admit that this is a bit cumbersome.</p>
<p>For completeness, there are a few cases where type classes are superior to locales.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Code generation within locales with assumptions essentially does not work. You can only <br>
generate code for interpretations for which you have to manually redefine the constants <br>
introduced in the locale. With type classes, the code generator takes care of overloaded <br>
operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overloading of polymorphic operations. If an overloaded operation (like addition in a <br>
ring) occurs with multiple different instances, the locale approach requires you to use a <br>
different constant for each instance. In that case, you normally have to introduce a <br>
locale that combines multiple instances, too. Here's an example with type classes:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>lemma fixes f :: "'a :: ring =&gt; 'b :: ring =&gt; 'c :: ring"<br>
   assumes "!!a b c d. f (a + b) (c + d) = f a c + f b d"<br>
   shows "..."</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I don't know all the details about how to overload notation, but it <br>
appears that overloading notation through type classes is generally <br>
superior to doing it other ways, and notation can be of huge importance.</p>
<p>If you use type classes, you obtain other magic by default, in <br>
particular with the code generator, which at a minimum comes into play <br>
with the "value" command. It's very useful to always be able to do some <br>
experimental computations with "value", and very annoying when "value" <br>
won't work for my functions, even though my logic is good.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>
