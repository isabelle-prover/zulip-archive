<p>From: Christine Rizkallah &lt;<a href="mailto:c.rizkallah@unsw.edu.au">c.rizkallah@unsw.edu.au</a>&gt;<br>
If only there were a place where I could prove theorems, change the world, and have<br>
fun while doing it...</p>
<p>Sounds too good to exist?</p>
<p>In the Trustworthy Systems team at UNSW and Data61 that's what we do for a living. We<br>
are the creators of seL4, the world's first fully formally verified operating system<br>
kernel with extreme performance and strong security &amp; correctness proofs. Our highly<br>
international team is located on the UNSW campus, close to the beautiful beaches of<br>
sunny Sydney, Australia, one of the world's most liveable cities.</p>
<p>We are offering scholarships to multiple motivated PhD students who want to join us<br>
in Sydney, move things forward, and have a global impact.</p>
<p>Cogent is a language we designed that co-generates code and proofs in order to ease<br>
the verification of systems components around seL4. Potential PhD topics include<br>
designing and implementing new domain-specific programming languages extending<br>
Cogent, writing formal specifications and proofs in Isabelle/HOL, developing formally<br>
verified infrastructure for building secure systems on top of seL4, contributing to<br>
improved proof automation and reasoning techniques, and applying formal proof to<br>
real-world systems and tools.</p>
<p>To apply you should have (or be about to obtain) a bachelor degree (minimum 4 years) or<br>
a bachelor and  masters degree in  Computer Science, Mathematics, or similar.</p>
<p>You should also possess a significant subset of the following skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>functional programming in a language like Haskell, ML, or OCaml</li>
<li>first-order or higher-order formal logic</li>
<li>basic experience in C</li>
<li>ability and desire to quickly learn new techniques</li>
<li>ability and desire to work in a larger team</li>
</ul>
<p>If you additionally have experience</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in software verification with an interactive theorem prover such as<br>
  Isabelle/HOL, HOL4, Coq, or Agda, and/or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with programming languages and verified or certifying compilers, and or</p>
</li>
<li>in verified applications technology such as CakeML</li>
</ul>
<p>you should definitely apply!</p>
<p>You will work with a unique world-leading combination of OS and formal methods<br>
experts, students at undergraduate and PhD level, engineers, and researchers from<br>
5 continents, speaking over 15 languages.</p>
<p>Trustworthy Systems is a fun, creative, and welcoming workplace with flexible<br>
hours &amp; work arrangements.</p>
<p>We value diversity in all forms and welcome applications from people of all ages,<br>
including people with disabilities, and those who identify as LGBTIQ. See<br>
<a href="https://ts.data61.csiro.au/diversity/">https://ts.data61.csiro.au/diversity/</a> for more information.</p>
<p>For applying, email us on &lt;c.rizkallah@unsw.edu.au&lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:c.rizkallah@unsw.edu.au">c.rizkallah@unsw.edu.au</a>&gt;&gt; a copy of your CV,<br>
cover letter, transcripts, and contact information for two referees.</p>
<p>This round of applications closes on the 19th of April 2019.</p>
