<p>From: <a href="mailto:mandrykin@ispras.ru">mandrykin@ispras.ru</a><br>
Hello!</p>
<p>A bit of context: we are currently experimenting with an approach to <br>
more reliable SMT proof replay in Isabelle/HOL with the aim to later <br>
apply it to low-level code verification, where there are typically many <br>
similar and fairly uninteresting goals that can be easily discharged by <br>
SMT. The approach is based on deterministic quantifier instantiation in <br>
Isabelle/HOL itself, so that the solver is provided with a <br>
quantifier-free problem, which is always decideble, making the proof <br>
replay very stable and even enabling partial model resonstruction of <br>
counterexamples (a preliminary description, if interesting: <br>
<a href="https://forge.ispras.ru/attachments/download/7602/TSMT_Tutorial.pdf">https://forge.ispras.ru/attachments/download/7602/TSMT_Tutorial.pdf</a>, but <br>
for now the reconstruction of deterministic one-liners from normal SMT <br>
proofs is not yet properly implemented (requires manual efforts)). So, <br>
naturally, we explored the possibility to replay the proofs within <br>
Isabelle/HOL itself using its internal solvers such as Metis and Argo <br>
(for the fragment without linear integer arithmetic). While we had some <br>
success with Metis+our instantiation (although it's not consistently <br>
faster than SMT proof replay), we encountered unexpected failures in <br>
Argo, particularly in its congruence closure propagation. I attach a <br>
theory with two goals, where Argo fails with an unexpected exception. <br>
The second goal is in fact valid and can be discharged with Metis. A <br>
more general question is where is it appropriate to reports such <br>
problems and whether Argo is maintained in the upstream or it would be <br>
reasonable to try investigating this ourselves and possibly suggest a <br>
patch</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
