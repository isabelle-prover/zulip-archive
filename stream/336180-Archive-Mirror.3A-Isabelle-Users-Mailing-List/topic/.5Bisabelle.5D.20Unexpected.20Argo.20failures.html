<p>From: Mikhail Mandrykin &lt;<a href="mailto:mandrykin@ispras.ru">mandrykin@ispras.ru</a>&gt;<br>
Hello!</p>
<p>A bit of context: We are currently experimenting with an approach to <br>
more reliable SMT proof replay in Isabelle/HOL with the aim to later <br>
apply it to low-level code verification, where there are typically many <br>
similar and fairly uninteresting goals that can be easily discharged by <br>
SMT. The approach is based on deterministic quantifier instantiation in <br>
Isabelle/HOL itself, so that the solver is provided with a <br>
quantifier-free problem, which is always decidable, making the proof <br>
replay very stable and even enabling partial model resonstruction of <br>
counterexamples (a preliminary description, if interesting:<br>
<a href="https://forge.ispras.ru/attachments/download/7602/TSMT_Tutorial.pdf">https://forge.ispras.ru/attachments/download/7602/TSMT_Tutorial.pdf</a><br>
but for now the reconstruction of deterministic one-liners from normal <br>
SMT proofs is not yet properly implemented (requires manual efforts)). <br>
So, naturally, we explored the possibility to replay the proofs within <br>
Isabelle/HOL itself using its internal solvers such as Metis and Argo <br>
(for the fragment without linear integer arithmetic). While we had some <br>
success with Metis+our instantiation (although it's not consistently <br>
faster than SMT proof replay), we encountered unexpected failures in <br>
Argo, particularly in its congruence closure propagation. I prepared a <br>
sample theory<br>
<a href="https://gist.github.com/schrodibear/fbe8c2224291e45c9e51c3b812746a46">https://gist.github.com/schrodibear/fbe8c2224291e45c9e51c3b812746a46</a><br>
(for some reason, the list rejected this inlined in the message) with <br>
two goals, where Argo fails with an unexpected exception. The second <br>
goal is in fact valid and can be discharged with Metis. A more general <br>
question is where is it appropriate to reports such problems and whether <br>
Argo is maintained in the upstream or it would be reasonable to try <br>
investigating this ourselves and possibly suggest a patch. The Isabelle <br>
version is Isabelle2020, current development version seems to not have <br>
any changes in Argo since then</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>This sounds very interesting. Most of the issues we have appear to be related to Z3's incomplete quantifier instantiation. CVC4 finds a proof using different (probably incomplete) heuristics and Z3 just seems not to find the same quantifiers. I was always afraid an approach based on instantiation would be too verbose (in the output), but now I've changed my mind: Most lemmas are probably used only with one instantiation anyway.

<p>I'd expect Metis to, in principle, always terminate on such ground goals. I say "in principle" because it had some completeness bugs, but we're working right now on updating Metis in Isabelle to reflect the latest version.</p>

<p>Argo's developer and maintainer is Sascha Böhme (in CC:). He's in industry now and I don't know how responsive he will be. But do check with him first, and failing that, I would propose you investigate it yourself and send me a patch. (When Sascha left, I inherited some of his code, including "smt", but "argo" is a tool he developed afterwards as a hobby and I don't know it at all.)</p>

<p>A general suggestion for sledgehammer: whenever I try to understand a metis <br>
proof found by s/h, I wish s/h would instantiate the lemmas (a little bit) <br>
explicitly because it makes it so much easier to figure out the proof as a <br>
human. Maybe it could be an option and would work only in a proper context where <br>
the variable names have been fixed.</p>
<p>Just one of these things it would be nice to have if the s/h developers had <br>
unbounded time ;-)</p>

<p>Another, arguably more important problem here, is that since we want our <br>
method to be deterministic, we have to perform full instantiation <br>
according to the algorithm, but this is possible only if the <br>
instantiation terminates. However, in general it does not, so instead of <br>
applying E-matching once until fixpoint, we separately provide syntax to <br>
apply it either until fixpoint or just once. Applying matching once for <br>
every lemma is the default. It makes instantiation fully deterministic, <br>
but makes the proof line discovery harder since we need not simply a set <br>
of lemmas, but a list with proper ordering, because there are <br>
dependencies between the instances. In particular, the list may contain <br>
repeated application of the same lemma as for DiffT in the example <br>
above. So what we are now planning to implement is a heuristical <br>
ordering (possibly with duplication) of facts extracted by sledgehammer <br>
to maximize the set of resulting instances. If we get the proof replayed <br>
within our method once, we can extract the instantiations and further <br>
optimize the proof by removing some redundant instances (this <br>
optimization is already implemented).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd expect Metis to, in principle, always terminate on such ground<br>
goals.<br>
We have not encountered cases, where Metis does not terminate for sure <br>
(a small formula, but, say &gt;90s of solving), but even for ground <br>
formulas the time for proof replay grows significantly faster than with <br>
SMT (Z3 with proof reconstruction), e.g. for a formula with 500 ground <br>
assumptions (many redundant instances arising without explicit <br>
instantiation) Metis takes &gt;90s, while SMT takes 42ms for Z3 + 98ms for <br>
proof replay. So we hoped that maybe Argo as an SMT solver can be faster <br>
on such formulas.</p>
</blockquote>

Hi Tobias,</p>
<p>I know. :) You made the suggestion years ago, and back then I didn't prioritize it and failed to understand its potential (documentation, speed up reconstruction, and possibly make the difference between semidecidability and decidability). In retrospect, it's obvious, and just three days ago, I added the following item (#28!) to the Sledgehammer TODO list:</p>
<p>Génération de preuves Isar simples pour arithmétique et instantiation de quantifieurs</p>
<p>Aujourd'hui, il y a plusieurs cas où la génération de preuve Isar prend trop de temps<br>
    ou est trop compliquée alors qu'une preuve du genre un have pour chaque lemme<br>
    théorie (arithmetique) et un show à la fin qui appelle typiquement metis.</p>
<p>Similairement, CVC4 et peut-être d'autres solveurs SMT peuvent générer les<br>
    instances ground des axiomes utilisées. Ça pourrait être utilisé avec note, p.ex.,<br>
    note f1 = some_lemma[of a b c], et ensuite un show à la fin. Ou bien directement un<br>
    seul gros appel laid à metis etc.</p>
<p>Thankfully it's a relatively easy change, not a full PhD, so it might get done first. Also because I have a bad conscience of not having done it back in 2012-2014.</p>
<p>Jasmin</p>
