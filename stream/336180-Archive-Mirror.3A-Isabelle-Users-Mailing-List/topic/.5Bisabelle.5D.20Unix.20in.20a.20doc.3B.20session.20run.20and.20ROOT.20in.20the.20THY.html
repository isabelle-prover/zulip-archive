<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
This is either shameless advertisement, or useful disclosure to raise <br>
some awareness.</p>
<p>I'm an outsider, and prefer no feedback, which is either being rude, or <br>
stating a necessary formality.</p>
<p>I've long been scrolling to the end of theories to make sure they check <br>
error free, but lately, several times, I see no errors, turn my computer <br>
off, and then the next day errors show up when I start things up. That's <br>
a scary thought; proving what you didn't prove.</p>
<p>There are some related user-list emails about this, on doing an official <br>
run of a sessions to catch that sort of thing. I got the verbose flag <br>
from this one by L.Hupel:</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-October/msg00106.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-October/msg00106.html</a></p>
<p>It also talks about a part of the problem I've experienced. A metis <br>
proof is good, and applied with a 'by' command, but then I make changes, <br>
and then some metis proof doesn't kick out. It just churns away forever, <br>
but I don't know about it. The 'by' statement still results in the <br>
theorem being used after that.</p>
<p>For some reason either errors aren't showing up in the sidebar, or <br>
"purple proof action" isn't showing up there. It could be because I <br>
changed "Editor Reparse Limit" from 10000 to 100000. Regardless, I need <br>
that so that errors clear on big commented out sections in the THY.</p>
<p>I've gone official now, by finally starting to run the sessions with <br>
'isabelle build', which is nothing extraordinary. What's special is that <br>
I both edit the 'ROOT' file, and run 'isabelle build -v -D .', in the THY.</p>
<p>That can be done with my custom 'I.bash' and 'I.prog' commands, which <br>
are not to be talked about here, only admired.</p>
<p>The first attached screen shot shows my experiments with <br>
'quick_and_dirty' mode, running the session with the option friendly <br>
'I.bash', which runs a script without writing it to a file. There are <br>
others, or were, like I.perl, I.pypy, and I.polyml. I still need to set <br>
up I.nodejs.</p>
<p>When I tried again, things went bad with running 'isabelle' in the PIDE. <br>
Things were spawning other things too much.</p>
<p>The 2nd screenshot shows my switch to the very useful 'I.prog', where <br>
I'm just using it to write a file, and run bash. It can be used with any <br>
compiled language or scripting language, for which bash files and makes <br>
files have been set up, or with any build tool, like Ruby rake.</p>
<p>Again, not something to be talked about, only speculatively admired. Is <br>
it wannabe-ware? Or is the real thing? Options. It has 'em. Help? Use <br>
the 'h' switch, in your mind.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
