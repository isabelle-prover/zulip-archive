Dear Isabelle users,</p>
<p>I'm happy to announce release 1.0.2 of I3P,<br>
the Interactive Interface for the Isabelle Prover.</p>
<p>The new version is available from</p>
<p><a href="http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/i3p/">http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/i3p/</a></p>
<p>It supports both the Isabelle2009-2 release<br>
and Windows/Cygwin installations.</p>
<p>Those who are already using I3P can just employ<br>
the Tools/Plugins dialog to download the updated modules.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank all users who have given me<br>
feedback on the first version. I hope that the<br>
changes made based on the suggestions about usability<br>
are as expected.</p>
<p>Enjoy,</p>
<p>Holger</p>

<p>From: Joachim Breitner &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@joachim-breitner.de">mail@joachim-breitner.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Holger,</p>
<p>three quick remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Options, Fonts &amp; Colors, Highlighting, I had to disable the<br>
„Highlight Caret Row“ background color, otherwise I would not see how<br>
far the code in the current row has been evaluated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the IsabelleText TrueType font that comes with Isabelle-2009-2,<br>
I can not display a few special characters, especially \&lt;guillemotleft&gt;,<br>
\&lt;guillemotright&gt; and \&lt;one&gt;. These are shown as a black square. Is that<br>
a problem with i3p, the font, or something else?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calligraphic math (e.g. \&lt;F&gt;) is shown as "\&lt;F&gt;". A unicode codepoint<br>
is available for that: U+2131 SCRIPT CAPITAL F. Could this be improved?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Joachim<br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The font should be OK.  You can test it as follows:</p>
<p>Isabelle2009-2/bin/isabelle jedit Isabelle2009-2/etc/symbols</p>
<p>Assuming that this file has been loaded with the encoding <br>
"UTF-8-Isabelle", which is the default configuration here, you will see <br>
the decoded version of the standard symbol encoding table of the Isabelle <br>
system.  Users can add further symbols in $ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/symbols</p>
<p>There is a fairly straight-forward Isabelle/Scala interface to use this <br>
information in JVM-based applications, but I3P still ignores that, <br>
shipping its own (faulty) tables instead.</p>

Hi Joachim,</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out; these issues are fixed.</p>
<p>Also, I have taken the opportunity to add to the theory editor<br>
an auto-completion box which pops up when you start typing a symbol<br>
name with \&lt;... and can also be triggered as usual by Ctrl-space.</p>
<p>Those who have already installed I3P, just use "check for updates".</p>
<p>Thanks to Makarius for pointing out that there is an official stable<br>
mapping from symbol encodings to Unicode characters.</p>

<p>From: Holger Gast &lt;<a href="mailto:gast@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de">gast@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Makarius,</p>
<p>For me as a possible user, the current form in which this<br>
functionality is available is not very attractive. I hope that the<br>
following feedback on how a user might approach the library helps<br>
in improving the experience for others.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is very hard to locate the functionality that is there.<br>
  For instance, after listening two of your talks which presented<br>
  the Scala layer as a whole, I did not expect that there was some<br>
  re-usable functionality just for encoding/decoding symbols.<br>
  It always a appeared as a "whole", which could be used entirely<br>
  or not at all.</p>
<p>After your remark, I therefore looked through the sources<br>
(since there is not proper API documentation) and found the<br>
object Symbol in General/symbol.scala. The Interpretation class<br>
inside looked just as if I could use it, and I was quite pleased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It turns out, however, that the constructor of Interpretation<br>
  already expects some pre-processed form of a table with<br>
  xsymbol encodings. How could I ever provide this?</p>
<p>After some find-grep in the Emacs, the only call to the<br>
constructor is in Isabelle_System.<br>
It retrieves the file from etc/symbols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now the facade class Isabelle_System is certainly a nice idea,<br>
  since it lists the basic entry points into the system.<br>
  However, to use it, one has to have an Isabelle installation<br>
  available.</p>
<p>And this is what makes the library useless for me:<br>
I simply cannot display the raw xsymbol notation until the user<br>
has selected the Isabelle installation. User's won't accept it.</p>
<p>I suspect that the startup functions for the jedit implementation<br>
somehow get hold of "the startup installation", and then use that.<br>
If the library is to be re-used in different contexts, as<br>
you imply by your remark, this may not be so easy. Re-usability<br>
just is not for free ;(</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be that my procedure was not the expert one, but this is<br>
not the point; what I would like to convey is some feedback on how<br>
users might approach the library.</p>
<p>Also, from a prospective library user's point of view, two<br>
rather minimal improvements would be most helpful<br>
(I formulate them as suggestions, for brevity):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make re-usable functionality accessible with minimal assumptions.</p>
<p>For instance, the font support from Isabelle_System is not really<br>
tied to a particular installation. It could as well be offered as<br>
a separate JAR, which would bundle the Isabelle Text font, the<br>
symbols table, and the Symbol class.</p>
<p>I suspect that similar sub-functionality can be found and extracted<br>
in other places as well. The Isabelle_System might, of course,<br>
still offer the font support by instantiating the package.<br>
(As is, incidentally, the idea of the facade pattern.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a minimal overview documentation of all entry points and packages.</p>
<p>The strategy of placing Scala and ML files side by side in the sources<br>
is very helpful for keeping them consistent, but for the user it means<br>
that it is very hard to find specific things they might be looking for.</p>
<p>An example of a good solution is the Netbeans list of modules. Each module<br>
has a two-line description, such that the user can quickly identify<br>
the relevant ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make very clear in the documentation of classes which methods<br>
  you consider for public use and which are "public" only for<br>
  technical reasons.</p>
<p>For the public ones, a one or two sentence summary of their<br>
functionality would be most helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide simple test cases that demonstrate the usage of the re-usable<br>
  functionality.</p>
<p>If users have to read sources to understand what a particular method<br>
does, this means they have to spend a lot of time on things that they<br>
would consider as "done" and "just usable". For you, as the developer,<br>
on the other hand, it is simple to write a few lines of example code<br>
in the form of automatic tests that demonstrate particular use scenarios<br>
that you have foreseen and also plan to support. The user can then proceed<br>
by example, which simplifies development a lot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again: the remarks are to reflect a user's perspective.<br>
I hope that they will help to make the emerging Scala layer<br>
more attractive from the technical side, since certainly the<br>
idea of _having_ a well-defined API for interacting with the<br>
Isabelle system already is very attractive.</p>
<p>Holger</p>

<p>Isabelle_System is really the very foundation of anything built on top of <br>
the Isabelle environment.  Without that you can hardly do anything useful.</p>
<p>Historically, Isabelle_System used to be implicit in the process <br>
environment of Isabelle tools, later I made it an explicit object, only to <br>
figure out further on that only one instance will really work within a <br>
given JVM process.  The reason for that are certain "globalities" of the <br>
JVM itself, i.e. consider low-level character encodings or input methods <br>
(both are not yet implemented).  The registering of Swing fonts is another <br>
once-and-for-all thing, and it <em>is</em> implemented right now to spare users <br>
going through the pain of installing fonts manually on the system.</p>
<p>You cannot easily juggle various Isabelle system installations without <br>
disintegrating the Isabelle platform and reassembling it differently, <br>
loosing overall hull integrity in the process.</p>

<p>This merely indicates that the present I3P architecture does not fit to <br>
Isabelle as of 2009 or later.</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Make re-usable functionality accessible with minimal assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, the font support from Isabelle_System is not really<br>

</blockquote>
<p>It is, because you cannot even read files in a robust (and platform <br>
independent manner) without Isabelle_System being around.  These <br>
fundamental system integrity structures are very delicate, and I've spent <br>
a long time to make them work robustly, while minimizing assumptions <br>
routinely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As is, incidentally, the idea of the facade pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is a foundational concept like Isbelle_System called "facade" here? <br>
Very strange.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that Isabelle/Scala is our way to reach out <br>
to the JVM platform.  Just because some other languages happen to live on <br>
the same JVM runtime environment does not mean that we take over their <br>
worldview -- neither that of Java, nor that of Clojure etc.</p>
<p>Compare this to Isabelle/ML: it is based on the Poly/ML runtime system, <br>
which is itself implemented in C++ and runs native machine code generated <br>
from ML.  Nobody would start thinking in terms of C++ / assembly language <br>
in Isabelle/ML, of course.</p>
<p>Isabelle/Scala is about transferring established Isabelle/ML traditions as <br>
closely as possible, while honoring the intrisic virtues of the Scala/JVM <br>
platform -- e.g. using Scala actors, which do not have a counter part on <br>
the ML side.  You will have a hard time understanding Isabelle/Scala with <br>
a Java mindset.</p>

I understand from this that the Scala layer will not support my use case.<br>
I have therefore simply developed the standalone module that I suggested.<br>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/i3p/">http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/i3p/</a></p>
<p>It only makes use of standard Java library mechanisms and should<br>
therefore run anywhere. (Of course, I also tested it under<br>
Linux, Windows, and MacOS.) As I proposed, demo code and test cases<br>
showing the basic supported use scenarios are included in the files.</p>
<p>The development has a nice side-effect:<br>
Users of I3P do not have to install &amp; configure fonts anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you attend my recent tutorial on Isabelle System programming at<br>

gives you a practical overview of the main entry points.<br>
Thank you for mentioning this, because it illustrates very well what I<br>
wanted to point out about documentation from a user's perspective:<br>
that workshop was attended by around 25 people, most of whom were in fact<br>
not interested in user interfaces, but in the prover. Anybody who did<br>
not happen to be at the meeting would have to guess that the<br>
font-related functionality is there and find the information by googling<br>
"Scala Isabelle fonts" (The NEWS file comes up 4th, the tutorial is 7th.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My point is that the Scala library would be used much more widely, and<br>
that the substantial and in-depth work that it represents would be<br>
recognized more generally, if its use was simpler. In particular,<br>
to be effective, documentation needs to be placed where users are looking<br>
for it. The canonical place is, of course, the standard output of<br>
the scaladoc tool. (The raw .html files with the signatures are already there.)<br>
Writing the basic documentation for a class takes the developer<br>
about 10-15min (compare this to the development time for the code).<br>
Retrieving the same information from different slides, tutorials, papers and<br>
NEWS files takes each (!) user at least 20-30min, provided<br>
they suspect its existance. It is clear that providing the documentation<br>
beforehand makes the overall use of the library much more effective.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think we should discontinue this thread on the mailing list,<br>
since it does not seem to lead to further results.<br>
I am, of course, always available for offline technical discussions.</p>
