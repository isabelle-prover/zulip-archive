<p>Regarding the Isabelle/Scala API: Does anyone know how I might use <br>
session.update (or any other method call) to apply edits to a previous <br>
Document.Version, or alternately how to move the session to a different <br>
Document.Version so I can then apply updates from that point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Document.update operation works with explicit ids for the old and new <br>
version, but this functional update model is not continued in <br>
Session.update, which is presently the main way you access the PIDE <br>
document model.</p>
<p>The Session module (in Scala) essentially models an editor-like session, <br>
as later used for Isabelle/jEdit.  Such editors work in an old-school <br>
stateful way, which also causes problems in different areas, outside the <br>
scope of this thread.  Thus there is a certain bias in <br>
Session.global_state to move forward in a certain manner, never backwards.</p>
<p>Instead of navigating the history in a way you would expect from purely <br>
functional content, I would say it is easier to move forward and apply <br>
inverted edits.  In other words you remove what you've inserted before.<br>
The document model will clear out old stuff at some point; this can be <br>
also configured in the Session.prune parameters, if you setup your own <br>
Session instance in Scala.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The context is straightforward: I would like to apply a change, and then <br>
revert it (i.e. 'undo') if the prover fails after the change. I would <br>
like to do this without starting a new session, as that seems <br>
unnecessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't say much at this level of abstraction.  It feels a bit too <br>
synchronous to me, to await a certain result from the prover, and then <br>
produce further edits.</p>
<p>It might be easier to internalize this logic of trying something into the <br>
prover commands that you are running.</p>
<p>The PIDE document model usually works in a "streaming" fashion: you throw <br>
a lot of commands at the prover at the same time, without waiting for <br>
anything, and later visualize results incrementally as they arrive.</p>
