Hi all,</p>
<p>this is a elaboration raised by the thread<br>
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fa.isabelle/TmzVaYzDoGc">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fa.isabelle/TmzVaYzDoGc</a>.</p>
<p>In my understanding the deeper reason for this situation is that<br>
currently, if you develop a specification using lift_definition, you are<br>
actually forced to use lift_definition throughout, otherwise the<br>
transfer method becomes unusable.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that this is a consequence of the actual way of how<br>
transfer is working. On the other hand, I see two points why this is<br>
unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>a) One of the strengths of Isabelle is that the initial definition is<br>
not that important. Indeed, as you prefer, you can establish different<br>
specificational views (primitive, equational, inductive) on operations<br>
by providing appropriate theorems (and declare them to proof tools etc.<br>
accordingly). See the attached example for different but equivalent<br>
definitions of a distinctness predicate. This gives you the freedom to<br>
switch to the »representation« which suits best your proof application.<br>
Similarly, concerning a type, there can be operations which you want to<br>
derive from more primitive ones (and use that definition in proofs<br>
also), but also be able to lift over it. Currently, you are forced to<br>
define it using lift_definition, whether you consider this »natural« or not.</p>
<p>b) In some situations, particularly when lifting type class instances<br>
over types, you just have not the freedom of giving your own<br>
definitions. E.g. for operation like of_nat you have to prove the class<br>
assumption relative to of_nat without any possibility to use<br>
lift_definition at all. If you are very experienced you can derive and<br>
declare your own lifting rules (see e.g. src/HOL/Code_Numeral.thy), but<br>
this is really elementary.</p>
<p>To overcome this shortcomings, just one thought. What about a statement</p>
<p>lift_equation<br>
      t1 is t2</p>
<p>which is almost like lift_definition but does not introduce a new<br>
operation and operates on an existing expression t1 instead. It would<br>
give the necessary proof obligations to the user and then register the<br>
appropriate transfer rules.<br>
This would enable us to write things like</p>
<p>lift_equation<br>
      ‹of_nat :: nat =&gt; integer› is ‹of_nat :: nat =&gt; int›</p>
<p>and establish transfer relations a posteriori.</p>
<p>Opinions?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

Hi Florian,</p>
<p>This sounds like a good idea. I have already got used to writing my own transfer rules for <br>
the functions that I do not want to (or cannot) define with lift_definition. An example of <br>
this can be found in the Coinductive entry in the AFP (theory TLList, lemmas TNil_transfer <br>
to tllist_all2_transfer).</p>
<p>However, one should be clear about which proof obligation should be presented to the user. <br>
If function f is defined in terms of g, for which there is already a transfer rule, then <br>
the transfer rule for f can often be proved by unfolding f's definition and invoking <br>
transfer_prover. Yet, transfer prover is very picky about the format of the goal <br>
statement. In particular, it does not like the ones set by lift_definition.</p>
<p>Another great feature would be to get parametric transfer rules by specifying <br>
parametricity theorems for either side of the transfer rule. Lift_definition currently <br>
does some clever rewriting there that is not so easily done manually when proving custom <br>
transfer rules.</p>
<p>Andreas</p>
