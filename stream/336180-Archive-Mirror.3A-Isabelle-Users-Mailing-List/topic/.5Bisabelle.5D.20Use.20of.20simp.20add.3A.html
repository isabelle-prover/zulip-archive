<p>From: "W. Douglas Maurer" &lt;<a href="mailto:maurer@gwu.edu">maurer@gwu.edu</a>&gt;<br>
I would appreciate some kind of strategy to determine what to write <br>
after simp add: when proving a simple fact. This first came up for me <br>
when I was trying to prove "floor (9.5::real) = (9::int)" and <br>
"ceiling (9.5::real) = (10::int)". Here try0 was no help; it tried <br>
simp, auto, fast, fastforce, force, blast, metis, linarith, and <br>
presburger, and then reported no proof found. Quite by accident, I <br>
found out how to do these; you type simp add: floor_unique or simp <br>
add: ceiling_unique . I'd like to know how to find rules like <br>
floor_unique and ceiling_unique in other cases. The one I'm concerned <br>
about now is "(2::nat)*x ~= 3", which arose for me as an unproved <br>
subgoal. Yes, I know I can prove this one by presburger, because try0 <br>
told me so, but that seems like using an elephant to crush a flea; <br>
presburger took forever to find a proof. I've also tried <br>
find_theorems, but that said it found over 18,000 theorems and none <br>
of the first few looked promising. I'm sure there's a much simpler <br>
way of proving that "(2::nat)*x ~= 3", and I'm sure that many people <br>
on the mailing list know what it is, but what I'd really appreciate <br>
is some hints on how to find something like this. -Douglas</p>

<p>For a start, simp should prove this, but unfortunately it does not. We will have<br>
to add the right lemmas to automate this, thanks.</p>

<p>The search button (<code>Find' or </code>Query'). In this case it is not so clear what to<br>
search for. Certainly "floor", but that still gives you 75 lemmas, which you<br>
would have to go through and see if they might be helpful.</p>

<p>Not for me: presburger is instantaneous, as is arith (which tries linear<br>

<p>The 18,000 suggests you just typed find_theorems. Use the search facility<br>
(<code>Find' or </code>Query') with appropriate selection criteria.</p>

In this case, my approach would have been to use find_theorems to look<br>
for "floor _ = _". If the property could also be computed (there are no<br>
variables in this goal), you can also try code_simp/normalization/eval<br>
-- these methods use a different setup of rewrite rules aimed at<br>
generation of executable code instead of proving.</p>

It shouldn't take long -- on my machine, presburger is almost<br>
instantaneous on this goal (additional premises may slow it down, though).<br>

find_theorems is often the right approach. However, if you need to give<br>
it a query, otherwise it lists all theorems (which is not going to be<br>
useful). The simples queries consist of a number of term patterns (like<br>
"_ * _"); another very useful query is "intro" which lists all<br>
applicable introduction rules. The reference manual has a full list of<br>
options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way to discover lemmas is using sledgehammer and inspecting the<br>
proofs (especially if you give it the isar_proofs option). For me, it<br>
gives the proof</p>
<p>by (metis Suc_numeral even_mult_two_ex monoid_mult_class.mult.right_neutral<br>
odd_Suc_mult_two_ex semiring_norm(5))</p>
<p>The interesting lemmas here are even_mult_two_ex and<br>
odd_Suc_mult_two_ex. However, due to the existential, they are not<br>
well-suited for simp and auto.</p>
<p>The goal "2*x ~= 3" is a bit tricky for automated tools: The reasoning<br>
is that 2*x is even and 3 is odd. However, neither "even" nor "odd" is<br>
mentioned in the goal. A rule like "even x ==&gt; odd y ==&gt; x ~= y" could<br>
introduce these constants. However, looking at the theorems for "even"<br>
and "odd" [1], none of the existing theorems suggests itself.</p>
<p>We can easily prove it ourselves, though:</p>
<p>lemma even_odd_neq_nat: "⋀x y :: nat. even x ⟹ odd y ⟹ x ≠ y" by auto</p>
<p>Giving this lemma to simp easily solves the goal.</p>
<p>-- Lars</p>
<p>[1] There is some oddity in find_theorems. Searching for "odd" will not<br>
yield any lemmas, you will need to write "odd _". This is somehow<br>
related to odd being an abbreviation for "~ even" and possibly warrants<br>
some closer investigation from the developers.</p>

The real solution, it would appear to me, is that ax=b (for the free <br>
variable x, and constant natural numbers a and b) should simplify to <br>
b mod a = 0. Since a and b are constants, this should be easy to <br>
check. Similarly, ax ~= b should simplify to b mod a ~= 0. For "2*x <br>
~= 3", this would simplify to 3 mod 2 ~= 0, or 1 ~= 0. -Douglas</p>
