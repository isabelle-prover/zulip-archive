<p>From: "Eugene W. Stark" &lt;<a href="mailto:isabelle-users@starkeffect.com">isabelle-users@starkeffect.com</a>&gt;<br>
The quoted question triggered something that I have been meaning to ask:<br>
In people's experience, what is a useful number of cores to have in a machine<br>
to run Isabelle and what limits the amount of exploitable concurrency?</p>
<p>My main machine has been a 4-core i5-4670K @ 3.40GHz.  Though I don't have money<br>
just to throw around for new toys, I have been considering upgrading it to a machine<br>
with more cores.  I did some experiments using cloud servers on Digital Ocean, which can be<br>
reconfigured relatively quickly from a cheap 1vCPU/1GB RAM $5/month maintenance level<br>
(just to maintain the configuration so I don't have to reinstall each time I want to use it)<br>
up to a 32vCPU/192GB RAM configuration at $960/mo (or $1.429/hr).  The idea is to spend a<br>
couple of minutes reconfiguring up to the expensive configuration at the start of a session,<br>
use the machine for awhile, then reconfigure back down to the maintenance level.</p>
<p>The vCPUS identify as the following:</p>
<p>vendor_id   : GenuineIntel<br>
cpu family  : 6<br>
model       : 85<br>
model name  : Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6140 CPU @ 2.30GHz<br>
stepping    : 4<br>
microcode   : 0x1<br>
cpu MHz     : 2294.608<br>
cache size  : 25344 KB<br>
bogomips    : 4589.21<br>
address sizes   : 40 bits physical, 48 bits virtual</p>
<p>I tried doing "isabelle build" of my projects using configurations with various numbers of vCPUs<br>
and watching the load average, CPU utilization, number of threads, and so on.  I found that it<br>
was difficult to find situations where more than about 8 CPUs were in use and the overall average<br>
speedup factor was more like about 3x.  So it is hard to justify paying for something larger<br>
than the 8vCPU/32GB RAM configuration at $0.238/hr or maybe the 12vCPU/48GB configuration at $0.357/hr.</p>
<p>Also, the 2.30GHz Xeon CPUs on the cloud server are somewhat slower than my 3.40GHz i5 CPU at home,<br>
so it actually turns out that I still get stuff done faster on my home system than if I use the<br>
cloud server with double the number of cores.  The cloud server is still useful when traveling,<br>
though (assuming a low-latency internet connection so that the GUI is sort of useable) because<br>
my old i3 laptop no longer has the horsepower to do anything useful with the projects that I have<br>
been working on.</p>
<p>A question that comes to mind is what is it that usually limits the amount of concurrency when<br>
using Isabelle?  Although obviously the source has to be parsed and type-checked before anything else<br>
can be done, and that seems to occur in a initial pass over the code that runs ahead of the actual<br>
proof checking, once that has been done it seems like as many of the basic proof steps as you like<br>
ought to be doable in parallel.  So I wonder why that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>Currently the high end for home machines is something like 8-core i7 /<br>
i9 @ 3.60 GHz. It also helps to have extra-fast RAM and SSD.</p>

<p>For a single session, 8 cores is indeed the optimal number for most<br>
applications. Typical speedup is in the range of 3..7.</p>
<p>For full-scale maintenance of many (parallel) sessions, notably AFP, it<br>
makes sense to have 80 cores around. Usually these are arranged in a<br>
non-uniform manner. Often, server hardware is actually just a<br>
single-board cluster of 8-core nodes.</p>

<p>Yes, I guess this is normal for most clouds.</p>

<p>Processing of Isabelle document sources (not "code") has many aspects.<br>
It depends a lot on the structure of the application how much implicit<br>
parallelism is in there by default. Scalable parallel executation is one<br>
of the big challenges of computer-science. Isabelle is already quite<br>
advanced in this respect, but we now also see the limits of hardware:<br>
parallel shared-memory access is a typical bottle-neck.</p>
