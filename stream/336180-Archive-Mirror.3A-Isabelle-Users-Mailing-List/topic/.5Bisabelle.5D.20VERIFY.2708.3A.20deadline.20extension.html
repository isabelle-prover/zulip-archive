<p>From: Gerwin Klein &lt;<a href="mailto:gerwin.klein@nicta.com.au">gerwin.klein@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
The deadline of VERIFY'08 has been extended for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>If you don't have a paper at IJCAR this year, but maybe some work-in-progress <br>
that people should know about, this is the perfect opportunity to visit IJCAR <br>
and Sydney!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>5th International Verification Workshop - VERIFY'08</p>
<p>What are the verification problems? What are the deduction techniques?</p>
<p>in connection with IJCAR 2008</p>
<p>August 10-11, 2008, Sydney, Australia</p>
<p>[http://www.uni-koblenz.de/~beckert/verify08/]</p>
<p>The formal verification of critical information systems has a long tradition<br>
as one of the main areas of application for automated theorem<br>
proving. Nevertheless, the area is of still growing importance as the number<br>
of computers affecting everyday life and the complexity of these systems are<br>
both increasing. The purpose of the VERIFY workshop series is to discuss<br>
problems arising during the formal modeling and verification of information<br>
systems and to investigate suitable solutions. Possible perspectives include<br>
those of automated theorem proving, tool support, system engineering, and<br>
applications.</p>
<p>The VERIFY workshop series aims at bringing together people who are interested<br>
in the development of safety and security critical systems, in formal methods,<br>
in the development of automated theorem proving techniques, and in the<br>
development of tool support. Practical experiences gained in realistic<br>
verifications are of interest to the automated theorem proving community and<br>
new theorem proving techniques should be transferred into practice. The<br>
overall objective of the VERIFY workshops is to identify open problems and to<br>
discuss possible solutions under the theme</p>
<p>What are the verification problems? What are the deduction techniques?</p>
<p>The scope of VERIFY includes topics such as</p>
<ul>
<li>ATP techniques in verification          + Information flow control</li>
<li>Case studies (specif. &amp; verific.)           + Refinement &amp; Decomposition</li>
<li>Combination of verification tools           + Reliability of mobile computing</li>
<li>Integration of ATPs and CASE-tools          + Reuse of specifications &amp; proofs</li>
<li>Compositional &amp; modular reasoning           + Management of change</li>
<li>Experience reports on using verification    + Safety-critical systems</li>
<li>Gaps between problems and techniques        + Security models</li>
<li>Formal methods for fault tolerance          + Tool support for formal methods</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions are encouraged in one of the following two categories:</p>
<p>A.  Regular papers: Submissions in this category should describe previously<br>
      unpublished work (completed or in progress), including descriptions of<br>
      research, tools, and applications.  Papers must be formatted following the<br>
      Springer LNCS guidelines and be 6-15 pages long.</p>
<p>B.  Discussion papers: Submissions in this category are intended to initiate<br>
      discussions and should address controversial issues, and may include<br>
      provocative statements.  Papers must be formatted following the Springer<br>
      LNCS guidelines and be 3-15 pages long.</p>
<p>Submission of papers is via EasyChair at:<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=verify08">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=verify08</a></p>
<p>The workshop proceedings will be distributed at the workshop as a collection<br>
of the accepted papers; they will also be made available as CEUR Workshop<br>
Proceedings.</p>
