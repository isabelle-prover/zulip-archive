Fourth Verified Software Competition (VSComp) 2014<br>
14-15 June 2014<br>
<a href="http://vscomp.org">http://vscomp.org</a></p>
<p>Organizers: Ernie Cohen, Marcelo Frias, Peter Müller, Natarajan Shankar</p>
<p>The Fourth Verified Software Competition (VSComp) aims to showcase the<br>
progress in verification technology.  The competition will occur over<br>
48 hours during the weekend of 14/15 June starting with the<br>
publication of the challenge problems at 0900 GMT of Sat June 14 and<br>
ending with the submission deadline for the solutions at 0900 GMT of<br>
Mon June 16.  Teams of up to three individuals can register to<br>
participate just prior to the start of the competition at<br>
<a href="http://vscomp.org">http://vscomp.org</a>.  The competition will consist of five verification<br>
challenges (with possible sub-problems) spanning a range of domains,<br>
including (but not limited to) sequential and concurrent algorithms,<br>
refinement, assertional verification, and metatheory.  Teams will have<br>
to solve the challenge problems using mechanized tools.  Teams are<br>
allowed to use multiple tools to tackle the challenges.  Only the best<br>
three problem solutions from each team will be taken into<br>
consideration for evaluating team performance.  An FAQ Wiki page will<br>
be maintained at the website to clarify questions that might come up<br>
before or during the competition.  After the competition, solutions<br>
will be made publicly available for peer review by the other teams.<br>
Teams should be available to answer questions during the peer review<br>
process, and if necessary, be prepared to make their verification<br>
tools available for experimentation.  Based on the results of the peer<br>
review, the organizers will evaluate the solutions for correctness,<br>
completeness, and clarity.</p>
<p>The winners will be given short speaking slots at VSTTE 2014 which<br>
takes place in Vienna during July 17, 18, 2014.  The competition will<br>
run on an honor system to ensure that above guidelines are being<br>
followed by each of the teams.  We especially encourage the<br>
participation of all-student teams and teams that are using tools<br>
developed by others.</p>
