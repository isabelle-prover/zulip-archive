<p>3rd International Conference on Verified Software: Theories, Tools, and Experiments (VSTTE 2010)<br>
Edinburgh, Scotland</p>
<p>August 16th-19th, 2010</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/vstte10">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/vstte10</a></p>
<p>POSTER SESSION</p>
<p>The complementary themes of Theories, Tools and Experiments makes VSTTE <br>
an unique conference. Through the introduction of a POSTER session <br>
at VSTTE 2010, we are aiming to widen the body of researchers that are <br>
involved in the Verified Software Initiative (VSI) and its related<br>
Challenges (more details on VSTTE &amp; VSI are provided below). </p>
<p>Limited financial support will be available if necessary to enable <br>
attendance of both MSc and PhD students whose posters are accepted. <br>
Specifically, we aim to attract students who are already engaged in <br>
theories or tools or experiments relevant to verification; and give <br>
them an opportunity to meet other students and researchers engaged <br>
in complementary experiments or theories or tools. Note that the<br>
POSTER session is open to all researchers, not just students. <br>
With regards to submissions, we require the following:</p>
<p>1. 1-page abstract of your research<br>
     2. Poster OR a poster plan <br>
     3. For students, a supporting statement from your supervisor </p>
<p>Submissions should be sent electronically to <a href="mailto:vstte10@macs.hw.ac.uk">vstte10@macs.hw.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<p>The timetable for POSTER authors is as follows:</p>
<p>JUNE 18:  Submission of abstract &amp; poster (plan) deadline<br>
JUNE 30:  Notification of decision<br>
JULY 31:  Camera-ready abstract deadline <br>
AUGUST 17:  Poster session</p>
<p>Note that a collection of abstracts for the accepted posters <br>
will be distributed at the conference. Poster authors will <br>
be expected to bring their poster with them to the conference.<br>
Details of the size of the final posters will be provided in<br>
due course. </p>
<p>Financial support will be allocated on a case-by-case basis,<br>
and will support around 30 partial/fully funded places, <br>
including 10 SICSA PhD funded places.</p>
<p>If you have any queries, please direct them to <a href="mailto:vstte10@macs.hw.ac.uk">vstte10@macs.hw.ac.uk</a> </p>

<p>WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF VSTTE?</p>
<p>The Third International Conference on Verified Software: Theories,<br>
Tools, and Experiments follows a successful inaugural working<br>
conference at Zurich (2005) and a successful conference in Toronto<br>
(2008). This conference is part of the Verified Software Initiative<br>
(VSI), a fifteen-year, cooperative, international project directed<br>
at the scientific challenges of large-scale software verification.<br>
VSI also includes UKCRC's Grand Challenge 6, i.e. Dependable Systems<br>
Evolution. VSTTE is open to anyone who is interested in participating<br>
actively in the VSI effort.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The goal of this conference is to advance the state of the art in<br>
the science and technology of software verification through the<br>
interaction of theory development, tool evolution, and experimental<br>
validation.  Authors are encouraged to submit work in progress,<br>
particularly if the work involves collaboration, theory unification,<br>
and tool integration.  Topics of interest include</p>
<p>requirements modeling<br>
specification languages<br>
specification/verification case-studies<br>
formal calculi<br>
programming languages<br>
language semantics<br>
software design methods<br>
software testing<br>
automatic code generation<br>
refinement methodologies<br>
type systems<br>
computer security<br>
verification tools (static analysis, dynamic analysis, model<br>
checking, theorem proving, satisfiability)<br>
tool integration<br>
benchmarks<br>
challenge problems<br>
integrated verification environments</p>
<p>We also encourage researchers to submit challenges in theory,<br>
formalization, systems verification, code verification, and<br>
applications. Contributions relating to existing challenges<br>
will also be welcomed, i.e.</p>

<p>VENUE</p>
<p>VSTTE 2010 is being hosted by Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.<br>
The conference dates coincide with the 2010 Edinburgh International<br>
Festival and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe -- collectively the<br>
largest annual  arts festival on the planet! The technical programme<br>
will take place in the Edinburgh Conference Centre (Riccarton campus),<br>
where accommodation will be available at very competitive rates for<br>
festival time. Social events will be arranged within the city centre,<br>
making VSTTE an unique cultural and scholarly event for 2010!</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>
<ul>
<li>Tom Ball (Microsoft Research, Redmond)</li>
<li>Gerwin Klein (National ICT Australia)</li>
<li>Matthew Parkinson (University of Cambridge)</li>
</ul>
<p>WORKSHOPS</p>
<p>In addition to the main conference, VSTTE will host two workshops on August 19th:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>VS-Theory focuses on theoretical foundations of software verification. <br>
Topics range from the difficult and essential study of soundness of delicate <br>
proof methods, to the discovery of new specification techniques and proof <br>
methods, to dramatic simplification or unification of existing methods, to as <br>
yet unknown breakthroughs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VS-Tools &amp; Experiments focuses on the development of verification tools and <br>
their experimental evaluation. Possible topics include interfaces between tools, <br>
tool integration platforms, and case studies. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The workshops will provide a forum to present new, possibly unfinished work and will <br>
also give the opportunity to propose research challenges, which will help form a research <br>
agenda for the Verified Software Initiative. </p>
<p>Papers must be written in English using Springer LNCS style. The page limit is 10 pages<br>
for technical papers and 5 pages for proposals of verification challenges. The proceedings will be <br>
published as a technical report. </p>
<p>SUMMER SCHOOL</p>
<p>There will be a two-day summer-school preceding the main conference on the 14 and<br>
15 August. The summer school will give a broad overview of software verification <br>
techniques,  addressing both bottom-up and top-down approaches with a strong focus<br>
on the formal representation and reasoning themes. The school consists of eight <br>
introductory lectures, each concentrating on an unique aspect of one or both of the <br>
overall themes. The topics of the lectures include inductive theorem proving; SAT and <br>
SMT solving; proof planning and rippling; rely/guarantee conditions; separation <br>
logic; operating system verification; formal analysis of security.</p>
<p>The following will present at the summer school:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert Atkey (University of Strathclyde) &amp; Ewen Maclean (Heriot-Watt University) </li>
<li>Alan Bundy &amp; Lucas Dixon (University of Edinburgh)</li>
<li>Jane Hillston (University of Edinburgh)</li>
<li>Cliff Jones (University of Newcastle)</li>
<li>Gerwin Klein (National ICT Australia)</li>
<li>J Strother Moore (University of Texas at Austin)</li>
<li>Natarajan Shankar (SRI)</li>
<li>Graham Steel (INRIA)</li>
</ul>
<p>The school is intended for PhD students and researchers working within one or both of <br>
these themes, however familiarity with any of the techniques is not a prerequisite. <br>
All lectures are meant to be introductory.  For more information see:</p>

<p>COMPETITION</p>
<p>A verification competition will be held at VSTTE 2010. The challenge is<br>
to develop a machine-verified piece of software with respect to a given<br>
specification. The competition will be conducted over a 2.5 hour period<br>
on some evening of the conference. The problem will be presented with a<br>
logical specification and test cases over .5 hours including time for<br>
discussion with 2 hours to construct a solution. Each competing team<br>
can feature up to three members. You can use any tool or combination of<br>
tools as well as libraries, but you cannot modify these tools.  You can<br>
reinterpret the specification to suit your tools and methods, but you<br>
will be judged on the fidelity of your interpretation. The goal is to<br>
produce an executable program and a replayable proof that the program<br>
meets the specification.  It will be possible to code the solution using<br>
integers and arrays. The solutions will be judged for soundness</p>
<p>(absence of bugs) and completeness (presence of proofs). The three best<br>
solutions will be selected and the respective teams will be invited to<br>
make presentations at the tools/experiments workshop. You must<br>
register a copy of the  verification system with the judges prior to the<br>
competition with instructions for replaying proofs and running the<br>
programs.</p>
