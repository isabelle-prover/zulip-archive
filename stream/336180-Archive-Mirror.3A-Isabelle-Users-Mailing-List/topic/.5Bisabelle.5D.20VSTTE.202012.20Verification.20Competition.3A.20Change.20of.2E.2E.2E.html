<p>VSTTE 2012 Verification Competition</p>
<hr>
<p>A software verification competition is organized on behalf of the<br>
VSTTE 2012 conference (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/vstte2012">https://sites.google.com/site/vstte2012</a>).<br>
The purposes of this competition are: to help promote approaches and<br>
tools, to provide new verification benchmarks, to stimulate further<br>
development of verification techniques, and to have fun.</p>
<p>The contest takes place during 48 hours, on 8-10 November 2011, two<br>
months prior to the conference. Problems will be put on the website of<br>
the conference.  Solutions must be sent by email to the competition<br>
organizers. Any programming language, specification language, and<br>
verification tool is allowed.</p>
<p>Problems</p>
<hr>
<p>There will be several, independent problems.  Each problem is<br>
presented as a sequential algorithm, using English or pseudocode, and<br>
a list of properties to formally prove about it, also expressed in<br>
plain English and standard mathematical notation. Participants have<br>
liberty to implement the proposed algorithms in functional,<br>
imperative, object-oriented, or any other programming style.</p>
<p>Evaluation</p>
<hr>
<p>Submissions are ranked according to the total sum of points they<br>
score.  Each problem includes several sub-tasks, e.g. safety,<br>
termination, behavioral correctness, etc., and each sub-task is given<br>
a number of points.  While evaluating the submissions, judges take<br>
into account the accuracy and thoroughness of solutions as well as<br>
their terseness and elegance.  (Clarity is more important than brevity.)<br>
A certain degree of subjectivity is inevitable and should be<br>
considered as part of the game.</p>
<p>Participants</p>
<hr>
<p>Anybody interested can take part in the contest. Team work is allowed.<br>
Only teams up to 4 members are eligible for the first prize.<br>
Individual participants may belong to several teams.<br>
However, the same solution cannot appear in different submissions.</p>
<p>The technical requirements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>access to the web to download the problems (PDF file);</li>
<li>access to the email to submit the solutions;</li>
<li>any software used in the solutions should be freely available for<br>
 noncommercial use to the public. This does not exclude closed source<br>
 programs (such as Microsoft's Z3). Software must be usable on an x86<br>
 Linux or Windows machine. Participants are authorized to modify<br>
 their tools during the competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission</p>
<hr>
<p>A submission is a (possibly compressed) tarball that contains exactly<br>
one directory (named by the team, for instance). This directory should<br>
contain at least a text file named README, and one directory for each<br>
problem solved. Thus it must look like:</p>
<p>team/ -+<br>
         +- README<br>
         +- problem1/<br>
         +- problem2/</p>
<p>+  ...<br>
         +- problemN/<br>
         +- other stuff...</p>
<p>The README file should contain the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>contact information (email);</li>
<li>
<p>detailed description of the submitted solutions: properties that<br>
 have been specified and/or proved, restrictions and/or<br>
 generalizations, anything that may facilitate the review;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>detailed instructions to replay the solutions, including the<br>
 software to use, URLs to get it from, compilation commands, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Several solutions can be submitted for the same problem (for instance,<br>
using different tools). They should be stored in separate subdirectories<br>
of problemI/. During evaluation, only the best-faring solution will be<br>
taken into account.</p>
<p>Organizers</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Jean-Christophe Filliâtre (CNRS, France)</li>
<li>Andrei Paskevich (Univ Paris Sud, France)</li>
<li>Aaron Stump (University of Iowa, USA)</li>
</ul>
<p>Schedule</p>
<hr>
<p>Tuesday   8 Nov 2011, 15:00 UTC - competition starts<br>
 Thursday 10 Nov 2011, 15:00 UTC - competition stops</p>
<p>Monday 12 Dec 2011 - the winner is notified<br>
 28-29 Jan 2012 - results are announced at VSTTE 2012</p>
<p>Prize</p>
<hr>
<p>The winner is awarded a talk slot at VSTTE 2012, to present any<br>
research of his/her choice of interest for the VSTTE community. In<br>
particular, a presentation of solutions to the competition problems<br>
and/or of the techniques and system used would be appreciated.</p>
