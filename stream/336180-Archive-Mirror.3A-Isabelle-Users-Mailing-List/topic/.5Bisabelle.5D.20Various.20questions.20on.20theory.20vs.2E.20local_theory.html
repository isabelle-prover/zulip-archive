<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu">andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
I am currently trying to automate some definitions and subsequent proofs and <br>
declarations. However, I am currently unsure how to go about with a few points <br>
and I'd appreciate any help to point me in the right direction. By the way, I am <br>
using the Isabelle repository version 29aa0c071875.</p>
<p>Here's what I am doing: I have implemented a function as a transformer of <br>
local_theory. Given some parameters,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>it constructs an Isabelle term and uses this to define a new constant using <br>
Local_Theory.define. Call the resulting theory lthy1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the definition, it proves some equations for simplification, adds them <br>
to a dynamic theorem list, and declares them as [iff]. This is the first bit <br>
which looks odd to me. Here are the details:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a) I use Goal.prove based on lthy1 to prove the simplification equations (say <br>
simp_thm) whose term representation whose I have constructed using the ML <br>
primitives.</p>
<p>b) Then, I add the proven theorems to the dynamic theorem list via<br>
   Local_Theory.declaration {syntax = false, pervasive=true} f<br>
where f phi applies the morphism to the theorem to be stored (i.e. simp_thm) <br>
before it updates the Generic_Data slot that manages the dynamic theorem list. <br>
This gives lthy2.</p>
<p>c) Next, I declare thms as [iff] via</p>
<p>val lthy3 = Local_Theory.declaration {syntax=false, pervasive=false}<br>
     (fn phi =&gt; Thm.attribute_declaration (Clasimp.iff_add o Morphism.thm phi)<br>
                   simp_thm) lthy2</p>
<p>For now, let lthy3 be the result of the whole function.</p>
<p>When I execute these steps inside a locale via local_setup, step c) outputs two <br>
warnings each about duplicate rewrite rules and duplicate safe elimination rules <br>
for the simp_thm. Is that normal? What should I do instead?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Next, I would like to register the newly defined constant as another datatype <br>
constructor for the code generator via Code.add_datatype. Unfortunately, <br>
Code.add_datatype is a theory morphism, not a local_theory transformer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, the problem is that Code.add_datatype expects a list of constructor <br>
names, i.e., the names that the constructors have in the background theory. How <br>
can I obtain the global name of the newly defined constant?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Since the constructors for code generation have changed, I would also like to <br>
add the corresponding code equations for equal_class.equal, i.e., prove some <br>
code equations and declare them in the background theory as [code], i.e., using <br>
Code.add_eqn, which again is a theory transformer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Am I right to assume that Local_Theory.background_theory converts that into a <br>
transformer on the local_theory?<br>
And how do I correctly export the code equations that I have proved in lthy1 to <br>
the background theory?</p>
<p>I hope that the above description provides sufficient information about what I <br>
am doing to answer my problems. If not, I could also post the full code, but it <br>
is currently in a messy state.</p>
<p>Andreas</p>
