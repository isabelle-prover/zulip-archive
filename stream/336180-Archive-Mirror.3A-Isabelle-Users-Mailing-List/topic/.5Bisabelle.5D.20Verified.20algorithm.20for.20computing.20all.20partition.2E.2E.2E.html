<p>From: Christoph LANGE &lt;<a href="mailto:math.semantic.web@gmail.com">math.semantic.web@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle community,</p>
<p>as a part of our work on formalising auctions<br>
(<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/code/auction-theory/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/code/auction-theory/</a>) we<br>
implemented an algorithm that computes all partitions of a given set and<br>
proved its correctness.  This is joint work with Marco B. Caminati,<br>
Manfred Kerber and Colin Rowat.</p>
<p>Even though this is just one small building block of our soundness proof<br>
of a combinatorial auction (see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1779">http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1779</a> for the<br>
big picture), it is self-contained, and we believe that it is of general<br>
interest.  We are further working on a verified algorithm to compute all<br>
injective functions between two given sets.</p>
<p>Our main reason for defining these functions in a computable way is the<br>
ability to use Isabelle's code generator to generate verified auction<br>
software.  Please see<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/code/auction-theory/isabelle/Auction/code/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/code/auction-theory/isabelle/Auction/code/</a><br>
for executable Scala demos.</p>
<p>The sources can be found in our GitHub repository<br>
<a href="https://github.com/formare/auctions/">https://github.com/formare/auctions/</a> at<br>
<a href="https://github.com/formare/auctions/blob/master/isabelle/Auction/Partitions.thy">https://github.com/formare/auctions/blob/master/isabelle/Auction/Partitions.thy</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sure Partitions.thy is of interest for the AFP.  However, other<br>
parts of our Auction Theory Toolbox (maintained on GitHub) depend on it.<br>
 Do you have a good recommendation for how to submit Partitions.thy to<br>
the AFP without breaking the dependencies of our Toolbox?</p>
<p>Furthermore, would such a theory be of interest for the Isabelle library?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Christoph</p>

You can always modify the development version of your AFP entry to keep it in<br>
sync with the rest of your toolbox.</p>
<p>Parts of IsaFoR, the Isabelle Formalization of Rewriting by Christian Sternagel<br>
and René Thiemann, live in the AFP. Either of them should share their experience<br>
with this arrangement.</p>

<p>From: René Thiemann &lt;<a href="mailto:rene.thiemann@uibk.ac.at">rene.thiemann@uibk.ac.at</a>&gt;<br>
So far, we are quite satisfied with our setup, that some parts of IsaFoR are in the AFP and<br>
others are not. Here are my personal opinions on our setup:</p>
<p>1) If you are always working with the development version of Isabelle, then there<br>
   is no problem at all to put parts of your work in the AFP. Because then you can<br>
   at any time change your AFP entries.</p>
<p>2) Putting theories in the AFP has the big advantage that updates for your theories<br>
   in AFP w.r.t. changes in Isabelle will most likely done by someone else, namely<br>
   the person who did the change in Isabelle.<br>
   Moreover, you get feedback by other Isabelle users who want to use your AFP-theories,<br>
   and the visibility of your development is increased.</p>
<p>3) If you are working with a release version of Isabelle, then one problem might be<br>
   that changes in the AFP-part of your theories will only become visible in the AFP<br>
   at the next release. To this end, we usually only put those parts into the AFP <br>
   which are quite stable. Moreover, in our local development we accumulate changes<br>
   for the AFP-part, which are then integrated into the AFP shortly before the next<br>
   release. In this way, other persons (students) can always work with IsaFoR and<br>
   a release version of Isabelle. (Exceptions are shortly before the next release where<br>
   we merge our theories with the AFP) </p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
René</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Here you should swap the articles and say "a development version" vs. "the <br>
release version".</p>
<p>Development versions are many: more than 50000 right now.  When you make <br>
an arbitrary shot at some of them, you get "the" version on your machine <br>
in some directory, while the public repository keeps moving.  You need to <br>
care about keeping it in sync with other snapshots of other projects (e.g. <br>
AFP), tell other people about the changeset id you happen to have etc. <br>
To work smoothly, you need to follow ongoing changes frequently.  Staying <br>
behind too long means your "latest development version" becomes more <br>
outdated than the last public Isabelle release version. (You IsaFoR guys <br>
manage all that very well, and there is even a formal COMPATIBILITY file <br>
with changeset ids of Isabelle and AFP within your repository.)</p>
<p>In contrast, Isabelle releases are well-defined stable checkpoints that <br>
happen every 6-10 months and remain "current" over a longer time.  When <br>
someone posts on the mailing list, there is no need to say "I am using the <br>
latest release" (or one or two releases behind), since that can be easily <br>
guessed or tried out quickly against 2 or 3 alternatives (instead of <br>
thousands above).  Someone who happens to have some project based on some <br>
proper release from a few years ago can still be helped out.  (Archeology <br>
on repository versions that are more than a few months old is much <br>
harder.)</p>
<p>Anyway, we are presently again in a state of confusion about <br>
isabelle-users vs. isabelle-dev, proper releases vs. arbitrary repository <br>
snapshots.  I've just myself posted ongoing repository changes about a <br>
mostly administrative tool "isabelle components" on this mailing list by <br>
accident.</p>
