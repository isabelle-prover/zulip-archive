<p>===================================================================================<br>
25th INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON ALGEBRAIC DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUES 2020<br>
===================================================================================</p>
<p><a href="https://wadt2020.github.io">https://wadt2020.github.io</a></p>
<p>Dublin, Ireland, 25.-26. April 2020</p>
<p>Co-located with ETAPS 2020</p>

Abstract Submission Deadline: 14.2.2020<br>
Notification: 24.2.2020</p>
<hr>
<p>The algebraic approach to system specification encompasses many<br>
aspects of the formal design of software systems. Originally born as a<br>
formal method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now covers<br>
new specification frameworks and programming paradigms (such as<br>
object-oriented, aspect oriented, agent-oriented, logic and<br>
higher-order functional programming) as well as a wide range of<br>
application areas (including information systems, concurrent,<br>
distributed and mobile systems). The workshop will provide an<br>
opportunity to present recent and ongoing work, to meet colleagues,<br>
and to discuss new ideas and future trends.</p>
<p>The workshop takes place under the auspices of IFIP WG 1.3.</p>
<p>WADT 2020 will have three thematic streams and one general stream:</p>
<p>Graph Transformation – chair: Andrea Corradini, Italy<br>
System Modelling – chair: Alexander Knapp, Germany<br>
Deductive Software Verification – chair: Marieke Huismanm, The Netherlands<br>
General Stream - chair: Markus Roggenbach, UK</p>
<hr>
<p>GRAPH TRANSFORMATION STREAM</p>
<hr>
<p>The  graph   transformation  stream  seeks  contributions  addressing<br>
theoretical,  application oriented  or tool  related aspects  of graph<br>
transformation, or  any combination of  them. Here is  a non-exclusive<br>
list of topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foundations of algebraic and set-based approaches to graph transformation</li>
<li>Relations between graph transformation and other computational models</li>
<li>Analysis, verification, validation and testing of graph transformation systems</li>
<li>
<p>Applications to software engineering, including software architectures, refactoring,<br>
  business processes, access control and service-orientation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications to computing paradigms such as bio-inspired, string diagrams, quantum, ubiquitous, and visual computing</p>
</li>
<li>Tools based on or supporting the development of graph transformation systems.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>SYSTSEM MODELLING STREAM</p>
<hr>
<p>The system modelling stream seeks contributions in the (co-)algebraic<br>
and model-based tradition of system specification and verification,<br>
for which typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systems modelling</li>
<li>System views and consistency</li>
<li>Real-time, Hybrid, and Cyber-physical systems</li>
<li>Modelling languages, like UML, SysML, etc., and their profiles</li>
<li>Model transformations</li>
<li>Model-based testing</li>
<li>Tools for systems specification, testing, and verification</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>DEDUCTIVE SOFTWARE VERIFICATION STREAM</p>
<hr>
<p>The deductive software verification stream seeks contributions<br>
addressing theoretical or tool-related contributions in the area of<br>
deductive software verification. Also experience reports are<br>
welcome. Here is a non-exclusive list of topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foundations of deductive software verification and program logics</li>
<li>
<p>Advancing deductive software verification techniques to new programming languages,<br>
  or different programming paradigms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automating deductive software verification</p>
</li>
<li>Combinations of deductive software verification techniques with other formal methods</li>
<li>Applications of deductive software verification on industrial case studies</li>
</ul>
<p>This stream will be scheduled in such a way that there will be no overlap with the VerifyThis workshop at Etaps 2020.</p>
<hr>
<p>GENERAL STREAM</p>
<hr>
<p>Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest for the general stream are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foundations of algebraic specification</li>
<li>
<p>Other approaches to formal specification, including process calculi and <br>
  models of concurrent, distributed, and cyber-physical systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specification languages, methods, and environments</p>
</li>
<li>Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques</li>
<li>Integration of formal specification techniques</li>
<li>Formal testing and quality assurance, validation, and verification</li>
<li>Algebraic approaches to cognitive sciences, including computational creativity</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>SUBMISSION</p>
<hr>
<p>The scientific programme of the workshop will include presentations of<br>
recent results and ongoing research. The presentations will be<br>
selected by the relevant PC Chair on the basis of submitted abstracts<br>
according to originality, significance and general interest. The<br>
abstracts must be up to two pages long including references. If a<br>
longer version of the contribution is available, it can be made<br>
accessible on the web and referenced in the abstract.</p>
<p>The abstracts have to be submitted electronically via the EasyChair<br>
system using the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wadt2020">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wadt2020</a></p>
<p>After the workshop, authors will be invited to submit full papers for<br>
the refereed post-proceedings. All submissions will be reviewed by the<br>
WADT 2020 PC (TBA); selection will be based on originality, soundness and<br>
significance of the presented ideas and results. The proceedings are<br>
likely to be published as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer<br>
Science (LNCS) by Springer. The deadline for submissions will be<br>
19.5.2020 , with notifications of acceptance by<br>
26.6.2020. Camera-ready versions will be required by 17.7.2020.</p>
