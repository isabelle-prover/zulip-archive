<p>WFLP 2020</p>
<p>The international Workshop on Functional and (constraint) Logic<br>
Programming (WFLP) aims at bringing together researchers, students, and<br>
practitioners interested in functional programming, logic programming,<br>
and their integration. WFLP has a reputation for being a lively and<br>
friendly forum, and it is open for presenting and discussing work in<br>
progress, technical contributions, experience reports, experiments,<br>
reviews, and system descriptions.</p>
<p>The 28th International Workshop on Functional and (Constraint) Logic<br>
Programming (WFLP 2020) will be organized by the University of Bologna,<br>
Italy, as part of Bologna Federated Conference on Programming Languages<br>
2020 and it will be held entirely on-line due to the coronavirus<br>
pandemic.</p>

<p>Topics</p>
<p>The topics of interest cover all aspects of functional and logic<br>
programming. They include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional programming</li>
<li>Logic programming</li>
<li>Constraint programming</li>
<li>Deductive databases, data mining</li>
<li>Extensions of declarative languages, objects</li>
<li>Multi-paradigm declarative programming</li>
<li>Foundations, semantics, non-monotonic reasoning, dynamics</li>
<li>Parallelism, concurrency</li>
<li>Program analysis, abstract interpretation</li>
<li>Program and model manipulation</li>
<li>Program transformation, partial evaluation, meta-programming</li>
<li>Specification,</li>
<li>Verification</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Knowledge representation, machine learning</li>
<li>Interaction of declarative programming with other formalisms</li>
<li>Implementation of declarative languages</li>
<li>Advanced programming environments and tools</li>
<li>Software techniques for declarative programming</li>
<li>Applications</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary focus is on new and original research results, but<br>
submissions describing innovative products, prototypes under<br>
development,<br>
application systems, or interesting experiments (e.g., benchmarks) are<br>
also encouraged. Survey papers that present some aspects of the above<br>
topics from a new perspective, and experience reports are also welcome.</p>
<p>Papers must be written and presented in English. Work that already<br>
appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings<br>
may<br>
be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).</p>
<p>Submission Guidelines</p>
<p>Submission is via Easychair submission website for WFLP 2020:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wflp2020">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wflp2020</a></p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit papers in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular research paper</li>
<li>Work-in-progress report</li>
<li>System description</li>
</ul>
<p>Regular research papers must describe original work, be written and<br>
presented in English, and must not substantially overlap with papers<br>
that have been formally published or that are simultaneously submitted<br>
to a journal, conference, or workshop with formal proceedings. They<br>
will<br>
be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness,<br>
originality, and clarity. For work-in-progress reports and system<br>
descriptions, less formal rules apply, and presentation-only<br>
submissions<br>
(talk and discussion, but no paper in the formal proceedings) are<br>
possible. Please contact the PC chair with any questions.</p>
<p>All submissions must be formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer<br>
Science style. Submissions cannot exceed 15 pages including references<br>
but excluding well-marked appendices not intended for publication.<br>
Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers<br>
should<br>
be intelligible without them. However, all submissions (especially<br>
work-in-progress reports and system descriptions) may be considerably<br>
shorter than 15 pages.</p>
<p>Proceedings</p>
<p>All papers accepted for presentation at the conference will be<br>
published<br>
in informal proceedings publicly available at the Computing Research<br>
Repository. According to the program committee reviews, submissions can<br>
be<br>
directly accepted for publication in the formal post-conference<br>
proceedings.<br>
The formal post-conference proceedings will be published in both<br>
electronic<br>
and paper formats by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science<br>
series.<br>
After the conference, all authors accepted only for presentation will<br>
be<br>
invited to revise and/or extend their submissions in the light of the<br>
feedback<br>
solicited at the conference. Then, after another round of reviewing,<br>
these<br>
revised papers may also be published in the formal proceedings.</p>
<p>Therefore, all accepted papers will be published in open-access, and<br>
the<br>
authors can also decide to publish their work in the Springer LNCS<br>
formal<br>
proceedings.</p>
