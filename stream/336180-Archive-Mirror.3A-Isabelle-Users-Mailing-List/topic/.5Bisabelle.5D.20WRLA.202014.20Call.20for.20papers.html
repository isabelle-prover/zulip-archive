10th International Workshop on Rewriting Logic and its Applications</p>
<p>WRLA 2014<br>
Grenoble, France, April 5th and 6th, 2014<br>
<a href="http://www.dsic.upv.es/workshops/wrla2014/">http://www.dsic.upv.es/workshops/wrla2014/</a></p>
<p>The workshop will be held in conjunction with<br>
ETAPS 2014<br>
17th European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software<br>
April 5-13, 2014<br>
<a href="http://www.etaps.org/2014">http://www.etaps.org/2014</a></p>
<p>AIMS AND SCOPE</p>
<p>Rewriting logic (RL) is a natural model of computation and an <br>
expressive semantic framework for concurrency, parallelism, <br>
communication, and interaction. It can be used for specifying <br>
a wide range of systems and languages in various application <br>
fields. It also has good properties as a metalogical framework <br>
for representing logics. In recent years, several languages <br>
based on RL (ASF+SDF, CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude) have been designed <br>
and implemented. The aim of the workshop is to bring together <br>
researchers with a common interest in RL and its applications, <br>
and to give them the opportunity to present their recent works, <br>
discuss future research directions, and exchange ideas.</p>
<p>The topics of the workshop comprise, but are not limited to,</p>
<ul>
<li>foundations and models of RL;</li>
<li>languages based on RL, including implementation issues;</li>
<li>RL as a logical framework;</li>
<li>RL as a semantic framework, including applications of RL to</li>
<li>object-oriented systems,</li>
<li>concurrent and/or parallel systems,</li>
<li>interactive, distributed, open ended and mobile systems,</li>
<li>specification of languages and systems;</li>
<li>
<p>use of RL to provide rigorous support for model-based software <br>
engineering;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formalisms related to RL, including</p>
</li>
<li>real-time and probabilistic extensions of RL,</li>
<li>rewriting approaches to behavioral specifications,</li>
<li>tile logic;</li>
<li>verification techniques for RL specifications, including</li>
<li>equational and coherence methods,</li>
<li>
<p>verification of properties expressed in first-order, <br>
 higher-order, modal and temporal logics,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>narrowing-based analysis and verification;</p>
</li>
<li>comparisons of RL with existing formalisms having analogous aims;</li>
<li>application of RL to specification and analysis of</li>
<li>distributed systems,</li>
<li>physical systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>Submission deadline          December 30th 2013<br>
Author notification          February 2nd 2014<br>
Version informal proceedings February 14th 2014</p>
<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>The final program of the workshop will include regular papers, <br>
tool papers, and work-in-progress presentations. The program <br>
will also contain invited talks to be determined by the <br>
program committee. Papers must contain original contributions, <br>
be clearly written, include appropriate references, and <br>
comparison with related work. They must be unpublished and <br>
not submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere. <br>
Tool papers present a new tool, a new tool component, or <br>
novel extensions to an existing tool. They should provide a <br>
short description of the theoretical foundations with <br>
relevant citations, emphasize the design and implementation,<br>
and give a clear account of the tool's functionality. The<br>
described tools must be publicly available via the web.<br>
All submissions should be formatted according to the <br>
guidelines for Springer LNCS papers, and should be submitted <br>
electronically using EasyChair.</p>
<p>Regular papers and work-in-progress should not exceed <br>
15 pages including references. Tool papers can have a <br>
maximum of 6 pages including references and may have <br>
an appendix of up to 4 additional pages with <br>
usage details and tool demonstration.</p>
<p>PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>All submissions will be evaluated by the Program Committee. <br>
Regular papers, tool papers, and work-in-progress that <br>
are accepted will be presented at the workshop and <br>
included in the proceedings, which will be available<br>
during the workshop. Regular papers, tool papers, and <br>
invited presentations will also be published in a volume <br>
in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science <br>
(LNCS) series to be distributed after the workshop. </p>
<p>Depending on the number and the quality of the contributions, <br>
we will consider the preparation of a special issue in some <br>
scientific journal in the field with extended versions of a <br>
selection of the papers of the workshop.</p>
