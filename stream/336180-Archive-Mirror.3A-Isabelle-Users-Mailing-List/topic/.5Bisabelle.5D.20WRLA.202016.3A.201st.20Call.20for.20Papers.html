======================== Call for Papers =================================</p>
<p>WRLA 2016</p>
<p>11th International<br>
            Workshop on Rewriting Logic and its Applications</p>
<p>An ETAPS 2016 satellite event<br>
               Eindhoven, The Netherlands, April 2-3, 2016<br>
==========================================================================</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>* Abstract deadline: January 6th 2016<br>
   * Submission deadline: January 10th 2016<br>
   * Author notification: February 14th 2016<br>
   * Workshop: Saturday April 2nd and Sunday April 3rd, 2016</p>
<p>AIMS AND SCOPE</p>
<p>Rewriting is a natural model of computation and an expressive semantic<br>
framework for concurrency, parallelism, communication, and interaction. It<br>
can be used for specifying a wide range of systems and languages in various<br>
application domains. It also has good properties as a metalogical framework<br>
for representing logics. Several successful languages based on rewriting<br>
(ASF+SDF, CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude) have been designed and implemented. The aim<br>
of WRLA is to bring together researchers with a common interest in rewriting<br>
and its applications, and to give them the opportunity to present their<br>
recent work, discuss future research directions, and exchange ideas.<br>
The 2016 edition of WRLA will mark its 20th anniversary since its first<br>
edition in Asilomar, California, in 1996.</p>
<p>The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>A. Foundations</p>
<p>* foundations and models of rewriting and rewriting logic, including<br>
     termination, confluence, coherence and complexity</p>
<p>* unification, generalisation, narrowing, and partial evaluation<br>
   * constrained rewriting and symbolic algebra<br>
   * graph rewriting<br>
   * tree automata<br>
   * rewriting strategies<br>
   * rewriting-based calculi and explicit substitutions</p>
<p>B. Rewriting as a Logical and Semantic Framework</p>
<p>* uses of rewriting and rewriting logic as a logical framework,<br>
     including deduction modulo</p>
<p>* uses of rewriting as a semantic framework for programming language<br>
     semantics</p>
<p>* rewriting semantics of concurrency models, distributed systems, and<br>
     network protocols</p>
<p>* rewriting semantics of real-time, hybrid, and probabilistic systems<br>
   * uses of rewriting for compilation and language transformation</p>
<p>C.  Rewriting Languages</p>
<p>* rewriting-based declarative languages<br>
   * type systems for rewriting<br>
   * implementation techniques<br>
   * tools supporting rewriting languages</p>
<p>D. Verification Techniques</p>
<p>* verification of confluence, termination, coherence, sufficient<br>
     completeness, and related properties</p>
<p>* temporal, modal and reachability logics for verifying dynamic<br>
     properties of rewrite theories</p>
<p>* explicit-state and symbolic model-checking techniques for<br>
     verification of rewrite theories</p>
<p>* rewriting-based theorem proving, including (co)inductive theorem <br>
proving</p>
<p>* rewriting-based constraint solving and satisfiability<br>
   * rewriting-semantics-based verification and analysis of programs</p>
<p>E. Applications</p>
<p>* applications to logic, mathematics and physics<br>
   * rewriting models of biology, chemistry, and membrane systems<br>
   * security specification and verification<br>
   * applications to distributed, network, mobile, and cloud computing<br>
   * specification and verification of real-time, probabilistic, and<br>
     cyber-physical systems</p>
<p>* specifications and verification of critical systems<br>
   * applications to model-based software engineering<br>
   * applications to engineering and planning</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>
<p>TBA</p>
<p>SUBMISSION</p>
<p>We solicit submissions of regular papers, tool papers, and<br>
work-in-progress papers.</p>
<p>Regular papers must contain original contributions, be clearly written,<br>
include appropriate references, and comparison with related work. They must<br>
be unpublished and not submitted simultaneously for publication<br>
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Tool papers have to present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel<br>
extensions to an existing tool. They should provide a short description of<br>
the theoretical foundations with relevant citations, emphasise the <br>
design and<br>
implementation, and give a clear account of the tool's functionality. The<br>
described tools must be publicly available via the web.</p>
<p>Work-in-progress papers present early-stage work or other types of <br>
innovative<br>
or thought-provoking work related to the topics of the workshop. The<br>
difference between work-in-progress and regular papers is that <br>
work-in-progress<br>
submissions represent work that has not reached yet a level of<br>
completion that would warrant the full-refereed selection process. We<br>
encourage researchers and practitioners to submit work-in-progress papers as<br>
this provides a unique opportunity for sharing valuable ideas, eliciting<br>
useful feedback on ongoing work, and fostering discussions and <br>
collaborations<br>
among colleagues.</p>
<p>All submissions should be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer<br>
LNCS papers, and should be submitted electronically using EasyChair at</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wrla2016">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wrla2016</a></p>
<p>Regular and work-in-progress papers should not exceed 15 pages including<br>
references. Tool papers can have a maximum of 6 pages including references<br>
and may have an appendix of up to 4 additional pages with usage details and<br>
tool demonstration.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION</p>
<p>All submissions will be evaluated by the program committee. Regular papers,<br>
tool papers, and work-in-progress papers that are accepted will be presented<br>
at the workshop and included in the pre-proceedings, which will be available<br>
during the workshop. Following the tradition of the last editions, it is<br>
expected the regular papers, tool papers, and invited presentations to be<br>
published as a volume in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)<br>
series to be distributed after the workshop.</p>
<p>A special issue of the Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in<br>
Programming (JLAMP) will be devoted to extended versions of selected papers<br>
from WRLA 2016.</p>
