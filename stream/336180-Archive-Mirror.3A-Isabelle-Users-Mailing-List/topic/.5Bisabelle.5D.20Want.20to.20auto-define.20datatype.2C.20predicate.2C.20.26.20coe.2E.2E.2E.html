Hi,</p>
<p>I have a question for the Big Guns, and I posted it on Stackoverflow:</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27865042/want-to-auto-define-with-ml-a-datatype-a-predicate-coercions-given-name">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27865042/want-to-auto-define-with-ml-a-datatype-a-predicate-coercions-given-name</a></p>
<p>It's big enough to where I want to increase the chances that I'll either <br>
get an answer in the negative, an answer that's complete enough for me <br>
to finish it, or an answer that's a plain ole, complete working solution.</p>
<p>There is the UGB, the universal set of Isabelle/HOL Big Guns, and a <br>
subset of UGB, the BGAOSO, the Big Guns Active on Stackoverflow. Members <br>
of the BGAOSO have actually been very helpful, and I've gotten important <br>
answers on SO. For anything important, it seems like it was answered.</p>
<p>I think SO is a better staging place for a more involved question, one <br>
where there's a good chance it won't get answered, or won't get answered <br>
with enough detail for me to finish the job.</p>
<p>If the answer is deceptively simple, that would not be bad. Within the <br>
scope of that which is called bad, compared to that which is called <br>
good, it, a deceptively simple answer, would be of that quality which is <br>
commonly called good, or, simply, good.</p>
<p>It's okay if it's answered here. If it's answered here and not there, <br>
I'll probably delete the question there. I could include it all here, <br>
now, but the formatting is better there, so it seems I should leave it <br>
all there, at this time.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I get impatient, so that question I was asking about is gone, or soon <br>
will be.</p>
<p>I'll give you something of importance that I said there, which is the <br>
Law of df&amp;P:</p>
<p>(The Law of df&amp;P): There is pattern matching with datatype and fun, let <br>
it not escape your use.</p>
<p>I like things black and white, so I need laws to work by. I now have a <br>
new one, which is the result of eliminating some complexity, and <br>
accepting a compromise.</p>
<p>(The Law of the Universe Plus One): There is 'a option, use it directly, <br>
in it's simple brilliance.</p>
<p>I was using it, but not in its simplicity, because I was trying to solve <br>
a problem that comes, at least partly, from the limitations of simple <br>
types. Given a fundamental type, like nat, ideally, defining a new type, <br>
such as that n = 1 or n = 7, should be a one-liner, but things end up <br>
getting complicated.</p>
<p>I looked at the standard example of a dependent type to try and get a <br>
bare minimum understanding. I don't know whether dependent types would <br>
even solve the problem above, because, as far as I can tell, if I don't <br>
restrict the domain of a type with the use of type constructors, rather <br>
than with a predicate, it doesn't help. The end result can be that I <br>
just introduce a lot of complexity, trying to achieve an idea, that my <br>
domain should be encoded in my type name.</p>
<p>Why I don't switch to dependent types? I would. I'm a fair weather <br>
friend when it comes to proof assistants.</p>
<p>What I do is try to do is get a glimpse of what I don't understand, and <br>
make decisions on my glimpse, because understanding takes times. My <br>
glimpse tells me that complexity comes at a cost. Limitations force me <br>
to seek simpler solutions, or to deal with details directly, and when I <br>
deal with details directly, I'm probably closer to what the hardware <br>
really does, and the details, again, make me seek simpler, more <br>
straightforward solutions. There are lots of things to consider, though.</p>
<p>Here's a brilliant use of None:</p>
<p>instantiation option :: ("numeral") numeral<br>
   begin<br>
     definition one_option :: "'a option" where<br>
       "one_option == Some 1"</p>
<p>definition plus_option :: "'a option =&gt; 'a option =&gt; 'a option" where<br>
       "x + y == if x = None | y = None then None else Some (the x + the y)"<br>
     declare plus_option_def [simp add]<br>
   instance by(default, auto simp add: add.assoc)<br>
   end<br>
   declare [[coercion "Some :: nat =&gt; nat option"]]</p>
<p>And someone says, "Nothing new, guy, I've been using that for quite a <br>
long time." And I was hoping to hear that, because I need someone to <br>
appreciate my brilliant use of None.</p>
<p>Okay, because no one answered the question I requested help with, I want <br>
to ask for help on something else.</p>
<p>I need to know which of two phrases is grammatically correct. Should I <br>
say, "None is brilliant" or "None are brilliant"? Puns, yes, I would <br>
like to ask about those too, but I can ask about those later.</p>
<p>I said I'm impatient, right? Yes, I did. People, if they don't help me, <br>
I have to figure things out for myself, or look for another solution.</p>
<p>"None". It's polymorphic, is it not? Okay, then it's "are".</p>
<p>I think I've got a glimpse that the use of "None" has some good set <br>
theoretical zemantics. Sometimes it's the universe, and sometimes it's a <br>
set complement.</p>
<p>As to the sematics of zemantics, that's paying homage to the fact that <br>
in all my formal education, I don't remember once hearing a <br>
mathematician use the word "semantics".</p>
<p>Is that a complaint? Not at all, because I don't need semantics and I <br>
don't understand formal semantics. It also doesn't end up being a <br>
limitation, because I don't design languages, I use languages that. Why <br>
should I use the word?</p>
<p>I had truth tables, and now I have syntax. Semantics? No, I have no need <br>
for semantics, not when I have syntax and zemantics. One string of <br>
characters goes in and another string of characters comes out. How do I <br>
know? Because, I can see it all, in the console, that's why I keep it <br>
open all the time.</p>
<p>As to the zemantics of that little house in the console, and maybe even <br>
its semantics, I'm not sure. Maybe it's saying, "Hey, you, logical wimp, <br>
why you using Sledgehammer so much? Maybe I'll kick your logical tail, <br>
and send you home."</p>
<p>That I don't use semantics, does that mean I don't need interpretation? <br>
No, of course I need interpretation, even with zemantics at my disposal.</p>
<p>I look in the console. What do I see? An "x". Then, later on, not an <br>
"x", but an "x::'a". Later on even, not an "x::'a", but an <br>
"x::'a::numeral". This requires syntactic interpretation, that "x", I <br>
need to interpret it as "x::'a", and further, that "x::'a", it should be <br>
interpreted as "x::'a::numeral". I work it out again, to make sure I'm <br>
right. One character went in. Fourteen characters came out. I interpret <br>
it all again. Even a third time. Finally, I'm convinced that "x", yea, <br>
it's exactly the same "x" as "x::'a", which is exactly the same "x::'a" <br>
as "x::'a::numeral". Well, somehow not "exactly the same", but that's <br>
the benefit of zemantics over semantics. With zemantics, you don't sweat <br>
the small stuff.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>
