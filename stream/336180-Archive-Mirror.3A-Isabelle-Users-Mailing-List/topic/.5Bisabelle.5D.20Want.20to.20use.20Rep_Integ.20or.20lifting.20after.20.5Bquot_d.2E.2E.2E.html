<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
I agree with that, although the "marketing" of proof assistants in the <br>
last 10 years or so has moved in a different direction.  Today most people <br>
think of Coq as some dependently typed functional programming language, <br>
and the Agda is emphasizing the programming aspect even more.</p>
<p>My own terminology is mainly about "formal languages" and "formalization" <br>
of any kind. For example, the formal proof language of Isar is used to <br>
write formal proofs, not to "program" nor to "implement" proofs.</p>
<p>Isabelle/ML and Isabelle/Scala happen to be programming languages just by <br>
accident, so you can use them to program things.  The Isabelle document <br>
preparation language (formal latex) also happens to be computationally <br>
complete, but nobody would say to "program" / "implement" / "code" some <br>
text for a paper or book.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the computational or non-computational aspect of languages <br>
often causes additional confusion for licensing.  E.g. see the discussion <br>
in the paper about "Licensing the Mizar Mathematical Library" <br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3212">http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3212</a></p>
<p>To my taste, the attempt to see Mizar articles as potentially <br>
computational is even more artificial for that particular proof checker.</p>

You need to be specific what you mean by "Isabelle".  Maybe Isabelle/HOL?</p>
<p>In some sense, generic "Isabelle" is a framework (or playground) for a <br>
multitude of formal languages of different use and purpose: Isabelle/ML, <br>
Isabelle/Scala, Isabelle/Pure, Isabelle/HOL, Isabelle/Isar, Isabelle/XYZ.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I want to recover the ordered pair part of an int. I actually have a <br>
simple solution like this:</p>
<p>definition myI :: "int =&gt; nat * nat" where<br>
   "myI x = (nat x, nat (-x))"</p>
<p>In the process of getting to the above definition, I was trying to get <br>
the ordered pair using lower level methods. Even though I have a <br>
solution, I ask about these other methods in case there's something <br>
useful there for me to use.</p>
<p>In Int.thy, on line 20, int is defined as a quotient_type:</p>
<p>(020) quotient_type int = "nat * nat" / "intrel"<br>
(021)   morphisms Rep_Integ Abs_Integ</p>
<p>The type of Rep_Integ is (int =&gt; (nat * nat)), so I try to use it with <br>
something like "Rep_Integ 3", but I can't ever get it to return an <br>
ordered pair like (3,0).</p>
<p>QUESTION: Is there a way for me to get "Rep_Integ 3" to return (3,0)?</p>
<p>I try to do some lifting, like on line 208:</p>
<p>(208) lift_definition of_int :: "int =&gt; 'a" is "%x(i,j). of_nat i - <br>
of_nat j"</p>
<p>However, on line 1661, there's this:</p>
<p>(1661) declare Quotient_int [quot_del]</p>
<p>In isar-ref.pdf, it tells me that's to disable lifting for int, and so I <br>
try to enable it blindly like,</p>
<p>setup_lifting Quotient_int,</p>
<p>but I get a warning, and lifting doesn't work for me.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Can I enable lifting for int?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>

<p>From: Lawrence Paulson &lt;<a href="mailto:lp15@cam.ac.uk">lp15@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
The simple answer is no. What your request is impossible. The integers are constructed as a quotient and therefore the representation of an integer is an equivalence class, in this case a set of pairs of natural numbers. The construction does not give you a map from integers to some distinguished element of this set. Of course, nothing stops you from writing your own function from integers to pairs of natural numbers.</p>
<p>Some time ago I wrote a paper on such matters, which you may find useful:</p>

<p>I guess "lifting doesn't work for me" means this:</p>
<p>Lifting failed for the following term:<br>
Term:  λ(i∷nat, j∷nat). of_nat i - of_nat j<br>
Type:  nat × nat ⇒ ?'b∷{minus,semiring_1}</p>
<p>Reason:  The type of the term cannot be instantiated to "nat × nat ⇒ <br>

<p>And this gives you a hint where the problem is:<br>
you cannot instantied 'a::type for ?'b::{minus, semiring_1}.</p>
<p>The original definition of of_int in Int.thy is done in a context ring_1.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<p>lift_definition of_int :: "int =&gt; 'a::ring_1" is "%(i,j). of_nat i - <br>

<p>Yes, by the command you used:<br>

or even better together with the reflexivity theorem:<br>

Larry,</p>
<p>Alright, your paper will be the explanatory comments to Int.thy that <br>
everyone forgot to put in. Your slides will also be useful:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Reports/equivclasses-slides.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Reports/equivclasses-slides.pdf</a> <br>

<p>I just need to match up a little of your notation in the paper with the <br>
newer Isar that's in Int.thy, and a lot of the naming is the same.</p>
<p>It'd be interesting to know if it's common these days for other <br>
languages to use the classic definition of the integers as equivalence <br>
classes like you did with Int.thy:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer#Construction">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer#Construction</a></p>
<p>It seems it's common for the natural numbers to be built using the <br>
successor function, but I'm guessing it's not so common for the integers <br>
to be equivalence classes.</p>
<p>I only need one representation of an integer, like (3,0) for 3, which I <br>
can use to tie into an equivalence class of my own, if that's the way I <br>
should do things, and it will work out.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help,<br>

<p>One thing led to another, and I did a bunch of searches, and it turns <br>
out you would be one of the two to ask for a tutorial on lifting, but <br>
I'm sure you don't have time.</p>
<p>I found this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~kuncar/documents/huffman-kuncar-itp2012.pdf">http://www4.in.tum.de/~kuncar/documents/huffman-kuncar-itp2012.pdf</a> <br>

<p>And it turns out you have connections to Josef Urban.</p>
<p>I got rid of my setup_lifting warning by importing Quotient_Product.thy, <br>
from a tip of yours here:</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2013-January/msg00127.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2013-January/msg00127.html</a></p>
<p>Now, I do setup_lifting, and the line of code you gave me works, so I'm <br>
at an error for a simple thing I want to do, which will show you that I <br>
have a fundamental misunderstanding of how to use lifting:</p>
<p>setup_lifting Quotient_int<br>
    lift_definition of_int :: "int =&gt; 'a::ring_1" is "%(i, j). of_nat i</p>
<p>- of_nat j"<br>
       by(metis int.abs_eq_iff of_int.abs_eq)</p>
<p>lift_definition foo45 :: "int =&gt; nat * nat" is "%(x,y). (nat x, nat y)"</p>
<p>The last line gives this error:</p>
<p>Lifting failed for the following types:<br>
    Raw type:  int<br>
    Abstract type:  nat<br>
    Reason:  No quotient type "Nat.nat" found.</p>
<p>But my "foo45" represents what I want, but you'll have to tell me <br>
exactly what I have to do to get something like that.</p>
<p>I've attached a screenshot which shows the four lines of code above, <br>
with the error.</p>

In my experience it is quite the other way round. The first semesters<br>
mathematics course I attended introduced the integers, the rational<br>
numbers and the real numbers as equivalence classes. Only the natural<br>

My slides briefly hint at the reason why the integers and rationals are almost invariably defined using equivalence classes and not using particular representations such as signed natural numbers or reduced fractions. It is simply that equivalence classes make everything much easier.</p>
<p>Imagine defining addition on signed natural numbers. You will need at least three cases: (1) the signs agree (2) left operand is greater (3) right operand is greater. To prove the associative law, you will have four occurrences of the addition operator and therefore 81 separate cases. With equivalence classes, there is only one case and it is shown in full on one of the slides.</p>
<p>For fractions in reduced form, the situation is even worse, because you're constantly reasoning about greatest common divisors. With equivalent classes, there is no need for that.</p>

<p>From: Ondřej Kunčar &lt;<a href="mailto:kuncar@in.tum.de">kuncar@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
The term "(nat x, nat y)" has type "int * int" and you want to lift it <br>
to a term of the type "nat * nat". That's not possible because there is <br>
not registered any such quotient (or subtype) (i.e., using integers to <br>
represent natural numbers).</p>
<p>What you probably meant (but I don't know I am just guessing your <br>
intentions), is this definition:</p>
<p>lift_definition foo45 :: "int =&gt; nat * nat" is "%(x,y). (x, y)"</p>
<p>This is type correct but you can't prove the respectfulness theorem <br>
since this theorem implies that each equivalence class in a definition <br>
of integers contains exactly one element. That's not true.</p>
<p>You need some kind of a normalization function that picks up one element <br>
for each class. For example:</p>
<p>lift_definition foo45 :: "int =&gt; nat * nat" is "%(x,y). (x - y, 0)" by auto</p>
<p>This gives you for each positive integer x a pair (x, 0) and for each <br>
negative integer (0, 0).</p>
<p>For deep understanding I recommend read the paper that Brian and I wrote <br>
about Lifting/Transfer and it is also good to know how typedef works. <br>

Johannes,</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment. I was comparing the formal, textbook <br>
construction of the integers, as in what you're listing, to concrete <br>
implementations of integers in programming languages, such as Coq, <br>
Isabelle/HOL, Haskell, or any other language, old or new, but especially <br>
new.</p>
<p>I'm speculating that this ability of Isabelle/HOL to define integers as <br>
equivalence classes is special, and that it takes a special foundation <br>
in a language to be able to do it, and that most languages don't have <br>
the foundation to be able to do it in a practical way.</p>
<p>But I wouldn't know. This is the first time I've ever delved into the <br>
low-level internals of a programming language, but defining an integer <br>
as a set, in particular as an equivalence class, seems like it requires <br>
some clever and sophisticated foundational code.</p>
<p>First, a person would simply know how it could be done at all. But <br>
that's not enough; their code would have to perform reasonably fast.</p>
<p>I wouldn't know where to begin, and I'm sure any initial discovery of <br>
mine on how to do it would be so slow, it would be useless.</p>
<p>All that to say, I'm guessing that Isabelle/HOL is pretty special in <br>
this ability to achieve a textbook definition of the integers. But I try <br>
not to become dogmatic about things I don't know about, and it could be <br>
that it's very common for programming languages to implement integers as <br>
equivalence classes.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>I was just starting to decide that under certain contexts, I could refer <br>
to Isabelle/HOL as a programming language, because it's just a lot <br>
easier to use that phrase sometimes, whereas, according to your specific <br>
clarification in the email linked to above, Isabelle/Pure and <br>
Isabelle/Isar are never to be called programming languages, so I try to <br>
use "proof language" or "source language" when referring to them, even <br>
when I know others might not get my point.</p>
<p>One of my other recent emails to the list spawned some private chatter <br>
in which I referred to HOL as a programming language, which resulted in <br>
a similar response to yours,  which paraphrased would be, "What is this <br>
programming language you're talking about in reference to HOL?"</p>
<p>That's why I had easy access to the links above, because I thought I had <br>
the perfect, authoritative reference to explain that Isabelle/HOL is a <br>
programming language, where Pure and Isar aren't.</p>
<p>In an attempt to use safe, correct vocabulary, I've resorted to using <br>
"coding language" when trying to refer to the whole Isabelle family of <br>
languages. At some point, there's a need for phrases, like, "I'm <br>
programming with Isabelle/HOL", or, "I'm coding with Isabelle". Like I <br>
say, "coding" has become my word of choice to replace "programming".</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm happy to try and use the official vocabulary correctly. <br>
There are a ton of interwined languages with Isabelle, so I give up and <br>
get lazy sometimes, and just say "programming language".</p>
<p>As to Coq, it seems to me if I can call Isabelle/HOL a programming <br>
language, then I can call Coq a programming language. That's just an <br>
aside. I'd be happy to use any official Coq vocabulary to use to refer <br>
to Coq.</p>

<p>I would not put it that way.<br>
Both Isabelle/HOL and &lt;your favourite functional programming language&gt; are<br>
based on some flavour of lambda calculus. That's the connection.<br>
However, there is no evaluation strategy specified for Isabelle/HOL terms,<br>
and several constants don't have reducible definitions.<br>
It's possible (and even common) to write uncomputable specifications in HOL<br>
whereas you can't write anything uncomputable in a programming language.</p>

You can call anything anything, but you are only complicating things for yourself. To my mind, asking why Isabelle/HOL has equivalence classes when Haskell doesn't and they are both programming languages is a bit like asking why a Boeing can fly and a Ford cannot when they are both cars.</p>
<p>Perhaps the term you are looking for is "formal language". Programming languages are formal, and higher-order logic is also a formal language. Just as Boeings and Fords are both vehicles.</p>

<p>This is one more time in which lifting appears to not be the best <br>

<p>And so I have 3 papers to pull from now, yours, Peter's and this one you <br>
just listed. All along it's been, "Something's being lifted from <br>
somewhere, to some thing, but what's being lifted is not clear to me, <br>
and neither are the restrictions on what the some thing can be."</p>
<p>It looks like Urban and Kaliszyk's paper provides a good conceptual <br>
overview. From section 5:/<br>
/</p>
<p>/The main benefit of a quotient package is to lift automatically<br>
    theorems over raw types to theorems over quotient types. We will<br>
    perform this lifting in three phases, called regularization,<br>
    injection and cleaning according to procedures in Homeier’s ML-code./</p>
<p>So I was asking myself, "What's this Homeier's ML-code?"</p>
<p>And then I replied, "Oh, that would be Peter Homeier, who sent me a link <br>
to his paper on quotients earlier in the day, in response to my global <br>
request for docs on quotients and lifting."</p>
<p>With quotients and lifting, it appears that if you learn the one, you <br>
learn the other.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Larry,</p>
<p>I was going to let your email be the end, a decision which actually <br>
resulted in me culling out every point I thought about making, except <br>
for trying to make a point with your transportation analogy.</p>
<p>To summarize the point to begin with, so you don't have to actually read <br>
the analogy, it's just a variation of my past "Isabelle is awesome" <br>
statements.</p>
<p>So Isabelle/HOL is a Boeing airplane, though a special model that's <br>
configurable, and Haskell is a Ford car.</p>
<p>In regards to transportation, it appears not to make sense for a person <br>
to make anything but the broadest of generalizations when comparing the two.</p>
<p>That's because, Isabelle, being a Boeing airplane, is certainly a means <br>
of transportation, but the maintenance and fuel costs are extraordinary, <br>
and so on the surface, to point out that Haskell, a Ford car, hasn't <br>
implemented certain theoretical, engineering concepts when Isabelle has, <br>
can appear to be dumb, especially, because practically speaking, as far <br>
as transportation the advanced features are of no use.</p>
<p>However, the proper context is my use of the special, configurable <br>
Boeing airplane. It happens to be that I have almost no interest in <br>
traveling, I only care to theorize about traveling, in particular, <br>
theorizing about air travel.</p>
<p>At this time, I don't have the money to even have the Boeing started up, <br>
but then again, at this point, I only have a need to look at the Boeing, <br>
and take a few measurements for certain parts that aren't completely <br>
documented.</p>
<p>Now, I would hope that in several years, I'm doing something more than <br>
what has already been done in regards to theorizing about air travel, to <br>
the point to where I have a need to do more than just look at the <br>
airplane, but in two years time, manufacturing costs being what they <br>
are, there's some chance it will be affordable for me to pay some per <br>
minute charge to reconfigure the special Boeing, where simply <br>
reconfiguring it should answer some question I'll have.</p>
<p>So forth and so on. As times passes, what was once not affordable <br>
becomes affordable, in regards to testing my theories. The upside is <br>
that I may never have to resort to buying a Ford car, which is <br>
accessible to the masses, but still costs a lot of money, and is a waste <br>
if I don't have to do it.</p>
<p>And there's the possibility, if I can keep postponing the need for a <br>
Ford car, that at some point, the configurable Boeing has ceased to be <br>
leading edge technology, for near exclusive use by academics and <br>
researchers, but the costs have dropped so much that it has become <br>
commodity technology, and things have evolved for me to the where I now <br>
have a need to travel, but not simply on the ground, like with the Ford <br>
car, but in the air.</p>
<p>Do the designers intend for a person like me to use the Boeing in this <br>
way? Probably not. Most likely, the configurable Boeing is meant as an <br>
ends to a mean for professionals who work in the aerospace industry.</p>
<p>But instead of of using the configurable Boeing as an ends to a means, I <br>
use it as an ends in itself, and because it can be used like that, it's <br>
awesome.</p>
<p>Well, because I have no desire to ever work outside the realm of the <br>
configurable Boeing, certain vocabulary doesn't fit my use of the Boeing <br>
as good as it fits the designers use, but that idea is not to be pursued <br>
here.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
