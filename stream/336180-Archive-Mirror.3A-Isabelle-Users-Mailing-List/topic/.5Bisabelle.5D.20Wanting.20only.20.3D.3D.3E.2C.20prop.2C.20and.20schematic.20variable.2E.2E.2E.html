Hi,</p>
<p>I put this up in case someone wants to add to what I've learned.</p>
<p>Attached is a THY and PDF of my exercise. The PDF shows my efforts to <br>
make a printout self-contained. The numbered links take you to a theorem <br>
summary, which has a bibliography link with a line number, which takes <br>
you to the bibliography entry, which links to a Mercurial source file <br>
with line numbers.</p>
<p>Being positively influenced by the concept of sequents, though only just <br>
starting to dive into sequents, I saw that there is turnstile, which is <br>
used as the meta-language symbol to give meaning to everything else.</p>
<p>There is then the meta-object symbol ==&gt;, and wanting life to be simple, <br>
I wanted to say that it is ==&gt; that gives meaning to everything else. <br>
However, willing for life to be more complex, I decided that at the <br>
blackbox-in and blackbox-out levels, there is only prop, schematic <br>
variables, and ==&gt;.</p>
<p>The blackbox-in level is</p>
<p>theorem foo "..."</p>
<p>with Trueprop coercion unhidden, and the blackbox-out level is</p>
<p>thm foo</p>
<p>with Trueprop coercion unhidden, and you can't blame me for wanting only <br>
prop, schematic variables, and ==&gt;, when that's all I've seen for months <br>
at the blackbox level.</p>
<p>In drule.ML, I stumbled on "equal_intr_rule", which expresses meta-logic <br>
\&lt;equiv&gt; in terms of ==&gt;. I also saw "triv_forall_equality", and in <br>
logical haste, I decided that by proving a theorem that uses \&lt;And&gt; and <br>
\&lt;equiv&gt;, and using only "equal_intr_rule", that would allow me to take <br>
the perspective that at the blackbox level, it is ==&gt; that gives <br>
meaning, rather than  \&lt;And&gt; and \&lt;equiv&gt;, where the function arrow <br>
operator was far from my mind, though surely it's at a lower level anyway.</p>
<p>The theorem I chose was "atomize_all", but I hit a snag, which was <br>
fortunate. I set up the assumptions correctly for "equal_intr_rule", but <br>
"rule" didn't use them to prove "atomize_all" in one step, so I resorted <br>
to "simp" to do parts of the proof.</p>
<p>The main value of the exercise was in seeing that the simplifier was <br>
creating rewrite rules from the assumptions, so it gave new meaning to <br>
those mysterious 'Adding rewrite rule "??.unknown"' statements.</p>
<p>What I was looking for was evidence that \&lt;And&gt; and \&lt;equiv&gt; operate <br>
independently from ==&gt;, so that they all have to be considered <br>
fundamental. Looking at the simp trace kind of gave me that evidence, <br>
but someone can correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>Also, when "rule" didn't use the assumptions I gave it, it then made <br>
goals based on "equal_intr_rule". But it didn't do an exact <br>
instantiation. \&lt;And&gt; is used in the conclusion of "atomize_all", so <br>
"rule" made some decisions, and did some rearranging of the use of <br>
\&lt;And&gt; before it printed the goals, which indicates to me that it's <br>
fundamental.</p>
<p>I'm a little closer to being able to eventually describe how ==&gt;, <br>
\&lt;And&gt;, and \&lt;equiv&gt; all fit in at the meta-logic level.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB<br>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
It's not exactly all there, but starting on page 27 of isar-ref.pdf, <br>
there is section "2.1 The Pure Framework", in which a brief explanation <br>
of the four meta-logic symbols is given, where the four symbols are =&gt;, <br>
\&lt;And&gt;, \&lt;equiv&gt;, and ==&gt;. It pays to look at things 4 or 5 times, at least.</p>
<p>In particular, on page 28, it says, "Logical statements are composed via <br>
\&lt;And&gt;x::alpha. B(x) and A ==&gt; B." It then goes on to define some rules <br>
for \&lt;And&gt; and ==&gt; using sequents.</p>
<p>That's important because there is the section  "Simulating sequents by <br>
natural deduction" on page 203 which talks about expressing a form of <br>
sequents using the ==&gt; symbol.</p>
<p>You put those sections together, and you might be able to figure how to <br>
use ==&gt; to have a form of sequents in Isabelle/HOL where ==&gt; is <br>
considered the fundamental symbol for the sequents, and figure out how <br>
to do it without abusing conventional standards too much.</p>
<p>You might call them isa-sequents. If you abuse things unintentionally, <br>
an isa-sequent is whatever  you define it be anyway.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>
