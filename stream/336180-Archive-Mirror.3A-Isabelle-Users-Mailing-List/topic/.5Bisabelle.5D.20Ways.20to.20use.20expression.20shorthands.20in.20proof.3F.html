Hi people out there,</p>
<p>Sorry for an other rather beginner's question, but here is: I favor  <br>
explicit proof over automated one, except for some simplifications group.  <br>
That works, but this often lead to repeated subexpressions in multiple  <br>
“have”, and that bloats the proof text, which in turn, does not help  <br>
readability. I wondered if there is a way to have shorthands for common  <br>
expression appearing at multiple places. I tried with a “def E ≡  <br>
"my-expression"” and then an “have "blah E blah"”, but it does not work,  <br>
seems E is not replaced with the corresponding expression as I expected,  <br>
and proofs by simp which succeed with the literal subexpression, fails  <br>
when I replace the literal subexpression with E. I also tried a naive  <br>
“write "my-expression" ("E")”, but that's even worse, Isabelle complains  <br>
the expression is an unknown constant.</p>
<p>You see that's not a question about proving, but a question about style in  <br>
writing proofs.</p>
<p>I have another in the same vein, for which I don't wish to open a new  <br>
thread. I don't know about LaTex, and wondered if there a way, to do the  <br>
same with plain text comments. That is, I would write a comment somewhere,  <br>
and either include it at another place or else add a reference to it from  <br>
that other place.</p>
<p>I may also have a question about the different way to invoke the  <br>
simplifier, but I leave that for later; that's enough for that thread.</p>
<p>Have a nice day all</p>

<p>From: Brian Huffman &lt;<a href="mailto:huffman@in.tum.de">huffman@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
When you use "def E == expression", the definition of E must be<br>
unfolded explicity (using something like "apply (simp add: E_def)" or<br>
"unfolding E_def").</p>
<p>The alternative is to use "let" to define a new schematic variable:<br>
"let ?E = expression". Then "?E" is really just an input abbreviation,<br>
no explicit unfolding necessary.</p>

Yannick,</p>
<p>Brian already answered your question, which is good information for me <br>
also, but for myself, I worked up how to use "abbreviation" to <br>
abbreviate a formula, which is probably not best for your situation, but <br>
which may come in handy for me, though I notice that in prog-prove.pdf, <br>
it tells me that abbreviations should be used sparingly.</p>

<p>For an interesting discussion of an explicit proof example using <br>
introduction and elimination rules, scroll down to Wenzel's PhD thesis <br>
on the page below, and have a look at pages 77 to 92 where he takes a <br>
simple example and starts with a very abbreviated form and keeps <br>
expanding it into more explicit forms.</p>

<p>Here's what I get with a simple example:</p>
<p>theory z0_i_Scratch imports Main begin<br>
typedecl sT<br>
consts inS::"sT =&gt; sT =&gt; bool" (infixl "IN" 55)<br>
consts emS::sT<br>
axiomatization where<br>
   eeA_that_would_have_hard_to_type_name: "!x. ~(x IN emS)"<br>
lemma eeA_ASCI_name1: "!x. ~(x IN emS)"<br>
   by(metis eeA_that_would_have_hard_to_type_name)<br>
abbreviation<br>
   eeA_exp_name::"bool" where "eeA_exp_name == (!x. ~(x IN emS))"<br>
lemma eeA_ASCI_name2: "!x. ~(x IN emS)"<br>
   by(metis eeA_ASCI_name1)<br>
end</p>
<p>When I put the cursor at "eeA_ASCI_name2" in the output panel, "(!x. ¬(x <br>
IN emS))" gets replaced with "eeA_exp_name", unlike at "eeA_ASCI_name1".</p>
<p>As far as getting something like "(!x. ¬(x IN emS))" replaced with <br>
another formula (that's not a named identifier), I don't know about that.</p>
<p>Abbreviation is syntactic sugar (page 14 of prog-prove.pdf).</p>

<p>I guess you're talking about defining a "macro command" as in Latex, and <br>
then using the macro, where it gets expanded when the PDF document is built.</p>
<p>That would be the use of antiquotations inside of "text{<em>...</em>}", <br>
"section{<em>...</em>}", etc., and lots of other places; I don't use <br>
antiquotations yet. Learning the details of how to use antiquotations <br>
would be on the level of learning how to use Latex, but if you were <br>
going to learn one first, then you'd probably want to learn <br>
antiquotations first (page 64 isar-ref.pdf).</p>
<p>What you eventually end up doing is using antiquotations with Latex; <br>
Isabelle uses Latex rather than duplicate it.</p>
<p>Whether or not you take advantage of additional Latex commands, if you <br>
specify the document to be built with something like "usedir", Latex is <br>
used to create the PDF.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

Currently on the page 77 you mentioned, looking at “is” and “concl is”.  <br>
Looks even shorter and straighter than using “let”. That's what I like  <br>
with my discovery of Isabelle: as I go, I understand it's intentionally  <br>
designed to author concise and readable proof, and to balance both  <br>
(conciseness and verbosity) as you see fits.</p>

The page 77 you're talking about is the absolute page number, which <br>
would be the printed page number of 63.</p>
<p>The example I'm talking about is sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4, printed page <br>
numbers 77 to 92.</p>
<p>It goes to show that there are lots more examples and explanations in <br>
that document on Isar. For each keyword described in Wenzel's document, <br>
if you look the keyword up in isar-ref.pdf, then you learn even more.</p>

<p>From: "Yannick Duchêne (Hibou57 )" &lt;<a href="mailto:yannick_duchene@yahoo.fr">yannick_duchene@yahoo.fr</a>&gt;<br>
I finally go with both Brian's suggestion to use “let” and Markus's thesis  <br>
suggestion to use “"…" (is "…")”. I ended to the test files attached to  <br>
that message. Please note that's nothing exiting, just intended to  <br>
beginners like me, and to be opened to comments (comments are easier on  <br>
simple things). It's based on something from a function tutorial in  <br>
Isabelle's documentation directory. I'm not so much happy with the PDF  <br>
rendering, but I don't know enough about (La)Tex, that may be the reason  <br>
why (I also wonder why the document weight more than expected, but that's  <br>
another story).</p>
<p>Thanks for your tips, to both of you<br>
