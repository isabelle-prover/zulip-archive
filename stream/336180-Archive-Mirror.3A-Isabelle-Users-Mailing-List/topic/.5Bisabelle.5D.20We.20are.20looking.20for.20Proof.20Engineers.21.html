<p>Data61 Seeking Proof Engineers<br>
==============================<br>
(applications close 15 October 2015)<br>
<a href="http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/jobs/proof-engineers2015">http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/jobs/proof-engineers2015</a></p>
<p>If only there was a place where I could prove theorems for money, change the<br>
world, and have fun while doing it...</p>
<p>Sounds too good to exist?</p>
<p>In the Trustworthy Systems team at Data61, formerly known as NICTA, that's<br>
what we do for a living. We are the creators of seL4, the world's first fully<br>
formally verified operating system kernel with extreme performance and strong<br>
security &amp; correctness proofs. Our highly international team is located on<br>
the UNSW campus, close to the beautiful beaches of sunny Sydney, Australia,<br>
one of the world's most liveable cities.</p>
<p>We are looking for multiple motivated entry-level proof engineers who want to<br>
join our team, move things forward, and have global impact. We are expanding<br>
our team, because seL4 is going places. There are active projects around the<br>
world in</p>
<p>- Automotive - because cars have been hacked enough<br>
  - Aviation - for more security and safety for autonomous vehicles<br>
  - Connected consumer devices - with security built in from the start<br>
  - SCADA - for more secure intelligent industrial control automation<br>
  - Spaceflight, autonomous and crewed - because awesome</p>
<p>To make these projects successful, we need to scale formal verification.<br>
You would</p>
<p>- work on industrial-scale formal proofs in Isabelle/HOL<br>
  - help to extend and improve existing proofs or verify new features in seL4<br>
  - contribute to improved proof automation and better reasoning techniques<br>
  - apply formal proof to real-world systems and tools</p>
<p>To apply for this position, you should possess a significant subset of the<br>
following skills.</p>
<p>- functional programming in a language like Haskell, ML, or OCaml<br>
  - first-order or higher-order formal logic<br>
  - basic experience in C<br>
  - ability and desire to quickly learn new techniques<br>
  - undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, or similar<br>
  - ability and desire to work in a larger team</p>
<p>If you additionally have experience</p>
<p>- in software verification with an interactive theorem prover such as<br>
    Isabelle/HOL or Coq, and/or</p>
<p>- with operating systems and microkernels</p>
<p>you should definitely apply!</p>
<p>If you have the right skills and background, we can provide training on the job.<br>
Continual learning is a central component of everything we do. You will work<br>
with a unique world-leading combination of OS and formal methods experts,<br>
students at undergraduate and PhD level, engineers, and researchers from 5<br>
continents, speaking over 15 languages. Trustworthy Systems is a fun,<br>
creative, and welcoming workplace with full health insurance and flexible<br>
hours &amp; work arrangements.</p>
<p>We value diversity in all forms and welcome applications from people<br>
of all ages, including people with a disability, and those who identify as<br>
LGBTIQ. See <a href="http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/diversity/">http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/diversity/</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The salary range for this position is AUD 65,000 to 90,000 for recent<br>
graduates, depending on experience and qualification.</p>
<p>Apply by sending your CV, undergraduate transcript (if applicable), two<br>
references, and cover letter to &lt;<a href="mailto:gerwin.klein@nicta.com.au">gerwin.klein@nicta.com.au</a>&gt; and<br>
&lt;<a href="mailto:june.andronick@nicta.com.au">june.andronick@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>This round of applications closes 15 October 2015.</p>
