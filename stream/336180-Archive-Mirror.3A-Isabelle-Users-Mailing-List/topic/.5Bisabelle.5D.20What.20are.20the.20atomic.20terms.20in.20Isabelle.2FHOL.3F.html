<p>From: <a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a><br>
I'm looking at this sentence in prog-prove.pdf, page 3:</p>
<p>Terms are formed as in functional programming by applying<br>
     functions to arguments. If f is a function of type<br>
     tau1 =&gt; tau2 and t is a term of type tau1, then f t<br>
     is a term of type tau2.</p>
<p>Also, the word "contain" in this sentence on page 4 makes me unsure of <br>
what a term is:</p>
<p>Terms may also contain lambda-abstractions.</p>
<p>I've looked for other definitions of "term" in the Isabelle docs, but <br>
I'm not sure how constants and variables are used as a part of the <br>
definition of "term".</p>
<p>Here are three questions I've asked myself, with my answers in <br>
parentheses. You can correct them if you'd like:</p>
<p>1) Does a term (of Isabelle/HOL) have a type?  (obviously yes)<br>
2) Is a term (of Isabelle/HOL) a type? (no)<br>
3) Is a type (of Isabelle/HOL) a term? (no)</p>
<p>I'm guessing that one difference between a term and a type is related to <br>
constants.</p>
<p>I briefly looked at "3.2.5 Types and terms" in isar-ref.pdf, but I can't <br>
sort that out.</p>
<p>In intro.pdf (Old Introduction to Isabelle), page 1, it says:</p>
<p>The syntax for terms is summarised below...<br>
     t :: tau       type constraint, on a term or bound variable<br>
     %x . t         abstraction<br>
     %x1...xn . t   curried abstraction, %x1...%xn . t<br>
     t(u)           application<br>
     t(u1,...,un)   curried application, t(u1) ... (un)</p>
<p>This indicates that a lambda-abstraction can be a term.</p>
<p>In Paulson's "Logic and Computation - Interactive proof with Cambridge <br>
LCF", in "Chapter 5 Syntactic Operations for PP-Lambda", page 142, he says:</p>
<p>Terms come in four syntactic classes: constants, variables,<br>
     abstractions, and combinations (function applications).</p>
<p>This is like a lambda-calculus term, so it looks as if Isabelle/HOL <br>
terms may not be limited to function application, but I tend to take <br>
things literally, so when prog-prove.pdf says, "Terms are formed as in <br>
functional programming by applying functions to arguments", that makes <br>
me wonder whether a term is only function application.</p>
<p>I'll ask two more questions, in case someone wants to answer them:</p>
<p>1) Is a term (in Isabelle/HOL) function application only? (probably not)<br>
2) To what extent do the concepts in "Part II Cambridge LCF" of <br>
Paulson's "Logic and Computation" apply to Isabelle/HOL?</p>
<p>Part I chapters 2, 3, and 4 of "Logic and Computation" look like <br>
something I need to work through for foundational material on HOL.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>

<p>A little, but not much.  Type classes are just predicates over types plus <br>

<p>Yes, the Isabelle/Pure framework clearly distinguishes 3 main categories <br>

with references to the corresponding ML functions.  Section 2.3.2 is <br>
particularly funny: it shows some tricks to mix the different kinds of <br>

Isabelle's terms are lambda-terms with a type system similar to that of LCF, ML<br>
or Haskell. The document Programming and Proving in Isabelle is an introduction<br>
to Isabelle, not a definition. Just like most textbooks on functional<br>
programming it does not start out with the lambda-calculus on page 1.</p>

Tobias,</p>
<p>Thanks. I'm trying to get the vocabulary down.</p>
<p>Unless you tell me different, I'll conclude that term constants and term <br>
variables are different than type constants and type variables, though <br>
there might not be such a thing as a "type constant". I see (morely <br>
clearly now) that you did precede the introduction of "terms" with <br>
introducing "base types", "type constructors", "function types", and <br>
"type variables", though I see no "type constant".</p>
<p>The standard lambda-term definition is straight forward enough, but the <br>
type definition is a little more slippery. Hindley's "Basic Simple Type <br>
Theory" says:</p>
<p>2A1 Definition (Types): An infinite sequence of type-variables is<br>
      assumed to be given, distinct from term-variables. Types are...<br>
      (i) each type-variable is a type (called an atom)</p>
<p>Somehow, "distinct from term-variables" escaped my attention. Still, <br>
there's only mention of type variables. I should have also looked at <br>
Hindley's "Lambda-Calculus and Combinators":</p>
<p>Definition 10.1 (Simple types): Assume we have a finite or infinite<br>
      sequence of symbols called atomic types; then...<br>
      (a) every atomic type is a type;</p>
<p>"Atomic type" is sufficiently vague to allow for "type constants", and <br>
all sorts of other atomic types.</p>
<p>By all this it now seems clear to me that atomic types are distinct from <br>
atomic terms.</p>

<p>Correct.</p>

<p>No, there are type constants. They are also known as "type operators".<br>

<p>Indeed all types, atomic or not, are distinct from all terms, atomic or<br>

There are other type theories where this is not true, but again you haven't<br>

By my reckoning "atomic types" should just be type variables, and possibly<br>
also the type constants with arity 0.</p>

<p>From: <a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a><br>
Ramana,</p>
<p>Your HOL4-centric clarification of "types" and "terms" reminded me of <br>
your suggestion to Bill, in the thread "rigorous axiomatic geometry...", <br>
that he should look at the HOL4 document titled "The HOL System Logic".</p>
<p><a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/documentation.html">http://hol.sourceforge.net/documentation.html</a></p>
<p>I've had the main HOL4 manuals on my hard drive for months, but I forgot <br>
about using them as a general source of information on HOL.</p>
<p>The three BNF grammars for "types" and "terms" on pages 10 and 15 also <br>
fall under the "Dude, this is awesome" category, along with your <br>
clarifications, and the detailed explanations in the manual, which I'll <br>
eventually study.</p>
<p>Collectively, the Isabelle docs, HOL4 docs, and related textbooks are <br>
awesome. A lot of theorem assistants don't have enough documentation to <br>
get people over the barrier to entry.</p>
<p>Still, because the books are spread around that give a foundational <br>
understanding of what Isabelle/HOL is, it can make it hard to know where <br>
to start. But that's other people's problem. I think I have a basic grip <br>
on what it is now, and how to learn about it. And in understanding <br>
Isabelle/HOL, I should get an understanding of how to reinvent whatever <br>
object-language-wheel I want to on top of it.</p>
<p>Two books I would add to my previous list are these:</p>
<p>"The HOL System LOGIC", HOL4 Documentation<br>
<a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/documentation.html">http://hol.sourceforge.net/documentation.html</a></p>
<p>"Logic and Computation: Interactive Proof with Cambridge LCF",<br>
     by Lawrence Paulson (Amazon)</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarifications.</p>

<p>So the atomic types are type variables and type constructors of arity 0. <br>
I guess.</p>
<p>The HOL4 terminology in the HOL4 logic manual is not the perfect goto <br>

<p>It turns out that it's the opposite, that "type constants" is a synonym <br>
for "type constructors". Synonyms being what they are, that's not a <br>
problem.</p>

<p>The list doesn't appear to be overly concerned with enforcing correct <br>
