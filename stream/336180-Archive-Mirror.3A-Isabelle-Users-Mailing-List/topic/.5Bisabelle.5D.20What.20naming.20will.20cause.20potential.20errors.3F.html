<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>On the developer's list I saw some discussion about problems that naming <br>
can cause.</p>
<p>If possible, I'd like to know what naming conventions I "have to" follow <br>
to prevent future, potential errors due to naming.</p>
<p>I looked at the implementation manual:</p>
<p><a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013/dist/Isabelle2013/doc/implementation.pdf">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013/dist/Isabelle2013/doc/implementation.pdf</a></p>
<p>Naming conventions for ML are spelled out some on page 3, "0.1.2 Naming <br>
conventions". I'm not using ML, so I'm only concerned with Isar naming, <br>
and it wasn't obvious to me that any hard rules exists, such as in <br>
section "Names", page 46.</p>
<p>I'll take two specific cases, theory names and theorem names.</p>
<p>I was naming my theory with lowercase first letter. I have now changed <br>
the first letter to uppercase, since it's a minor thing, and I have this <br>
hunch that somewhere, there's a need for fully qualified names to abide <br>
by that.</p>
<p>For theorem names, I name many theorems starting with uppercase, which <br>
seems to be contrary to the convention in the HOL sources.</p>
<p>I have good reason to do this, because I care more about following <br>
mathematical notation conventions than following Isabelle coding <br>
conventions.</p>
<p>However, if someone tells me that my naming scheme will potentially <br>
cause errors, rather than just annoy people, I am more than ready to <br>
give preference to any naming convention that "must be" followed to <br>
prevent potential errors.</p>
<p>But I don't want to change my naming scheme without knowing what the <br>
rules are because there are lots of different objects, in particular, in <br>
addition to theorem names, there are locales, classes, and sublocales, <br>
which I see that I may need now.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what Isar naming conventions "must be" followed to <br>
prevent potential errors?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
GB</p>

There is nothing you "have to" follow.  Naming conventions are a matter to <br>
keep things simple at very little cost -- they belong to "best practices".</p>
<p>Observing certain customs routinely saves a lot of energy to rethink and <br>
reconsider things over and over again.  Sometimes this has to be done, <br>
nonethrless: e.g. for Isabelle/Scala I've re-used many Isabelle/ML <br>
conventions at the cost of violating other conventions on the Java Virtual <br>
Machine, and Scala itself tends towards very mixed ways of writing.  I had <br>
to spend extra time to study history, manuals, websites to ensure that no <br>
bad consequences are coming from Graph.is_minimal in both Isabelle/ML and <br>
Isabelle/Scala, and not Graph.is_minimal here and Graph.isMinimal there <br>
(IAmNotGoingIntoDetailsWhyCamelCaseIsNotUsedInOurTradition).</p>
<p>Anyway, the mail thread you mention was initiated by the surprise that <br>
using a lower-case theory name in Isabelle/HOL makes the Haskell code <br>
generator fail due to resulting lower-case module name, which Haskell <br>
rejects.</p>
<p>Theory names in Isabelle have a long-standing naming tradition: capital <br>
words (usually in singular), separated by underscore.</p>
<p>Example (good): Vector_Space.</p>
<p>Counter-examples (bad): Vector_Spaces, VectorSpaces, vectorSpaces, <br>
vectorspace etc.</p>
<p>Many years ago, theory names were als very short, since users had to <br>
repeat typing use_thy invocations a lot on the TTY, but has changed a lot <br>
with the introduction of Proof General in 1998.  Today there is nothing <br>
special saying outright what you mean with theory Boolean_Algebra, which <br>
former generations would have squeezed that towards 8 or 5 characters.</p>
<p>The majority of material within a theory body uses lower case names (also <br>
separate by underscore).  Some special situation have capitalized or <br>
all-caps names, e.g. "max", "Max", "MAX" for certain families of <br>
operations.</p>
<p>Locale names are within a theory body, and thus lower-case.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>theory Vector_Space<br>
   imports Main<br>
   begin</p>
<p>locale vector_space = ...<br>
   begin</p>
<p>definition "foo = ..."</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>This produces fully qualified names like</p>
<p><a href="http://Vector_Space.vector_space.foo">Vector_Space.vector_space.foo</a></p>
<p>with name space accesses like</p>
<p><a href="http://Vector_Space.foo">Vector_Space.foo</a>   -- "global access"<br>
<a href="http://vector_space.foo">vector_space.foo</a>   -- "local access"</p>
<p>That is the basic observation from 1999, when locales were first <br>
introduced.  Further complexity has piled up since then, but the basic <br>
advantage of having access to two important hierary levels is still there <br>
-- by convention, not by special machinery that would introduce extra <br>
complexity.</p>
<p>You do get overlaps in certain more complex cases nonetheless, but the <br>
convention is somewhat better off than doing it just arbitrarily.</p>

<p>In some sense the "coding" conventioned deviated by accident (or on <br>
purpose) from what you often see in informal "prose" text, but I would <br>
consider this an improvement.  We are not writing for the New York Times <br>
here.</p>
<p>Isabelle sources are coming from certain free-world Unixoid background <br>
where lowercase is preferred.  The ancient empire of IBM had enforced <br>
all-caps variable names, and the advent of proper lowercase in ASCII was a <br>
great relieve (together with the invention of the underscore as formal <br>
separator).</p>
<p>I did not invent these conventions, but I do think that lower-case is <br>
better for the mass of text.  Incidently, Coq prefers capital names and <br>
keywords by default, and just last year some hard-core Coq users pointed <br>
this out as historical accident: it causes a lot of pain to press SHIFT so <br>
often, especially in Proof General.  The proposed solution was then to use <br>
vi keyboard mapping for Emacs.  (If this is madness, there is method in <br>
it.)</p>
<p>Note that I normally don't argue about the ease of <em>writing</em> the sources, <br>
since ease of <em>reading</em> has the prime priority.  This is why the <br>
underscore is important to separate words, and lower-case helps the <br>
Western brain to gloss quickly over large bodies of text (this is why the <br>
scribes of Charlemagne invented the miniscules).  Uppercase still has its <br>
role in situations of special emphasis, e.g. "max", "Max", "MAX", but it <br>
would loose that benefit if it were used by default.</p>
<blockquote>

errors, rather than just annoy people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Annoyance only starts when people try to combine several independent <br>
theory libraries into bigger coherent applications.</p>
<p>Until recently, hardly anything was done in this respect, apart from the <br>
main libraries that are shipped with Isabelle (main HOL and HOL/Library). <br>
I am pleased to see that in recent years, some AFP articles have started <br>
to aggregate, and build up beginnings of modest dependency structures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I don't want to change my naming scheme without knowing what the <br>
rules are because there are lots of different objects, in particular, in <br>
addition to theorem names, there are locales, classes, and sublocales, <br>
which I see that I may need now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a general principle in Isabelle, "different objects" don't differ in <br>
the naming convention, but make them coincide as far as sensible, even <br>
with the actual names.  Each category of a separate name space, so you <br>
normally you don't have a dog "foo_dog", cat "foo_cat", mouse "foo_mouse", <br>
but dog "foo", cat "foo", mouse "foo".</p>
<p>In practice, this could mean class "nat", type "nat", const "nat", theorem <br>
"nat". Fine points need to be observed when different categories appear in <br>
clusters: lets say some type "nat" and some const "nat" that both produce <br>
some theorem "nat.induct", which would then clash in the common theorem <br>
name space.</p>

<p>Thanks for the lengthy reply. I'll take your word that I can name <br>
identifiers in any way that the prover engine will accept when I'm <br>

<p>I've put some effort into coming with a naming scheme, mainly for the <br>

that comes back to haunt me.</p>

Your statement, "Note that I normally don't argue about the ease of <br>
<em>writing</em> the sources, since ease of <em>reading</em> has the prime priority", <br>
is usefully quotable. For one to be opinionated about a topic can many <br>
times result in one being perceived as presumptuous, whereas one being <br>
opinionated about the same topic, while also providing a quote from <br>
someone with good, establishment credentials, can, instead, result in <br>
putting others on the defense.</p>
<p>I had already "primarily" adopted your non-use of camel case, but the <br>
other half to readability is the line length of code, and standard <br>
mathematical notation demonstrates how much information you can get on <br>
one line, where, other than the graphical symbols, it's mainly because <br>
of the use of single letters, or single subscripted letters.</p>
<p>I do, though, use a little bit of camel case, so today, I've made me a <br>
rule about that. The rule is that I only use camel case to separate <br>
characters or cryptic sequences of characters, or characters acting as a <br>
prefix or suffix to words.</p>
<p>For example, I'm naming my operators like inP, ssO, eqO, xeO, geU, geI, <br>
and so forth. And then I also have a name for the same operators with <br>
names something like P\&lt;^isub&gt;I\&lt;^isub&gt;n, where part of the reasoning of <br>
both styles of names is to try and prevent global names clashes with the <br>
HOL sources, and what names other people are using. My use of a name <br>
P\&lt;^isub&gt;I\&lt;^isub&gt;n then requires sometimes that a theorem name will <br>
start with P\&lt;^isub&gt;I\&lt;^isub&gt;n.</p>
<p>What I've said about my naming is still tied into my original question <br>
for this thread. First, I want to know what the rules are (which you've <br>
already answered). It's best to stay with community convention if <br>
breaking convention will cause problems down the road.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>I don't think you have to be paranoid, as long as you stay somewhere in <br>
the middle ground what you normally see in public Isabelle applications.</p>
<p>Concerning enforcement of rules, there has been a slight tendency over the <br>
years to become more strict: tell more explicitly via errors or warnings <br>
instead of just writing manuals about the system.  It is always a long and <br>
tedious process to do so, since one first needs to pin down the rules <br>
precisely, implement them, update existing applications accordingly, and <br>
finally handle seasoned users who argue differently.</p>

<p>It is hard to tell where "internal" ends and "external" starts.  The <br>
Isabelle/HOL code generator for Haskell is part of the standard Isabelle <br>
disctibution, and used routinely in many applications.</p>
<p>Another example is the file-system: Is that internal or external to the <br>
prover?  A theory called "\&lt;A&gt;\&lt;^isub&gt;1" won't work for relatively obvious <br>
reasons; one called "Aux" is less obvious -- it used to work in <br>
Isabelle2012 due to Cygwin, but the Scala/JVM build system now insists in <br>
Windows/MS-DOS conformity.  Further uncertainty is introduced routinely <br>
due to case-insensitive file-systems.</p>
<p>Note that Isabelle/jEdit has its own way to manage files for the prover, <br>
so there are subtle differences to someone used to Proof General.</p>

<p>This can always happen.  Theory developments being used by others will <br>
have to be refined and smoothened.  A similar smoothening effect happens <br>
to user applications after more than 3 updates of the underlying Isabelle <br>
version -- I think you have noticed this already :-)</p>
