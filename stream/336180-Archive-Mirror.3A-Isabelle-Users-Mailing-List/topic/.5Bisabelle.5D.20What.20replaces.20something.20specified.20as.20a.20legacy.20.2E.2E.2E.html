<p>From: "W. Douglas Maurer" &lt;<a href="mailto:maurer@gwu.edu">maurer@gwu.edu</a>&gt;<br>
I am trying to formalize the usual rule about checking whether a list <br>
is sorted by checking only adjacent elements of the list. So if t is <br>
an int list with no duplicate elements, then in order to show that t <br>
! i &lt; t ! j for all i &lt; j in range, it is enough to show that t ! i &lt; <br>
t ! (i+1) for all i in range (other than the end of t, where t ! <br>
(i+1) is not defined). I wanted to formalize this with fixes, <br>
assumes, and shows, and so I started out by writing lemma fixes "t :: <br>
int list"; and I got an error message reading Legacy feature! Bad <br>
name binding: "t :: int list". Well, if I understand the term "legacy <br>
feature," this is something that used to work, in older versions of <br>
Isabelle, so I must have learned it while using an older version. By <br>
experimentation I was able to get this to work by taking the "t :: " <br>
outside the double quotes, like this: lemma fixes t :: "int list" . <br>
But this raises a larger question: When features are taken out of <br>
Isabelle n in producing Isabelle n+1, is there a list of such <br>
features, somewhere, together with what they are replaced by? I don't <br>
want to teach my students something that no longer works, even if it <br>
used to work. I'm particularly interested in seeing such a list for <br>
Isabelle2015, when that comes out. -WDMaurer</p>
