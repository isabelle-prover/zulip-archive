Hi people,</p>
<p>I hope my question won't look too much stupid to logics gurus.</p>
<p>Reading at Wikipedia's page about HOL, something tackled me a bit:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_logic">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_logic</a></p>
<p>“HOL with standard semantics is more expressive than first-order logic.<br>
     For example, HOL admits categorical axiomatizations of the natural<br>
     numbers, and of the real numbers, which are impossible with first-order<br>
     logic. However, by a result of Gödel, HOL with standard semantics does<br>
     not admit an effective, sound and complete proof calculus.”</p>
<p>There's also a criticism section on the same page.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not sure to understand what it really means and would like to  <br>
know if there are good pointers to understand how and when difference  <br>
between HOL and FOL matters, and when and how Isabelle has to do with it.  <br>
The quote from Wikipedia looks weird to me, as it seems to say they may be  <br>
soundness issue with HOL? Is that really it? I've never heard about any  <br>
such assertion before…</p>

<p>From: Ramana Kumar &lt;<a href="mailto:rk436@cam.ac.uk">rk436@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
The Wikipedia article is referring to the fact that there will always be<br>
true statements in HOL that are not the conclusion of any derivation in a<br>
proof calculus.<br>
(This can be contrasted with FOL: there is a sound proof calculus for FOL<br>
with the property that every true FOL statement can be proved in it.)<br>
(The problem in HOL, as I understand it, is that there are too many true<br>
statements, more than could be all the conclusions from a proof calculus.)</p>
<p>It does not say that there cannot be a sound proof calculus for HOL.<br>
Indeed, we think Isabelle/HOL implements one such calculus.</p>
<p>As for how to learn this stuff... I'm sure someone on list will be able to<br>
recommend a good textbook.<br>
Personally I think Wikipedia is OK, but you have to be patient and willing<br>
to read carefully and follow links... and sometimes it may be wrong, so<br>
discussing with others helps :)</p>

<p>Yannick,</p>
<p>I collect books written by the logic gurus, and occasionally read the <br>
introductions, so I am qualified to provide links to books.</p>
<p>The standard text that keeps getting mentioned by the logic gurus here <br>
is Andrews' text, which starts with propositional logic and FOL, and <br>
then covers type theory, where types would be the beginning of the <br>
foundation of HOL in general:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Mathematical-Logic-Type-Theory/dp/1402007639">http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Mathematical-Logic-Type-Theory/dp/1402007639</a></p>
<p>FOL begins with the standard logic operators as its primitives, or a few <br>
of them from which the others can be derived, as shown by Definitions <br>
5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 of Bilaniuk's book:</p>
<p><a href="http://euclid.trentu.ca/math/sb/pcml/">http://euclid.trentu.ca/math/sb/pcml/</a></p>
<p>FOL is reasonably fixed in stone and standardized.</p>
<p>HOL begins with variables, functions, and function application as <br>
primitives, as shown by Paulson's "Foundations of Functional <br>
Programming" Definition 1, page 2:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Notes/Founds-FP.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Notes/Founds-FP.pdf</a></p>
<p>From there (or somewhere else) HOL diverges, where the two biggest <br>
camps would be Coq's higher-order logic, and the HOL family, where HOL <br>
is not to be confused with the general phrase "higher-order logic", and <br>
where John Harrison gives a diagram showing the HOL family of products <br>
on page 9 of "HOL Light Tutorial":</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/tutorial_220.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/tutorial_220.pdf</a></p>
<p>Alfio recently pointed me to "Introduction to Type Theory" by Geuvers <br>
which makes comparisons between type theory and set theory:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/PUBS/IntroTT-improved.pdf">http://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/PUBS/IntroTT-improved.pdf</a></p>
<p>Because ZFC sets reigns as King and Queen in the world of mathematics, <br>
and is a FOL language, then HOL vs. FOL is largely "types vs. ZFC sets", <br>
at least for those who even know about the comparison, where education <br>
about types is near non-existence in formal, mathematics education, even <br>
though Church and Curry had their formal degrees in mathematics.</p>
<p>To compare the two, the problem is understanding what HOL is, not what <br>
FOL is, at least for me, since FOL is much simpler, even though HOL <br>
starts with a simple set of primitives.</p>
<p>I shared a list of the books I'd collected on trying to get up to speed <br>
with Isabelle/HOL:</p>
<p><a href="http://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2012-June/msg00024.html">http://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2012-June/msg00024.html</a></p>

<p>Fortunately, I've decided I probably will be able to be live more <br>
normally, which is to occasionally ponder questions about foundational <br>
logic, but not have to completely understand it all to work at a higher <br>
level. It's a very healthy place to be.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
When I'm only qualified to provide links, and I start speaking <br>
authoritatively, then I quickly get in trouble.</p>
<p>Lambda calculus would be the beginning, and types comes next. I was <br>
speaking of lambda calculus and types as being monolithic. In my mind, <br>
it must be that lambda calculus and types are part of the same <br>
foundation. That perception might be eliminated if I read more of the <br>
books, or it might become stronger.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This is indeed a very nice overview, I need to study this further.</p>
<p>Particularly notable is Theorem 11 / Virtue 6 about the completeness of <br>
HOL, which goes back to Henkin 1950, published shortly after the famous <br>
Church 1940 paper.</p>
<p>More than 60 years after it, there are still occasional rumors about HOL <br>
being incomplete.  Farmer gives some nice explanations about the overall <br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This seems to refer to the virtual machine that runs at the bottom of Coq. <br>
(We would need some Coq experts here, or move that thread to coq-club, if <br>
anybody dares to do it.)</p>
<p>Looking the problem from a higher level, it is the old debate how you make <br>
the prover: LCF-style to run through the inference kernel at run-time, or <br>
somehow native as part of the computational part of the logic.  This also <br>
means the logic is made in a way to have a computational part in the first <br>
place (like Coq, Agda, etc.).</p>
<p>My impression is that the LCF-style run-time interpretation turns out as <br>
surprisingly fast in many practical applications, both relatively and <br>
absolutely compared to the Coq computation model.  In a system like <br>
Isabelle/HOL you are not limited to a single built-in computational model, <br>
you can do things with different formal status (say HOL specifications vs. <br>
emitted code in other languages).  In principle, Coq does not limit you <br>
either, but the traditional way is to assimilate everything within its one <br>
big formal system.</p>
<p>Incidently, a Coq user has explained to me just last weak, that the <br>
notable Isabelle application IsaFoR/CeTA performs best in its category. <br>
The code that does the actual work in the end is native in Haskell, <br>
without the prover preventing it from being really fast.</p>

I think it can get quite confusing because different people use the same<br>
names for different things, and different names for the same things, and<br>
sometimes the same people do this too!</p>
<p>"HOL" can mean "higher-order logic" (referring to one or more of various<br>
logics that are higher-order), or it can mean "the HOL logic" (Mike Gordon's<br>
particular higher-order logic, implemented by HOL4, Isabelle/HOL, HOL Light,<br>
ProofPower and HOL Zero).  Other theorem provers such as Coq, PVS and IMPS<br>
implement other higher-order logics.  So the logic described in the HOL4<br>
logic manual really is the same as HOL Light's, etc, the only difference<br>
being that they are built up in different ways (i.e. they start with a<br>
different initial set of axioms and primitive inference rules, but these<br>
axiomatisations are just different ways of defining the same logic).</p>
<p>Does that clear anything up?</p>

<blockquote>

Mark,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was sort of speaking of maybe where I was a year ago, but "the <br>
problem" is still there to a certain extent.</p>
<p>So I count 30 folders for the "HOL section" of books, then there's the <br>
non-HOL logic folders, where I count 49 folders, along with the ML <br>
folders, 14 of those, and the Isabelle section with about 14 top level <br>
folders, but many subfolders by author or web page.</p>
<p>Before tying into the last paragraph, in the document <br>
kanaskskis-8-logic.pdf, I point out the semi-formal BNF grammar <br>
describing a HOL4 type, page 11, and then the first BNF grammar <br>
describing a term, page 15, followed by the second BNF grammar of a term.</p>
<p>I now ask, "Where is the semi-formal definition of a Isabelle type and <br>
term?"</p>
<p>If you said, "If you understand the HOL4 definitions of a type and term, <br>
then you basically understand Isabelle's".</p>
<p>To that I would reply, "But I'm not interested in studying 2 or 3 or 4 <br>
other HOL's to get a general understanding of Isabelle's logic, I'm <br>
interested in studying one logic to get a precise understanding of the <br>
one logic that I'm using."</p>
<p>"The problem" is represented by another question. "What is the clear <br>
learning path for learning about a particular HOL so that a person can <br>
use that HOL in a theorem assistant, and do that within a reasonable <br>
period of time, and not just end up with a foggy notion of ideas?"</p>
<p>The answer is that, for self-education, there is no clear path. It's not <br>
clear what is essential, and what is an unneeded tangent. But that's not <br>
anyone's fault. It just indicates that the market is not mature.</p>
<p>In a mature market, speaking analogously, you don't have to learn C, to <br>
learn C++, to learn Java, when it's Java that you're going to be using. <br>
In a mature market, people have written lots of books to start you <br>
wherever you want to start.</p>
<p>Now to something of a positive nature. The name for your HOL Zero site <br>
on my hard drive is "hoZ", and I downloaded the latest glossary, which <br>
is now named "hoZ__Glossary 130202.pdf".</p>
<p>It occurred to me that I can tweak it to fit my own preferences, so I <br>
saved it to PDF, and with Acrobat, I can add a bookmark entry for each <br>
of the terms, and make them sub-bookmarks of their first character. <br>
Doing that, I'll be able to see the trees, and not just the forest.</p>
<p>There are many mini-lessons in there that don't demand a big investment <br>
of time, so thanks for that.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

<p>From: "\"Mark\"" &lt;<a href="mailto:mark@proof-technologies.com">mark@proof-technologies.com</a>&gt;<br>
Yes, I agree it's very difficult.  When I started in theorem proving I was<br>
also struck by the lack of a clear learning path.  Isabelle is I think one<br>
of the most difficult to <em>really</em> understand how everything works.  You have<br>
to understand each of the many layers of Isabelle.  I'm afraid I don't<br>
understand these layers, although I would like to at some stage, but more<br>
seem to be getting added as the years go by!  But the main priorities for<br>
the implementors of Isabelle, as I understand it, have been usability and<br>
power, and having an understandable implementation comes way down the list.<br>
In HOL Zero, trustworthiness and understandable implementation are top of<br>
the list (they go hand-in-hand in my opinion), but of course it is very<br>
basic and no good for creating proofs.  So I think an important part of the<br>
issue here is about priorities.</p>

<p>I was sort of speaking of maybe where I was a year ago, but "the<br>
problem" is still there to a certain extent.</p>
<p>So I count 30 folders for the "HOL section" of books, then there's the<br>
non-HOL logic folders, where I count 49 folders, along with the ML<br>
folders, 14 of those, and the Isabelle section with about 14 top level<br>
folders, but many subfolders by author or web page.</p>
<p>Before tying into the last paragraph, in the document<br>
kanaskskis-8-logic.pdf, I point out the semi-formal BNF grammar<br>
describing a HOL4 type, page 11, and then the first BNF grammar<br>
describing a term, page 15, followed by the second BNF grammar of a term.</p>
<p>I now ask, "Where is the semi-formal definition of a Isabelle type and<br>
term?"</p>
<p>If you said, "If you understand the HOL4 definitions of a type and term,<br>
then you basically understand Isabelle's".</p>
<p>To that I would reply, "But I'm not interested in studying 2 or 3 or 4<br>
other HOL's to get a general understanding of Isabelle's logic, I'm<br>
interested in studying one logic to get a precise understanding of the<br>
one logic that I'm using."</p>
<p>"The problem" is represented by another question. "What is the clear<br>
learning path for learning about a particular HOL so that a person can<br>
use that HOL in a theorem assistant, and do that within a reasonable<br>
period of time, and not just end up with a foggy notion of ideas?"</p>
<p>The answer is that, for self-education, there is no clear path. It's not<br>
clear what is essential, and what is an unneeded tangent. But that's not<br>
anyone's fault. It just indicates that the market is not mature.</p>
<p>In a mature market, speaking analogously, you don't have to learn C, to<br>
learn C++, to learn Java, when it's Java that you're going to be using.<br>
In a mature market, people have written lots of books to start you<br>
wherever you want to start.</p>
<p>Now to something of a positive nature. The name for your HOL Zero site<br>
on my hard drive is "hoZ", and I downloaded the latest glossary, which<br>
is now named "hoZ__Glossary 130202.pdf".</p>
<p>It occurred to me that I can tweak it to fit my own preferences, so I<br>
saved it to PDF, and with Acrobat, I can add a bookmark entry for each<br>
of the terms, and make them sub-bookmarks of their first character.<br>
Doing that, I'll be able to see the trees, and not just the forest.</p>
<p>There are many mini-lessons in there that don't demand a big investment<br>
of time, so thanks for that.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>"HOL" can mean "higher-order logic" (referring to one or more of various<br>
logics that are higher-order), or it can mean "the HOL logic" (Mike<br>
Gordon's<br>
particular higher-order logic, implemented by HOL4, Isabelle/HOL, HOL<br>
Light,<br>
ProofPower and HOL Zero).  Other theorem provers such as Coq, PVS and<br>
IMPS<br>
implement other higher-order logics.  So the logic described in the HOL4<br>
logic manual really is the same as HOL Light's, etc, the only difference<br>
being that they are built up in different ways (i.e. they start with a<br>
different initial set of axioms and primitive inference rules, but these<br>
axiomatisations are just different ways of defining the same logic).<br>
Does that clear anything up?</p>

<p>When the gurus try to succinctly describe Isabelle/HOL, they'll many<br>
times just use the phrase "simply typed lambda calculus".</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus</a></p>
<p>But if they have time to type a few extra characters, they might add the<br>
phrase "with polymorphism".</p>
<p>If you keep talking long enough, another one might pop in and throw in<br>
the term "type classes".</p>
<p>Because there's no HOL which has yet won the HOL wars, then they use<br>
external, historical vocabulary to begin the description of their HOL,<br>
but then have to start attaching their own internal vocabulary to the<br>
description.</p>
<p>For someone looking for a label to label HOL with, as a starting place<br>
to learn about HOL, it can get confusing.</p>
<p>If you see the phrase "simple type theory" in the title of Farmer's<br>
paper, then you might ask, "Ah, is this what's going to tell me what<br>
Isabelle/HOL is? Because 'simple type theory' sounds suspiciously like<br>

<p>Being an authoritative prophet, I can now say that in the future, the<br>
HOL's which win out in the HOL wars will be the standard themselves, and<br>
the references will be to the 700 page textbooks which formalize,<br>
starting with the basics, what the logic of these HOLs are.</p>
<p>For HOL4 they already have that in their logic manual (to what degree I<br>
can't say), which I thought would be the perfect place to learn about<br>
Isabelle/HOL's formal logic, but it's not, it's the perfect place to<br>
learn about HOL4's formal logic:</p>
<p><a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/documentation.html">http://hol.sourceforge.net/documentation.html</a></p>
<p>For completeness, I quote from Mark's glossary to show how the gurus<br>
have to do a lot qualifying when they try to explain things:</p>
<p>simply-typed : (adj)  Relating to type systems that are relatively<br>
simple<br>
and<br>
are not, for example, dependently-typed.  There is considerable<br>
variation<br>
in<br>
the<br>
precise intended meaning of "simply-typed" in contemporary usage: in<br>
some<br>
usages<br>
polymorphism is not a disqualifying factor, in other usages polymorphism<br>
is<br>
only<br>
a disqualifying factor if it caters for the quantification of type<br>
variables,<br>
and in other usages still any form of polymorphism is a disqualifying<br>
factor.<br>
To avoid confusion, the usage of this term is avoided in HOL Zero, its<br>
documentation and elsewhere in this glossary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still looking at Gottfried's list.<br>
In addition to collecting books, I also rip web pages for past,<br>
educational courses on Isabelle. I haven't had time to study any of this<br>
right now. I'm making enough progress just stumbling along. I'll get<br>
more sophisticated later. Some of these are linked to from the official<br>
Isabelle site, many of them aren't.</p>

<p>Mark,</p>
<p>But there's still lots of good news, like "the market" is way past <br>
Cambridge LCF, and that low-priced computers now can have 4 cores, 8 <br>
GBytes of ram, and run at 2.5GHz or greater, because without fast <br>
computers, functional programming would still be the domain of the <br>
academics. It was only a few years ago that I would rail about Java, <br>
after my computer performance would come to crawl because the browser <br>
was starting up Java.</p>
<p>The docs distributed with HOL Zero have some good tutorial information <br>
in them, like "3_HOL_Language.txt".</p>
<p>I created the file "HOL_Zero_docs.tex". If a person unzips <br>
"holzero-0.6.0.tgz", and puts my .tex file in the folder <br>
"./holzero-0.6.0", then they can produce the PDF file "HOL_Zero_docs.pdf".</p>
<p>I had to add the extension ".txt" to the files without an extension, <br>
otherwise "\VerbatimInput" gave an error.</p>
<p>I attached "HOL_Zero_docs.tex", and I attached ""HOL_Zero_docs.pdf", <br>
where the PDF is for demonstration purposes only. The PDF is to show <br>
what a person would have access to if they were to install Latex on <br>
their machine and compile the .tex file.</p>
<p>Again, the PDF is for demonstration purposes only. It is required that <br>
any student of HOL acquire the sources from the web and compile their <br>
own .tex file. The allotted time for viewing the PDF for demonstration <br>
purposes is an integer m, where m can be greater than or equal to 1, but <br>
less than or equal to 30, where the dimension of m is seconds.</p>

<p>Makarius,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reference. A little guidance can go a long way. But, it <br>
still gets unwieldy, so I quote from a cycling blog article, <br>
<a href="http://inrng.com/2013/02/eurosport-david-harmon-interview/">http://inrng.com/2013/02/eurosport-david-harmon-interview/</a></p>
<p>In truth the greatest challenge is from having to deal with<br>
    performances unfolding in front of you that are just so astounding<br>
    and abnormal that you know precisely what's happening but you just<br>
    can't say it straight out. The list is endless; Rasmussen, Armstrong<br>
    and the Postals, Sella, Ricco, Mazzoleni... and on. I now confine<br>
    myself to saying "that was an unbelievable performance"...</p>
<p>What I know precisely is that the answer is spread out over multiple <br>
documents, which was actually easy to know, just not easy to sort out.</p>
<p>I'm already past my word limit, so I try to implement a form of the <br>
method from the quote.</p>
<p>The augmented question at hand: what is a "more formal" definition of a <br>
Isabelle type, term, and formulae.</p>
<p>We start at the very bottom of page 27 and the first three lines of page <br>
28 of isar-ref.pdf to give us a conceptual view of 3 important <br>
meta-logic types: functions, universal quantification, and implication:</p>
<p><a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2012/dist/Isabelle2012/doc/isar-ref.pdf">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2012/dist/Isabelle2012/doc/isar-ref.pdf</a></p>
<p>On page 28, there's reference [5] to Stefan and Tobias' "Proof terms for <br>
simply typed higher order logic", published 2000, where on page 2 of <br>
that, there are semi-formal definitions of types, terms, and formulae, <br>
where two of those important meta-logic types show up again, universal <br>
quantification, and implication.</p>
<p><a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~berghofe/papers/TPHOLs2000.pdf">http://www4.in.tum.de/~berghofe/papers/TPHOLs2000.pdf</a></p>
<p>There are references [33,34] in isar-ref.pdf and [8,9] in "Proof terms" <br>
to Larry's papers, where the one common reference is most applicable, <br>
"The foundation of a generic theorem prover", published 1989.</p>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/9301/9301105.pdf">http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/9301/9301105.pdf</a></p>
<p>Page 4 introduces types, terms, and formulae, along with three important <br>
meta-logic constants, and then on page 7, the three meta-logic constants <br>
are printed on 3 lines to emphasize them.</p>
<p>So, you look at the three different documents, read the three different <br>
descriptions, look at the types of the meta-logic constants, read about <br>
"prop" and "trueprop", and it might make more sense.</p>
<p>Interesting is that they all list implication and quantification, but <br>
only Larry lists meta-logic equality.</p>
<p>But then things are more complex now, right? But another reference out <br>
of those listed above is "Isabelle, a Generic Theorem Prover", published <br>
1994.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Isabelle-Generic-Theorem-Lecture-Computer/dp/3540582444">http://www.amazon.com/Isabelle-Generic-Theorem-Lecture-Computer/dp/3540582444</a></p>
<p>And on page 5 they're already talking about type classes.</p>

<p>In another email, you made the analogy to being a Linux user. I think <br>
the better analogy would be where 90% of the code is in C, but then <br>
there's that occasional call into assembly language. If assembly <br>
language is not a total mystery to you, you make tweak here or there.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's the VHDL analogy. You can read schematics, but that VHDL <br>
that the PGA is programmed in, that really stumps you, and you come to a <br>
grinding halt because that's not something you easily learn, and a lack <br>
of understanding really limits your ability to understand the circuit.</p>
<p>Until the book "The Isabelle/Pure and Isabelle/HOL Logic, From Top to <br>
Bottom, as Implemented in ML and Isar" comes out, every 4-6 months <br>
someone will be asking, "Hey, what's Isabelle/Pure all about?"</p>
<p>But there's quite a bit of documentation to all this, or I wouldn't be <br>
messing around with it.</p>

<p>The main priority?  I don't believe that!  You've already said that you<br>
don't understand everything.  The extra layers that have been introduced<br>
massively complicate the implementation, but are done with the good<br>
intention of improving usability (and maybe other reasons as well).  So, if<br>
understandable implementation were the <em>main</em> priority then why on Earth<br>
would this have been done?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As far as I understand, the only trustworthiness issue that you have with<br>
HOL Zero is that it is implemented in OCaml.  Firstly, HOL Zero addresses<br>
the main OCaml vulnerabilities to do with string and integer representation,<br>
and in any case can be relatively easily ported to SML, and I even intend to<br>
do this at some stage, as you well know, so please stop banging on about<br>
this.  Secondly, the implementation language is secondary here.  The primary<br>
problem is designing and implementing a system that itself has no intrinsic<br>
trustworthiness-related flaws.  All other HOL systems other than HOL Zero<br>
have not managed to do this because they have flaws in their pretty<br>
printer/concrete syntax design.  Their implementors either admit these flaws<br>
or brush them under the carpet with "well normal users are not malicious so<br>
would never in practice exploit these".  Only HOL Zero has no such known<br>
flaws, and it even has a bounty of $100 for anyone who can find one.  So,<br>
please, try to say something positive about HOL Zero's trustworthiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would put more trust on OpenTheory right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a misconception that HOL Zero is competing with or incompatible with<br>
Open Theory.  HOL Zero is a HOL system.  OpenTheory is a system for porting<br>
theory and proofs between HOL systems (and perhaps other systems).  Someone<br>
could write an Open Theory importer or exporter for HOL Zero just as much as<br>
for any other HOL system.  If they did, this would boost the credibility of<br>
OpenTheory.</p>

<p>Yes, there is no such queue of users.  Isabelle quite rightly concentrates<br>
on usability.  This does not mean that I am wrong.</p>

Isabelle has been developed over nearly 30 years, but with largely the same formalism; the only real changes have concerned polymorphism and type classes. Thanks to the LCF architecture, only a tiny percentage of the code has to be trusted. There are papers concerning formal properties of the basic calculus and some of its extensions, which should answer many specific questions. I would mention in particular the following papers:</p>

As someone who once attempted to write an exporter from Isabelle/HOL to<br>
OpenTheory, I have to say that figuring out exactly what the primitive<br>
inference rules for Isabelle/HOL are and how they are used is not an easy<br>
thing.<br>
I would anticipate it to be much easier for HOL Zero, and know it to be<br>
fairly easy for HOL4 and HOL Light.<br>
My attempt in Isabelle is on hold at the moment; the last thought was to<br>
see if I could use the existing proof-recording technology (Berghofer et<br>
al) and translate the proof terms it creates into OpenTheory proofs.<br>
There have been some references and links in this thread that I haven't<br>
examined in detail yet, though, so thanks.</p>

<p>It is important to discern complexity vs. complication.  Isabelle was not <br>
done the way like "this is a good day to introduce some new layers to <br>
complicate things; we are so smart, and it was hard to write so it should <br>
be hard to read".</p>
<p>On the contrary, the "layers" were always an answer to genuine <br>
complication that had occumulated over time, to rationalize and <br>
systematize concepts etc.  Doing this sucessfully then turns complications <br>
into mere complexity.  And modularity taken seriously means you only need <br>
to understand layers separately and the principles of composition, but not <br>
the whole of the result.</p>

<p>To keep the system alive and thriving over a very long time, with ever <br>
growing demands from the applications.  Isabelle has an unbroken tradition <br>
of more than 25 years, always with the same code-base.  Internally it <br>
looks rather young, fresh, and clean, if you compare it to other systems <br>
of such an age.  For example, I am now routinely exposed to Java and its <br>
standard libraries, and that is really complicated, not just complex.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as I understand, the only trustworthiness issue that you have with<br>
HOL Zero is that it is implemented in OCaml.  Firstly, HOL Zero addresses<br>
the main OCaml vulnerabilities to do with string and integer representation,<br>
and in any case can be relatively easily ported to SML, and I even intend to<br>
do this at some stage, as you well know, so please stop banging on about<br>
this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The string and int problem is a good example for genuine complication: you <br>
have to "repair" bad effects from OCaml, but you don't want that extra <br>
stuff there.  The Coq guys have quite a few such repairs of OCaml in their <br>
code.  To make HOL Zero on OCaml really bullet-proof you would probably <br>
have to blow up the kernel by a factor of 2 compared to a pure version, <br>
lets say in SML, or even HOL as specification language.</p>
<p>I have pointed out further nasty tricks of OCaml occasionally, where you <br>
simply cannot trust your eyes reading the OCaml source.  Some LRI guys are <br>
particularly good at playing such tricks and proud of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary problem is designing and implementing a system that itself <br>
has no intrinsic trustworthiness-related flaws.  All other HOL systems <br>
other than HOL Zero have not managed to do this because they have flaws <br>

either admit these flaws or brush them under the carpet with "well <br>
normal users are not malicious so would never in practice exploit <br>

<p>I am one of thos who brush it under the carpet, because it is no real <br>
problem in practice, but there are others.  Pinning down parsing / pretty <br>

trustworthiness.</p>
<p>I did see real issues in a different area, e.g. when Oracle (via the JVM) <br>

connectivity at all.</p>

<p>We start at the very bottom of page 27 and the first three lines of page 28 <br>
of isar-ref.pdf to give us a conceptual view of 3 important meta-logic types: <br>
functions, universal quantification, and implication:</p>

<p>On page 28, there's reference [5] to Stefan and Tobias' "Proof terms for <br>
simply typed higher order logic", published 2000, where on page 2 of that, <br>
there are semi-formal definitions of types, terms, and formulae, where two of <br>
those important meta-logic types show up again, universal quantification, and <br>
implication.</p>
<p><a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~berghofe/papers/TPHOLs2000.pdf">http://www4.in.tum.de/~berghofe/papers/TPHOLs2000.pdf</a></p>

Larry's papers, where the one common reference is most applicable, "The <br>
foundation of a generic theorem prover", published 1989.</p>

printed on 3 lines to emphasize them.</p>
<p>So, you look at the three different documents, read the three different <br>
descriptions, look at the types of the meta-logic constants, read about <br>
"prop" and "trueprop", and it might make more sense.</p>
<p>Interesting is that they all list implication and quantification, but only <br>
Larry lists meta-logic equality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of the above are important references about Isabelle/Pure.</p>
<p>Generally, you always need to put things into the context of <em>who</em> is <br>
writing <em>when</em> -- there different ways to explain things, which also tend <br>
to change over time.  For example, I always follow the advice by Stefan <br>
Berghofer from 2000 to say "logical framework" and not "meta-logic": Pure <br>
gives you so little to speak about other logics, e.g. no induction on the <br>
object-logic formulation.</p>
<p>The == connective of Pure is hardly relevant for users now, it serves <br>
mainly foundational purposes, so it appears later in my exposition in the <br>
"implementation" manual.  And there are more important add-on constants in <br>
Isabelle/Pure, like conjunction or funny prop markers.</p>
<p>For users mainly =&gt; !! ==&gt; are relevant, to express the structure of your <br>
abstract syntax and rule statements.</p>

<p>But then things are more complex now, right? But another reference out of <br>
those listed above is "Isabelle, a Generic Theorem Prover", published 1994.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Isabelle-Generic-Theorem-Lecture-Computer/dp/3540582444">http://www.amazon.com/Isabelle-Generic-Theorem-Lecture-Computer/dp/3540582444</a></p>
<p>And on page 5 they're already talking about type classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is now really really old.  I feel nostalgic about the "3 standard <br>
Isabelle manuals" that were pasted together for the 1994 LNCS volume.</p>
<p>Things have changed a lot since then, both the system and the way it is <br>
explained.  Type classes are not as trivial as they were looking in 1992, <br>
so you can't just introduce them in passing right at the start of an <br>
arbitrary Isabelle manual.</p>
<p>What I sometimes do is to show a canonical application of type classes to <br>
beginners, e.g. <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/Isar_Examples/Group.html">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/Isar_Examples/Group.html</a></p>
<p>This looks simple and obvious, and people learn something they can re-use <br>
later.  It is very far removed from the actual logical foundation of type <br>
classes, though.  Lots of "layers" around the raw logic at the bottom.</p>

<p>Pretty printing is very strongly related to trustworthiness!  If the pretty<br>

gets misled about what has been proved and/or what has beed defined.  I have<br>
known examples on real industrial safety-critical projects where this has<br>
caused problems.  It doesn't get much more serious than that.</p>

<p>Because these are all secondary issues, i.e. issue in the programs that fit<br>
around the theorem prover rather in the theorem prover itself.  I'll say it<br>
again, the primary trustworthiness issue in theorem prover implementation is<br>
designing and implementing a system that itself has no intrinsic<br>

French habit of making long complicated expressions short: Laboratoire de <br>
Recherche en Informatique, i.e. the CS lab at Paris Sud.</p>
<p>The coffee room of the lab is sometimes an exchange point for the latest <br>
OCaml tricks -- there are many power users of it.  Historically, the lab <br>
was also one of the originators of Coq, but that is now mainly done at LIX <br>
and PPS/Pir2 -- yet more odd abbreviations (you are French yourself, so <br>
you should know).</p>
<p>And of course, Coq is not untrustable just because it is using OCaml. <br>
The French colleagues understand the problems and made their homework, but <br>
it also introduces complexities.  People like Bruno Barras could tell you <br>
more.</p>
<p>So maybe that is now the point for Mark Adams to move this never-ending <br>
thread to coq-club to see how they react about high-end provers having to <br>
be simplistic.</p>

the term "type classes".</p>
<p>Because there's no HOL which has yet won the HOL wars, then they use <br>

<p>Being an authoritative prophet, I can now say that in the future, the <br>
HOL's which win out in the HOL wars will be the standard themselves, and <br>
the references will be to the 700 page textbooks which formalize, <br>
starting with the basics, what the logic of these HOLs are.</p>
<p>For HOL4 they already have that in their logic manual (to what degree I <br>

<p>For completeness, I quote from Mark's glossary to show how the gurus <br>
have to do a lot qualifying when they try to explain things:</p>
<p>simply-typed : (adj)  Relating to type systems that are relatively simple and<br>
are not, for example, dependently-typed.  There is considerable variation in the<br>
precise intended meaning of "simply-typed" in contemporary usage: in some usages<br>
polymorphism is not a disqualifying factor, in other usages polymorphism is only<br>
a disqualifying factor if it caters for the quantification of type variables,<br>
and in other usages still any form of polymorphism is a disqualifying factor.<br>
To avoid confusion, the usage of this term is avoided in HOL Zero, its<br>
documentation and elsewhere in this glossary.</p>

<p>In addition to collecting books, I also rip web pages for past, <br>
educational courses on Isabelle. I haven't had time to study any of this <br>
right now. I'm making enough progress just stumbling along. I'll get <br>
more sophisticated later. Some of these are linked to from the official <br>

From the same author (W. M. Farmer), an academic course (link below) I  <br>
landed into. Its wordings in chapter 5, made me feel I've read something  <br>
like this before… indeed, as I checked, this was in the Seven Virtues of  <br>
STT.</p>

<p>Chapter 5 concisely explains (to me, even more concisely than in the Seven  <br>
Virtues) many of the theoretical concepts found in Isar‑Ref and the  <br>
Isabelle Tutorial (for people like me who are not from the academic  <br>
world). He's a lot fan of the type theory.</p>
<p>Interestingly, at the end, he suggest an extension of STT, which would  <br>
include indefinite expressions, which seems to be the same as what  <br>
shown‑up during another topic with references to HOL+LCF as HOLCF (an  <br>
Isabelle theory).</p>

Yes, the question of whether or not to adopt an explicit logic of “definedness” continues to attract discussion. Most implemented formal systems have only total functions. Then there is PVS and the dependently-typed calculi, which allow partial functions but still don’t formalise the notion of “undefined”. I believe that Farmer advocates such formalisms. LCF and related systems formalise domain theory, in which the concept of definedness induces a partial ordering over all values. As always, increasing the expressiveness of the formalism also increases the difficulty of conducting proofs.</p>

What is perfect will vary according to need. The HOL4 logic manual is <br>
imperfect for a perfect understanding of Isabelle/HOL, and also of <br>
Isabelle/Pure, because HOL4 is only similar to what is implemented in <br>
Isabelle. Significant differences are that with Isabelle there are two <br>
logics, along with type classes.</p>
<p>To set the stage, I repeat a variation of a question I've asked in the <br>
past, and I state a law.</p>
<p>QUESTION_1: Where is the BNF grammar, or similar grammar, that precisely <br>
states what a typed lambda calculus term is in Isabelle/Pure and <br>
Isabelle/HOL?</p>
<p>QUICK_COMMENT: Such a grammar might immediately answer certain <br>
questions, such as whether an Isabelle/Pure term is identical to an <br>
Isabelle/HOL term. Here, I explicitly differentiate between Pure and HOL <br>
because of a paper by Wenzel in which he emphasizes that there are two <br>
HOLs in Isabelle. I reference the paper below.</p>
<p>LAW OF RIGOR: If you don't have the time to treat a formal, mathematical <br>
topic with proper rigor, then do your best to never mention the topic, <br>
lest you be accused of being a non-rigorous arm-waver. If you must <br>
discuss the topic, then give the shortest, possible overview of the <br>
topic, to make it obvious that the overview is not a formal treatment of <br>
the topic.</p>
<p>I assume that the Law of Rigor is one reason why the grammar I mention <br>
above doesn't exist for the current state of the Isabelle art, though <br>
such a thing may actually exist. Simple questions such as "Where is such <br>
and such?", when such and such is somewhere, are many times not <br>
answered. Such is life.</p>
<p>I say here that I've found several, older documents in which a type and <br>
term was defined for the state of the Isabelle art at that time. I <br>
reference those documents below.</p>
<p><em>COMPLEX TYPED TERMS, NO MOTIVE TO SORT THROUGH A SIMILAR GRAMMAR</em></p>
<p>Back to the HOL4 logic manual, on page 8 there is the phrase "[a] more <br>
accurate grammar of terms is", and then he gives a grammar which we must <br>
sort through using previously defined grammars, along with more formal <br>
discussion.</p>
<p>It would be doable, if I was willing to expend enough brain waves, but <br>
it would never get me an exact understanding of what an Isabelle/Pure <br>
and Isabelle/HOL term is.</p>
<p>I now use my first-order logic analogy. At the point I understood <br>
Bilaniuk's definitions 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 to define the symbols, terms, <br>
and formulas of a first-order language, the definition of a first-order <br>
language ceased to be Ph.D. level knowledge for me. If I completely <br>
understand those definitions, how can it be Ph.D. level knowledge? I <br>
don't have a Ph.D.</p>
<p>I bring the first-order logic analogy to an end prematurely to keep <br>
things shorter, lamenting that I must sacrifice what would've been the <br>
most intellectually stimulating rhetoric of my whole life (a joke? no, <br>
no joke), but I also consider the upside of not having to type 800 more <br>
characters. It's six of one, or a half dozen of the other, as they say. <br>
Economically speaking, we can equate the most intellectually stimulating <br>
rhetoric of my whole life with the time I would have spent typing 800 <br>
more characters, minus the number of characters in this sentence.</p>
<p>Anyway, I already know that terms have types, and types have types. I <br>
don't see any purpose in straining my brain to study something like the <br>
HOL4 grammar to only end up understanding, a bit better, that terms have <br>
types and types have types. When an authority on Isabelle publishes the <br>
grammar of QUESTION_1 above, then it's worth putting out that kind of <br>
effort.</p>
<p><em>SOME ISABELLE SOURCE BEFORE SOME ORIGINAL SOURCES</em></p>
<p>Frequently, I've seen it stated that Isabelle is simply typed lambda <br>
calculus. Here, I'd like to make the point that the definition of a <br>
lambda calculus term is fairly simple, which I do to compare its <br>
simplicity to a typed lambda calculus term, which is not simple.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<p>term "x::(('a::{type,equal,ord}) list)"</p>
<p>Understanding the typing of concrete examples like this is <br>
straightforward, though partly straightforward because I can use the <br>
PIDE to show me what some of the inferred typing is.</p>
<p>What the example shows is that the general case for a typed term is not <br>
simple at all. There are four things that can vary there: variable, type <br>
variable, type variable type (the type class), and type constructor.</p>
<p><em>SOME ORIGINAL SOURCES</em></p>
<p>Your recent question about sorts led to me sorting through some <br>
bibliographies again:</p>
<p>Re: [isabelle] Are sorts of Isabelle the same as what's described for <br>
second order logic?</p>
<p><a href="http://fa.isabelle.narkive.com/oYtXhS2I/isabelle-are-sorts-of-isabelle-the-same-as-what-s-described-for-second-order-logic">http://fa.isabelle.narkive.com/oYtXhS2I/isabelle-are-sorts-of-isabelle-the-same-as-what-s-described-for-second-order-logic</a></p>
<p>I've decided the available documentation of Isabelle can be described as <br>
"30 documents spread over 20 years". There is the question of which is <br>
more difficult:</p>
<p>1) Is it more difficult for me to understand involved explanations about <br>
how typing works, where some of the names for the types are outdated, <br>
and the definitions are mainly formatted in paragraph form, rather than <br>
formatted in a BNF grammar type style?</p>
<p>2) Or, is it more difficult for me to remember where the difficult <br>
passages are in the 30 documents spread out over 20 years?</p>
<p>I list in chronological order some documents I've sorted through, and <br>
make some comments:</p>

<p>Section 5.1.3 contains a BNF syntax for types, and 5.1.4 has one for <br>
terms. The book is pretty much a textbook style book. The first part of <br>
the book teaches some basic logic, such as natural deduction and sequent <br>
calculus.</p>
<p>I guess after the first time a person does that, the motivation to <br>
repeatedly teach the basics decreases over time.</p>
<p><em>1994: ISABELLE, A GENERIC THEOREM PROVER</em></p>
<p>by Lawrence Paulson, with Contributions by Tobias Nipkow<br>
Published by Springer-Verlag in hardcopy form.</p>
<p>This book was broken up into 5 documents, and distributed with the <br>
Isabelle distribution. I looked at Isabelle1999-2 to Isabelle2008. The <br>
PDFs for a long time were intro, logics, logics-HOL, logics-ZF, and ref.</p>
<p>The ref document stayed mostly the same up until 2008, after which it <br>
started to be subsumed by other documents. With Isabelle2013-2, it's <br>
completely gone.</p>
<p>Of note is that the page count of intro.pdf, the old intro, has stayed <br>
at about 77 pages from 1999 to 2013-2:</p>

<p>Section 1.2 discusses type classes, and even explains the empty sort. <br>
This seems to be an important document.</p>
<p>Possibly, some type names have changed. I've been wondering what the <br>
type of "int" is, because the PIDE doesn't show it has a type with this:</p>
<p>term "a::int"</p>
<p>Section 1.2 tells me that the type of the "int" constructor is "term". I <br>
don't ever see that in the PIDE.</p>
<p><em>1995: TYPE RECONSTRUCTION FOR TYPE CLASSES</em></p>

<p>There's a grammar for a Mini-Haskell on page 3.</p>
<p>If someone told me, "The Mini-Haskell syntax basically describes a <br>
Isabelle/HOL term", I'd say, "Great, so go ahead and modify it so that I <br>
know exactly what a Isabelle/HOL term is, rather than basically know. I <br>
wouldn't understand it at first, but an important starting point is <br>
having a precise definition."</p>
<p><em>1997: TYPE CLASSES AND OVERLOADING IN HIGHER-ORDER LOGIC</em></p>
<p>by Makarius Wenzel<br>
<a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/papers/axclass-TPHOLs97.pdf">http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/papers/axclass-TPHOLs97.pdf</a></p>
<p>Here Makarius, in several ways, treats Isabelle/Pure as the HOL to be <br>
considered, rather than Isabelle/HOL. He says,</p>
<p>As a quite harmless simplification, HOL can be identified directly<br>
    with Isbelle/Pure.</p>
<p>The consequence for me is that I now want to see a precise definition <br>
for a typed term for both Isabelle/Pure and Isabelle/HOL. It might help <br>
me see a difference that's important, that I otherwise wouldn't see.</p>
<p>In section 3.1 HOL Syntax, he quickly describes the HOL types and terms.</p>
<p><em>OUTRO</em></p>
<p>I have a better understanding now that terms have types and types have <br>
types. I'm better now at understanding what I see when I have show_sorts on.</p>
<p>Below, I include some of what I was looking at. I was mainly interested <br>
in looking at the types "type" and "{}".</p>
