<p>From: "John F. Hughes" &lt;<a href="mailto:jfh@cs.brown.edu">jfh@cs.brown.edu</a>&gt;<br>
I've finally gotten to a state where I can prove multiple small lemmas<br>
(with a great deal of help from "try") fairly smoothly. But I'm stuck on<br>
something that seems... well, as usual, it seems completely obvious to me,<br>
but none of Isabelle's solvers can get anywhere at all, apparently.</p>
<p>I'm trying to prove things about the ordinary affine plane. I'm using<br>
"a2meets P k" to mean "the point P is on the line k". Lines are either<br>
Vertical or Ordinary, the latter being lines with equations of the form y =<br>
mx + b. Here's the set-up for all that:</p>
<p>datatype a2pt = A2Point "real" "real"<br>
  datatype a2ln = A2Ordinary "real" "real"  | A2Vertical "real"</p>
<p>fun a2meets :: "a2pt ⇒ a2ln ⇒ bool" where<br>
    "a2meets (A2Point x y) (A2Ordinary m b) = (y = m*x + b)" |<br>
    "a2meets (A2Point x y) (A2Vertical xi) = (x = xi)"</p>
<p>definition a2parallel:: "a2ln  ⇒ a2ln ⇒ bool" (infix "a2||" 50)<br>
      where "l a2|| m ⟷ (l = m ∨  (∀ P. (¬ a2meets P l)  ∨ (¬a2meets P m)))"</p>
<p>I'm in the middle of proving that if you have a line l and a point P not on<br>
l, there's a unique line l' parallel to l and containing p. I've shown that<br>
such an l' exists; now I'm trying to show uniqueness.</p>
<p>So I'm trying to show that given a line l and a point P not on l, if m and<br>
k are both parallel to l and both contain P, then m = k.</p>
<p>lemma A2_a2b:<br>
  fixes P<br>
  fixes l<br>
  fixes m<br>
  fixes k<br>
  assumes pl : "¬ a2meets P l"<br>
  assumes pm : "a2meets P m"<br>
  assumes pk : "a2meets P k"<br>
  assumes lm_parr : "l a2|| m"<br>
  assumes lk_parr : "l a2|| k"<br>
  shows "m = k"</p>
<p>I'm doing this by cases on l, and working on the case where l is Ordinary.<br>
Using some lemmas, I'm able to show that k and m are both ordinary, and<br>
both have the same slope as l:</p>
<p>proof (cases l)<br>
  case (A2Ordinary s1 b1)<br>
  fix s1 b1 assume lo: "l = A2Ordinary s1 b1"<br>
  fix x0 y0 assume P: "P = A2Point x0 y0"<br>
  then  have mform: "∃b2. m = A2Ordinary s1 b2 " using A2_parallel_2<br>
A2_parallel_3 lm_parr lo by fastforce<br>
  also  have kform: "∃b3. k = A2Ordinary s1 b3 " by (metis A2Ordinary<br>
A2_parallel_2 A2_parallel_3 calculation lk_parr lm_parr)</p>
<p>So at this point, I have that k is and ordinary line with slope s1 and<br>
intercept b3. I know, from the hypotheses, that "a2meets P k", i.e., that<br>
the point P = A2Point x0 y0 lies on k, which (by the definition of a2meets)<br>
says that y0 =  s1*x0 + b3". But when I assert this and use "try" to find a<br>
proof...it tries in vain:</p>
<p>also have "y0 = s1*x0 + b3" try</p>
<p>It even tries in vain if I try to help it along by suggesting some useful<br>
tips:</p>
<p>also have "y0 = s1*x0 + b3" using kform pk try</p>
<p>I have the feeling that I'm approaching this kind of thing completely<br>
wrong, because even the most obvious things like this one seem tough.</p>

Hello,</p>
<p>I might have reproduced your theory incorrectly but:</p>
<p>The b3 you have in<br>
  "∃b3. k = A2Ordinary s1 b3 "<br>
is not the same as the b3 you have in<br>
  also have "y0 = s1*x0 + b3"</p>
<p>The first is bound and the second is free. The Isabelle IDE might be<br>
indicating this by drawing the background of the b3 in<br>
  also have "y0 = s1*x0 + b3"<br>
differently.</p>
<p>You will need to use something like obtain to fix the b3. For example,<br>
replace<br>
"∃b3. k = A2Ordinary s1 b3 "<br>
with<br>
obtain b3 where "k = A2Ordinary s1 b3 " &lt;you will need some proof of this&gt;</p>
<p>You will need to do similar for b2 and then prove b2 = b3.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Mark</p>

Thanks, Thomas and Mark.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That's a fun way to put it, but ... with a half-century of practice, I'm<br>
pretty good at proving things (and stating true things to prove). I'm just<br>
not good at understanding Isabelle/Isar (to put it very mildly!)</p>
<p>Your answer says a bunch of useful things, like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You begin your proof with "cases l", and the first case with "case (A2Ordinary<br>
s1 b1)". This automatically fixes variables<br>
s1 and b1 and assumes that "l = A2Ordinary s1 b1". The assumption is<br>
initially named A2Ordinary (the name of the case), and also "this".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The assume gadget is just for restating existing assumptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You need to tell it you want x to be a new name for a thing. As Mark<br>
said, the right thing in this case is "obtain", which was also the right<br>
way to handle "P = A2Point x0 y0".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...and I'd like to know whether there's DOCUMENTATION anywhere that<br>
actually says these things. I'd be very very happy to read it and stop<br>
asking naive questions if I possibly could.</p>
<p>I'd also like to understand why the "State" sidebar seems to not know about<br>
s1 and b1. For instance, after I've written</p>
<p>case (A2Ordinary s1 b1)<br>
  then<br>
  have mform: "∃b. m = A2Ordinary s1 b"<br>
    using A2Ordinary A2_parallel_2 A2_parallel_3 lm_parr by fastforce</p>
<p>and click just after "then" the sidebar says:</p>
<p>proof (chain)<br>
picking this:<br>
  l = A2Ordinary s1 b1</p>
<p>but clicking after "fastforce" it says</p>
<p>proof (state)<br>
this:<br>
  ∃b. m =<br>
      A2Ordinary s1 b</p>
<p>goal (2 subgoals):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>⋀x11 x12.<br>
       l =<br>
       A2Ordinary x11<br>
        x12 ⟹<br>
       m = k</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>⋀x2. l = A2Vertical<br>
   x2 ⟹<br>
          m = k</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't understand why the "goal" still has two subgoals, even though I'm<br>
in the "Ordinary" case, and why those subgoals use x11 and x12 rather than<br>
s1 and b1, for instance. This is clearly a problem, because even after I do<br>
a bunch more steps eventually showing that m = k, the proof-state still<br>
looks the same (except that "this" is now "m = k")</p>

<p>Mark seems to have said similar things, here's my version:</p>
<p>The short answer is, "try" can't prove some of the goals you've stated<br>
because they aren't true.</p>
<p>The script you've attached contains a bunch of confusion about how Isar<br>
proof syntax works. Let me point out three cases:</p>
<p>You begin your proof with "cases l", and the first case with "case (A2Ordinary<br>
s1 b1)". This automatically fixes variables s1 and b1 and assumes that "l<br>
= A2Ordinary s1 b1". The assumption is initially named A2Ordinary (the<br>
name of the case), and also "this". You've fixed new copies of s1 and b1<br>
and assumed the assumption again. I'm not sure if that's a problem but it<br>
is a possible source of confusion.</p>
<p>You then assume "P = A2Point x0 y0" which is definitely a problem. You're<br>
in danger of the "fails to refine any pending goal" error. The assume<br>
gadget is just for restating existing assumptions, and this isn't an<br>
existing assumption.</p>
<p>Finally, having proven "∃b2. m = A2Ordinary s1 b2", you attempt to show "y0<br>
= s1*x0 + b2". The misunderstanding here is that the exists syntax is a<br>
binder, and the syntactic name b2 is meaningful only within the scope of<br>
the exists. Mark pointed this out.</p>
<p>Isar forces you to be intentional about these things. You can prove that "∃x.<br>
..." with some property, and it won't try to unpack that x. If it did, you<br>
might get confusion between different instances of x. You need to tell it<br>
you want x to be a new name for a thing. As Mark said, the right thing in<br>
this case is "obtain", which was also the right way to handle "P =<br>
A2Point x0 y0". You want to obtain x0/y0/b2 at the proof scope with these<br>
properties.</p>
<p>To clarify:</p>
<p>obtain x0 y0 where P: "P = A2Point x0 y0"<br>
    by (cases P; simp)</p>
<p>Or, the short form of all this, it's easy to think that the problem is<br>
proving true statements in a formal system. Actually the first challenge is<br>
to state a true statement.</p>

<p>You have to use "show" to complete a goal. "have" is just for <br>

<p>The fact that variables are not renamed in the proof state is something <br>
I also find annoying. Sometimes I temporarily use rename_tac to make it <br>
easier to copy formulas from the proof panel. Sometimes it's possible to <br>
