<p>You are right.  The Simplifier setup does not anything like this for other<br>
reasons (including historical ones).</p>

<p>OK, let's try a compromise:</p>
<p>lemma doh2 [simp]: "tt f g == %x. f x (g x)"<br>

  finally show "tt f g == %x. f x (g x)" by simp<br>

<p>Try this in the body:</p>
<p>show "%x. tt f g x == %x. f x (g x)" by simp</p>
<p>i.e. you make the Simplifier happy by stating an expanded form.  The<br>
result then fits into the pending problem due to alpha-beta-eta<br>
conversion.  All single-step refinements work by higher-order unification,<br>
which includes these lambda conversions.  Automated tools may have<br>
slightly different ideas.</p>

<p>Now, the weird thing is (and here I'm going back to my point 1),<br>
Isabelle happily accepts this proof:</p>
<p>lemma doh [simp]: "const x == %y. x"<br>
proof -<br>
  have "const x == %y. const x y" .<br>
  also have "... == %y. x" by (unfold const_def)<br>
  finally show "const x == %y. x" .<br>

<p>even though you claim, about lambda introductions like the one on the<br>
first line:</p>
<p>"Such redundant cases are filtered out in<br>
 order to achieve more robust guessing of rule instances."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The filtering is on calculational results, not the original facts.  Here<br>
you did make some progress, becase the final rhs is different from the<br>
first lhs.  In the first example the latter were the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OK, but I'm confused about the distinction between object-level equality<br>
and meta-equality. What advantage would that give me for these types of<br>
proofs? What disadvantages?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking, meta-level !! and ==&gt; connectives express natural<br>
deduction rules, which can be used directly.  Object-level formula need to<br>
be unpacked first, via usual intro/elim rules to reduce them to plain !!<br>
and ==&gt;.</p>
<p>Concerning equality, there is not much of a difference in HOL<br>
theoretically. Practically speaking = is more convenient, because most<br>
tools work directly with this form.  For example, the calculational rules<br>
for = include various mixed forms (substitution etc.) while == is limited<br>
to plain transitivity.</p>

<p>Would currying be affected</p>

<p>No.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and would my theory file get more verbose?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, if you pack everything into ALL --&gt; etc. unnecessarily; proofs will<br>
become more complicated.  But this is not what the present examples were<br>
about.</p>

<p>OK, with this hint I managed to fix that proof - thanks.</p>
<p>However, I would disagree that it does not make any progress. Two<br>
strange things about this explanation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sometimes Isabelle does not object to a step which essentially just<br>
introduces a lambda - but sometimes it does (assuming your explanation<br>
above is correct). I cannot discern any rhyme or reason to this - it<br>
appears to me to be arbitrary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What's worse, I find myself in a Catch 22. Given the file I posted<br>
previously, I want to prove from </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>lemma tt_simp [simp]: "tt f g x == f x (g x)"</p>
<p>the following:</p>
<p>lemma doh2 [simp]: "tt f g == %x. f x (g x)"</p>
<ul>
<li>something that should be completely trivial to prove, because it<br>
follows directly from the fact that a function is defined to be a lambda<br>
in the lambda calculus (in fact, I would expect the simp rule to do<br>
it). So let's try a one-step proof:</li>
</ul>
<p>lemma doh2 [simp]: "tt f g == %x. f x (g x)" by simp</p>
<p>No, that fails. OK, let's try a patient, but verbose approach:</p>
<p>lemma doh2 [simp]: "tt f g == %x. f x (g x)"<br>
proof -<br>
  have "tt f g == %x. tt f g x" .<br>
  also have "... == %x. f x (g x)" by simp<br>
  finally show "tt f g == %x. f x (g x)"<br>
qed</p>
<p>This yields:</p>
<p>*** empty result sequence -- proof command failed<br>
*** At command "finally".</p>
<p>OK, let's try a compromise:</p>
<p>lemma doh2 [simp]: "tt f g == %x. f x (g x)"<br>
proof -<br>
  have "tt f g == %x. tt f g x" .<br>
  finally show "tt f g == %x. f x (g x)" by simp<br>
qed</p>
<p>With this, Isabelle complains "No calculation yet".</p>
<p>So the Catch 22 is: if I try to do it in 1 step, Isabelle can't seem<br>
to simplify that much in one step. If I try to do it in 3 steps,<br>
Isabelle effectively complains that I'm insulting its intelligence<br>
(going by your explanation of what the problem is, anyway). If I try to<br>
do it in 2 steps, Isabelle doesn't recognise a 2-step calculation as a<br>
calculation (even though, it clearly is such, from a human POV). I<br>
can't win!</p>
<p>Now, the weird thing is (and here I'm going back to my point 1),<br>
Isabelle happily accepts this proof:</p>
<p>lemma doh [simp]: "const x == %y. x"<br>
proof -<br>
  have "const x == %y. const x y" .<br>
  also have "... == %y. x" by (unfold const_def)<br>
  finally show "const x == %y. x" .<br>
qed</p>
<p>even though you claim, about lambda introductions like the one on the<br>
first line:</p>
<p>"Such redundant cases are filtered out in<br>
 order to achieve more robust guessing of rule instances."</p>
<p>So why is it that my proof of doh works, but my proofs of doh2<br>
don't? There must be something more to it that I'm not getting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also note that equality reasoning is usually performed at the <br>
object-level, using "=" instead of "==".  (This is in contrast to the <br>
other connectives !! and ==&gt;, which usually work better than ALL and<br>

<p>OK, but I'm confused about the distinction between object-level<br>
equality and meta-equality. What advantage would that give me for these<br>
types of proofs? What disadvantages? Would currying be affected -<br>
and would my theory file get more verbose?</p>

<p>Previously when I hit this error, I found that I could delete the<br>
previous line in the proof and the error would go away. But in this<br>
case, if I delete the previous line, the combined step is too hard for<br>
Isabelle to do in one step, as far as I can see.<br>
