Can anyone speak to reasoning behind the decision to remove the set  <br>
type from HOL in Isabelle 2008?</p>
<p>I find it strangely disconcerting not to have a syntactic distinction  <br>
between sets and predicates. Obviously it has some technical  <br>
inconveniences, but perhaps they are outweighed by some advantages?</p>

Brendan,</p>
<p>There were two main motivations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Avoiding pointless coercions between the two worlds. In particular, <br>
given a predicate P you had to write {x. P(x)} to turn it into a set. <br>
Now you have to worry less as to whether 'a set or 'a =&gt; bool is more <br>
appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compatibility with other HOLs.</p>

<p>From: "Dr. Brendan Patrick Mahony" &lt;<a href="mailto:brendan.mahony@dsto.defence.gov.au">brendan.mahony@dsto.defence.gov.au</a>&gt;<br>
One of those times when I regret my wasted education as a Z weenie,  <br>
but my amateur viewpoint really sees this as concerning. Some points  <br>
of debate follow.</p>
<p>Isn't this an argument for using ZF over HOL? Surely there are  <br>
benefits to strong typing? Probably the people who actually worry  <br>
about this question, want to worry about it. More likely, people who  <br>
always chose 'a =&gt; bool, occasionally realise that {f x | x y. t x y}  <br>
is a way more convenient (and disciplined) way of writing (% z. (! x  <br>
y. z = f x &amp; t x y)) and get annoyed they need a coercion to make use  <br>
it. In any case, they won't use set notations very often, I guarantee  <br>
that the predicate oriented user will not write { (x, y) | x y. t x y}  <br>
instead of (% x y. t x y). A proper theory of predicates would be more  <br>
to their liking, with a (generalised) predicate comprehension and  <br>
predicate conjunction, disjunction, and negation operators. This would  <br>
pretty much need little more than the introduction of a  <br>
boolean_algebra class and the generalisation of the boolean operators  <br>
to this class.</p>
<p>Biggest irony of all, the Collect coercion operator hasn't gone away  <br>
as it is needed to support print translations. Only the strong typing  <br>
on sets has gone! Why does this cause problems (other than the  <br>
problems always caused by weak typing)?</p>
<p>In effect, this equates sets with meta-abstraction, as there is  <br>
already effectively no object-level "function" type in HOL. Thus set  <br>
instances suffer from the same "higher-order unification" problems  <br>
that make arg_cong and fun_cong a pain to work with in Isar. It is now  <br>
necessary to instantiate set reasoning rules far more often than  <br>
previously.</p>
<p>Isar only allows a single reasoning set. With a distinguished set  <br>
type, this could be worked around to a degree. Now there is no way to  <br>
say, "just do set-style reasoning here." Auto fails to terminate in  <br>
many more situations now.</p>
<p>I'll continue evaluating the situation, but the chances are that I'll  <br>
be investigating the feasibility making a copy of Set.thy with</p>
<p>datatype 'a set = Collect "'a =&gt; bool"</p>
<p>replacing</p>
<p>types 'a set = "'a =&gt; bool".</p>

Brendan, you are certainly right that in some situations proofs are less<br>
automatic. We were aware of this but found that in the theories we have<br>
access to it was not too bad, only a few times per theory on average.<br>
However we concede that depending on your application this could be<br>
worse. I'm very sorry if you were particularly affected.</p>
<p>Concerning boolean algebras (and lattices), we do intend to develop this<br>
connection further.</p>
<p>Regards<br>

The latest problem encountered in in developing instances of  <br>
axclasses. No set type means no set instance claims for axclasses.  <br>
Obviously function type instance proofs are very different.</p>

Hi Brendan,</p>
<p>when porting the theories in the Isabelle distribution to the new encoding<br>
of sets as predicates, we found that most of the instance proofs for sets<br>
could be replaced by appropriate instance proofs for functions and booleans<br>
in a rather straightforward way. Could you give an example of an instance proof<br>
for sets that you could not easily replace by instance proofs for functions and<br>
booleans?</p>
