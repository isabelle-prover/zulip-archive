<p>OVERVIEW<br>
Affiliated with the Thirty-Second Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic<br>
in Computer Science (LICS) 20-23 June 2017, Reykjavik, Iceland.</p>
<p>We are holding the first Women in Logic (WiL) workshop as a LICS<br>
associated workshop this year. The workshop intends to follow the<br>
pattern of meetings such as Women in Machine Learning (WiML,<br>
<a href="http://wimlworkshop.org/">http://wimlworkshop.org/</a>) or Women in Engineering (WIE,<br>
(<a href="http://www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering">http://www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering</a>) that have<br>
been taking place for quite a few years.</p>
<p>Women are chronically underrepresented in the LICS community;<br>
consequently they sometimes feel both conspicuous and isolated, and<br>
hence there is a risk that the under-representation is<br>
self-perpetuating.</p>
<p>The workshop will provide an opportunity for women in the field to<br>
increase awareness of one another and one another's work, to combat<br>
the feeling of isolation. It will also provide an environment where<br>
women can present to an audience comprised of mostly women,<br>
replicating the experience that most men have at most LICS meetings;<br>
we hope that this will be particularly attractive to early-career<br>
women.</p>
<p>Topics of interest of this workshop include but are not limited to the<br>
usual Logic in Computer Science (LICS) topics. These are listed as<br>
automata theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,<br>
concurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,<br>
constructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,<br>
description logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects<br>
of program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,<br>
higher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic,<br>
logic in artificial intelligence, logic programming, logical aspects<br>
of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational complexity,<br>
logical aspects of quantum computation, logical frameworks, logics of<br>
programs, modal and temporal logics, model checking, probabilistic<br>
systems, process calculi, programming language semantics, proof<br>
theory, real-time systems, reasoning about security and privacy,<br>
rewriting, type systems and type theory, and verification.</p>
<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>
Contributions should be written in English and can be submitted in the<br>
form of full papers (with a maximum of 10 pages), short papers (with a<br>
maximum of 5 pages), or talk abstracts (1 page).</p>
<p>Papers and abstracts should be prepared in latex using the LICS style<br>
(IEEE Proceedings 2-column 10pt). LaTeX style files are available at<br>
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/">http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/</a>.<br>
Please use IEEEtran.cls version V1.8b, released on 26/08/2015.</p>
<p>The submission should be in the form of a PDF file uploaded to the WiL<br>
2017 Easychair page (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2017">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2017</a>)<br>
before the submission deadline of 31 March 2017, anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>PROCEEDINGS<br>
We plan to publish a post conference volume at ENTCS or other equally<br>
visible outlet.</p>
