           WiL 2018: Second Women in Logic Workshop<br>
                          Oxford, UK<br>

<li>Submission Deadline: 15 April 2018</li>
</ul>
<p>Affiliated with the Thirty-Third Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in<br>
Computer Science (LICS), 9-12 July 2018 (<a href="http://lics.siglog.org/lics18/">http://lics.siglog.org/lics18/</a>)<br>
and held as part of the Federated Logic Conference 2018 (FLoC), 6-19<br>
July 2018 (<a href="http://www.floc2018.org/">http://www.floc2018.org/</a>).</p>
<p>We are holding the second Women in Logic Workshop (WiL 2018) as a LICS<br>
associated workshop this year. The workshop follows the pattern of<br>
meetings such as Women in Machine Learning (WiML,<br>
<a href="http://wimlworkshop.org/">http://wimlworkshop.org/</a>) or Women in Engineering (WIE,<br>
<a href="http://www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering">http://www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering</a>) that have<br>
been taking place for quite a few years.</p>
<p>Women are chronically underrepresented in the LICS community;<br>
consequently they sometimes feel both conspicuous and isolated, and<br>
hence there is a risk that the under-representation is<br>
self-perpetuating.</p>
<p>The workshop will provide an opportunity for women in the field to<br>
increase awareness of one another and one another's work, to combat<br>
the feeling of isolation. It will also provide an environment where<br>
women can present to an audience comprised of mostly women,<br>
replicating the experience that most men have at most LICS meetings,<br>
and lowering the stress of the occasion; we hope that this will be<br>
particularly attractive to early-career women.</p>
<p>Topics of interest of this workshop include but are not limited to the<br>
usual Logic in Computer Science (LICS) topics. These are: automata<br>
theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,<br>
concurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,<br>
constructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,<br>
description logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects<br>
of program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,<br>
higher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic,<br>
logic in artificial intelligence, logic programming, logical aspects<br>
of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational complexity,<br>
logical aspects of quantum computation, logical frameworks, logics of<br>
programs, modal and temporal logics, model checking, probabilistic<br>
systems, process calculi, programming language semantics, proof<br>
theory, real-time systems, reasoning about security and privacy,<br>
rewriting, type systems and type theory, and verification.</p>
