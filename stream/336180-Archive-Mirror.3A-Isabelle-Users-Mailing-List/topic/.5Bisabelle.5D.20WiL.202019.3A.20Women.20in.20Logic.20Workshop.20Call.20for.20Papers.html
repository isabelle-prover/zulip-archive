Call for Talks and Papers<br>
           WiL 2019: 3rd Women in Logic Workshop<br>
                     Vancouver, Canada<br>
                       23 June 2019<br>
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/womeninlogic2019/home">https://sites.google.com/site/womeninlogic2019/home</a></p>
<p>Affiliated with the Thirty-Fourth Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in<br>
Computer Science (LICS), 24-27 June 2019 (<a href="https://lics.siglog.org/lics19/">https://lics.siglog.org/lics19/</a>).</p>
<p>We are holding the third Women in Logic Workshop (WiL 2019) as a LICS<br>
associated workshop on 23 June 2019. The workshop follows the pattern<br>
of meetings such as Women in Machine Learning (WiML,<br>
<a href="http://wimlworkshop.org/">wimlworkshop.org/</a>) or Women in Engineering (WIE,<br>
<a href="http://www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering">www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering</a>) that have been<br>
taking place for quite a few years.</p>
<p>Women are chronically underrepresented in the LiCS community. The<br>
workshop will provide an opportunity for women in the field to<br>
increase awareness of one another and one another’s work, to combat<br>
the feeling of isolation. It will also provide an environment where<br>
women can present to an audience comprising mostly women, replicating<br>
the experience that most men have at most LiCS meetings, and lowering<br>
the stress of the occasion; we hope that this will be particularly<br>
attractive to early-career women.</p>
<p>Previous versions of Women in Logic (Reykjavik, Iceland 2017 and<br>
Oxford, UK 2018) were very successful in showcasing women's work and<br>
as catalysts for recognition of the need for change in the<br>
community. Our extended program committee tries to cover most areas of<br>
Logic in Computer Science.  These include but are not limited to the<br>
usual Logic in Computer Science (LICS) topics. These are: automata<br>
theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,<br>
concurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,<br>
constructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,<br>
description logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects<br>
of program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,<br>
games and logic, higher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi,<br>
linear logic, logic in artificial intelligence, logic programming,<br>
logical aspects of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational<br>
complexity, logical aspects of quantum computation, logical<br>
frameworks, logics of programs, modal and temporal logics, model<br>
checking, probabilistic systems, process calculi, programming language<br>
semantics, proof theory, real-time systems, reasoning about security<br>
and privacy, rewriting, type systems and type theory, and<br>
verification.</p>

before the submission deadline of 7 April 2019, anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>PROCEEDINGS<br>
We plan to publish an informal post conference volume at ENTCS or<br>
other equally visible outlet.</p>
<p>ORGANIZING AND PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>
Since our workshop is especially keen on making sure that women get to<br>
know the work of other women, we have a large program committee.</p>
