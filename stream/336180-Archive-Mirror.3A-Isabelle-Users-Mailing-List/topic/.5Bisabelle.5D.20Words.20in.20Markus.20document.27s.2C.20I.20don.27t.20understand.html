Hi all,</p>
<p>Please, someone can help to understand some words in<br>
<a href="http://tumb1.biblio.tu-muenchen.de/publ/diss/in/2002/wenzel.pdf">http://tumb1.biblio.tu-muenchen.de/publ/diss/in/2002/wenzel.pdf</a> ?</p>
<p>Page 27 (printed 12), these words:</p>
<p>“For example, existing formalizations of linear and modal<br>
    logics simulate sequent-calculus rules within the pure<br>
    natural deduction framework, which would result in slightly<br>
    impractical Isar proof texts.”</p>
<p>Well, I simply don't understand what I quoted above.</p>
<p>What does it mean? An example?</p>
<p>If I ever have other questions from the same document, I will post it in  <br>
this thread.</p>

<p>From: Elsa L Gunter &lt;<a href="mailto:egunter@illinois.edu">egunter@illinois.edu</a>&gt;<br>
In Natural Deduction, one has a system of proof rules for constructing <br>
proof trees for provable propositions.   These trees are associated with <br>
a "discharge" function labeling where in the proofs assumptions (open <br>
leaves of the tree) are used.  The rule for implication introduction is <br>
usually written</p>
<p>A<br>
        :<br>
        :<br>
       B<br>
    -------<br>
    A --&gt; B</p>
<p>meaning that in the construction of the proof tree of B, there are zero <br>
or more occurrences of the assumption A (as leaves of the tree) that may <br>
be assigned to be discharged at this node of the proof tree.<br>
the discharge function may only discharge in accordance with rules <br>
allowing it.  Thus, among other things, an assumption can only be <br>
discharged at a node that has the assumption as the end of a branch from <br>
that node.    Assumptions</p>
<p>The rules come in two forms: introduction and elimination.  The rule <br>
above is the introduction rule for implication.  The elimination rule <br>
for implication is</p>
<p>Q<br>
                       :<br>
                       :<br>
  P -&gt; Q    P    R</p>
<hr>
<p>R</p>
<p>A proof tree is incomplete unless all assumptions are discharged <br>
somewhere in the tree.  For example, from these we may build the <br>
following (incomplete) proof tree:</p>
<p>-------             ---<br>
A --&gt; B       A      B<br>
  --------------------(Imp elim, discharging B to prove B)<br>
                 B<br>
--------------------(Imp intro, discharging (A --&gt; B)<br>
(     A --&gt; B)  --&gt; B</p>
<p>This proof is incomplete because nowhere have we discharged A.  It can <br>
be understood as saying "if we know A, then we know (A --&gt; B)  --&gt; B.  <br>
It can be completed as follows:</p>
<p>-------    ---    ---<br>
A --&gt; B       A      B<br>
  --------------------(Imp elim, discharging B to prove B)<br>
                 B<br>
    ---------------(Imp intro, discharging (A --&gt; B)<br>
     (A --&gt; B)  --&gt; B<br>
---------------------(Imp intro, discharging A)<br>
A --&gt; ((A --&gt; B) --&gt; B)</p>
<p>A bit more infrastructure is needed to deal with variables if your logic <br>
has quantifiers.</p>
<p>Sequent calculi are a different style of describing provability.  <br>
Instead of proving propositions, one proves sequents.  A sequent is a <br>
pair of collections of propositions, and may be thought of a asserting <br>
"if everything on the right is true, then something on the left is true".</p>
<p>The rules for a sequent calculus usually include a collection of rules <br>
for introducing operations on the left collection, a set of rules for <br>
introducing operations on the right collection, a rule (often called <br>
axiom) for introducing assumptions, and the "cut" rule.  The "axiom" rule is</p>
<hr>
<p>A  |- A</p>
<p>The cut rule is frequently given as</p>
<p>Gamma |-  Delta, A    Sigma, A |- D1, ..., Dj</p>
<hr>
<p>B1,..., Bm, C1, ..., Ca, Cb, ..., Ck  |- A1 ,...Aa, Ab,..., An, D1, <br>
..., Dj</p>
<p>Sample Left and RIght rules are</p>
<p>Gamma |- A, Delta        Sigma, B, |- Pi<br>
--------------------------------  (Left Implication)<br>
  Gamma, Sigma, A --&gt; B |- Delta, Pi</p>
<p>Gamma, A |- Delta, B<br>
---------------------- (Right Implication)<br>
Gamma |- Delta, A --&gt; B</p>
<p>In the above, A and B are propositions, while Gamma, Delta, Sigma, and <br>
Pi are collections of propositions.<br>
Various flavours arise depending upon whether the collection is a set, <br>
list or multiset.  For example, intuitionistic logic restricts the <br>
collection on the right to having just one element.  On can encode <br>
sequent calculi in a natural deduction system by introducing an explicit <br>
predicate "provable" taking a pair of collections, with an inductive <br>
relation definition following the sequent rules.</p>
<p>Linear logic is a variant of logic having "linear" connectives, <br>
restricting the "use" of propositions in proofs (linear implication can <br>
only discharge a single instance of an assumption, for example).</p>
<p>Modal logics introduce "modality" operators including Box and Diamond.  <br>
Box may be read as "it is necessarily the case that" and Diamond may be <br>
read as "it is possible that".   Temporal logics can by and large be <br>
viewed as an outgrowth of modal logic.</p>
<p>I hope this gives you a little better idea of what is being said in the <br>
section of Wenzel's thesis you were trying to read.  For a little more <br>
in depth discussion, you might try the Wikipedia entries; they're not <br>
too bad.<br>

PS.  I apologize for any and all typos and other gaffs in the above <br>
description.  I have not proofread it carefully.  If you find anything <br>
confusing, please ask for clarification.</p>
