Hi, everyone</p>
<p>Recently I have been working on writing a new theorem prover based on<br>
Isabelle. This is the first time I think it is in good enough shape to<br>
be made public. It is now available at</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bzhan/auto2">https://github.com/bzhan/auto2</a></p>
<p>An informal documentation (doc.pdf) is also available.</p>
<p>It is still more of a "proof-of-concept" than anything that can be<br>
used in production. The focus has been on reproducing the proof of<br>
selected theorems in HOL/Number_Theory/Primes.thy. A lot of work will<br>
be needed to extend it to be able to prove a wide range of theorems.</p>
<p>I am posting it here to see if there are any suggestions, things that<br>
are known that could help with this project, or (even better)<br>
contributions. I can also answer questions about the program here. In<br>
particular please point out anything that is confusing or need to be<br>
elaborated on in the documentation.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Bohua</p>

<p>I was first confused by this wording, but "auto2" seems to be a plain <br>
proof tool inside Isabelle, i.e. just a normal application of the existing <br>
framework.</p>

<p>I recommend to add a formal session ROOT to make clear what is the project <br>
structure.  See also "isabelle mkroot" in the "system" manual.</p>
<p>BTW, using some unspecified "development version of Isabelle" means this <br>
is mainly a private experiment of yours.  I you have good reasons for not <br>
using the latest Isabelle release (Which ones?) the minimum is to say <br>
which changeset id of the Isabelle repository is required.  It is also <br>
possible to make a formal Mercurial subrepository reference (in a <br>
Mercurial repository, probably not a git one).</p>

<p>Just some notes from looking briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Theory names are always capitalized in Isabelle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The @{term_pat} antiqutation is a bit strange.  If you really mean to<br>
   refer to schematic terms, you should say so via<br>
   Proof_Context.mode_schematic, and not Proof_Context.mode_pattern.</p>

Hi, Makarius</p>
<p>Thanks. Updated with capitalization of theory names, and moved to<br>
support Isabelle2014.</p>
<p>It seems when a schematic variable without specified type is read in<br>
mode_schematic, the type is set to be a free variable rather than<br>
schematic variable. I would actually prefer it to be schematic, since<br>
there is potential for type matchings.</p>
<p>I will need more time to figure out mkroot. The general structure is:<br>
Auto2 depends on Arith_Thms, Logic_Thms<br>
Auto2_Test depends on Auto2 (unit testing)<br>
Primes_Ex depends on Auto2.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Bohua</p>

Dear Bohua,</p>
<p>This looks interesting. What I would be curious to see is how “auto2” performs with respect to other Isabelle automation (“auto”, “blast”, etc., and “sledgehammer”). The paper “Sledgehammer: Judgement Day” by Böhme and Nipkow applied Sledgehammer to 1240 goals from Isabelle theories, using a tool called Mirabelle, included with Isabelle. It would be fairly straightforward to extend Mirabelle with “auto2” and perform some comparisons. Please let me know if this interests you and I can help you get started with Mirabelle.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jasmin</p>

<p>From: Bohua Zhan &lt;<a href="mailto:bzhan@mit.edu">bzhan@mit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi, Jasmin</p>
<p>The intention (not to say it is realized) is that auto2 should be<br>
stronger than auto and blast, perhaps comparable to an SMT solver. The<br>
way auto2 matches terms with patterns (up to rewriting the term using<br>
known equalities) is similar to what is done in SMT, although I would<br>
think the overall idea is different.</p>
<p>One difficulty with directly comparing auto2 and sledgehammer tools is<br>
that auto2 needs each theorem it uses to be registered by hand,<br>
specifying which direction it is to be used and under what conditions<br>
(this is done for some theorems in logic, arithmetic, and sets in<br>
theories Logic_Thms, Arith_Thms, and Set_Thms). Naively adding all<br>
theorems in all directions will make auto2 very inefficient. Also,<br>
auto2 works directly with statements in HOL rather than in first-order<br>
logic (the point is to work as closely as possible to what a human<br>
sees).</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think it would be very interesting to try to use<br>
auto2 to formalize different theories, such as the 7 examples in the<br>
reference you gave. The goal is to use auto2 to prove all major<br>
theorems, with hints provided in the form of intermediate steps of the<br>
proof. The hints should be no more detailed than what would appear in<br>
an informal proof in a textbook. If this cannot be done, it may point<br>
toward some improvements in auto2 that can be made.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Bohua</p>

<p>From: Bohua Zhan &lt;<a href="mailto:bzhan@mit.edu">bzhan@mit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi, everyone</p>
<p>I have uploaded the second version of auto2 at<br>
<a href="https://github.com/bzhan/auto2">https://github.com/bzhan/auto2</a></p>
<p>It now supports Isabelle2015. The biggest internal addition is proof<br>
scripts, which allows the user to specify intermediate steps of a<br>
proof, similar to (but currently independent from) Isar. There is also<br>
much better support for induction.</p>
<p>There are now more examples from different areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number theory: infinitude of primes and unique factorization theorem.</li>
<li>Lists, trees, and red-black trees.</li>
<li>Hoare logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see README and the updated documentation for details. Again I<br>
would welcome any comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Bohua</p>
