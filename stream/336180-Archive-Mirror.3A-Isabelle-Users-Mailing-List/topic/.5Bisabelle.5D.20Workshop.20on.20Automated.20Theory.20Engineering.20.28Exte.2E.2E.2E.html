                       CADE23 Workshop on<br>
                 Automated Theory Engineering<br>
                             (31. July 2011)</p>
<p>Extended Deadline: 6 May 2011<br>

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br>
   The first Workshop on Automated Theory Engineering will<br>
   be held in July 2011 in Wroclaw. It is associated  with<br>
   the 23th International Conference on Automated Deduction<br>
   (CADE23).</p>
<p>SCOPE<br>
   Theory engineering  means the development and mechanisation<br>
   of mathematical axioms, definitions, theorems and inference<br>
   procedures as needed to cover the essential concepts and<br>
   analysis tasks of an application domain. It is essential for<br>
   the  qualitative and quantitative modelling and  analysis of<br>
   computing systems. The aim of the workshop is to present users<br>
   with lightweight domain specific modelling languages, and to<br>
   devolve the technical intricacies of analysis tasks as far as<br>
   possible to tools that provide heavyweight automation.</p>
<p>The workshop brings together tool and theory developers with<br>
   industrial engineers to exchange  experiences and ideas that<br>
   stimulate further tool developments and theory designs. A main<br>
   goal is the creation of a repository of case studies that<br>
   allows developers to test and improve their theories and tools.</p>
<p>TOPICS<br>
   Theory engineering is relevant to the design of systems, programs,<br>
   APIs, protocols, algorithms, design patterns, specification<br>
   languages, programming languages and beyond.  It involves technology<br>
   such as  ITP systems, ATP systems, SAT/SMT solvers, model checkers<br>
   and decision procedures. Specific topics of the workshop include,<br>
   but are not limited to:<br>
     o  qualitative and quantitative modelling and  analysis<br>
     o  formal specification and verification<br>
     o  domain specific models, languages and solvers<br>
     o  theorem proving technology for theory engineering<br>
     o  integration of theories and tools<br>
     o  applications of mechanised reasoning to formal modelling<br>
     o  industrial case studies/experiences</p>
<p>We especially invite industrial contributions from the areas of<br>
   network protocols and concurrent systems, but any submission on<br>
   the topics outlined  is very welcome.</p>
<p>INVITED SPEAKER<br>
   o  Timothy Griffin, University of Cambridge, UK<br>
   o  TBA</p>
<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>
   Submission of papers for presentation at the workshop are now<br>
   invited. Submissions are limited to 10 pages,  but shorter extended<br>
   abstracts are welcome. All papers will be reviewed by the programme<br>
   committee, and a balanced programme will be selected based on<br>
   relevance and technical soundness. Submissions must  be in PDF<br>
   using the LaTeX EasyChair-format <a href="http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip">http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip</a><br>
.<br>
   Accepted papers will be published as CEUR Workshop Proceedings.</p>
<p>If quality and quantity of the submissions warrants this, we<br>
   plan to publish a special issue of a recognized journal on the<br>
   topic of the workshop.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:<br>
   Submission (extended):    6 May 2011<br>
   Notification:    30 May 2011<br>
   Final version:   1 July 2011<br>
