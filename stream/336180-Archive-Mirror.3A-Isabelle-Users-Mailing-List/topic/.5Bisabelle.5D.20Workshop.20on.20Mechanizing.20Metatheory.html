2nd Informal ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Mechanizing Metatheory</p>
<p>Freiburg, Germany</p>
<p>Sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN<br>
                        Co-located with ICFP'07.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/wmm/">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/wmm/</a></p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
<p>* Submission deadline: 18 June 2007<br>
      * Author Notification: 16 July 2007<br>
      * Workshop: 4 October 2007</p>
<p>Workshop Description</p>
<p>Researchers in programming languages have long felt the need for<br>
    tools to help formalize and check their work. With advances in<br>
    language technology demanding deep understanding of ever larger and<br>
    more complex languages, this need has become urgent. There are a<br>
    number of automated proof assistants being developed within the<br>
    theorem proving community that seem ready or nearly ready to be<br>
    applied in this domain--yet, despite numerous individual efforts in<br>
    this direction, the use of proof assistants in programming language<br>
    research is still not commonplace: the available tools are<br>
    confusingly diverse, difficult to learn, inadequately documented,<br>
    and lacking in specific library facilities required for work in<br>
    programming languages.</p>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers who have<br>
    experience using automated proof assistants for programming<br>
    language metatheory, and those who are interested in using tool<br>
    support for formalizing their work. One starting point for<br>
    discussion will be the obstacles that hinder mechanisation (whether<br>
    they be pragmatic or technical), and what users and developers can<br>
    do to overcome them.</p>
<p>Format</p>
<p>The workshop will consist of presentations by the participants,<br>
    selected from submitted abstracts. It will focus on providing a<br>
    fruitful environment for interaction and presentation of ongoing<br>
    work.  Participants are invited to submit working notes, source<br>
    files, and abstracts for distribution to the attendees, but as the<br>
    workshop has no formal proceedings, contributions may still be<br>
    submitted for publication elsewhere. (See the SIGPLAN republication<br>
    policy for more details.)</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>The scope of the workshop includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>* Tool demonstrations: proof assistants, logical frameworks,<br>
        visualizers, etc.</p>
<p>* Libraries for programming language metatheory.<br>
      * Formalization techniques, especially with respect to binding<br>
        issues.</p>
<p>* Analysis and comparison of solutions to the POPLmark challenge.<br>
      * Examples of formalized programming language metatheory.<br>
      * Proposals for new challenge problems that benchmark programming<br>
        language work.</p>
