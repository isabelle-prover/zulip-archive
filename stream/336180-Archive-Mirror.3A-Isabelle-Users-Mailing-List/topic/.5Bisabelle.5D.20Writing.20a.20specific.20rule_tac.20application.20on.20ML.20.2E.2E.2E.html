<p>From: Sylvia Gruener &lt;<a href="mailto:sylvia.gruener@googlemail.com">sylvia.gruener@googlemail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>I would like to write a tactic which applies a theorem to the goal<br>
(where it depends on the structure of the goal which theorem is<br>
applied). Moreover, the tactic gets as argument a term with which the<br>
free variable "ur" of the theorem should be instantiated before applying the theorem to the goal (each possible theorem contains a variable with this name). After deciding which theorem to apply, the tactic should behave exactly like applying rule_tac with the selected theorem and instantiating the variable "ur" with the given term. </p>
<p>On the Isabelle level, the rule_tac application would look like this:<br>
 apply (rule_tac ur="some_term" in some_theorem)</p>
<p>My question is: How can I write this rule_tac application on the<br>
ML-Level?</p>
<p>I tried to do this rule_tac application by executing</p>
<p>(res_inst_tac ctxt [(("ur", 0), "some_term")] some_theorem 1)</p>
<p>in the ML code of the tactic, but I had two problems with this call, to<br>
which I do not find a solution: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The name of the variable has to be given as indexname (a pair of a<br>
 string and an integer). What exactly does the integer stand for? I<br>
 tried several values, none of them (also not 0) yielded exactly the<br>
 behavior of rule_tac (because some variables inside the term are not<br>
 instantiated the way rule_tac would do it). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"some_term" is of type "term", but res_inst_tac needs of course a<br>
 parameter of type string. I defined my own syntax for my tactic using<br>
 the method_setup command, which parses the parameter as a term. <br>
 Is it possible to convert a term to a string of the format that<br>
 res_inst_tac is expecting? (The functions I tried only converted the<br>
 term structure to a string.)<br>
 Or is it possible to parse a string as argument instead of a term<br>
 when the tactic is applied on the Isabelle level?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you very much,<br>
Sylvia</p>

Hi Sylvia,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>res_inst_tac is an old tactic designed for interactive use, which is why <br>
it has "parsing built in". It is not really useful for writing other <br>
tactics, due to the strings...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no direct ML counterpart of rule_tac.</p>
<p>It is easy if your instantiation does not refer to goal parameters (that <br>
is, variables that are !!-bound within the subgoal). Then you can first <br>
instantiate the theorem (using Thm.instantiate, or one of its relatives <br>
Drule.instantiate' and Drule.cterm_instantiate) and then apply it using <br>
resolve_tac. What you are doing then roughly corresponds to</p>
<p>apply (rule some_theorem[where ur="some_term"]) .</p>
<p>If you do have to refer to goal parameters, then it is a bit more <br>
difficult. I know of two approaches that work reasonably well:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use Subgoal.FOCUS_PARAMS to turn your subgoal into a new goal in a <br>
context where the parameters are turned to fixed variables. Then you can <br>
instantiate and apply the rule as above. This roughly corresponds to</p>
<p>(* goal: "!!x y z. P x y z" *)<br>
 proof -<br>
   fix x y z<br>
   show "P x y z" &lt;proof&gt;<br>
 qed</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>but the inner tactic (the rule application) does not have to solve the goal.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Manually lift some_theorem into your "goal context" using <br>
Thm.lift_rule. Then, the schematic variables become parameterized over <br>
the goal parameters (i.e. they are now of function type). You can then <br>
instantiate them as you need. To apply the rule, you would then use<br>
some variant of compose_tac.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>in the ML code of the tactic, but I had two problems with this call,<br>
to which I do not find a solution: 1. The name of the variable has to<br>
be given as indexname (a pair of a string and an integer). What<br>
exactly does the integer stand for?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schematic variables have an indexname instead of just a name, which <br>
allows for fast renaming. See Sect. 1.2.3 of the Implementation Manual.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or is it possible to<br>
parse a string as argument instead of a term when the tactic is<br>
applied on the Isabelle level?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In principle you could do this and delegate the parsing to res_inst_tac, <br>
but I would not recommend this as a general approach. In particular, you <br>
could no longer inspect the term structure of some_term.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
Alex</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The question about term-based res_inst_tac is very old (maybe 15 years). <br>
Various people had come up with private solutions to that.  More recently, <br>
with the almost accidental advent of FOCUS, it became suddenly clear that <br>
the answer is there.</p>
<p>So only thing you can't do with FOCUS is instantiate schematic variables <br>
in the goal, but these are very rare in (robust) proofs under ML program <br>
control.</p>
