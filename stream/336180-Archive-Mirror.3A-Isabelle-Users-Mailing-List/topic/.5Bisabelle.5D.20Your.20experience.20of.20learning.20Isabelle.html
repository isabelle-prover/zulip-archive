<p>From: "Pal, Abhik" &lt;<a href="mailto:ab.pal@jacobs-university.de">ab.pal@jacobs-university.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>I'm writing on behalf of the Hilbert-10 workgroup at Jacobs<br>
University, Bremen --- a small team of second-year undergraduate<br>
students working on a formalization of Yuri Matiyasevich's proof of<br>
Hilbert's Tenth problem in Isabelle.</p>
<p>We are trying to consolidate our experience of working on a theorem<br>
prover as a submission to CICM [1]. In our submission we don't tackle<br>
the formalization but reflect on the process itself. In particular, we<br>
discuss how we as a group of inexperienced undergraduates with no<br>
prior theorem proving experience decided to tackle the formalization<br>
of a non-trivial mathematical result.</p>
<p>Hence, we are interested in hearing your experience of learning to use<br>
a theorem prover.  In particular, we're interested in</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>your academic background when you learnt to use a theorem prover.<br>
  What parts of your formal education made it easier to actually<br>
  understand theorem proving?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in retrospect, what were the gaps in knowledge you had when you got<br>
  started?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what were the common mistakes you made? What concepts were difficult<br>
  to understand?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anything else about the experience of learning a theorem prover.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Broadly, we would also like to use this as an opportunity to generate<br>
a discussion around the usability of theorem provers themselves and<br>
making them more accessible.</p>
<p>We would love to know what you think!</p>
<hr>
<p>Abhik</p>
<p>[1]: Tentative abstract:</p>
<p>How difficult are theorem provers to use for beginners? We<br>
     respond by reviewing the formalization of the DPRM theorem in<br>
     Isabelle carried out by an undergraduate research group at Jacobs<br>
     University, Bremen. We argue that theorem provers are feasible.<br>
     However, we also survey the factors that keep beginners from<br>
     using them effectively and propose specific measures to make the<br>
     field more accessible to new users. Broadly, we advocate for an<br>
     increased adoption and regular use of theorem provers in<br>
     mathematical research.<br>

<p>From: José Manuel Rodríguez Caballero &lt;<a href="mailto:josephcmac@gmail.com">josephcmac@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello Abhik,<br>
  It is a pleasure to share my experiences about learning Isabelle/HOL<br>
(below: Q for Question and A for Answer). Please correct my English if<br>
there are some mistakes.</p>
<p>Q: Your academic background when you learnt to use a theorem prover.</p>
<p>A: I learned Isabelle/HOL, in a self-taught way (from the manuals), having<br>
a Master degree in Pure Mathematics. Before that, I learned Coq, again in a<br>
self-taught way (from the manuals).</p>
<hr>
<p>Q: What parts of your formal education made it easier to actually<br>
understand theorem proving?</p>
<p>A: A course on Formal Set Theory given by Prof. Alexander Shnirelman at<br>
Concordia University.</p>
<hr>
<p>Q: In retrospect, what were the gaps in knowledge you had when you<br>
got started?</p>
<p>A: Type Theory was the main gap. In general, it is not part of the<br>
background in Pure Mathematics. I learned homotopy type theory from the<br>
video-lectures given by Robert Harper. My access to these lectures was by<br>
means of YouTube.</p>
<hr>
<p>Q: What were the common mistakes you made?</p>
<p>A: The main mistakes were related to the types, e.g., (1::nat) is not the<br>
same as (1::real). This was, again, because of the lack of background in<br>
type theory. Nevertheless, it was easy to get used to this new way of<br>
thinking.</p>
<hr>
<p>Q: What concepts were difficult to understand?</p>
<p>A: For me, the most difficult concept to understand was the difference<br>
between dependent type theory (Coq) and simple type theory (Isabelle/HOL).<br>
When someone learns Coq first, he/she tries to work in the same way in<br>
Isabelle/HOL, but this is counterproductive. Isabelle/HOL deserves its own<br>
way of thinking. So, I recommend to learn Isabelle/HOL first and then Coq.</p>
<hr>
<p>Q: Anything else about the experience of learning a theorem prover.</p>
<p>A: I think that the best way to begin to practice Isabelle/HOL is to do<br>
elementary number theory, e.g., to prove Bezout's Identity, Fermat's Little<br>
Theorem, Wilson's Theorem, etc. These results can be easily formalized. It<br>
is important to understand the mathematics before to begin the<br>
formalization: never formalize something that you do not understand. It is<br>
important to begin with the statement of the theorem and then to prove it<br>
under the assumption that some lemmas are proved (use the keyword "sorry"),<br>
and repeat this process until the end. Finally, take coffee naps of 20-30<br>
minutes every 4 hours, it eliminates brain fatigue (don't fear the<br>
nosebleed, in most cases, it does not come from the brain).</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,<br>
José Manuel Rodriguez Caballero</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The problem is also the use of the same words for slightly different<br>
things. The difference of "dependent type theory" vs. "simple type<br>
theory" is not just in "dependent" vs. "simple", but also in "type<br>
theory" vs. "type theory".</p>
<p>Even Coq and HOL experts can get fooled by this. There are very few<br>
people who know both worlds sufficiently well to understand this<br>
misunderstanding.</p>

Hopefully many Isabelle users will provide you some input for the paper.<br>
Such experience reports are very important for the progress of the<br>
prover communities.</p>
<p>CICM is a good place for such "soft" contributions, beyond the hard<br>
formalizations. (Note that I will be there myself this year, as an<br>
invited speaker of the MKM track.)</p>

<p>From: Freek Wiedijk &lt;<a href="mailto:freek@cs.ru.nl">freek@cs.ru.nl</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Makarius,</p>
<p>I don't know what the difference is, these strings seem<br>
identical to me :-)  Let's see:</p>
<p>% ocaml<br>
        OCaml version 4.06.1</p>
<h1>"type theory" == "type theory";;</h1>
<ul>
<li>: bool = false</li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<p>% </p>
<p>Ah no, you're right, they _are_ different!  (And apologies<br>
for running OCaml 4.06.1 instead of 4.07.0, this has<br>
something to do with a project that I am in which is at<br>
some version of VST.  I think.)</p>
<p>For me the difference between Isabelle's type theory ("simple<br>
type theory") and Coq's type theory ("dependent type theory")<br>
is that in the first you have a unified framework in which<br>
terms and formulas are the same thing (typed lambda terms),<br>
while in the second, the terms, formulas _and_ proofs are<br>
all the same kind of thing (again: typed lambda terms).</p>
<p>So the main difference is the use in dependent type theory of<br>
the Curry-Howard isomorphism, and the resulting possibility<br>
for functions to take "proof objects" as arguments.</p>
<p>For example, in Coq the division operator (for an appropriate<br>
version of division) takes _three_ arguments: x, y, and<br>
a proof that y &lt;&gt; 0.  This means that the term 0/0 is a<br>
_function,_ from proofs of 0 &lt;&gt; 0 to numbers.</p>

<p>You wrote "Isabelle" and probably meant the Isabelle/HOL library.<br>
Isabelle as a logical framework was invented by Larry Paulson to<br>
formalize variants of Martin-Löf Type Theory. In restrospect it might be<br>
interesting to look what was missing to make this really work out: the<br>
Isabelle/HoTT threads on this mailing list could be a starting point for<br>
that.</p>
<p>Coq users typically develop a certain mindset of what a "type" is and<br>
how it is used in formalizations: it is more about logic than about<br>
classic use of types for abstract syntax. E.g. when a Coq user says<br>
"type checking" (for "proof checking"), a HOL user will usually<br>
misunderstand that as a false-friend.</p>

the Curry-Howard isomorphism, and the resulting possibility<br>

<p>In such situations I am often glad that HOL cannot do this. Cf. the<br>
parallel thread on the HOL mailing list about "0 / 0 = 0 ???".</p>

Dear Abhik and team,</p>
<p>first of all congratulations on your initiative and your very <br>
interesting work.<br>
I attended a presentation on your project back in July in Oxford- it <br>
looks like you are doing a great job.</p>
<p>Right now I am also in the process of writing a "beginner's experience"/ <br>
review  report on my Isabelle experience,<br>
and I can share it with you when I finish it, if you like.</p>
<p>(I started using Isabelle a bit over a year ago, working in Lawrence <br>
Paulson's ALEXANDRIA project at the University of Cambridge, and I got <br>
my PhD in pure Mathematics around 2 years ago)</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
