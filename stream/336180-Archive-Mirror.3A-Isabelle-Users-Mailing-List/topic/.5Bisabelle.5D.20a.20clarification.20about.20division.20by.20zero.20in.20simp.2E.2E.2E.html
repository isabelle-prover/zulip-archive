This is just a short technical clarification (I do not see any motive to go<br>
further in this discussion). There are peer-reviewed publications about the<br>
so-called "division by zero calculus". For example,</p>
<p>Pinelas, Sandra, and Saburou Saitoh. "Division by zero calculus and<br>
differential equations." *International Conference on Differential &amp;<br>
Difference Equations and Applications*. Springer, Cham, 2017.<br>

<p>The fact that the definition x/0 = 0 has important applications in<br>
mathematics can be explained, from a topological point of view, as the<br>
identification between the zero and the infinity in the Riemann sphere. You<br>
can see this idea illustrated in the following draw:<br>

<p>The moral of the division by zero calculus is that, when something is<br>
undefined in simple type theory, like the value of 1/n for n = 0, it is<br>
natural to define it in a way corresponding to some elegant topological<br>
structure. For example, defining 1/0 = 5 is not useful, because it does not<br>
correspond to an elegant topological structure.  So, simple type theory<br>
makes us discover new facts about mathematics that otherwise will<br>
be unnoticed.</p>

Just to clarify: My statement was meant in the context of Isabelle/HOL,<br>
not in general math. That is, what I wanted to say is that Isabelle/HOL<br>
does not (intentionally, at least as far as I know) use a "division by<br>
zero calculus". I would guess that defining (/) in such a way that "x /<br>
0 = 0" was just pragmatism. - chris</p>

<p>The reason for the introduction of x/0 = 0 in Isabelle/HOL was because many<br>
laws involving division will then hold unconditionally, an example being<br>
(a<em>b)/(c</em>d) = (a/c)*(b/d).</p>
<p>Why the laws hold unconditionally with x/0 = 0, but they do not otherwise,<br>
e.g., with x/0 = 5?</p>
<p>A topological explanation of this phenomenon is by means of the<br>
identification between zero and infinity in the Riemann sphere, i.e., the<br>
division by zero calculus. These are two different level of analysis.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>(a<em>b)/(c</em>d) = (a/c)*(b/d)</p>
<p>when b is 0 becomes</p>
<p>0/(c*d) = (a/c)/0</p>
<p>which in the Riemann sphere is</p>
<p>0 = infinity (this equality is true by definition of the topological<br>
indentification between zero and infinity).</p>
<p>Why is this important for Isabelle/HOL?</p>
<p>Well, the topology gives a clue of how to define some values for functions<br>
which are undefined in dependent type theory, e.g., x/0 is undefined in<br>
Coq. Topology and programming are the same thing, described in two<br>
different ways.</p>
