Hello,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E.g., monoid_mult (type class, in HOL) vs. monoid (locale, in <br>
HOL-Algebra). The classes have the advantage of being easier to use than <br>
locales in many cases (at least I feel that way), but they have the <br>
limitation of always having UNIV as the carrier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I had asked this question long ago here, though.) I had tried to unify <br>
them, but gave up due to a locale behavior that I don't understand.</p>
<p>My approach was defining locales with a predicate for carrier, like</p>
<p>locale magma =<br>
   fixes f (infixl "❙*" 70) and member<br>
   assumes closed: "⋀a b. member a ⟹ member b ⟹ member (a ❙* b)"</p>
<p>By instantiating member by "λx. True", and simplifying "True ⟹" away we <br>
get unrestricted statements. However, after</p>
<p>interpretation mult: magma where member = "λx. True" and f = "( * )"<br>
   rewrites "⋀P. (True ⟹ PROP P) ≡ PROP P"<br>
   by (unfold_locales, simp_all)</p>
<p>mult.closed is still "True ⟹ True ⟹ True" not "True".</p>
<p>I'm happy to contribute my code and some work if someone can make this <br>
rewrites work.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Akihisa</p>

<p>I do not say that this is not possible, but IMHO there are too many open<br>
questions to tackle that on one step;  the existing algebraic type class<br>
hierarchy is essential for the HOL bootstrap e.g. wrt. numeric types<br>
without subtyping.  Personally I got used to view the class / locale<br>
dichotomy (which carries over to the sessions distinctive HOL-Algebra<br>
and HOL-Computational_Algebra) as an inherent consequence of Isabelle's<br>
higher-order logic »as it is«.</p>

I was not suggesting to remove the type classes. In fact, I believe that <br>
they are much easier to use. What I was suggesting is much less <br>
ambitous: If HOL-Algebra is overhauled, make sure the locales stand in <br>
1-1 correspondence with the classes. I agree with you that the dichotomy <br>
is necessary, but what isn't necessary but rather historical is that, <br>
e.g., naming conventions are incompatible. (Purely a usability issue, <br>
not a mathematical consideration.)</p>

A notable peculiarity of Algebra is its locale abelian_group, which is based on comm_group (groups with commutative multiplication) but with the weird twist of requiring a ring; it appears to be, in reality, the specification that a ring’s addition operator is commutative. Except that all rings have this property, and the very existence of this locale is confusing. Does anybody know any more about this?</p>
<p>Larry</p>
<p>record 'a ring = "'a monoid" +<br>

  add_monoid :: "('a, 'm) ring_scheme ⇒ ('a, 'm) monoid_scheme"<br>
  where "add_monoid R ≡ ⦇ carrier = carrier R, mult = add R, one = zero R, … = (undefined :: 'm) ⦈"</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
HOL-Algebra is a bit messy. A big part of that, I think, comes from<br>
quirks of Isabelle/HOL itself.</p>
<p>My guess would be that one can write groups either additively (G, +, 0)<br>
or multiplicatively (G, *, 1). Of course, more abstract syntax (G, ∘, e)<br>
is also possible. There are various conventions about when to use which<br>
notation – in particular, I think the convention is that if you use "+",<br>
the group is always commutative (i.e. abelian).</p>
<p>In HOL-Algebra, groups are /always/ written multiplicatively. There is<br>
no other way. When you have a ring, you can write "+" for addition, but<br>
that is not formally associated to any group. The additive group of the<br>
ring has all its properties stated w.r.t. the "*" of "add_monoid R".</p>
<p>"abelian_group" is apparently some kind of attempt to have an abelian<br>
group that is written additively. Due to the fact that the "+" operator<br>
is defined for the ring record, this requires us to use a ring record<br>
even though there is (in general) no multiplication operation. We also<br>
don't have any locale assumption that this "ring record" is an actual<br>
ring (i.e. fulfils the ring axioms). Just the addition operation in it<br>
is required to form an abelian group.</p>
<p>As for why this strange "abelian_group" locale exists, I cannot say. One<br>
would have to examine where it is used and what for.</p>
<p>I agree that it's all very confusing. Maybe it is simply the case that<br>
this ad-hoc "single-inheritance record" "locale with structure<br>
parameters" is just fraught with problems. But as far as I know, it's<br>
the only way we have in Isabelle to do abstract algebra, and I don't<br>
know of a better one. Unless we can find a way to emulate the more<br>
modular typeclass/implicit parameter approach and elaborators that<br>
systems like Coq and Lean have.</p>

<p>From: Clemens Ballarin &lt;<a href="mailto:ballarin@in.tum.de">ballarin@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Larry,</p>
<p>when reading HOL-Algebra you need to keep in mind that much of the <br>
material pre-dates modern locales.  Then locales were not based on local <br>
theories, and expressions were limited to renaming; instantiation and <br>
rewriting were unavailable.</p>
<p>The approach of combining locales with records dates back to that time.  <br>
Definitions in locales were unavailable, and the solution was to extract <br>
the signature part of an algebraic structure into a record, on which <br>
definitions could be made globally.  Locales would only deal with the <br>
specification part.</p>
<p>Regarding the locale abelian_group: an abelian group by convention is a <br>
commutative group with additive notation.  A ring then is a <br>
(multiplicative) monoid and an abelian group.  What you see is an <br>
attempt of expressing that.  Unfortunately, since there isn't multiple <br>
inheritance for records, I needed to resort to using the ring record <br>
also for abelian groups, which is, of course, awkward.</p>

Hello Clemens,</p>
<p>that's interesting. It would certainly be of interest to think of a<br>
large-scale overhaul of HOL-Algebra using modern locale features.<br>
Unfortunately, I fear that even though there is not /that/ much material<br>
building on HOL-Algebra, it would involve a lot of work.</p>
<p>I also don't think there are any "heavy" users of HOL-Algebra these days<br>
who could champion such an endeavour and come up with better designs. If<br>
there are – please come forward! (Larry had two students who might<br>
actually be the two heaviest recent users.</p>
<p>I've used HOL-Algebra sporadically over the last two years or so and<br>
would like to see it improved. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to<br>
do that myself in the foreseeable future, and I also don't think I am an<br>
ideal candidate to do it considering my lack of expertise with<br>
HOL-Algebra and locales.</p>

In IsarMathLib notation details are deferred to the presentation layer so they are not tied to definitions. Multiplicative notation happens to be used in context of semigroups, groups and abelian groups, while additive notation is used for abelian semigroups and topological groups (see Semigroup_ZF, Group_ZF, AbelianGroup_ZF and CommutativeSemigroup_ZF, TopologicalGroup_ZF at <a href="http://isarmathlib.org">isarmathlib.org</a> ).</p>
