<p>From: Johan Meier &lt;<a href="mailto:johan.meier.1@gmail.com">johan.meier.1@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi I have multiple (small and probably naive) questions</p>
<p>First question: can I insert a theorem/fact "literally" into the local<br>
facts(something like HOL.simp_thms(n)) ? (i.e. with something like<br>
back-quotes or with \open \close, like when you reference a local fact<br>
literally)? Or at least more meaningful than for example "note<br>
HOL.simp_thms(4)" ( I'm fine with let's say append_Cons, but<br>
HOL.simp_thms(i) isn't a very meaningful name. Another thing that bothers<br>
me is that HOL.simp_thms could change and, as an example, HOL.simp_thms(7)<br>
isn't the same as before ).</p>
<p>Second question:<br>
In a proof only using apply (i.e. an apply script), when a goal has<br>
assumptions written like this : "asm1 ==&gt; asm2 ==&gt; conclusion"(which often<br>
appears when proving by induction as an intermediate goal), how can I<br>
directly access/use them? Is there something like a literal access like<br>
there is for local facts with back-quotes or "&lt; &gt;"?  Or is there a way to<br>
add these assumptions to "assms"? In general, I want to use them in<br>
situations where I have to reference a fact, but with subst in particular.<br>
I know of hypsubst in combination with rot_tac (in case there are more<br>
valid equalities for substitution ) , but it feels a bit awkward ... but<br>
maybe that's just me ... "simp only" sometime does more than what is<br>
specified after "only" (i.e. trivial simplifications) and using "erule<br>
subst" only substitutes in the conclusion.</p>
<p>Just to clarify: I want to use subst instead of simp/auto etc for learning<br>
purposes, that's all.</p>
<p>Third question:<br>
what are the the differences between subst and rewrite (from<br>
"~~/src/HOL/Library/Rewrite")? Is there any documentation on that ? Or can<br>
someone give an example what rewrite can do more than  subst ?</p>
<p>Final question: can I tell hypsubst to replace only in the nth position<br>
(i.e. when there is more than one place one can substitute) ? And is it<br>
possible to tell hypsubst to read an equality instead of "a = b" as  "b =<br>
a" ?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>there are multiple possibilities here.</p>
<p>If you're in an "apply" script, you can write</p>
<p>using thm<br>
  apply -</p>
<p>This will add the theorem as a premise to the goal state.</p>
<p>If you don't want to refer to it by name, you have little choices. The<br>
closest is "subgoal_tac". It takes a proposition and inserts it into the<br>
goal state. However, you'll get a new goal and have to justify that<br>
proposition. If it's in fact something out of "HOL.simp_thms", that'll<br>
go through with "simp".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cartouche (open/close) syntax doesn't work for<br>
anything that is not a fact. That would require combing through the<br>
whole theorem name space, which may be rather slow.</p>
<p>But you might be also interested in "solve_direct", which is a command<br>
that does just that. It presents you all theorems that can solve the<br>
current goal. But in the end, you'll have to refer to the theorem by name.</p>
<p>In most cases, names are rather stable, except for maybe these "theorem<br>
grab bags". I would strongly advise against using "HOL.simp_thms" if you<br>
can avoid it. My usual approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>show P<br>
     apply simp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at the subgoal, call it P'</p>
</li>
<li>have P'<br>
     &lt;proof&gt;<br>
   then show P<br>
     by simp</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use the "subgoal" command. See §7.2, "Subgoal structure" in the<br>
Isar reference manual. There are also some examples that illustrate usage.</p>

<p>"rewrite" supports a sophisticated matching language that allows you to<br>
specify where in a term you want to rewrite. "subst" only supports<br>
"assumption" or "conclusion" and a numeric index. As far as I<br>
understand, "rewrite" is strictly more powerful than "subst".</p>
<p>However, "rewrite" doesn't seem to be document in the reference manual<br>
so far. But there are some examples:<br>
