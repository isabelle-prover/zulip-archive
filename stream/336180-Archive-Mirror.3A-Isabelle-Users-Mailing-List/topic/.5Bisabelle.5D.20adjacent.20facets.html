I'm stuck on something that feels like it ought to be easy... (again :D)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From "HOL-Analysis.Polytope", we have that a polytope is a bounded<br>
polyhedron, and so it's the intersection of a bunch of half-hyperspaces,<br>
and its facets are polytopes lying in the corresponding hyperplanes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assume F is a facet of a polytope T, embedded in hyperplane H, and E is a<br>
facet of F, embedded in hyperplane h.</p>
<p>Clearly h⊂H, and also there's another facet F' of T embedded in another<br>
hyperplane H' such that h⊂H', and therefore F and F' are adjacent facets.</p>
<p>It's easy to convince Isabelle that h⊂H, and it's easy enough to obtain the<br>
set of hyperplanes that bound T... But I don't even know how to begin to<br>
prove that (exactly) one of them other than H intersects H at h.</p>
<p>Part of my problem is that I'm working through a learning curve for<br>
Isabelle and a separate learning curve for analysis, and I'm not sure which<br>
one I'm struggling with at any given time.</p>
<p>Can anyone offer some advice here? Even just how to break this problem down<br>
into smaller steps?</p>
<p>Here's what I have so far:</p>

<p>From: Michal Wallace &lt;<a href="mailto:michal.wallace@gmail.com">michal.wallace@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Of course, right after I finally gave up and asked for help, a (partial)<br>
solution (and/or red herring)<br>
popped into my head.... I still have no idea how to formalize it, though.</p>
<p>Suppose I find a point P in h (so on the same hyperplane as facet F), but<br>
on the other side of E.<br>
Now I can draw a line segment between P and some point R in F and it will<br>
intersect E. (Assume<br>
it intersects somewhere in the middle, and not at the extreme points of E.)</p>
<p>Then, if I have a point Q in between E and R, it must be outside F...<br>
And because polytope T is convex, R must be outside T.</p>
<p>(Perhaps I need to show that convex implies that no two facets fall in the<br>
same hyperplane, but I think I can manage this...)</p>
<p>So now, if I have a third point C at the center of T (thus not in F), and I<br>
draw a line segment<br>
between C and the external point R, there must be a portion of the segment<br>
that's<br>
inside T and a portion that's outside, and so there must be another face of<br>
T that's<br>
getting intersected.</p>
<p>In fact, if I extend the line segment PR past R out to infinity, then every<br>
point in between<br>
has this same characteristic: a line segment between it and C must<br>
intersect some face of T.</p>
<p>As I bring the point Q closer and closer to E, then my line segment CQ will<br>
eventually intersect the face adjacent to F.</p>
<p>This seems like progress, but I'm still essentially where I started: I know<br>
in my head that<br>
some hyperplane supporting T has a particular property, but i have no idea<br>
how I might<br>
convince Isabelle to believe me.</p>
<p>OTOH, this seems like I'm wandering closer to what "Analysis" is actually<br>
all about,<br>
so maybe there are already some places to look in the library for<br>
inspiration, if only I<br>
know what to look for.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Thanks... :)</p>

This happens because you began with a very advanced topic. That is not a<br>
good strategy from a pedagogical point of view. It was better to do one<br>
thing at the time. If your goal is to prove Euler's formula in for<br>
polytopes, try to prove easier versions first and go increasing the<br>
complexity step by step. Your intuition about this particular problem will<br>
increase with practice. So, I recommend you to follow the following<br>
learning process:</p>
<p>1. Proof Euler's formula for graphs as an exercise of initiation. Use<br>
   graph duality: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9OUyo8NFZg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9OUyo8NFZg</a></p>

Generalize your proof to any CW-complex (these are generalizations of<br>
   graphs). To implement this one in Isabelle/HOL require more coffee than the<br>
   graph theoretical version, but it is conceptually simpler than its<br>
   particular case for the polytopes.</p>
<p>3. Prove the Euler's formula as a corollary of your result for<br>
   CW-complex. You can reduce your proof to the case of the hypercube, because<br>
   any polytope is topologically equivalent to a hypercube. For the hypercube,<br>
   Euler formula is just a calculation that you can carry out by induction on<br>
   the dimension.</p>
<p>There is some wisdom about proving theorems from Alexander Grothendieck<br>
that could be useful for computer scientists and programmers (I hope<br>
someday some will write a book entitled Grothendieck for computer<br>
scientists.). According to Grothendieck, it is easier to prove an abstract<br>
theorem than a concrete one, because in abstraction you only deal with the<br>
essential parts of the theorem whereas in the concrete case there are too<br>

<p>There's a good start on graph theory in the AFP:<br>
<a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Graph_Theory.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Graph_Theory.html</a>  It's based on directed<br>
graphs, but allows modelling undirected graphs as bi-directed graphs.<br>
It looks like it defines spanning trees, and cycles, but I'd have to define<br>
faces and duals... Maybe that won't be hard?</p>

<p>Okay, but I don't understand what CW-complex is. I don't understand any of<br>
the following terms yet: homotopy, closed ball, attaching map, covered,<br>
Hausdorf space, homeomorphism, boundary... Those are just from the first<br>
two paragraphs on the wikipedia description. I do believe you when you say<br>
that it's easier to express these ideas with CW complexes, but...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a way, this <em>seems</em> like it's sort of like saying: the program I want to<br>
write in C would be easier to express in ML, but I only have access to a C<br>
compiler, so in order to express things in that nice elegant way, I have to<br>
first implement ML in C...</p>
<p>Once the cost of implementing ML (or CW) is added to the budget, the "hard"<br>
way probably turns out to be quicker.</p>
<p>Am I wrong about this? Is there an introductory book about CW complexes<br>
that defines everything step by step that I could follow? Or...<br>
alternatively, do you see this stuff already existing under different names<br>
in Isabelle? Or... Do you feel like writing a CW-complex theory? :D</p>
<p>(To be fair, the available language for discussing polytopes in Isabelle is<br>
turning out to be pretty limited, too, but at least I have vague memories<br>
of high school geometry to fall back on... )</p>

<p>How can I demonstrate that a polytope has connected edges, the way a graph<br>
(or presumably a CW complex) does?</p>
<p>To me this means that two edges share a vertex, or two faces share an edge,<br>
and so on in higher dimensions... Which is to say that they are adjacent,<br>
and we're back to my original question: how to show that such things exist?</p>

<p>I like this idea, and in fact, I've found myself reusing it repeatedly<br>
already: in proving the polyhedron formula for simplices, I wound up giving<br>
names to all sorts of things that were being referred to implicitly (like<br>
vertices and d-faces and whatnot).</p>
<p>Yesterday I hit on the idea of giving a name to the halfspaces of a<br>
polytope, and was able to show that if a point exists in one half-space but<br>
isn't inside the polyhedron, then there must be a half-space that doesn't<br>
contain it (and thus at least one facet separating it from the polytope)...<br>
I think with this I can eventually show that there's some sequence of<br>
intersecting hyperplanes connecting this new face from the one in the first<br>
hyperplane, (and therefore the Nth face in the sequence is adjacent to the<br>
Nth+1), but I'm not quite there yet...</p>

<p>From: Michal Wallace &lt;<a href="mailto:michal.wallace@gmail.com">michal.wallace@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Update:  I worked out an informal proof that describes how to identify an<br>
adjacent facet of a polytope.<br>
Now (other than cleaning up my inevitable mistakes and oversights) I just<br>
need to figure out how to express it in Isabelle.</p>
<p>Basically, I'm going to approach this by induction on the number of<br>
supporting hyperplanes that aren't in a "discarded" set:</p>
<p>- If I'm down to one hyperplane, I'm pretty sure I can prove it's the one<br>
I want.</p>
<p>- If I find the hyperplane containing adjacent facet along the way,<br>
that's good, too.</p>
<p>- Otherwise, I look at a potential candidate, throw it out, and then<br>
recurse.</p>
<p>So far, induction rules in Isabelle are a bit mysterious to me, so my next<br>
stop is to review the docs and<br>
code for induction, to try and understand how to make a custom induction<br>
rule for this.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of an example proof that does anything similar to this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>( work-in-progress psuedo-proof follows )</p>

   polytope T is defined by a finite number of half-spaces, each defined<br>
   by a hyperplane containing exactly one facet. *)</p>
<p>lemma adjacent_face:<br>
  assumes "polytope T"<br>
      and "H in halfspaces_of T" and "HP = defining-hyperplane-of H"<br>

E.<br>
           I'm calling this "P convex with F through E", because I don't<br>
know a better term yet. *)</p>
<p>(* 'discarded' is a set of half-spaces of T that we know are not<br>

<p>- obtain such H' HP' (* I can already do this much *)</p>
<p>- if N=1 then THE F' where (F' facet_of T &amp; F' SUBSET HP') must be<br>
adjacent to F<br>
    proof (* adjacent faces must exist, or else there'd be a 'hole'<br>

<p>Ideally, this fact would be sufficient to show that the<br>
adjacent facet<br>
             exists, and I wouldn't need to do any induction to obtain it,<br>

             there are multiple faces, it's always possible that no matter<br>
how<br>
             close P gets to E, any facet cutting it off from P could fail<br>
to be<br>
             adjacent to F because there's some other tiny facet in between.<br>
             But, with only 1 possible facet left, it has to be the one<br>
closing<br>
             the gap.</p>
<p>*) sorry</p>
<p>- if N &gt; 1 then the face adjacent with F through E is in (facets<br>

<p>- then show ?thesis<br>
    proof (cases "E is a subset of HP'")<br>
      case True:</p>
<p>- thus F and F' are adjacent by shared facet E, and we have what we<br>
were looking for.<br>
          proof (* face E is in both hyperplanes, and no two facets can be<br>
in the same hyperplane. *)<br>
                (* so... this is what we were looking for. *) sorry<br>
      case False:</p>
<p>- then HP' does not contain E<br>
        - then either HP' is a supporting hyperplane of E, OR they are<br>
completely disjoint<br>
          (* HP' can't intersect E somewhere in the middle, because that<br>
would remove<br>
             part of E from T and we know E is a subset of T *)</p>
<p>- either way, this isn't the face we're looking on, so recurse on<br>
(discarded insert H')</p>

You could avoid your problem using the following approach:<br>
1- the Euler characteristic is a topological invariant, i.e., it is<br>
invariant under homeomorphisms.<br>
2- any polytope is homeomorphic to an hypercube.<br>
3- the Euler characteristic of a hypercube is 1.</p>
<p>Notice that:</p>
<p>A 0-cube is just a point. So, its Euler characteristic is 1 = 1.</p>
<p>A 1-cube is a segment. Notice that a segment has 2 vertices and 1 edge. So,<br>
its  Euler, characteristic is 2 - 1 = 1.</p>
<p>In the case of a 2-cube (a square), you have 4 vertices, 4 edges and 1<br>
face. So, its Euler characteristic is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.</p>
<p>the general proof is by induction on the dimension.</p>

The proof is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This is true for an n-dimensional simplex (just proceed by induction on<br>
the dimension).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any polytope can be expresses as a union of adjacent simplexes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Imagine a square A B C D draw from A to B to C to D and then to A again.<br>
For example, given the 1-face AB, you want to prove that there is a 1-face<br>
which is adjacent to AB (in this case AC or BD are the answers).</p>
<p>Divide the square A B C D into two triangles A B D and C B D.  Notice that<br>
A B is adjacent to B D by definition. Also, C B is adjacent to A B by<br>
definition.</p>

<p>If you want to visualice higher dimensions, you need to see pictures of<br>
higher dimensional objects in the plane, close your eyes and try to<br>
reconstruct the picture in your head. It require some practice, but it<br>
work! Here is an introduction to visualization of higher dimensions:<br>
