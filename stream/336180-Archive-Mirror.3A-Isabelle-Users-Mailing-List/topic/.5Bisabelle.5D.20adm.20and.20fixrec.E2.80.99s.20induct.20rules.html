<p>From: Joachim Breitner &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@joachim-breitner.de">mail@joachim-breitner.de</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Brian,</p>
<p>I have been working some more with HOLCF (although my supervisers warned<br>
me that I might run into difficulties or make life harder for me...),<br>
and I have some suggestions and some questions. I hope you don’t mind me<br>
accosting them to you, and remember that these really are only<br>
suggestions, not requests :-)</p>
<p>First I noticed that I tend to have a lot of admissibility statements to<br>
proof. With the lemmas provided in Adm.thy, this is usually not a big<br>
problem. I wonder if it would be sensible to take a similar approach<br>
than taken with cont2cont: I.e. have a ruleset adm2adm that I can amend,<br>
so that I can just use "apply (intros adm2adm)" without listing all my<br>
custon adm rules, and be done in most cases. Or possibly "apply (intros<br>
adm2adm cont2cont)", if some rules involve continuity claims, such as<br>
this one I wrote:</p>
<hr>
<p>lemma adm_single_valued:<br>
 assumes "cont (λx. f x)"<br>
 shows "adm (λx. single_valued (f x))"<br>
using assms<br>
unfolding single_valued_def<br>
by (intro adm_lemmas adm_not_mem cont2cont adm_subst[of f])</p>
<hr>
<p>My next question is about pattern matching in fixrec equations. At the<br>
moment, fixrec only supports very few constructors in patterns, and the<br>
Discr constructor is not supported. Therefore, I have only one equation<br>
with a large case expression then, which makes the .induct rule<br>
relatively unpleasant to work with (compared with, e.g., the function<br>
package). I’d be glad if I could use the Discr constructor in patterns,<br>
and I’d be even more pleased if arbitrary patterns can be used inside<br>
the Discr constructor. </p>
<p>And finaly, I’d like to have some advice. I tried to proof a statement<br>
"P f" about the function f defined by fixrec, using f.induct. I noticed<br>
that it would be easier if I know "Q f", so I proved that (again using<br>
f.induct). Turning back to the proof of "P f", I found out that the<br>
lemma "Q f" is useless, as in the inductive proof of "P f" I am not<br>
working with f, but rather an approximation.</p>
<p>I worked around it by proving P and Q simultaneously in one induction,<br>
but the proof is becoming illegibly convoluted.</p>
<p>Is there maybe a cleaner and more idiomatic way of handing such a case?<br>
I’m afraid that if I continue this way, in the end all statements of my<br>
projects will be proven in one huge induct rule. And Isabelle is already<br>
moving slowly inside the induct proof.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support,<br>
Joachim<br>

<p>Hi Joachim,</p>
<p>You can easily create your own named rulesets using the Named_Thms ML<br>
functor, like this:</p>
<p>ML {*<br>
structure Adm2Adm = Named_Thms<br>
(<br>
  val name = "adm2adm"<br>
  val description = "admissibility intro rule"<br>
)<br>
*}<br>
setup Adm2Adm.setup</p>
<p>This defines a dynamic theorem list called "adm2adm", as well as an<br>
attribute called "adm2adm" that will add a theorem to the list. You<br>
can then populate the ruleset with pre-existing rules from Adm.thy<br>
using a declare statement:</p>
<p>declare &lt;names of adm rules&gt; [adm2adm]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You can extend fixrec by associating match combinators with new<br>
constructors, using the Fixrec.add_matchers ML command. To see how to<br>
do this, look at my latest update to List_Cpo.thy, where I set up Nil<br>
and Cons to work with fixrec:</p>
<p><a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/3989b2b44dba">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/3989b2b44dba</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately this won't work for all constructors -- fixrec has some<br>
hard-wired assumptions about the kinds of constructors it will work<br>
with. For one, it assumes that the arguments to the constructor will<br>
all have types in class cpo. This means that the "Discr" and "Def"<br>
constructors won't work, because their argument types are generally<br>
not cpos.</p>
<p>I'd like to relax this restriction, but doing so would require<br>
rewriting fixrec's pattern-match compiler, which I don't really have<br>
time to do right now -- I need to finish my dissertation first!</p>

<p>I'm afraid that with the foo.induct rules currently produced by<br>
fixrec, you're probably stuck doing the simultaneous inductions.<br>
Fortunately it is possible to create a stronger induction rule, but<br>
unfortunately fixrec does not generate such a rule for you. (It's on<br>
my long list of things to do after I finish my degree :)</p>
<p>Here's how fixrec currently generates its induction rules: When you<br>
define a recursive constant "foo :: 'a", fixrec builds a functional<br>
"foo_rec :: 'a =&gt; 'a", and defines foo as its least fixed-point: "foo<br>
== fix$(LAM f. foo_rec f)".</p>
<p>Then fixrec uses the "fix_ind" lemma to generate an induction rule for foo:</p>
<p>lemma fix_ind:<br>
  assumes "adm P" and "P \&lt;bottom&gt;" and "!!x. P x ==&gt; P (F$x)"<br>
  shows "P (fix$F)"</p>
<p>The problem is that fix_ind is weaker than it could be. Here is a<br>
stronger form of induction for least fixed-points that could be used<br>
instead:</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  assumes "adm P" and "!!n. P (iterate n$F$\&lt;bottom&gt;)"<br>
  shows "P (fix$F)"</p>
<p>So here's what I'd <em>like</em> fixrec to do: In addition to defining "foo<br>
== fix$(LAM f. foo_rec f)", also define another nat-indexed sequence<br>
of approximations to foo: "foo_chain n == iterate n$(LAM f. foo_rec<br>
f)$\&lt;bottom&gt;". Then it could generate an unfolding rule:</p>
<p>"foo_chain (Suc n) = foo_rec (foo_chain n)"</p>
<p>and a strong induction rule:</p>
<p>"adm P ==&gt; (!!n. P (foo_chain n)) ==&gt; P foo"</p>
<p>I think such a rule would allow you to prove separate lemmas about<br>
foo_chain, and re-use them inside later inductions. This way you could<br>
avoid having to do those big simultaneous inductions you complained<br>
about. Even without automation from fixrec, it might be worthwhile to<br>
define the extra constant and prove the extra rules manually.</p>

Dear Brian,</p>
<p>I’d like to try that, but here, the symbol "foo_rec" is not known. And<br>
looking at src/HOLCF/Tools/fixrec.ML (without understanding much), I can<br>
not find a string ending in "rec" anywhere. The _def theorems generated<br>
by fixrec seem to contain the equations of my functions directly. Are<br>
you sure that the _rec symbol is actually generated?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Joachim<br>

<p>From: Brian Huffman &lt;<a href="mailto:brianh@cs.pdx.edu">brianh@cs.pdx.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Sorry, I guess what I said was a bit misleading. There is no "foo_rec"<br>
constant. I only meant "foo_rec" to stand for the functional (a<br>
possibly large lambda term) of which "foo" is the least fixed-point.</p>
<p>Maybe a more explicit example will my suggestion more clear.</p>
<p>domain 'a llist = LNil | LCons (lazy 'a) (lazy "'a llist")</p>
<p>fixrec repeat :: "'a -&gt; 'a llist" where "repeat$a = LCons$a$(repeat$a)"</p>
<p>These lemmas are generated by fixrec:</p>
<p>repeat_def: "repeat == fix$(LAM r a. LCons$a$(r$a))"<br>
repeat.unfold: "repeat = (LAM a. LCons$a$(repeat$a))"<br>
repeat.simps: "repeat$a = LCons$a$(repeat$a)"<br>
repeat.induct: "adm P ==&gt; P \&lt;bottom&gt; ==&gt; (!!x. P x ==&gt; P (LAM a.<br>
LCons$a$(x$a))) ==&gt; P repeat"</p>
<p>And I would suggest that you also define</p>
<p>repeat_chain :: "nat =&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a llist"<br>
"repeat_chain n == iterate n$(LAM r a. LCons$a$(r$a))$\&lt;bottom&gt;"</p>
<p>and prove the lemmas</p>
<p>"repeat_chain (Suc n) = (LAM a. LCons$a$(repeat_chain n$a))"<br>
"adm P ==&gt; (!!n. P (repeat_chain n)) ==&gt; P repeat"</p>

Hi Brian,</p>
<p>ah, I see. Although it would be nice to have the foo_chain defined, in<br>
my case, it would be too ugly (the lambda-term I’d have to copy’n’paste<br>
would just be too ugly large :-). I’ll try to work with one big<br>
induction proof now.</p>
<p>But thanks for the suggestion.</p>
