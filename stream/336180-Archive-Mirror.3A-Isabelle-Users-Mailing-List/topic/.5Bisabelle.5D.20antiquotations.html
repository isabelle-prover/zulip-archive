I'm having some trouble using antiquotations.</p>
<p>I find, for example that</p>
<p>val ls_sp = @{simproc let_simp} ;</p>
<p>works fine,  but</p>
<p>val ncn_sp = @{simproc natless_cancel_numerals} ;</p>
<p>doesn't work, message is<br>
 ***    ERROR "Undefined simplification procedure: <br>
\"natless_cancel_numerals\""</p>
<p>(and many more that I've tried also don't work).</p>
<p>How should I use these antiquotations?</p>
<p>Another problem I've found with antiquotations is that commenting them <br>
out doesn't work properly, thus</p>
<p>val ls_sp = @{simproc let_simp} ;<br>
(*<br>
val ncn_sp = @{simproc natless_cancel_numerals} ;<br>
*)</p>
<p>produces the same error message about natless_cancel_numerals</p>

<p>Hmmm... It seems that the difference is that "let_simp" was declared <br>
using the "simproc_setup" command (in HOL.thy), and the declaration of <br>
"natless_cancel_numerals" still happens using the (imperative) ML <br>
operations. This might be the reason for the anomaly, though I am not sure.</p>

<p>Yes, this is probably worth improving: At the stage where the <br>
antiquotations are expended, comments are not taken into account.</p>
<p>I am sure, Makarius can comment on these issues when he is back from <br>
vacation.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Having studied the recent threads on the "effect of use_thy", <br>
"antiquotations" etc. here is a summary in my own words, together with <br>
some additional hints on how to avoid problems with old ways of doing <br>
things, and moving on towards more powerful concepts.</p>
<p>* ML code should be used within a proper theory only, with explicit <br>
    "uses" declarations for the theory header specification for any "use"  <br>
    command in the body.  Inline "ML" commands work without further ado.</p>
<p>For historical reasons, the theory loader is a bit too liberal in <br>
    skimping over ill-specified dependencies, which occasionally results <br>
    in confusing situations, where the loader and the user disagree on the <br>
    state of a theory being fully loaded.  This will improve eventually, <br>
    as we remove more legacy features, especially the possibility of <br>
    loading ML files ``after a theory'', which has caused endless trouble <br>
    ever since it was introduced many years ago.  (Long ago this feature <br>
    was really needed, because it was impossible to prove theorems within <br>
    a theory body, which is hard to believe today.)</p>
<p>* The raw interactive ML toplevel is mostly obsolete.  After many years <br>
    of the two toplevels side-by-side, we have finally passed the turning <br>
    point where everything is Isar, and ML is smoothly integrated into <br>
    that.  Proper context-dependent antiquotations are just one benefit <br>
    from this principle, and typing additional ML {* *} should be a small <br>
    price to pay in current Proof General (adding a key binding to produce <br>
    that wrapping should be trivial anyway).</p>
<p>Further benefits of turning everything into Isar transactions will <br>
    become more relevant in the future.  The point is that this uniform <br>
    arrangement allows the Isar toplevel to ``manage'' isolated <br>
    executions.  For example, it enables to schedule transactions <br>
    concurrently (which is still limited to whole theory files in <br>
    Isabelle2007).  Or just think of interrupting individual Isar commands <br>
    instead of the whole Isabelle process with all its concurrent <br>
    transactions being worked on at some point.</p>
<p>If you really need the bare-metal feeling of the raw ML toplevel (e.g. <br>
    for special debugging situations), here is an easy way to get it with <br>
    proper Isar context, but without antiquotations:</p>
<p>theory A imports B begin<br>
      exit               (<em>leaving Isar for now</em>)<br>
      ML&gt; ...            (<em>raw ML text here</em>)<br>
      ML&gt; Isar.loop();   (<em>back to normal</em>)</p>
<p>This also works within a proof or locale contexte etc.</p>
<p>* ML functions that refer to the old-style (dynamic) context, such as <br>
    "the_context" and "thm" are very hard to understand exactly and should <br>
    be replaced more and more by proper antiquotations (which are <br>
    statically scoped at compile-time).</p>
<p>This means that pointing your finger at some bits of ML code, you <br>
    already know its context (i.e. where your finger is within the <br>
    Isabelle/Isar text), and any terms, thms etc. being referenced by <br>
    antiquotation are fixed values wrt. to that context.  Moreover there <br>
    is some degree of static checking of formal references.  For example, <br>
    @{const_name wf} or @{thm wf_induct} will only compile if these <br>
    entities are well-formed according to the compile-time context.</p>
<p>Slightly more delicate issues arise when ML implementations are moved <br>
    between contexts along with logical entities, by re-interpreting <br>
    general ``declarations'' wrt. to a given morphism.  Some recent papers <br>
    and talks by Chaieb/Wenzel explain these advanced concepts further.</p>
<p>* The expander for antiquotations is ignorant of ML syntax.  In <br>
    particular, Isar entities referenced inside ML comments are still <br>
    statically checked, which might occasionally appear more rigid than <br>
    expected.</p>
<p>At some later stage, the expansion mechanism might learn bits of ML <br>
    syntax (which is quite delicate), so this could be liberalized <br>
    eventually.  A more interesting application of ML syntax interacting <br>
    with Isar antiquotations is to produce different code in ML pattern <br>
    positions (of fun/case/let) vs. plain ML expressions.</p>
<p>* The @{theory} antiquotation requires special care, because it produces <br>
    a static reference to the current theory value, which is still <br>
    developed further in the present theory body.  If the ML environment <br>
    somehow keeps this value persistently, it is likely to cause ``stale <br>
    theory'' errors when accessed later.  As explained in the rudimentary <br>
    "Isabelle/Isar Implementation Manual", theory certificates work like a <br>
    linear type in ML, but a persistent @{theory} value violates the <br>
    linearity restriction.</p>
<p>In the worst case, one needs to keep a @{theory_ref} instead, which is <br>
    a sliding theory reference that never becomes stale, but may evolve <br>
    monotonically without further notice (just like the implicit theory <br>
    reference present within any @{context}, @{thm}, or @{cterm} value).</p>
<p>Luckily, raw theory values are rarely required these days, since <br>
    Proof.context has taken over its role to represent ``the context'' <br>
    most of the time. (In new-style local theory specifications, such as <br>
    definitions within a locale, the context is disguised as local_theory, <br>
    which is of the same ML type Proof.context, but holds additional <br>
    target information to tell how results are processed).</p>

<p>Thanks for this - I think I understand this point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your ML code fails to produce <br>
any result here, because it references bool_axioms in the raw ML <br>
environment, without going through the Isar layer, which would have <br>

<p>However I don't understand this - as I said in my earlier email, exactly <br>
the same ML code _does_ produce the desired result later on.  So why <br>
does the _same_ ML expression behave _differently_ at different points <br>
?  Both the points where the ML expression bool_axioms RL [fun_cong] is <br>
used occur _after_ the point where fun is shown to be in the<br>
axclass boolean_class  (I understand that this is what the problem was).<br>
Using a proper ML antiquotation makes things work as expected:</p>
<p>@{thms bool_axioms} RL [fun_cong]</p>
<p>I gather your point is that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>@{thms bool_axioms}</p>
<p>transfers bool_axioms to the current theory.  But this is exactly what I <br>
don't want!<br>
My complaint is that the _same_ ML expression bool_axioms RL [fun_cong] <br>
behaves differently between (a) where I put it in the theory file, where <br>
it doesn't work, and (b) when I use it later, in trying to debug the <br>
problem.  I want the same expression to have the same meaning when I am <br>
trying to debug it as the meaning it has when it fails to work! </p>
<p>Incidentally, some years ago I discovered that thms "bool_axioms" <br>
retrieves the theorems<br>
bool_axioms, after transferring them to the current theory.  I asked how <br>
to retrieve named theorem(s) without transferring them to the current <br>
theory - no one then seemed to know.  Does anyone know how to do this?</p>
<p>Further questions from my previous email, whose answers would, I hope, <br>
help me to understand the complexities of theories in Isar:</p>
<p>theory_of_thm (hd bool_axioms); produces a different result inside the <br>
Isar file<br>
from the result it gives afterwards.  Why is this?</p>
<p>If I understand correctly the_context () returns the current theory as <br>
at the point where it is executed.  Is that correct?  </p>
<p>The difficulty in using Isar seems to be that the current theory keeps <br>
on changing, much more than with typical .ML proof files. Is this correct? </p>
<p>So far as I understood the previous emails,<br>
ML {* XXX the_context  () <em>} and ML {</em> XXX@{theory} *} would only return <br>
a different result if the code represented by XXX actually changed the <br>
current theory.  Is that correct?</p>
<p>A further question from a previous email (the answer given then was to <br>
use a different function) : bind_thm(s) seems to sometimes work (in the <br>
sense of storing a theorem in the database so that it can be effectively <br>
retrieved later).  Why is this?  What is the difference between bind_thm <br>
and the function I was told to use (ie, PureThy.add_thmss)?</p>
<p>Finally, is all this stuff documented anywhere?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that the ML environment is not the real <br>
thing, just a low-level view on the implementation platform.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what this means, but it is the language in which enormous <br>
amounts of Isabelle proofs are and have been written - and it is still <br>
the only language for doing lots of things (including some fairly <br>
mundane things, as my theory file showed) in Isabelle.</p>

trying to debug the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your radio doesn't work in the cellar, but does work in the living<br>
room, then you cannot debug the problem in the living room. You have to<br>
go to the cellar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want the same expression to have the same meaning when I am trying<br>
to debug it as the meaning it has when it fails to work!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should debug it in the same context: Open the offending theory in<br>
PG, step to the point until it breaks, and debug it there. Then you<br>
should be able to see what the problem is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I understand correctly the_context () returns the current theory<br>
as at the point where it is executed.  Is that correct?<br>
[...]<br>
So far as I understood the previous emails, ML {* XXX the_context  ()<br>
<em>} and ML {</em> XXX@{theory} *} would only return a different result if<br>
the code represented by XXX actually changed the current theory.  Is<br>
that correct?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. Strictly speaking, the behaviour of the_context () is completely<br>
unspecified: Since theories can be loaded in parallel, you could get<br>
almost anything, including a theory that is currently developing in a<br>
different thread. The "current context" is not defined in terms of the<br>
point in time when something is executed. It must be given statically,<br>
by the location in the theory source. The @{theory} antiquotation does that.</p>
<p>Let me repeat: If you use "the_context ()" in production code, it will<br>
break with obscure errors sooner or later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A further question from a previous email (the answer given then was<br>
to use a different function) : bind_thm(s) seems to sometimes work<br>
(in the sense of storing a theorem in the database so that it can be<br>
effectively retrieved later).  Why is this?  What is the difference<br>
between bind_thm and the function I was told to use (ie,<br>
PureThy.add_thmss)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read the answer from its type:</p>
<p>bind_thms         : string * Thm.thm list -&gt; unit<br>
PureThy.add_thmss : ((bstring * Thm.thm list) * Thm.attribute list) list<br>
                 -&gt; Context.theory -&gt; Thm.thm list list * Context.theory</p>
<p>Since bind_thms is impure, it can only update some global reference<br>
hanging around. This is incompatible with paralellism. At the moment it<br>
may work sometimes, but it is guaranteed to break sooner or later.</p>
<p>These changes are necessary, since the ability to process theories in<br>
paralell decides whether you can use the 15 extra cores in your next CPU :-)</p>
<p>You can usually tell these "dont-use" functions from the type: If you<br>
feel they should depend on or change the theory or context, and this is<br>
not explicit in the type, then this is calling for trouble.</p>
<p>Since my comments above are a little non-constructive ("don't do this"),<br>
I had another look at the theory you sent recently. You just need to<br>
change a few things to avoid all the trouble.</p>
<ol>
<li>Instead of the (evil, imperative) bind_thms, use a proper<br>
declaration. On the theory level, the "setup" command will do what you<br>
need. It takes an ML snippet of type "theory -&gt; theory". In your example:</li>
</ol>
<p>setup {*<br>
   let<br>
     val boolexp = @{thm "boolexp"} ;</p>
<p>val bool_axioms = Seq.list_of (EVERY'<br>
       [REPEAT o dresolve_tac [conjunct1, conjunct2], REPEAT o etac allE,<br>
atac] 1<br>
         (boolexp RS revcut_rl)) ;<br>
   in<br>
     snd o PureThy.add_thmss [(("bool_axioms", bool_axioms), [])]<br>
   end<br>
*}</p>
<p>will do the right thing. If you find the syntax of PureThy.add_thmss too<br>
complicated, just define yourself a shortcut:</p>
<p>ML {*<br>
   fun save_thms (name, thms) =<br>
     snd o PureThy.add_thmss [((name, thms), [])]<br>
*}</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use antiquotations to refer to things from the context. Don't use the<br>
imperative "thm" or "thms". They have no context, so they are bad :-).</li>
</ol>
<p>I recognise that it is hard to "unlearn" these things when they have<br>
worked for you all the years. But it is really necessary to change them <br>
(and thus break backwards compatibility) in order to bring Isabelle <br>
forward.  But in the end, it should not be so difficult to solve your <br>
concrete problems.</p>
<p>I hope this helps... Please don't hesitate to ask if you run into more <br>
problems, and include theory files whenever you can.</p>
<p>All the best,<br>
Alex</p>

Dear Jeremy,</p>
<p>the reason for this effect is that each theorem contains an ML reference<br>
pointing to the theory it has been proved in (or been looked up in). The<br>
theorems contained in bool_axioms refer to some intermediate theory that<br>
does not yet contain the information that fun is in boolean_class. However,<br>
as soon as your theory has been completely processed, all theorems that<br>
have been proved in the preceeding intermediate theories are promoted to<br>
theorems that are also valid in the final theory. This is done by<br>
(imperatively!) updating the theory references contained in the theorems,<br>
which explains why the very same ML expression (denoting a data structure<br>
containing a reference) suddenly behaves in a different way.</p>
<p>This usage of references might indeed seem a bit strange at first sight,<br>
but it seems to be the only way to achieve that definitions and proofs<br>
may be intermixed within the same theory, which was impossible with the<br>
implementation of theories we had in Isabelle more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>An effect similar to the one that you have noticed can be produced by<br>
executing the ML command</p>
<p>Type.of_sort (Sign.tsig_of (theory_of_thm (hd bool_axioms)))<br>
     (Type ("fun", [TFree ("'a", HOLogic.typeS), TFree ("'b", ["BI.boolean_class"])]),<br>
      ["BI.boolean_class"])</p>
<p>for checking whether a function type is a member of boolean_class. This<br>
expression returns "false" when executed inside your theory, but "true"<br>
when executed outside your theory, because the theory returned by<br>
"theory_of_thm ..." is changed when closing the theory.</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>

<p>In principle you can do this, but this requires extra bookeeping of some <br>
kind of ``thread data environment''.  In post-Isabelle2007 we already have <br>
this for the "print_mode", which is now thread-safe without giving up the <br>
slightly odd "setmp" idiom. Such contraptions should be the exeption, not <br>
the rule.</p>
<p>Even Java programmers have started to envy powerful concepts of purely <br>
functional programming, which partly explains the current excitement about <br>
Scala.</p>

<p>In principle yes.  This is a bit like the Holo Deck in Startrek TNG, which <br>
is sufficiently powerful to simulate another Enterprise with another fully <br>
functional Holo Deck inside -- potentially ad infinitum.  In the end it is <br>
a matter of practical concern which level to take as primary one, which as <br>
secondary, and stop the nesting at some point.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Since the Isar toplevel is more powerful than the raw ML one, the choice <br>
of preference is clear to me.  Also you don't want your ``operating <br>
system'' code (i.e. the Isar infrastructure) pasted into your application <br>
code.  Moreover, we have recently started to repair some defects in <br>
versions of SML/ML, by passing through our management of ML sources within <br>
Isar.</p>

<p>See appendix A.2 of the fragmentary Isabelle/Isar implementation manual. <br>

<p>In rare situations, user code may also have to synchronize things <br>

<p>You can look at the Isar implementation to find out the details, just for <br>

<p>Basically none.  You can refer to the compile time context using <br>
@{context}, or get a runtime context as explicit functional argument from <br>
somewhere else.  For example, a proof method is essentially a function <br>
Proof.context -&gt; args -&gt; tactic, and your implementation will be something <br>
like (fn ctxt =&gt; fn args =&gt; ...), so you get the context ``by induction <br>
hypothesis'' over the structure of your program.</p>
<p>Concerning theorem lookup, ProofContext.get_thm: Proof.context -&gt; thmref<br>
-&gt; thm enables to retrieve named facts from a given context, but it is<br>
rarely useful within abstract code, because the name spacing rules behind <br>
this are quite delicate.  Better refer to proper theorem <em>values</em> <br>
directly, either via @{thm ...} at compile time, or by using well-typed <br>
interfaces to derived context data, such as DatatypePackage.the_datatype <br>
or similar operations of whatever tool you build yourself.</p>
<p>The general idea of strongly-typed context data is explained in section <br>
1.1 in the Isabelle/Isar implementation manual.</p>

<p>Yes, the simpset() form is indeed a legacy feature.  If it occurs in <br>
one-shot scripts, it can usually be replaced by the static version <br>
@{simpset}; the same for @{claset} or @{clasimpset}.</p>
<p>Your application sounds more like requiring a run-time context, though. So <br>
assuming you have a proper value (ctxt: Proof.context) already, you may <br>
get the simpset component like this:</p>
<p>local_simpset_of ctxt</p>
<p>and then add your stuff to the result.</p>

<p>Most likely, no antiquotations will get involved here, because you are <br>
working only with a runtime context.  You still need to get hold of that, <br>
i.e. ``by induction over the structure of your code'' as explained <br>
earlier.</p>

Dear Jeremy,</p>
<p>That depends on the application.</p>
<p>You use "setup", when you want to apply the function to the current <br>
theory at that point in the source. This can be used e.g. to</p>
<p>- install new commands, methods and attributes</p>
<p>- Do something else (definitions, proofs or anything) at a<br>
    specific point.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are adding something like a method (=Isar <br>
version of a tactic), then you are usually given a theory (or a <br>
Proof.context) by the framework.</p>
<p>Can you describe your application (i.e. what does "addsm" do and how <br>
should it be used on a theory), then I can be more concrete.</p>

<p>Having studied the recent threads on the "effect of use_thy", <br>
"antiquotations" etc. here is a summary in my own words, together with <br>
some additional hints on how to avoid problems with old ways of doing <br>
things, and moving on towards more powerful concepts.</p>
<p>* The raw interactive ML toplevel is mostly obsolete.  After many years <br>
    of the two toplevels side-by-side, we have finally passed the turning <br>
    point where everything is Isar, and ML is smoothly integrated into <br>
    that.  Proper context-dependent antiquotations are just one benefit <br>
    from this principle, and typing additional ML {* *} should be a small <br>
    price to pay in current Proof General (adding a key binding to produce <br>
    that wrapping should be trivial anyway).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the integration isn't "smooth".  In fact I'm working on a <br>
project now where it is demanded that everything is in Isar, so I have <br>
to try to work in this way.  And it is incredibly frustrating, because <br>
things seem to sometimes work, and sometimes not, with no apparent <br>
reason, seemingly randomly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mostly my problems are something do to with theories.  I don't know if <br>
the problems I've faced today are because of theories or not, but I <br>
think it is quite likely.  But I waste an enormous amount of time trying <br>
to cope with things that don't work as expected.  What is a simple job <br>
when I'm doing proofs using "the raw interactive ML toplevel" becomes <br>
slow and frustrating when I try to use Isar as much as possible, while <br>
using ML for the things not available in Isar.</p>
<p>The latest example is contained in the attached theory file.<br>
For some reason the ML expression bool_axioms RL [fun_cong] produces an <br>
empty list of results when it appears in the theory file being loaded.</p>
<p>After the theory file is modified in the way shown (ie not using <br>
bool_axioms RL [fun_cong]) it loads OK.  Then, after that, the <br>
expression bool_axioms RL [fun_cong]<br>
returns exactly the results expected.  Why does the same ML expression <br>
behave differently at different points ?</p>
<p>Why is this?  I suspect it is to do with theories, and noted that<br>
theory_of_thm (hd bool_axioms); produces a different result inside the <br>
Isar file<br>
from the result it gives afterwards.  Why is this?</p>
<p>I waste an enormous amount of time trying to cope with things that don't <br>
work as expected.  When a proof works fine at the terminal, but doesn't <br>
work when you put it into a theory file and load that theory file, <br>
debugging the situation is very difficult. (This is quite apart from the <br>
fact that debugging Isar is naturally more difficult than debugging ML, <br>
because when you load an ML proof file that fails, the theorems proved <br>
prior to the failure are there for you to use).</p>
<p>Something that is a simple job when I'm doing proofs solely in ML <br>
becomes slow and frustrating when I try to use Isar as much as possible <br>
(and ML for the things not available in Isar.)  Often it seems to be <br>
something to do with theories.  And although I've been using Isabelle <br>
for over 10 years now, it seems that these difficulties have only arisen <br>
in the last few years, and mostly to do with trying to use Isar.  In <br>
short, using Isar is so much more difficult than using pure ML for <br>
proofs. (Of course, learning two languages instead of one is no doubt <br>
part of the reason also).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* ML functions that refer to the old-style (dynamic) context, such as <br>
    "the_context" and "thm" are very hard to understand exactly and should <br>
    be replaced more and more by proper antiquotations (which are <br>
    statically scoped at compile-time).</p>
<p>If I understand correctly the_context () returns the current theory as <br>
at the point where it is executed.  Is that correct?  If so, it doesn't <br>
seem so hard to understand.  But - again I may be wrong here - the <br>
difficulty in using Isar seems to be that the current theory keeps on <br>
changing, much more than with typical .ML proof files.<br>
So far as I understood the previous emails,<br>
ML {* XXX the_context  () <em>} and ML {</em> XXX@{theory} *} would only return <br>
a different result if the code represented by XXX actually changed the <br>
current theory.  Is that correct?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, attached is the theory file that has taken so much of my time.<br>
If the experts could tell me why bffcs0 is different from bffcs1-3, I'd <br>
be grateful.</p>

As explained in the Isar Implementation Manual, theory acts like a linear <br>
type.  The "Stale theory" error indicates that it has been used in <br>
non-linerar fashion.</p>
<p>Note that @{theory} is rarely used in production code, only in one-liner <br>

The canonical documentation for Isabelle/ML is the "implementation"<br>
manual. You can look at the index for Isar.goal or use Isabelle/jEdit to<br>
make a hypersearch for it on all documentation sources:<br>
$ISABELLE_HOME/src/Doc -- the latter gives a "live" view on that<br>
document (including example snippets) in the Prover IDE.</p>
<p>Anyway, I suspect that Jeremy wants to recreate the look-and-feel of<br>
different system called "Isabelle98" from 20 years ago. For that, the<br>
proof method called "tactic" might help: it is documented in the<br>
"isar-ref" manual, section "7.3: Tactics -- improper proof methods".<br>
This already indicates that we are looking at fringe topics of Isabelle2017.</p>

Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>Thanks - what I really meant when I asked about documentation was, how <br>
do I find out how to get the goal as an ML value when I don't already <br>
know the answer to that question.  I agree that if I know the answer <br>
then it's easy to find it in the canonical documentation.</p>
<p>In fact the preceding section in the Implementation manual is about the <br>
Proof structure, which also looks as though it contains useful stuff, <br>
except that one needs to get hold of the current proof state.  How do <br>
you get the current proof state as an ML value?</p>
<p>Thanks for the pointer about apply tactic ..., yes it's possible to <br>
write a tactic which does nothing but print out the goal, and can use <br>
the goal as an ML value within the tactic, but when I tried to define a <br>
reference value in which to save the goal value I found I couldn't.  Has <br>
the version of ML available to Isar users been jinxed, or something, so <br>
that reference variables don't work?</p>
<p>For your information, I don't want to recreate the look-and-feel of<br>
(what you now, I think correctly, admit is a) different system called <br>
"Isabelle98".  I just want to get stuff done.  The sort of stuff (like <br>
finding out how to get hold of the current goal) that takes no time at <br>
all in HOL4 or Isabelle2005 (which is actually what I use when I'm <br>
building on previous work) and takes hours in your Isabelle 2017</p>
<p>Incidentally, on the subject of documentation - what about the Isabelle <br>
cookbook - why isn't it included as part of the Isabelle documentation <br>
(and kept up to date)?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

for tool developers, and even that is quite easy if you think about the<br>
system in the proper way, and look a bit through the documentation.</p>
<p>Note that "to get stuff done" (doing proofs) usually requires no<br>
Isabelle/ML at all.</p>

Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>not clear what you mean by this - sure, the goal has been entered in <br>
textual form by the user, and obviously the system turns this into the <br>
ML value - but I can't see how the ML value is "there in the source".</p>
<p>What do you mean by this?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jeremy</p>

The true proof state is the partial proof text that you edit in the<br>
Prover IDE: as Isar source.</p>
<p>You don't need the ML value to do the proof, it is part of the<br>
implementation.</p>
<p>It might be fun to explore the implementation, but it can also take some<br>
years to get to the bottom of it.</p>

Hi</p>
<p>I don't seem to be able to use the goals or subgoals antiquotations <br>
correctly</p>
<p>lemma example: "a = b --&gt; b = a"<br>
ML_prf {* @{thm refl} *}</p>
<p>ML_prf {* @{goals} <em>} (</em> fails *)<br>
ML_prf {* @{subgoals} <em>} (</em> fails *)<br>
ML_prf {* @{context} <em>} (</em> OK *)<br>
ML_prf {* @{theory} <em>} (</em> OK *)</p>
<p>what am I doing wrong here?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Jeremy</p>

Dear Jeremy,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't seem to be able to use the goals or subgoals antiquotations<br>

</blockquote>
<p>as far as I understand, those are "document antiquotations", i.e. they<br>
may only appear in document text, but not in ML:</p>
<p>text ‹@{goals}›</p>
<p>If you want to take a look at the proof state from within the IDE, you<br>
have two choices:</p>
<p>1) open the "State" panel<br>
2) open the "Output" panel and check the "Proof state" box</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma example: "a = b --&gt; b = a"<br>
ML_prf {* @{thm refl} *}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this can be shorter expressed as "thm refl" directly. No need<br>
to wrap that into ML.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>you can use</p>
<p>lemma example: "a = b --&gt; b = a"<br>
  ML_val {* @{Isar.goal} *}</p>
<p>to get the current goal. Note though, that this does not work with ML_prf.</p>

Dominique.</p>

Hi Dominique,</p>
<p>Thanks - that's most helpful.  Do you know if this is documented anywhere?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

I don't know if it's documented. I found it via autocompletion in<br>
Isabelle/jEdit. But it took some experimenting to figure out that it works<br>
with ML_val. (Because otherwise it just thrown UNDEF).</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
