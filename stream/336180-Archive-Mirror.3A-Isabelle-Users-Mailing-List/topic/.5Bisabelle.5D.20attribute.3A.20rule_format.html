I think it was just a little more difficult to implement, and never necessary, because you could always write your original theorem in the form P —&gt; Q —&gt; R rather than P &amp; Q —&gt; R. And this sort of thing was only necessary for proof by induction anyway.</p>
<p>With the Isar induction methods, which had been around for several years now, the rule_format attribute is quite unnecessary. It is retained only so that legacy proofs will continue to work.</p>

What is the reason for "rule_format" not to touch HOL conjunction in <br>
premises, i.e., why is, e.g.,  "A &amp; B --&gt; A" not transformed into "A ==&gt; <br>
B ==&gt; A" by "rule_format"?</p>
<p>I often thought such a behavior useful. Is there another way of <br>
replacing every HOL connective by an appropriate Pure connective (as far <br>
as possible)?</p>
<p>cheers</p>

<p>It was indeed considered legacy since day 1, when I introduced the <br>
attribute to imitate the old qed_spec_mp feature of that time.  This also <br>
explains what it does and what not.  Generally it would be hard to say <br>
where to stop making a "rule format", and an important purpose of the <br>
explicit Pure rule notation with !! and ==&gt; is to make clear what the <br>
intended rule structure really is, without guessing by the system.</p>
<p>Moreover, the somewhat odd joining of what is now called "rule attribute" <br>
vs. "declaration attribute" in the same notation goes back to the ancient <br>
times of imitating qed_spec_mp.  It has been a partial success in getting <br>
rid of many qed commands, but at the cost of some confusion about what <br>
attributes really are.  (I've made some tiny reforms here for <br>
Isabelle2012, to provide proper static evaluation of rule attributes at <br>
last.)</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Occasionally, I entertain myself in trying to eliminate such old uses of <br>
"rule_format", or rather do it while testing Isabelle/jEdit performance <br>
and robustness.  Unfortunately, it often fails, because compact HOL <br>
connectives passed through induction produce different goals for tools <br>
like "auto": having nested !! and ==&gt; in the induction hypotheses fails <br>
for some reasons that are unknown to me.  Empirically I've always taken <br>
this as a feature of auto, but it might be worth revisiting it.</p>
<p>Larry himself has pointed out such observations about auto privately to me <br>
some months ago, when porting older ZF scripts.</p>
<p>Maybe the isabelle-dev thread on "Safe approach to hypothesis <br>
substitution" by Thomas Sewell from 2 years ago points into a direction to <br>
improve the situation, or maybe it is unrelated.</p>

I use "rule_format" for other than legacy purposes.  Here is an<br>
example where I give a name to a (paramaterized) bool so that I can<br>
use it in various ways.  Perhaps someone will show me a better way.</p>
<p>abbreviation<br>
  he :: "bbS \&lt;Rightarrow&gt; bool"<br>
  where "he M == \&lt;forall&gt;(pi::name prm) X. F X M = F (pi\&lt;bullet&gt;X)<br>
(pi\&lt;bullet&gt;M)"<br>
abbreviation  (* F equivariant (relativised) *)<br>
  HE :: "bool"<br>
  where "HE == \&lt;forall&gt;M. bbL M \&lt;longrightarrow&gt; he M"<br>
abbreviation  (* F equivariant (unrelativised) *)<br>
  XHE :: "bool"<br>
  where "XHE == \&lt;forall&gt;M. he M"</p>
<p>This doesn't just save typing for me; it saves checking for a reader<br>
that all the uses are the same formula.  "rule_format" is used in<br>
proving things about HE and XHE.</p>

<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:Thomas.Sewell@nicta.com.au">Thomas.Sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
Ideally all of our tools would care only about the semantics of the <br>
rules we provide, rather than the specific syntactic arrangement. In <br>
practice we are far from that, and conversion between logically <br>
equivalent lemmas seems to be a fact of life.</p>
<p>For instance, it is sometimes useful to state a lemma "P ==&gt; Q" to <br>
exactly match an assumption "Q" of another rule and then resolve them <br>
with OF. It may be convenient to state "Q" using --&gt; and ALL rather than <br>
==&gt; and !! to ensure it is completely consumed with one OF.</p>
<p>I see [rule_format] as just a shorthand for one of the kinds of <br>
conversions that are often needed. Often it's not the right one, and a <br>
longhand [OF allI conjI ...] comes out.</p>
<p>I wonder if anonymous contexts are a (partial) solution to this problem, <br>
for instance:</p>
<p>anonymous context begin</p>
<p>abbreviation (input) "P x y == ..."<br>
abbreviation (input) "Q x y z == ..."<br>
abbreviation (input) "R z == ..."</p>
<p>theorem foo: "P x y &amp; Q x y z ==&gt; R z"<br>
proof<br>
    blah blah blah<br>
qed</p>
<p>corollary foo_tupleD: "P x y ==&gt; Q x y (x, y) ==&gt; R (x, y)"<br>
   and foo_tupleI: "P (fst z) (snd z) ==&gt; Q (fst z) (snd z) z ==&gt; R z"<br>
   and foo_simp: "Q x y z ==&gt; (P x y &amp; R z) = P x y"<br>
   by (metis foo)</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>This is a generalisation of the Isar (is "?P x y &amp; ?Q x y z --&gt; ?R z") <br>
which also allows easy statement of closely related corollaries.</p>
<p>I think that hypothesis substitution might be unrelated.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
     Thomas.</p>
