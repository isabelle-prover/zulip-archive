<p>From: Bohua Zhan &lt;<a href="mailto:bzhan@mit.edu">bzhan@mit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi, everyone</p>
<p>I have uploaded the newest version of auto2, with work done over the<br>
summer. The main addition is examples on verifying imperative<br>
programs, in the framework of Imperative_HOL.</p>
<p>The repository is at: <a href="https://github.com/bzhan/auto2">https://github.com/bzhan/auto2</a></p>
<p>The main algorithms verified are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse and quicksort on arrays.</li>
<li>Insert, delete, reverse, and merge on linked lists.</li>
<li>Insert and delete on binary trees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples on arrays and linked lists follow the corresponding ones in<br>
HOL/Imperative_HOL/ex.</p>
<p>Similar to examples in Imperative_HOL/ex, the proofs use directly the<br>
semantics of the heap monad. All loops are defined by recursion, and<br>
properties of recursive functions are proved by induction. No Hoare<br>
logic or separation logic is used (although some of the abstractions<br>
may be inspired by separation logic, as is necessary to deal with<br>
disjointness of sets of pointers, etc). The proofs are "mostly"<br>
automatic - only a few lines of hints are needed to give intermediate<br>
steps.</p>
<p>Some technical notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I added a "comment" command similar to "assert". It is used to state<br>
intermediate results about variables in the middle of imperative<br>
functions. It is never intended to be evaluated (and in fact, often<br>
cannot be evaluated algorithmically). Right now the semantics is that<br>
all comments must be true for a function to "succeed", which of course<br>
cannot be realized in actual execution - so some restructuring would<br>
be needed for this to make more sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For both linked lists and binary trees, I defined proper-ness of a<br>
pointer as distinctness of reachable pointers. For linked lists, this<br>
is equivalent to the fact that the traversal of the pointer is a<br>
finite list. For binary trees it is different.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation is updated to reflect all the internal changes, but<br>
unfortunately I haven't had time to explain the newer examples in<br>
detail. Nevertheless I would be happy to answer any questions about<br>
them here. Any comments are also welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Bohua</p>
