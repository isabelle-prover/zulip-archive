Hello all,</p>
<p>I have been revisiting the HOL-Word theories, and a central question<br>
which has come to my mind is how bits are to be represented.  Some<br>
theories are just using bool, but some use a dedicated but also<br>
two-valued type bit.  This mixture is awkward.  Further, it seems to me<br>
that the use of the bit type (in connection with the pseudo infix<br>
constructor _ BIT _, which is the seed of almost all further usages of<br>
type bit) goes back to the ancient numeral representation as signed bit<br>
strings, which is now gone.</p>
<p>So, I would call for feedback from users of the HOL-Word theories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is there a reason to prefer bit over bool or the other way round, and<br>
if yes, in which situations?  Or does that just appear as accident?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If bool would be the preferred type, is it feasible (wrt. to existing<br>
applications »outside there«) to replace bit by bool entirely? This<br>
could also include input syntax 0 and 1 for False and True respectively,<br>
a conversion of_bool :: bool =&gt; 'a::zero_neq_one etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestions welcome,<br>
    Florian<br>

<p>From: Brian Huffman &lt;<a href="mailto:huffman.brian.c@gmail.com">huffman.brian.c@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
I created Library/Bit.thy in February 2009 as a theory of the field of<br>
integers mod 2. One motivation was to be able to have polynomials with<br>
integers mod 2 as coefficients, which have applications in<br>
cryptography. (I had also been working on Library/Polynomial.thy<br>
around the same time.) As a field, it is possible to use type "bit"<br>
with polynomial operations like div, mod, and gcd.</p>
<p>The connections between Bit.thy and the ancient numeral representation<br>
using _ BIT _ are accidental (see rev. 8e33b9d04a82); it is just a<br>
coincidence that the new type is also named "bit". The other uses of<br>
Bit.thy in HOL-Word are also likely due to my choice of the name of<br>
the type "bit" more than anything else. Perhaps "Z2" or "z2" would<br>
have been a better name for the new type; I just thought that an<br>
English word would fit better with Isabelle's naming conventions.</p>
<p>In summary: I never meant for Library/Bit.thy to have any connection<br>
whatsoever to HOL-Word; I'd be in favor of converting HOL-Word to use<br>
type bool instead. Also, I'm open to renaming Library/Bit.thy to more<br>
accurately describe its contents and intended use.</p>

<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:Thomas.Sewell@nicta.com.au">Thomas.Sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
I'll try to give you my understanding of the situation.</p>
<p>As users, we mostly use these n-bit machine word representations:</p>
<p>- as lists of booleans of length n (to_bl/of_bl)<br>
   - as functions from a domain of cardinality n to bool (test_bit)<br>
   - as naturals modulo 2^n (unat/of_nat)<br>
   - as nonnegative integers modulo 2 ^ n (uint/word_of_int)<br>
   - as a integers - 2 ^ (n - 1) &lt;= x &lt; 2 ^ (n - 1) (sint/word_of_int)</p>
<p>The word type could also have been defined as any of these <br>
representations, and the strength of the library is that the user <br>
doesn't need to care much what the underlying type definition is.</p>
<p>I think that HOL-Word has a lot of history in it. It was created around <br>
the time of an earlier change in the numeral representation, which <br>
annoyed its author somewhat and resulted in some compatibility layers. <br>
As a user, seeing these layers, types and definitions is a strong <br>
indication that you've dug too deep. The same goes for the "_ BIT _" <br>
representation. I suspect that these representations only get used in <br>
user proofs in evaluating concrete n-bit arithmetic (that is, the <br>
simpset introduces them then removes them again).</p>
<p>So, in short, go ahead and reconcile. I don't think users will have too <br>
much work to do if the key representations and theorems about them are <br>
preserved.</p>
<p>Final comment, the word_bitwise representation Sascha and I worked on in <br>
2010 uses the boolean list representation (to_bl/of_bl) or, more <br>
precisely, its reverse (rev o to_bl/of_bl o rev). In hindsight, the HOL4 <br>
group's approach based on the function-to-bool representation (test-bit <br>
in Isabelle) is probably smarter, since it caches better, though it <br>
involves lots of natural inequalities which require simprocs to resolve <br>
in Isabelle and are a bit of a nuisance. I'm not sure if that is even <br>
slightly relevant.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

Hi Brian,</p>
<p>could you describe in a bit more detail which aspects of finite fields<br>
you have formalized? In particular, have you formalized the concept of<br>
an irreducible polynomial, together with specific irreducibility criteria?<br>
When I started a formalization of AES a while ago, I used a brute-force<br>
approach to prove that the polynomial in the AES specification is actually<br>
irreducible. More precisely, to prove that p is irreducible I proved that<br>
no polynomial q with degree q \in {1..degree p div 2} divides p, but I was<br>
wondering whether there are more clever ways of doing this.</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
Stefan</p>

<p>I haven't formalized very much: Polynomial.thy defines div, mod, and<br>
gcd on univariate polynomials over a field, but I haven't formalized<br>
irreducibility or proved any related theorems.</p>

<p>I guess there are ([1] suggests a few methods), but I don't know of<br>
any formalizations of such methods in Isabelle.</p>

<p>From: Florian Haftmann &lt;<a href="mailto:florian.haftmann@informatik.tu-muenchen.de">florian.haftmann@informatik.tu-muenchen.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>thanks for the replies.  I will give a short summary and give some clues<br>
what I am actually aiming for.  Note that this is just a roadmap for<br>
future work, not anything I see for the near future (~ 3 months).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Concerning Bit.thy – this is something separate, a formalisation of<br>
the Z2 field actually.  It stand aparat, and references of the Word<br>
theories to bit should be replaced by bool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerning bit operations – these should use bool uniformly.  Both<br>
explicit list conversions and implicit structural operation like<br>
test_bit and set_bit are relevant for user space. _ BIT _ is a historic<br>
accident.  The idea is to clearly separate the bit operations into<br>
separate HOL-Library theories, to make them properly available for<br>
applications which do not need words but bits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This suggests a few refinements, which then lead to naming questions,<br>
e.g. for bin_nth :: int =&gt; nat =&gt; bool the name does not really make<br>
sense ;-).  Maybe its best to have the bit operations in a theory named<br>
Bit, to have qualified names like Bit.test :: 'a =&gt; nat =&gt; bool or<br>
<a href="http://Bit.map">Bit.map</a> :: nat =&gt; (bool =&gt; bool) =&gt; ('a =&gt; 'a) and such.  Then the<br>
existing Z2 theory should maybe really be named Z2.  (Just rough<br>
thoughts at the moment, not clear suggestions).</p>
<p>It is uncertain when I will come back to that issue, but the basic<br>
landmarks are now far clearer than before.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
    Florian<br>
