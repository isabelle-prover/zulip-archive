<blockquote>
<p>Fourier-Motzkin transformation over the reals/rationals: is just a projection. And the projection does not change if we eliminate common factors because this elimination is equivalence preserving. (There is one exception... Your projection may change because your Fourier-Motzkin implementation might change the variable elimination order. Yay heuristics...) What changes, however, is the run time needed to compute the projection. Whether you are faster or worse depends on the overhead of eliminating common factors vs. the speed-up you gain by having smaller coefficients. Personally, I think you would gain a speed-up.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fourier-Motzkin transformation over the integers: eliminating       common factors alone should not change whether a problem is solvable or unsolvable. Because the projection stays the same :-) Unless, (i) you combine it with rounding ("2 * x:int + 4 * y:int &lt;= 1" simplifies to "x:int + 2 * y:int &lt;= 0 = \floor(1/2)") or (ii) if you simplify strict inequalities over integer variables ("a:int &lt; 1" simplifies to "a:int &lt;= 0", but "2 * a:int &lt; 2" simplifies to "2 * a:int &lt;= 1"). I assume (ii) is what happened in your example (because (i) is a form of eliminating common factors) and thanks to eliminating common factors you removed some rational/real solutions and made the problem solvable. And because this is possible (i) and (ii) are also normally done for arithmetic inequalities. (Still, you might very rarely get worse results because your Fourier-Motzkin implementation changes the variable elimination order due to heuristic shenanigans…)<br>
</p>

<p>PS: Eliminating common factors and (i) and (ii) are not just preprocessing steps but inprocessing steps. You should apply them after every intermediate step of Fourier-Motzkin transformation…<br>

<p>I implemented that. I followed what was already in Tools/numeral_simprocs.ML. Then I activated the <br>
procedure as simproc on nat and 'a :: linordered_ring_strict (which includes int and reals) and run it on the (non-slow part of) AFP.</p>
<p>When trying it out on the AFP, some proofs broke because of the reordering meaning. So if we want to activate such simproc, we would have to adapt some proofs:<br>
  by (clarsimp simp add: cos_one_2pi) (metis mult_minus_right of_int_of_nat)<br>
~&gt;<br>
  by (clarsimp simp add: cos_one_2pi) (metis mult_minus_left of_int_of_nat)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it turns out things are a bit more complicated than I expected. They are already two different simprocs that can cancel terms, but do different things:</p>
<p>* eq_cancel_numeral_factor: it cancels term, but on the way, it reorders terms. <br>
     (2::int) * a * b = 2 * b' * a' ~&gt; a * b = a' * b'</p>
<p>* eq_cancel_factor: it cancels a terms, but without reordering terms:<br>
     (2::int) * a * b = 2 * b' * a' ~&gt; 2 = 0 ∨ a * b = b' * a'<br>
[2 = 0 can be simplified to false later, yielding a * b = b' * a']</p>
<p>I have a few questions:</p>
<p>* Does anyone know why some cancelation simprocs sort terms?<br>
  * Are simprocs supposed to be confluent, i.e., reach the same conclusion independently of the order they are applied?</p>
<p>Best,<br>

I've been mentioning this issue occasionally over the last few years.<br>
Considering how well computer algebra systems can handle equations and<br>
inequalities, there /must/ be room for improvement in Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've had little luck finding out what exactly it is that<br>
these systems do, and in any case it is probably a lot of work. To make<br>
matters worse, it might well break a lot of existing proofs if we switch<br>
it on by default, and no one will use it if we don't.</p>

I've seen that paper but I'm not sure how useful it would be in an<br>
Isabelle context, at least in an Isar proof. There, the typical workflow<br>
is that you have a fixed goal to prove and you chain in all the facts<br>
that are needed to prove it and then you call a method that can either<br>
solve it or it fails.</p>
<p>The only workflow I could possibly imagine is in apply-style<br>
exploration: You run "apply linarith2" on your goal and if it can't<br>
solve it, it prints a list of learned inequalities, and then you<br>
manually go through that to see if there are any interesting ones among<br>
them and then copypaste them back into your Isar proof before that.</p>
<p>Since this use of the method is purely diagnostic, there would be no<br>
need to formalise the "learning new equalities" part at all.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that it wouldn't be interesting to formalise this method<br>
just for the sake of formalising it; it's certainly interesting from a<br>
theoretical viewpoint in any case. I'm just not sure that it would be<br>
/that/ useful as an Isabelle tool.</p>
<p>By the way, since we're talking about simprocs, I'm currently offering a<br>
student project at TUM to implement some extremely specialised simprocs<br>
to tackle things like "ln(12) = 2*ln(2) + ln(3)", "of_nat n + 1 / 2 ∉ ℤ<br>
= False", and "totient 1234 = 616" etc. Let's see if someone bites.</p>

Hi all,</p>
<p>I had a look at the trace. The problems seems to be "¬ 10 * t2 ≤ 15 + 25 * t1". </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If not simplified, it is transformed to "16 &lt;= 10 * t2 + ~25 * t1" (in the tracing: "16 &lt;= 10, 0, ~25")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After simplification, it becomes "¬ 2 * t2 ≤ 3 + 5 * t1", which is transformed to "4 &lt;= 2 * t2 + ~5 * t1" (in the tracing: "4 &lt;= 2, 0, ~5")</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter yields an equivalent (but slightly stronger at a first glance) equality: "20 &lt;= 10 * t2 + ~25 * t1". This equality is equivalent to "16 &lt;= 10 * t2 + ~25 * t1", but linarith does not notice.</p>
<p>If I replace "10 * t2 ≤ 15 + 25 * t1" by "10 * t2 ≤ 19 + 25 * t1", then the refutation works (and this two expressions are equivalent).</p>

In principle a proof tool can propose to add more Isar text as <br>
"sendback" source snippets, e.g. see recent versions of the "induct" <br>
family of methods. The main problem is probably technical, to place <br>
further facts in the right spot before the goal statement: that would <br>
require new sendback properties such that the Prover IDE knows what is <br>
intended (Isabelle/Scala understands more Isar structure and syntax than <br>
Isabelle/ML).</p>

Dear Mathias,</p>
<p>It took me some time to remember the key point: linarith uses Fourier-Motzkin <br>
elimnation which is complere for rationals and reals but incomplete for <br>
integers. For the latter we have Presburger, but it is too slow for the example.</p>
<p>The idea of eliminating common factors first is interesting. I have no idea if <br>
this is always beneficial. Since the existing code is quite delicate, I also <br>
don't want to mess with it.</p>
<p>Is there a simproc for eliminating common factors? I suspect not in full <br>
generality, because the simplifier leaves "10 * (i::int) ≤ 25 * j" alone. There <br>
is one by Larry for the simple case "m * t &lt;= n * u" where m and n have a common <br>
factor. I have no idea how much work it would be to generalize it.</p>
<p>Best regards<br>
Tobias<br>
