"Fudge" seems to be a recent slang word that I do quite understand, or is <br>
this North American?</p>
<p>Concerning the meaning of the above, the concept of Isar facts vs. goal <br>
refinements are explained to some extent in section 6.2 of the <br>
implementation manual.  Roughly you have something like this:</p>
<p>&lt;using facts&gt;<br>
   &lt;goal&gt;<br>
   proof &lt;initial method&gt;<br>
     &lt;body&gt;<br>
   qed &lt;terminal method&gt;</p>
<p>The initial step (with the "using" part) is usually fully "structured" in <br>
the sense explained in section 6.2: methods like "rule" or "induct" take <br>
facts very seriously in what they do.  Moving further towards the tail <br>
position, some structure is given up: the terminal method merely finishes <br>
what is left, usually using "simple methods" in the sense of 6.2, where <br>
facts are only inserted as "insert" does.  (BTW, it is bad style to make a <br>
weakly structured initial method application -- simp, auto etc. -- and <br>
then try to proceed in a structured way towards the end.)</p>
<p>So the above use of qed "insert" is in accordance with the usual Isar <br>
style, even though complex method expressions at qed time tend to become <br>
slightly ugly.</p>
<p>For the special situation of induction, the general plan of action is to <br>
provide reasonably mechanisms for proof composition into the Prover IDE at <br>
some point.  E.g. the cases would be spelt out explictly by the IDE, and <br>
the user gets a chance to expand the non-trivial ones or tweak the trivial <br>
ones, even if most of them happen to be almost the same.  Once we are <br>
getting closer to this, one can revisit the old questions about effective <br>
composition and maintanence of big induction proofs, wrt. changes of the <br>
inductive specifications etc.</p>
<p>Here is a historically interesting example, which has defined the received <br>
Isar proof style to a large extent.  At that point <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/Isabelle2002/src/HOL/Unix/Unix.thy#l425">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/Isabelle2002/src/HOL/Unix/Unix.thy#l425</a> <br>
all cases are expanded uniformaly -- and automatically benefit from <br>
independent failure reports and parallel evaluation (around 2008/2009). <br>
At some later stage one subproof was changed independently so we now see<br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/Isabelle2011-1/src/HOL/Unix/Unix.thy#l425">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/Isabelle2011-1/src/HOL/Unix/Unix.thy#l425</a></p>
<p>This definitely shows some redundancy in the text, but postulating a <br>
decent Prover IDE it might actually work out in everyday hard work as <br>
well, without having to make tight "proof scripts" again.</p>

<p>It might be. I don't think it's recent.</p>

<p>I understand, but my point is that Isar allows me to name a fact but does not let me use it in a context where I need to - forcing me to employ the otherwise useless "insert" tactic. (In other contexts one can say "using ...", or appeal to the more powerful cut_tac if necessary.) This makes me think some outer syntax is missing.</p>
<p>I was vaguely proposing that:</p>
<p>...<br>
qed &lt;terminal method&gt;</p>
<p>be generalised to something like:</p>
<p>qed (using fact+)? &lt;terminal method&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>that the use of insert in this way be blessed with some outer syntax.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best of luck with the IDE issues. :-)</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>I have an induction of this form:</p>
<p>datatype D = a | b | c | d</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  assumes A: "A"<br>
  assumes B: "B (x :: D)"<br>
  shows "C x"<br>
using B<br>
proof(induct x)<br>
  case a with A show ?case sorry (* non trivial *)<br>
next<br>
  case b with A show ?case sorry (* trivial *)<br>
next<br>
  case c with A show ?case sorry (* trivial *)<br>
next<br>
  case d with A show ?case sorry (* trivial *)<br>
qed</p>
<p>I would like to write this instead:</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  assumes A: "A"<br>
  assumes B: "B (x :: D)"<br>
  shows "C x"<br>
using B<br>
proof(induct x)<br>
  case a with A show ?case sorry (* non trivial *)<br>
qed using A by ...</p>
<p>I have fudged this in the past by using the "insert" method:</p>
<p>...<br>
qed (insert A, ...)</p>
<p>Would it be possible to generalise what's allowed after "qed"?</p>
<p>Logically I could chain A into the induction too, but this obfuscates the induction hypothesis.</p>
<p>cheers<br>
peter</p>
