<p>Thanks for the additional context. However, seeing as we do not have<br>

<p>As a side note: José and I are currently developing an Isabelle/HOL <br>
library for complex functional analysis (as a planned AFP submission), <br>
including complex vector spaces. <br>
<a href="https://github.com/dominique-unruh/bounded-operators">https://github.com/dominique-unruh/bounded-operators</a> (Part of which <br>
might perhaps be included in HOL-Analysis when it's ready?) So, while we <br>
don't have complex vector spaces right now, John's argument might apply <br>
once the library is ready.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominique.</p>

That is good to know. However, "complex" will still be an instance of<br>
"real_normed_vector". We cannot really get rid of "norm :: complex", we<br>
can only "hide" it by an abbreviation (as it is done now).</p>
<p>I for one think that even in light of this new information, "cmod"<br>
probably does more harm than good. The term "modulus (of a complex<br>
number)" is definitely being used, but so is "norm (of a complex number)".</p>
<p>I still find "cmod" a lot more cryptic than "norm", and just for the<br>
sake of uniformity it makes sense to just call it "norm".</p>

I agree in this case, and more generally, introducing an abbreviation that gives a completely different name to a function just because it has a particular type can be confusing.</p>
<p>A contrasting situation concerns the function indicator. The return type of this function is polymorphic, so we have the abbreviation</p>
<p>abbreviation indicat_real :: "'a set ⇒ 'a ⇒ real" where "indicat_real S ≡ indicator S”</p>
<p>to cover the common case where the return value should have type real. But if the user wasn’t expecting this, they at least have a decent chance of figuring out what is going on.</p>

I never did like indicat_real (or understand why it exists).</p>
<p>On that note, functions with type variables in their return type that do<br>
not occur in the argument types are a bit of a nightmare. "fact" is<br>
another example, and I routinely stumble over that.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, I vaguely recall that I may have been the one who<br>
made it that way. Perhaps the alternative (gratuitous coercions) is worse.</p>
