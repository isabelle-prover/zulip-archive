<p>From: Ondřej Kunčar &lt;<a href="mailto:kuncar@in.tum.de">kuncar@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi!<br>
I want to define a declaration attribute which works with the given <br>
theorem. I've already implemented this operation in the function foo :: <br>
thm -&gt; local_theory -&gt; local_theory. Now I want to define a attribute by <br>
the function Thm.declaration_attribute :: (thm -&gt; Context.generic -&gt; <br>
Context.generic) -&gt; Thm.attribute. Although I invested a non-trivial <br>
time to try to figure out how to go from Context.generic to local_theory <br>
and back, I wasn't successful. Can anybody please help me and tell me <br>
how to implement the "boilerplate" function bar in <br>
"Thm.declaration_attribute bar" such that bar is implemented in terms of <br>
the function foo?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Ondrej</p>

The function Context.mapping is probably what you want.</p>

What is your local_theory -&gt; local_theory operation actually doing?  If it <br>
does genuine specifications (like Local_Theory.define) than it cannot be a <br>
"declaration" at the same time.</p>
<p>A declaration is some kind of generic data update on a generic context. <br>
It needs to work in many situations, like the original local_theory <br>
context of the user, its background theory, any other application context <br>
after interpretation, and more.</p>
<p>This is also the reason, why such declarations need to fail gracefully, if <br>
they don't like their argument, and not prevent other declarations from <br>
succeeding that happened to be pulled-in by the same locale <br>
interpretation, for example.</p>

<p>OK, I got from your explanation that it's not possible. So now I defined <br>
a command instead of an attribute and it works. But to be honest, I <br>
don't understand why it is not possible. Your explanation seems to be <br>

<p>This sounds like you are doing plain declarations of context data, but it <br>
happens to be wrapped up as local_theory specification elements.  By using <br>
the declaration functions directly, you should be able to present the <br>
composition as attribute.  Normally, the Isabelle components in question <br>
should export declarations functions along with the attributes, if not one <br>
can always recover the declaration part of an attribute by a bit of <br>
trickery.</p>
<p>It depends on the application how things are best presented to the user: <br>
Attributes are more flexible, because they can be used in many situations <br>
(specifications, proofs, locales, classes atc.), but sometimes it is more <br>
appropriate to wrap things up as standalone definitional package (like <br>
'function' or 'inductive').</p>

<p>I see a tendency of "negation by failure" reasoning here.  A certain <br>
attempt did not work, but many more possiblities were not even considered <br>
yet.  Usually the art is to find the one "canonical way" in a jungle of <br>
dead ends.  How much energy is invested on that depends on the <br>
application, i.e. if it is just some experiment or something exposed to <br>
many users eventually.</p>

<p>If you show your concrete sources, I can comment on the approach <br>
concretely.</p>
<p>Further general explanations are in the Isabelle/Isar Implementation <br>
manual.  Every time I revisit it to continue working on the text, I am <br>
surprised how much is mentioned there already, although it is definitely <br>
dense.</p>

<p>From: Thomas Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:Thomas.Sewell@nicta.com.au">Thomas.Sewell@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;<br>
Makarius may need several rounds of refinement to answer this question <br>
in a concrete way. Let me try to speed up the process.</p>
<p>I think that what is confusing you is that Context.generic provides a <br>
second layer of generic operation over theories, locales and structured <br>
proofs, when it looks that can already be done with local_theory.</p>
<p>Things are more complex than they seem. If one is inside a structured <br>
proof inside a locale inside a theory, all three context objects exist <br>
at once, in an arrangement that has been described as the Haftmann/Wenzel<br>
sandwich. Some operations are run on the topmost layer and then filter <br>
down as the proof/locale closes and merges. Some operations, such as <br>
attributes, get run simultaneously on multiple layers. Attributes may <br>
also be run when locales are interpreted and when they are reopened, <br>
though I think the details of this have changed recently. This was <br>
discussed in the past on this list <br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2012-March/msg00028.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2012-March/msg00028.html</a></p>
<p>This is what Makarius is getting at when he says attributes should try <br>
to run as generally as possible: they may need to run in all kinds of <br>
circumstances and failure may derail later operations.</p>
<p>As for local_theory, it looks like you can define all your functionality <br>
as a local_theory transformer, and run it on theories by using <br>
Theory_Target.init and Local_Theory.exit_global. If I understand <br>
correctly, this should not be expected to work for all kinds of changes, <br>
though it seems to work for adding notes (theorem names) and constants.</p>
<p>In conclusion: the obvious thing to do in an attribute is adjust data <br>
with the put/map operation of any data store derived from Generic_Data. <br>
This may in fact be what you want to do. You can also transform the <br>
theorem locally. Anything else requires a pretty deep understanding of <br>
what is going on.</p>
<p>This is just my understanding, I haven't attempted to read much of the <br>
documentation. I look forward to people correcting what I got wrong.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
     Thomas.</p>
