Ken,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the paper by Ondrej Kuncar and Andrei Popescu that you cite gives<br>
a description of the definitional mechanisms in HOL that is about 25 years out of date.<br>
The new_specification mechanism allows implicit definitions and cannot be viewed<br>
as a syntactic abbreviation mechanism. There is a proof of the conservativeness of a <br>
(generalisation of) this mechanism in Andy Pitts’ Introduction to the HOL Logic (ref. [31]<br>
in the paper). new_specification is implemented in all the "HOL-based provers” listed<br>
in the paper.</p>
<p>Due to tinkering on my part around 2013, new_specification has been extended to relax<br>
certain constraints on polymorphism that it imposed. The resulting gen_new_specification<br>
has been proved conservative informally by me and formally in HOL4 by Ramana Kumar,<br>
Magnus Myreen and Scott Owens  (see their and my papers in ITP 2014 and/or JAR 56(3)).<br>
gen_new_specification is implemented (to my knowledge) in HOL4, ProofPower and OpenTheory.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rob.</p>

Hi Rob,<br>
you are right that we mention only the plain definitions in HOL and not <br>
the implicit ones, when we compare the definitional mechanism of HOL and <br>
Isabelle/HOL. (If this what you meant; I assume you didn't mean to say <br>
that the overloading in Isabelle is 25 years out of date).<br>
I clearly remember that one of the early versions of our paper contained <br>
the comment that the current HOL provers use the more powerful mechanism <br>
that you mentioned but I guess that it was lost during later editing. We <br>
will include it again into the journal version of the paper.</p>
<p>I wanted to comment on your statement that A. Pitts proved that <br>
definitions in HOL are conservative. Such statements are always a little <br>
bit puzzling to me because when you say conservative (without any <br>
modifier), I always think that you mean the notion that "nothing new can <br>
be proved if you extend your theory (by a definition)". I think a lot of <br>
people (including me) think that this is THE conservativity. There is <br>
also a notion of the model-theoretic conservativity that requires that <br>
every model of the old theory can be expanded to a model of the new <br>
theory. This is a stronger notion and implies the proof conservativity.</p>
<p>As far as I know, A. Pitts considers only a subset of all possible <br>
models (so called standard models) in his proof and he only proves that <br>
these models can be extended from the old to the new theory. But as far <br>
as I know this does not imply the proof conservativity.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Ondrej</p>
