<p>Special Issue of<br>
         The Electronic Journal of Mathematics &amp; Technology (eJMT)<br>
<a href="https://php.radford.edu/~ejmt/">https://php.radford.edu/~ejmt/</a><br>

                Theorem-Prover based Systems for Education</p>
<p>===Scope</p>
<p>CADGME, the Conference on Computer Algebra and Dynamic Geometry Sy-<br>
stems in Mathematics Education, has a working group on Theorem-Prover<br>
(TP) based Systems since 2009. This year's conference held in Novi Sad,<br>
Serbia, leads to a special issue with this scope:</p>
<p>Recently and largely unnoticed in public, applications in science and<br>
technology drove the development of automated and interactive theorem<br>
proving technologies, which have become of major importance for mathe-<br>
matics and computer science in academia and in industry. However,<br>
their potential for a wide-spread education technology is unexplored,<br>
in spite of the fact, that TP exhibits features relevant for  educati-<br>
onal systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TP supports automated checks of user-input: since input states a<br>
   lemma to be proved within the logical context of a proof, a cal-<br>
   culation or a geometric construction, TP checks user-input without<br>
   specific code for large classes of input. Such automation brings<br>
   systems for step-wise problem solving within reach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TP covers the whole problem solving process: since TP implements<br>
   reasoning – the core of mathematical thinking, it supports all steps<br>
   in problem solving (mathematising, comparing specifications, reason-<br>
   ing and arguing, trying various strategies, until a solution can be<br>
   verified).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TP has underlying knowledge in a human readable format (following<br>
   the LCF-paradigm): mathematics  knowledge is mechanized down to<br>
   "first principles" beginning from basic axioms and definitions; so<br>
   presenting explanations to learners is not an issue of implementa-<br>
   tion but an issue of filtering off details.<br>
These features are distinguished from present educational mathematics<br>
software, from CAS, DGS, Spreadsheets etc. such that they promote a<br>
new generation of educational math assistants. Several prototypes are<br>
under construction in academic R&amp;D for geometry, algebra and appli-<br>
cations in engineering disciplines. So it seems in time to publish<br>
TP's potential and expected impact on educational practice in a<br>
special issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>===Important Dates</p>
<p>Deadline:                 September 15, 2012<br>
Deadline extended to:     September 22, 2012<br>
Submission:               16 pages pdf<br>
<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cadgme12-edutps">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cadgme12-edutps</a><br>
Preliminary notification: October 22, 2012<br>
Final notification        due to eJMT referees<br>
Expected publication:     Spring 2013</p>
<p>===Submission Details</p>
<p>We expect original articles (typically 12-18 pages) that present high-<br>
quality contributions that have not been previously published in an<br>
archival venue and that must not be simultaneously submitted for<br>
publication elsewhere.<br>
Guidelines <a href="https://php.radford.edu/~ejmt/SubmissionGuidelines.php">https://php.radford.edu/~ejmt/SubmissionGuidelines.php</a></p>
<p>===Program Committee</p>
<p>Christian Gütl, Graz University of Technology<br>
Roman Hašek, University of South Bohemia<br>
Zlatan Magajna, University of Ljubljana<br>
Filip Maric, University of Belgrade              (chair)<br>
Walther Neuper, Graz University of Technology (co-chair)<br>
Pavel Pech, University of South Bohemia<br>
Rein Prank, University of Tartu<br>
Pedro Quaresma, University of Coimbra<br>
Judit Robu, University of Xluj-Napoca<br>
Wolfgang Windsteiger, University of Linz</p>
<p>===Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Features of TP which have specific potential for innovating educati-<br>
   onal software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Descriptions of systems which implement TP components, and expected<br>
   impact on innovating education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reports from field-tests for TP-based systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are novel promises of TP for open learning scenarios in class,<br>
   independent learning at home, in renewed math and science education?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can TP provide additional challenges for gifted and interested<br>
   students as well as extra tuition to catch up on, particularly for<br>
   "slow but rigorous thinkers"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the gain for designing curricula, when respective math know-<br>
   ledge can be mechanized and is available "from first principles"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the gain for evaluation and assessment, when the same soft-<br>
   ware can be used for learning as well as for assessment (because for<br>
   the latter only supportive functionality needs to be reduced)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can TP-based systems support and enforce continuity between<br>
   “intuitive” math at high-school and “formal” math at university?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there ideas for open price competitions addressing the public in<br>
   interactive mathematical challenges via “cloud computing”?</p>
</li>
</ul>
