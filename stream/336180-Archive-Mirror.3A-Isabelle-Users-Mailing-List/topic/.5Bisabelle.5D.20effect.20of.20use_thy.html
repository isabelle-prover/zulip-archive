Hi Jeremy,</p>
<p>this error probably occurs because you have declared in the theory header that<br>
MSA depends on "SatEx1_mk.ML", e.g. by writing</p>
<p>theory MSA<br>
   imports ...<br>
   uses<br>
     ("SatEx1_mk.ML")<br>
     ...<br>
   begin</p>
<p>but there is no corresponding "use" command in the theory that actually loads<br>
"SatEx1_mk.ML". To fix this, you can either add the missing "use" command,<br>
or remove the parentheses around "SatEx1_mk.ML", i.e. write</p>
<p>theory MSA<br>
   imports ...<br>
   uses<br>
     "SatEx1_mk.ML"<br>
     ...<br>
   begin</p>
<p>This causes "SatEx1_mk.ML" to be loaded immediately at the beginning of the<br>
theory. Note that this option might not be possible if "SatEx1_mk.ML" depends<br>
on theorems or constants introduced later in MSA.</p>

<p>I am not sure about what you mean by "entering code at the keyboard", <br>
but You can use antiquotations when you program (I do it all the time).<br>
You just need to make sure that your file (or piece of Code) is loaded <br>
by Isar and not by ML. Antiquotations make no since without <br>
Isar-context. Technically, there is an interpreter of these <br>
Antiquotations that generates the lengthy Code you would write, when you <br>
want to refer to logical entities.<br>
In interactive theory development, you can start an ML section inside <br>
Isar by</p>
<p>ML{*</p>
<p>your code with antiquotations and X-symbols etc..</p>
<p>*}</p>
<p>You can run this code just like other theory elements, and will be <br>
interpreted with respect to the Isar context at that point.<br>
ML antiquotations that depend on the context, with use <em>that</em> context, <br>
<em>at compile time</em>. This is in contrast with calls like the_context(), <br>
which takes place when called (which again depends -- might be the <br>
compile time context or run time depending on the call's position).<br>
If you like more details, see [1].</p>

<p>You must declare this dependency as Stefan pointed out.<br>
  theory Foo<br>

<p>Now if you want your file to be used <em>before</em> starting the theory, you <br>

I do not see the problem clearly any more I must confess. Look at <br>
HOL/Presburger.thy. There you have a dependency on two sorts of ML files <br>
: those loaded before, and those loaded during the theory. The second <br>
ones contain antiquotations.</p>
<p>Btw ML{* *}. You can write pages of code in between, so you would have <br>
to type ML{* *} only when Proofs and ML code "alterate" or interact.<br>
Usually you prove some theorems and then want to write a procedure to <br>
manipulate these. To switch back to "theorems" or proof mode, on reason <br>
would be to use the developped proof procedure. Do you such a extremely <br>
coupled and interdependent bott-strapping process?</p>
<p>Maybe I misunderstand the issue.</p>

<p>Maybe the misunderstanding is that Jeremy is used to working at the <br>
interactive terminal, typing ML expressions and getting responses. When <br>
developing proof procedures, I used to work like this, too, but now I <br>
have switched completely to an "Isar-centric" style of working, <br>
primarily since the antiquotations are so useful.</p>
<p>What I usually do nowadays, when I develop ML code interactively is this:</p>
<p>In ProofGeneral, set up a theory:</p>
<p>| theory Scratch<br>
| imports WhateverYouNeed<br>
| begin</p>
<p>Then, I open up an ML section, and type term a:</p>
<p>| ML {*<br>
|   val a = ...;<br>
| *}</p>
<p>To see what happens, I step over this section (using PG). And then I fix <br>
it until it typechecks :-).</p>
<p>Now I want to keep editing, so I step back in PG and add the new <br>
declaration:</p>
<p>| ML {*<br>
|   val a = ...;<br>
|   val b = ...;<br>
| *}</p>
<p>This is a bit like working on a tty, but you get all the benefits of <br>
having a "true context" around that you can refer to using <br>
antiquotations. E.g. I write</p>
<p>Const (@{const_name "wf"}, ...)</p>
<p>instead of</p>
<p>Const ("<a href="http://Wellfounded_Recursion.wf">Wellfounded_Recursion.wf</a>", ...)</p>
<p>and if I mistype the name I get a useful error instead of some <br>
unpredictable garbage. The same for theorems @{thm ...} and so on.</p>
<p>Also, with this style of working, I have the development inside a file <br>
that I can save. And when the development is finished, the theory can be <br>
  imported in some other developments, with all the contexts and <br>
dependencies managed correctly, and you always know statically, what <br>
@{context} refers to.</p>
<p>Maybe this helps solving your problems with "the_context ()": Avoid it. :-)</p>

<p>Assume we have bar.thy and file.ML, and you want to load file.ML <em>after</em> <br>
bar.thy. Choose a name, wlo. bar2.thy, and import bar.thy in the header <br>
and use file.ML -- doesn't this do the job?</p>
<p>As I understand you want to use theories and ML files from the ML <br>
toplevel. Combining this with Antiquotations is painful. I have tried it <br>
once, since I used to develop everything on the ML toplevel. By the <br>
advent of antiquotations and other means, I left ML toplevel and only <br>
develop as Alex presented. Antiquotations and Co not only make *no <br>
sense* without Isar context, but turn against you without it.<br>
As Makarius says, this is the Context penalty.</p>

This is therefore not what I need.</p>

<p>This is indeed an Issue. Especially if a takes long.<br>
By the way, In emacs there is a way to make shortcut for these, but I <br>
don't know exactly how. Cc Ca Ca gives you the antiquotation @{text ""} <br>
with cursor ready inside the quotes, so there must be a way for ML{* *}</p>

to type ML{* *} only when Proofs and ML code "alterate" or interact.<br>
In my experience the code between the ML {* and the *} is executed all <br>
at once.  I am referring to a situation where I am developing the ML <br>
code, and where I do so by entering some ML code, having it run, viewing <br>
the result on the screen, and then writing some more ML code, and so <br>
on.  Eventually there may well be lots of ML code which can no doubt be <br>
enclosed by a single ML {* and *}.  But while I am developing it, or <br>
debugging it, I want to view the output of small parts of it.  This is <br>
why I gave the following as the example:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>val a = .... ; (entered interactively, so I can look at the result <br>
before proceeding)<br>
val b = ... ; (ditto)<br>
val c = ... ; (ditto)<br>
val d = the_context ()  (or whatever)</p>
<p>Now I understand (and this is how it works for me, anyway)</p>
<p>that if I were to type in</p>
<p>ML {*<br>
val a = .... ;<br>
val b = ... ;<br>
val c = ... ;<br>
*}<br>
then I wouldn't see the result for a before b is calculated, and so on.<br>
This is therefore not what I need.</p>

<p>Usually you prove some theorems and then want to write a procedure to <br>

extremely coupled and interdependent bott-strapping process?</p>
<p>Maybe I misunderstand the issue.</p>

<p>Dear Amine,</p>

<p>the theory file doesn't contain use bar.  I want to load the theory <br>
file, do some work interactively (eg, involving development or <br>
changes to bar), then use bar.  This is what<br>
seemed to be related to the failure I reported earlier</p>

Not before the theory, not during the theory.  That is to say, I want <br>

<p>Assume we have bar.thy and file.ML, and you want to load file.ML <br>

<p>As I understand you want to use theories and ML files from the ML <br>

it once, since I used to develop everything on the ML toplevel. By the <br>
advent of antiquotations and other means, I left ML toplevel and only <br>
develop as Alex presented. Antiquotations and Co not only make *no <br>
sense* without Isar context, but turn against you without it.<br>
As Makarius says, this is the Context penalty.</p>
<p>OK, well supposing I used @{theory} instead of the_context () in an ML file.<br>
Now it was said earlier that @{theory} is evaluated statically, and <br>
the_context () is evaluated dynamically.  I take it this means that <br>
the_context () is evaluated at the point where the code is encountered.  <br>
When is @{theory} evaluated?  Is it immediately before the ML file is <br>
loaded?  Or is it before the theory file, in which the ML file is <br>
declared, is loaded?</p>

<p>Likewise if I use @{theory} in an ML {* ... *} portion of a .thy file.  <br>
In this event,<br>
what is the point where @{theory} is evaluated?  Is it before the .thy <br>

<p>Worse: When the code is run. Suppose you are defining a function:</p>
<p>fun f x =<br>
   let<br>
      ...<br>
      val thy = the_context ()</p>
<p>Now the context will be evaluated (to the value of some global <br>
reference) whenever you apply the function. This is almost never what <br>
you want.</p>

val thry = Theory.begin_theory "test" [theory "MyTheory"];<br>

ML_Context.set_context (SOME (Context.Theory thry)); *)</p>
<p>I then usually use the variable "thry". If I finally want to publish the<br>

use the ML loading mechanisms from the theory that needs the ML code -<br>
in which case I can drop the header from my development file.</p>
<p>It's interesting to see theory development at the ML level - the need to<br>
do this depends on what level of programming you are doing. I quite like<br>
to be able to automate the making of definitions, and other theory-level<br>
changes. Thus I work at the ML level for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm not sure how ML can update "the_context()" in Isar.</li>
<li>I find it easier for debugging and develop for the reasons you've<br>
observed; ML interactive shell requires less typing for interaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, I haven't really played seriously with the antiquotations, so<br>
perhaps I'm just out of date with the latest and best coding fashions :)</p>
