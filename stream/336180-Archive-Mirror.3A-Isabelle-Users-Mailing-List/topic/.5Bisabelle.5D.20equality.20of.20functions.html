<p>From: "Roger H." &lt;<a href="mailto:s57076@hotmail.com">s57076@hotmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi, </p>
<p>the lemma "[1 ↦ [4], 2 ↦ [5]] =  [2 ↦ [5], 1 ↦ [4]]" can be proven by auto,</p>
<p>but is there any automatic proof, meaning some existing lemma, which i can add to the simplifier,<br>
so that such identities that occur in the middle of proofs are solved automatically?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

Hallo,</p>
<p>in this case: apply (simp add: fun_upd_twist)</p>
<p>Whether this works for more complicated statements of this kind, I<br>
cannot say. In particular, I suspect that this lemma could lead the<br>
simplifier to loop in some instances – I don't know whether the<br>
simplifier recognises that this lemma represents a kind of commutativity<br>
and treats it accordingly automatically.</p>
<p>Also, I recommend you use find_theorems to find lemmas of this kind, or<br>
sledgehammer if you don't want to search manually.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Manuel</p>

<p>From: IG BI &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>Your question is vague enough that I have a lot of freedom here to be <br>
right, rather than wrong. I take "solved" to mean that either the <br>
formula resolves to <code>True</code>, or that the left-hand side of <code>=</code> will be <br>
replaced by the right-hand side.</p>
<p>If, with auto, you can prove the formula you stated as a lemma, then <br>
anywhere that the formula is a proof goal, the command <code>apply(auto)</code> <br>
will prove it.</p>
<p>To find the specifics of how <code>auto</code> is proving your formula, you would <br>
have to "investigate", such as using <code>simp_trace</code>, though <code>simp</code> rules <br>
may not be the only thing <code>auto</code> is using.</p>
<p>If you still feel the need to have a custom rule for your formula, then <br>
you just add it as a <code>simp</code> rule, as others have explained, with the <br>
intent that the left-hand side of the formula will be replaced with the <br>
right-hand side, or that "=" will resolve to "True". However, it's <br>
possible that your  <code>simp</code> rule will never be used, because other <code>simp</code> <br>
rules might get to it first and do some rewriting, with the result that <br>
your rule can no longer be applied.</p>
<p>Because it takes so much work to work through textbooks and tutorials, I <br>
get value from questions that other's ask and that are answered by <br>
others. However, for a more comprehensive knowledge on some of these <br>
basics, I recommend two distribution tutorials:</p>
<p><a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013-2/dist/Isabelle2013-2/doc/prog-prove.pdf">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013-2/dist/Isabelle2013-2/doc/prog-prove.pdf</a></p>
<p><a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013-2/dist/Isabelle2013-2/doc/tutorial.pdf">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013-2/dist/Isabelle2013-2/doc/tutorial.pdf</a></p>
<p>I also pick one non-distribution web page by Jeremy Siek that, for my <br>
needs, will be very helpful in learning how to do non-auto natural <br>
deduction proof steps:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~siek/7000/spring07/">http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~siek/7000/spring07/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~siek/7000/spring07/isabelle-notes.pdf">http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~siek/7000/spring07/isabelle-notes.pdf</a></p>
<p>I myself have yet to work through any of these completely, so at times, <br>
I feel the urge to lash out at the establishment, and become a <br>
revolutionary in the Eastern hemisphere.</p>
<p>What could be easy, though time-consuming, becomes hard, because the <br>
right kind of textbooks for Isabelle don't exist, such as Martin <br>
Odersky's book on Scala, his Coursera video on Scala, and the 10 or so <br>
other textbooks that take you from beginning to moderate level Scala.</p>
<p>Controlling my emotions, and forcing myself to think rationally, I come <br>
up with a logical argument as to why affairs are the way they are, <br>
though I have little ability to implement such an argument in <br>
Isabelle/HOL, other than with Sledgehammer, auto, simp, fastforce, fast, <br>
presburger, etc. You get the picture.</p>
<p>Thinking rationally, I then feel no obligation to become a revolutionary <br>
in the Eastern hemisphere. Rather than do the tedius work of working <br>
through tutorials, I make an easy contribution to the mailing list, it <br>
being 17:48 in the German part of the Eastern hemisphere, on Friday, the <br>
Germans having gone home for the weekend.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>From: IG BI &lt;<a href="mailto:igbi@gmx.com">igbi@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I clarify some of what I said, where what I said are the statements of a <br>
novice.</p>
<p>First, the basic idea behind what I said is that if <code>by(auto)</code> is <br>
proving your formula above, I don't see why you need to add any rules. <br>
The <code>auto</code> method calls <code>simp</code>, among other things, and it seems to be <br>
doing a good job with what it has.</p>
<p>Also, if you did want to add custom rules, then you would create rules <br>
more general than your formula, which I suppose you already know. <br>
However, if <code>auto</code> already can solve the identity, then why add <br>
anything? Maybe there are reasons, such as optimization.</p>
<p>You can use <code>simp add: myThm</code> to add a <code>simp</code> rule for <code>simp</code> to use, <br>
but again, it found everything it needed.</p>
<p>The problem with mailing list subscriptions is that there's not an <br>
option for it to be "read only". The web page has that functionality, <br>
but it's convenient to get everything by email to be able to archive the <br>
ones I want for future reference.</p>
<p>I'd rather only have "write mode" capability most of the time, but I <br>
have it all the time, which is unfortunate.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>
