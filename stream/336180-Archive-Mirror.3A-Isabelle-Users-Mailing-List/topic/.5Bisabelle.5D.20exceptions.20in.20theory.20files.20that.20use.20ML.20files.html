<p>From: Lucas Dixon &lt;<a href="mailto:ldixon@inf.ed.ac.uk">ldixon@inf.ed.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
If I have a theory file which starts:</p>
<p>theory PureIsaP<br>
imports HOL<br>
uses "src/build/Pure_IsaP.ML"<br>
begin</p>
<p>The file "Pure_IsaP.ML" uses a number of other files. I noticed that <br>
when an exception is raised, I get something like this:</p>
<p>*** exception SysErr of ("chdir failed", SOME ENOENT) raised<br>
*** val d = "/home/ldixon/work/IsaP/trunk/IsaPlanner" : string<br>
*** val it = () : unit<br>
*** val it = () : unit<br>
*** val it = () : unit<br>
*** val it = () : unit<br>
*** Exception- TOPLEVEL_ERROR raised<br>
*** At command "theory".</p>
<p>However, this doesn't tell me in which sub-file the exception was <br>
raised. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>thanks,<br>
lucas</p>

Maybe the exception trace produced by Toplevel.debug := true provides some <br>
extra hints.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this is more that just an experiment, you need to specify <em>all</em> <br>
loaded ML files in the theory header, via uses ("my_extra_file.ML") with <br>
parentheses.  This means it is usually easier to use all files directly <br>
from the header in the first place, see the start of src/HOL/HOL.thy for <br>
example.</p>

<p>Regular 'ML' needs a context, because it can emit toplevel bindings, which <br>
are stored there.  You can always say 'ML_val' or 'ML_command', even <br>
before the initial 'theory' (in interactive mode).</p>

<p>Since you are using the repository versions of Poly/ML and Isabelle (both <br>
moving very fast), you should in principle get a detailed trace for the <br>
nested ML invocation, as well as a file/line position for the last <br>
exception (but that is probably just that of the "error" function in <br>
library.ML).</p>
<p>On the other hand, things might be broken right now.  Or the situation <br>
might be a bit different than expected.  Which "chdir" did you use?  Our <br>
"cd" or a different version?</p>

<p>We used to have this for src/Pure until recently.  Now there is only a <br>
single flat ROOT.ML without any chdirs.  This was motivated by precise <br>
source file tracking of Poly/ML 5.3pre, but has also clarified our load <br>
process.</p>

<p>You could do that.  In main HOL it happens all the time, although it is <br>
due to actual intermediate theory development before further ML files can <br>
be loaded.</p>
