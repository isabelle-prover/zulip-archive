<p>"\&lt;proof&gt;" is pretty much the same as "sorry" as far as Isabelle is<br>
concerned, but<br>
but is meant to indicate to the reader that the proof is essentially<br>
unimportant or<br>
intentionally left out, whereas "sorry" indicates that the thing proved by<br>
it is important<br>

<p>Yes. try using the 'print_facts' command before and after.</p>

<p>(3) what does "picking this" mean?  At this point (ie after "from a")<br>
what are the facts at the point?  Is something which is once a fact<br>

<p>I feel like all of thees have the same answers... Just click and look.</p>
<p>Which, combined with other questions you've asked, makes me wonder if you<br>
are just completely<br>

console?</p>
<p>I can certainly imagine how the other systems you've mentioned using would<br>
lead you to do that,<br>
but it must be terribly frustrating.</p>
<p>I think (maybe?) modern Isabelle is just a very different thing than what<br>
you want/expect it to be.<br>
It is still very possible to extend Isabelle with ML, but maybe it's worth<br>
taking a step back and<br>
telling yourself that what you're dealing with isn't ML. It's a new<br>
language/environment/system<br>
all its own that just happens to have ML as a sub component...</p>

Hi Michal,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At (almost) any point in your document in isabelle/jEdit, type the <br>

<p>Your answer to (1) I think also clarifies (7).  And for some reason I'd <br>
thought<br>
that what is printed after "using" or "using this" is the facts, which is<br>
apparently not so.</p>
<p>But do you know what it is that is printed after "using" or "using this"?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(6) After proof ... we get method_facts A1 A2 B1 B2 B3.  Are<br>
    method_facts the same as facts?  If not, what is the difference?<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've discovered that at several places in the file I can insert<br>
  apply (print_fact method_facts)<br>
and what it gives is different from what is printed by print_facts<br>
(which is described as local facts).</p>
<p>Do you know what method facts or local facts are?  Presumably they<br>
are of some relevance, different from them simply being facts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which, combined with other questions you've asked, makes me wonder if <br>
you are just completely<br>
ignoring the jEdit component, and trying to use Isabelle only from the <br>
console?</p>
<p>I've certainly tried to do as much as I can from the console, but as for <br>
running the file that my questions were based on and viewing the output <br>
at each step, I think I must have used jedit, I don't think I know how <br>
to do that using the console.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I can certainly imagine how the other systems you've mentioned using <br>
would lead you to do that,<br>
but it must be terribly frustrating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, being able to jump back and forth in a proof is <br>
very nice for doing exactly what you suggest (re print_facts) but <br>
generally it's not worth the sluggishness of jedit, and having to <br>
enclose everything in ML {* ... *}, and only seeing a few lines of <br>
output at a time, and so forth.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your answers</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jeremy</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Before this thread is again diverging into non-sense, just a reminder of<br>
the most basic facts of Isabelle2018:</p>
<p>* You do need to use Isabelle/jEdit for almost everything. Don't try<br>
to bail out into the "isabelle console" tool, which is merely a leftover<br>
for certain low-level system debugging.</p>
<p>* "enclose everything in ML {* ... *}" is misleading. You rarely need<br>
Isabelle/ML to use the system properly. ML is the system extension<br>
language, and using it for that purpose, Isabelle/jEdit is actually more<br>
convenient than anything before in the history of Isabelle.</p>
<p>* "sluggishness of jedit": The Isabelle/jEdit application normally<br>
works smoothly on decent hardware. You need 2-4 CPU cores and 8-16 GB<br>
RAM, i.e. cheap mid-range consumer hardware. If you don't want to invest<br>
in that, you should not use Isabelle2018.</p>
<p>Also note that the Isabelle/jEdit application title in Isabelle2018 is<br>
now "Isabelle2018/HOL" (or another logic image). It means that at first<br>
approximation "Isabelle2018" and "Isabelle/jEdit of Isabelle2018" are<br>
the same thing: there is practically no escape from it, and no point to<br>
try it. If you don't like that, you should be honest to yourself use a<br>
different proof assistant.</p>

I never observe the proof state, I just read my own Isar code as if I was<br>
writing a paper in LaTex. The slogan is: Isar is not a video game like Coq,<br>
but a typewriter like LaTex.</p>
<p>To understand the theory behind the proof is the key to write readable<br>
proofs in Isar. In my case, I follow the following steps (without regarding<br>
any textbook, just having an idea of the theory in mind):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I write my theorem and I write sorry in its proof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I write the lemmas that I need to prove my theorem, with sorry in the<br>
proof of each one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I write the proof of my theorem assuming the lemmas as true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I repeat the previous steps with each lemma with sorry as proof.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>I find that for a given proof state,</p>
<p>Proof.the_facts can indicate a non-empty list of facts, but<br>
(#facts o Proof.goal) gives an empty list of facts.</p>
<p>Why is this, and what do these two functions return?  Are there two <br>
different sorts of facts?</p>
<p>Variously the documentation refers to "current facts" and "incoming <br>
facts".  What does this terminology mean?</p>
<p>Method.get_facts and Method.set_facts refer to sets of facts which it <br>
would seem belong to a proof context, rather than to a Proof state.  How <br>
do these relate to the sets of facts mentioned above which would seem to <br>
be are part of the proof state?</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Jeremy</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
A fact is the most fundamental result produced in a proof context, it is<br>
a multi-thm, i.e. a list of things that hold in a certain context.</p>
<p>Facts are defined in the theory or proof context via names, just like<br>
constants or types. Within a proof, fact names are optional and the last<br>
fact is always called "this". This allows to use forward-chaining of a<br>
fact towards the next goal statement. Facts chained into a goal are<br>
presented to proof methods as the primary "facts" argument.</p>
<p>Attached is an example that illustrates this.</p>
