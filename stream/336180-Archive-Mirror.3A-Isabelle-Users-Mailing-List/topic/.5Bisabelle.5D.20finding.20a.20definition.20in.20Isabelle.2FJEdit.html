<p>From: Gergely Buday &lt;<a href="mailto:gbuday@gmail.com">gbuday@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
This is how I see it: I have met an unexpected behaviour: looking up a<br>
definition did not work. With my limited knowledge of the system, I<br>
tried to identify the cause. I spot the difference as the definition<br>
being in another file or in the same. This was incorrect. Makarius<br>
changed the aspect: the difference is between processed and<br>
unprocessed definitions. The former's data is in the heap so<br>
Isabelle/Jedit can look it up.</p>
<p>But now a question comes to my mind: the mentioned file, Lambda.thy<br>
was not itself processed but I use a precompiled heap image of Nominal<br>
that includes Lambda.thy as well. I understand that I might change<br>
Lambda.thy but _in theory_ the original definitions of Lambda.thy<br>
_can_ be looked up in the precompiled heap. Of course I do not know<br>
the internals of the Isabelle/JEdit implementation.</p>
<p>Makarius, what do you think, is this doable? Namely, to identify the<br>
source files of a precompiled heap and to look up their definitions,<br>
if the source files are unchanged? And, possibly, to make these files<br>
read-only in Isabelle/JEdit?</p>

Indeed.  What is still lacking on this thread is an elementary description <br>
of the situation that lead to the initial surprise.  So far there were <br>
several educated guesses by Lars and myself what the perceived problem <br>
actually is.</p>
<p>We don't need speculations about "bugs", "features", "intentions", <br>
"designs" or whatever, but just some information about the empirical <br>
observations.  That is more difficult with the Prover IDE, since it is an <br>
interactive game.  So quite often, the problem is in timing and <br>
reactivity, or lack thereof, but this is hard to phrase in prose text.</p>

<p>So far this is the most interesting contribution on the meta-discussion on <br>
this thread.</p>
<p>The key problem that I see with the notions of "bugs + features + fixes" <br>
is that the terminology suggests that you talk about a sufficiently small <br>
and simple thing that you can manipulate arbitrarity (taking it into your <br>
hands to do with it what you please). You might call that a "computer <br>
program", but I prefer to call it a "plastic model of software reality".</p>
<p>So how about the real thing?</p>
<p>Alan Kay has given a nice lecture about "Programming and Scaling" some <br>
years ago, which is interesting for various reasons, in particular:</p>
<p>(1) He as the inventor of the "object-oriented" movement repents after<br>
       all these decades, and sees more realistically the conceptual<br>
       mistakes they've made in the 1970/80-ies.  I am not in a position to<br>
       blame him for mistakes of his youth, since I am much younger and<br>
       less experienced, while he has grown old and wise.</p>
<p>(2) A huge software system like Microsoft Windows 7 should be<br>
       visualized as Mexico City.  Do you walk around there and to tell the<br>
       city administration about "bugs" that need to be "fixed"?  The<br>
       people in charge won't take you seriously at all.</p>
<p>Isabelle is not as large and complex as Windows, not even the Linux <br>
kernel, but it is definitely beyond the category of "computer program".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are my opinions, expressed with the usual pedanticism. Most of my <br>
emails are ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually read more than half of your mails.  Sometimes it takes time to <br>
see the points behind the many words, but quite often I find useful hints <br>
there.  E.g. some months ago you have shared your observations about the <br>
really ancient 'arities' command, which has no practical use today, but <br>
can destroy a user's theory via uncontrolled axiomatization.  So I've <br>
sorted this out for the next release.</p>

<p>I am trying for years to sort out the relation of precompiled heaps and <br>
their sources wrt. the active editor session.  This is not imminent -- <br>
users need to cope with a situation inherited from the past.  What does <br>
have a chance for the coming release is a reform that de-emphasizes heap <br>
images, such that you can edit whatever theories you like without thinking <br>
about batch sessions. Right now you still need the correct heap to be able <br>
to process certain sources at all, for historic reasons of the theory name <br>
space.</p>

<p>using ctrl-click to find the definition of an identifier is indeed<br>
valuable. However, it fails to work sometimes. I cannot make bold claims<br>

<p>the definition is in the same file</p>

Normally this should work.</p>
<p>A situation where ctrl-click does not take me to the expected location<br>
is if I am in a locale context (opened by context or implicitly via (in<br>
locale)). Then (sometimes?) the click takes me to the opening of the<br>
context, not to place where the lemma was defined.</p>

Can you point to a definition of "feature" or "bug"?  Both don't have any <br>
meaning to me.  I mean this seriously.</p>
<p>One of the key concepts of PIDE is that the prover can report some aspects <br>
of its internal workings to the document source, via markup that is <br>
positioned in the proper place.  Aspects, not everything -- the prover is <br>
doing many more things internally.</p>
<p>This restriction was the initial breakthrough of the Prover IDE approach.<br>
Aefore the IDE guys would ask for everything and get nothing.  Afterwards <br>
it became feasible to reform the prover to support IDEs adequately.</p>
<p>I've spent the past 5 years or so providing more and more informative <br>
markup from the bottom of the prover.  This is a never-ending process, as <br>
far as I can fortell.</p>
<p>Files are generally not very interesting in PIDE -- the prover does not <br>
really know about them.  It matters more if something has been loaded into <br>
the underlying heap image in batch mode, or within the current editor <br>
session.</p>

There is a conceptual problem here that was already known in 2008 when no <br>
concrete PIDE markup was available yet.  Contexts (class, locale etc.) are <br>
like a second-order mechanism on top of plain declarations, and the <br>
position reports should somehow take the relation of the two into account, <br>
but don't do anything yet.</p>
<p>PIDE is like a high speed train that runs already at 550 km/h, while only <br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This is a slightly odd idea about system development at a large scale. <br>
Quite often, the not so ideal behaviour is known and expected by the <br>
people who did the job, but there were reasons why it could not be done <br>
better in a certain situation, or forcing it would make things worse. <br>
Equally often, users expect much less than could be done, either in <br>
principle or in actuality after taking a fresh look at the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Above you say "it fails to work sometimes".  What does that mean? Reading <br>
between the lines I guess it might be any of the following behaviour in <br>
Isabelle2013-2:</p>
<p>* An entity reference that points to a file from the base session (e.g.<br>
     from Isabelle/HOL) merely resolves to the file + line number, but not<br>
     the character precise offset.</p>
<p>* An entity reference that points to a file within Isabelle/Pure merely<br>
     points to the start of the file, not even the line number.</p>
<p>I could have put that in the manual, to make it an official "feature", but <br>
that would be a bit silly.  It does not really qualify as "bug" either, <br>
because there is no real problem here: some entity references are more <br>
precise than others, and better than no references.  The hypersearch <br>
facility of jEdit helps to finish the procedure to find something <br>
somewhere.</p>
<p>For the coming release there will be more support for files of the base <br>
session and bootstrap files of Pure.  Due to other improvements in <br>
external file handling within theories, the file + line reference suddenly <br>
spoilt the game, so I invested more work to make the landing positions of <br>
links more precise also in that case.</p>
<p>Does that "fix a bug" as many people would say?  I say no, because there <br>
was nothing "loose" and there is never an end of what else could be <br>
improved, i.e. a "fixed situation".  For example, after recent <br>
improvements I could imagine a visual representation of "scope groups" <br>
(binding position plus occurrences) that can be seen in other IDEs. <br>
After that 5 more things that I don't dare to spell out yet.</p>

to work out the last piece of the puzzle above, because trying to work<br>
out the intention of the designer is _hard_.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes I am afraid you are serious here. But ordinary language is not<br>
"defined". People usually use the word feature when the behaviour is<br>
expected by the software writer, and, possibly, by the users, while<br>
a bug is something that is not expected and even unpleasant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a slightly odd idea about system development at a large scale.<br>
Quite often, the not so ideal behaviour is known and expected by the<br>
people who did the job, but there were reasons why it could not be<br>
done better in a certain situation, or forcing it would make things<br>
worse. Equally often, users expect much less than could be done,<br>
either in principle or in actuality after taking a fresh look at the<br>
bigger picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gergely doesn't have any odd ideas about large-scale system<br>
development at all. In fact, Gergely has the _right_ idea: in large<br>
developments, there are _bound_ to be program behaviours that are not<br>
expected, desirable, or intended.</p>
<p>The fact that Gergely hit a design trade-off and asked publicly as to<br>
whether it was intended or not is simply a sign that the behaviour is<br>
either ill-document and/or the UI is insufficient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Above you say "it fails to work sometimes".  What does that mean?<br>
Reading between the lines I guess it might be any of the following<br>
behaviour in Isabelle2013-2:</p>
<p>* An entity reference that points to a file from the base session<br>
   (e.g. from Isabelle/HOL) merely resolves to the file + line number,<br>
   but not the character precise offset.</p>
<p>* An entity reference that points to a file within Isabelle/Pure<br>
   merely points to the start of the file, not even the line number.</p>
<p>I could have put that in the manual, to make it an official "feature",<br>
but that would be a bit silly.  It does not really qualify as "bug"<br>
either, because there is no real problem here: some entity references<br>
are more precise than others, and better than no references.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it is a design trade-off. And yes, you _should_ put it in the<br>
manual, not because that would change the status of the behaviour from<br>
"bug" to "not bug", but so that users understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Better still, if a design trade-off needs to be made, modify the UI so<br>
that the user's expectations are met. A simple tooltip stating "Cannot<br>
determine source location" when the user tries to Ctrl+Click such a term<br>
gives the user a strong hint that they are hitting a design limitation,<br>
and not a bug.</p>

Makarius Wenzel doesn't really need me to help him out, so I'll check <br>

<p>It's more general than that. A bug implies something is wrong, and to <br>
know something is wrong, you have to have inside information, though at <br>
times, it's fairly safe to claim there's a bug.</p>
<p>I exported functions that used functions of type 'prop', and the code <br>
generator generated some totally bogus code for Scala and Haskell (or <br>
did it?). On my end, it was unexpected and undesirable. On their end, <br>
"unintended" would imply they even care about exporting 'prop' functions.</p>
<p>The issue at hand, that a link doesn't take you where you want, is not <br>
even remotely a bug. It's a feature which doesn't meet our expectations, <br>
because other features have fully met our expectations, which has made <br>
us very unsatisfied, and downright ticked off, because the one feature <br>
showed us how easy life could be if we lived in a more perfect world.</p>
<p>I could say it's wrong for people to complain about that kind of thing, <br>
but it's not. Anything put out for public consumption is subject to <br>
critique. People are free to produce, and we're free to complain.</p>
<p>Critiquing becomes a matter of perception. I myself understand there's <br>
only one proof assistant in the whole world that has the features I <br>
need, no exaggeration. It bares emphasizing, there's only one, and the <br>
one there happens to be is extraordinarily powerful, and free, too. I <br>
have a very bad attitude about many things involving proof assistants, <br>
but I control myself, a little.</p>

<p>"Unexpected, unintended, and undesirable" is a bogus definition of <br>
"bug". That mainly describes what we as users want or don't want.</p>
<p>If this was Microsoft, then you bash them because you can, because <br>
they're some big, faceless corporation, and you use "bug" freely, and <br>
don't worry about these things. Here, people aren't machines, and people <br>
can be motivated or demotivated. If we demotivate people, then they <br>
don't work as hard. No one here is dependent on me. I'm dependent on others.</p>
<p>These are my opinions, expressed with the usual pedanticism. Most of my <br>
emails are ignored. That would be good here, too.</p>

Some of the subsequent emails to this may have taken it too seriously.</p>
<p>Here are two possible definitions -)</p>
<p>(1) If the developers can't be bothered to fix it, it is a feature; if <br>
they can, then it is a bug</p>
<p>(2) Something is a bug if it a program behaves differently from how the <br>
documentation says it should behave.  (This means that if there is no <br>
documentation, then there are no bugs).</p>
<p>Regrettably, I can't claim originality in either of these approaches to <br>
bug-avoidance.</p>
