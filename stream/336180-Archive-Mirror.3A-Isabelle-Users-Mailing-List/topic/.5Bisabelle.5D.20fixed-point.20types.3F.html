Hi,</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is any way to directly construct a fixed-point type in Isabelle, without (at least, without directly) using datatypes. That is, I have a type constructor F x, and I would like to construct a fixed-point type tau = F tau. Any ideas on how to go about this? Of course, this should only be possible if F is a functor, since otherwise it doesn’t have a fixed-point.</p>
<p>In more detail, I am trying to axiomatize the resumption monad transformer, as follows. I start by declaring the underlying monad type, as follows:</p>
<p>typedecl ‘a Monad</p>
<p>By positing the monad laws as axioms, I am assured that Monad is a functor. Then I would like to define the resumption transformer like this:</p>
<p>datatype 'a ResumpT<br>
   = Done 'a<br>
   | Pause "('a ResumpT) Monad"</p>
<p>Of course, this is not a valid datatype, because Isabelle does not know that Monad is positive. I was thinking, however, that I could turn ResumpT into a type-level function, as follows:</p>
<p>datatype (‘a, ’t) ResumpT<br>
   = Done 'a<br>
   | Pause “’t Monad"</p>
<p>Then, if I could build a fixed-point type over the ’t type argument, I would by able to define ResumpT, at least indirectly.</p>
<p>Any help on this front would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
-Eddy</p>

Dear Eddy,</p>
<p>Of course you can construct your fixpoint type manually, but this will be a lot of work. <br>
Or, you just continue to axiomatize the structure of the resumption monad transformer, <br>
too, but axioms are better avoided.</p>
<p>The new datatype package might, however, offer a solution, because it supports fixpoint <br>
types for natural functors that are <em>bounded</em>. Boundedness means that the cardinality of <br>
the elements of the type is bounded by some cardinal that does not depend on the type <br>
variable over which the fixpoint is built. To that end, you have to register your monad <br>
type as a BNF.</p>
<p>In Isabelle2013-2, you have to import the BNF package via "~~/src/HOL/BNF/BNF", in the <br>
coming Isabelle2014 release, the datatype_new command will already be part of Main. The <br>
tutorial on datatypes tells you what is needed and provides further references.</p>
<p>By the way, I would also suggest to think about taking the greatest fixpoint (codatatype) <br>
rather than the least (datatype) for ResumpT. Then you can also reason about possibly <br>
infinite computations.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>

Andreas,</p>
<p>The new datatype package sounds pretty cool, if it can do all the things that you say here. I will definitely try it out… as soon as we upgrade our tool to work with the latest Isabelle. But now, we will have an excuse. :)</p>
<p>Thanks so much for getting back to me, and for the helpful pointers!<br>
