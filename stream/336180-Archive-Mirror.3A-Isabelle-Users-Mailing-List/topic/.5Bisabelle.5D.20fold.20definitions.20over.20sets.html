<p>recently, I came across an alternative way to define<br>
a fold on finite sets. In contrast to the Isabelle<br>
library version (discussed in the recent TPHOLs Paper),<br>
it has a slightly more general type:</p>
<p>fold : [['a, 'b] =&gt; 'b, 'b, 'a set] =&gt; 'b</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The library version has type (b =&gt; b =&gt; b) =&gt; (a =&gt; b) =&gt; b =&gt; a set =&gt; b<br>
which is not more specific but simply different. The one you suggest is the<br>
one used in HOL4 which we briefly mention towards the end of section 2.2<br>
where we also give a reference [2] that shows that both combinators are<br>
interdefinable. Ours is based on the singleton-union (SU) view of set<br>
generation, the one in HOL4 on the insert (I) view.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is strictly more general:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>see above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you can define the cardinality of finite sets by this fold, but not<br>
by the old one, for example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of section 3.5 we show how to define card in terms of our fold.</p>
<p>The one point that does make the I-fold more attractive than the SU-fold is<br>
complexity: it is obvious how to define the latter in terms of the former,<br>
but tricky the other way around. In fact, the tricky direction leads to a<br>
situation where you call the SU-fold with a function which is not commutative<br>
in general but only on the arguments arising in that computation. Hence our<br>
library (ie the thms) would need to be generalized a little to accommodate<br>
this situation. Just like the requirement of left-commutativity for the<br>
argument of the I-fold is too strong in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same algorithmic scheme would work for multi-sets too,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The duality between SU and I works for sets/multisets/lists.<br>
See [2] for the details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B) Wouldn't it be a better candidate<br>
  for the Isabelle/HOL library?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there were multiple instances where the SU-fold is more cumbersome to use<br>
than the I-fold, I might agree. But I am only aware of one instance,<br>
transitive closure, and that is defined very differently anyway.</p>
