<p>From: Tomáš Beránek &lt;<a href="mailto:tom@logici.cz">tom@logici.cz</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>my task is to explore possibility of formalisation of a logic in<br>
Isabelle/Isar, which is weaker than logics that are already formalised in<br>
Isabelle. For now I only need a first-order variant (higher orders will be<br>
needed later) of an alternative to<br>
MTL&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_t-norm_logic">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_t-norm_logic</a>&gt;.<br>
This formalisation should be in Hilbert style (some axioms and one MP rule).</p>
<p>I already tried to create the theory by taking the IFOL.thy and editing the<br>
connectives definitions and axioms according to my needs. Then I was able to<br>
prove some basic theorems but it came out it is quite difficult to write and<br>
hard to read these proofs since Isabelle's Pure is based on natural<br>
deduction and these proofs are in Hilbert calculus.</p>
<p>My first decision was to prove many natural deduction rules which I then<br>
would provide to Isabelle's simplifier, but I think the simplifier is also<br>
ment for natural deduction style proofs and thus it would be useles in this<br>
case (?) (without some coding on the ML level).</p>
<p>Then I got the idea to formalize the whole logic inside HOL since the<br>
meta-level of this logic is classical and HOL has many tools already set<br>
up). But here I am not sure if the HOL's tools (like the simplifier)<br>
wouldn't affect proving in my logic somehow unintentionally (turning some<br>
unprovable goals into provable ones etc.).</p>
<p>[Actual question]<br>
Now I am not sure if it is wise to continue writing completely new logic<br>
based on Pure and setting the simplifier to fit this logic or if it would be<br>
better (or at least possible) to make this formalization inside HOL.</p>
<p>I add that this logic should later serve to formalization of Fuzzy Class<br>
Theory &lt;<a href="http://www.mathfuzzlog.org/index.php/Fuzzy_Class_Theory">http://www.mathfuzzlog.org/index.php/Fuzzy_Class_Theory</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>The first attempt of the formalization is in the attached file. I am aware<br>
that the proofs are very bad, I am still learning how proving in Isabelle<br>
really works...</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice, I will gladly provide more precise information if<br>
needed.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Neither the simplifier nor any other proof tool can prove unprovable<br>
thms. Any theorem is proved by the rules that you provide. That is, if<br>
you state "(P&lt;-&gt;Q) ==&gt; (P==Q)" to get the simplifier going for &lt;-&gt;, you<br>
must make sure that this is an admissible rule.</p>

<p>If you want to make deductions merely in the logic, it is fine to set it<br>
up separately. If you do it inside HOL, it should be done as an<br>
inductive definition of provability, and then you can also prove<br>
theorems about provability. That is the more powerful approach.</p>

Thank you for your help, Tobias.</p>
<p>If you can prove the necessary rules to set up the simplifier, it will</p>
<blockquote>
<p>certainly be useful. The only bit of ML code involved is in simpdata.ML,<br>
and you can modify the existing one.</p>

you state "(P&lt;-&gt;Q) ==&gt; (P==Q)" to get the simplifier going for &lt;-&gt;, you<br>
must make sure that this is an admissible rule.</p>
<p>I will maybe ask more questions about this subject, because although I have<br>
some basic understanding of ML, I still cannot understand the code<br>
completely (even the simpdata.ML). For now I will continue proving the<br>
necessary rules.</p>

theorems about provability. That is the more powerful approach.</p>
<p>This topic I will have to discuss with my supervisor, but I think, the<br>
proving about provability will also be necessary in the theory FCT which<br>
will be based on the MTL logic. Now I take a deeper look in the HOL tutorial<br>
on inductively defined sets to see if I can figure out how to define the<br>
notion of provability inductively.</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
There are some (outdated) explanations in <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2011/doc/ref.pdf">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2011/doc/ref.pdf</a><br>
section 9.7 "Setting up the Simplifier".</p>
<p>In src/Pure/simplifier.ML there is also an easy_setup function that should <br>
give an idea how the minimal setup works.</p>
