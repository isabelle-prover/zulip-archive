<p>From: noam neer &lt;<a href="mailto:noamneer@gmail.com">noamneer@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hi everybody.</p>
<p>Whenever I have a rewriting problem (usually involving real expressions) I<br>
try first few general commands like<br>
    by auto<br>
    by simp<br>
    by (simp add: field_simps)<br>
    by sledgehammer</p>
<p>Sometimes none work, for example for<br>
    lemma "(x::real)&gt;0 ==&gt;<br>
                   ((1+x)<em>(1+x)</em>(1+x) powr (1/3))<br>
                   =<br>
                   1+x"</p>
<p>In such cases I sometimes decompose the problem to a few simpler ones, and<br>
sometimes delve into the HOL libraries looking for something useful to add<br>
to simp, possibly reversed.</p>
<p>Since these solutions are somewhat tedious, my question is - are there<br>
other general commands I can try at this point? Or maybe something like<br>
'field_simps' that is more appropriate for real expressions? Any advice<br>
would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanx.</p>

I'm afraid there is no magic bullet for this sort of problem. I often find divide_simps to be more effective than field_simps, but not here. It is obvious how to make that particular example easier to prove. In general though we are all struggling to prove obvious things.</p>

Hi Noam,</p>
<p>In addition to Larry's answer:</p>
<p>I believe you should be made aware of try, try0 and sledgehammer,<br>
these commands invoke generally powerful methods; they are not silver<br>
bullets but are as automatic as it gets in Isabelle and in interactive<br>
theorem provers in general.</p>
<p>Other than that, you have the right strategy of decomposing the goal,<br>
looking for useful theorems and trying to identify useful lemma sets,<br>
such as field_simps, divide_simps etc.</p>

<p>From: "Eugene W. Stark" &lt;<a href="mailto:isabelle-users@starkeffect.com">isabelle-users@starkeffect.com</a>&gt;<br>
There are many others on this list with much more experience than I have,<br>
but FWIW here are some techniques that I have found useful:</p>
<p>* "try" is quite useful, not only for finding out about relevant facts,<br>
     but also for finding out what proof methods are most likely to work<br>
     in various situations.  Surprisingly often, "try" will come up with<br>
     a proof if you let it run for a little while.  A disadvantage is that<br>
     sometimes it seems to explode and cause the system to embark on very<br>
     long garbage collections that put you out of business for many minutes<br>
     (this is a major peeve I have, which I wish could be improved).<br>
     Other times it will claim to produce a proof, but you will find that<br>
     it doesn't actually work.  However, by looking at the list of facts<br>
     that it thinks are relevant, you can select the ones you agree with,<br>
     add them to your "using" list, and re-run "try".  Sometimes you can<br>
     converge on a proof in this way.  At least you are getting an idea<br>
     of what facts the system has that might be relevant.  "Try" will<br>
     quite often find startling proofs by "smt" that are mostly<br>
     incomprehensible by just looking at the list of facts used.<br>
     In working out first versions of a development, I will use these<br>
     as a quick demonstration that what I am trying to prove is actually<br>
     true, but later I will go back and expand into something understandable.<br>
     Infrequently, you can replace "smt" by "metis" or "metis (no_types, lifting)"<br>
     to avoid the use of "smt".  Sometimes "try" will claim to produce proofs<br>
     by "smt" that mention "everything but the kitchen sink" and will say<br>
     that "smt" timed out.  I throw these away and try something else.</p>
<p>* "try0" is useful if you have a pretty good idea of a superset of the<br>
     facts needed to prove something, but you don't know which proof method<br>
     is going to work.  The "try0" command has a time limit, which avoids<br>
     spamming the system like "try" can do, so it is not a bad idea to try<br>
     it first, "just in case".  A disadvantage of "try0" is that it will miss<br>
     long-running proofs by "force" and "fastforce" because they will time out.<br>
     That is, you might have a sufficient list of facts, but a proof by<br>
     "force" or "fastforce" will take longer than "try0" allows.  This can<br>
     be frustrating.</p>
<p>* As a first strategy when automatic attempts to find a proof fail,<br>
     look at the output from using "apply simp" on your goal.<br>
     Try to get an idea why the simplifier only gets as far as it does.<br>
     This can help to identify missing hypotheses or to try to get an<br>
     idea of what kind of additional facts should be supplied.<br>
     If "apply simp" makes substantial progress, but fails to complete<br>
     the proof, take the result it produces and work on it as a subgoal.<br>
     If you succeed in proving this subgoal, then you can complete the<br>
     original proof by adding one additional "by simp" step.</p>
<p>* If a goal refuses to succumb to your first attempts, your main recourse is<br>
     to try to break it into simpler subgoals.  The output of "apply auto"<br>
     is one way of doing this, but the goals might not be very natural.<br>
     In other cases, you have to apply your understanding of how the proof should<br>
     go to figure out how to reduce the original goal to subgoals that are likely<br>
     to be easier to solve.  Sometimes if you look around you can find introduction<br>
     or elimination rules that were not applied automatically, and you can explicitly<br>
     invoke them in the first step of the proof.</p>
<p>* Another strategy that can be helpful when you think you have a set of facts that<br>
     ought to prove the result but you can't see why the system will not find a proof,<br>
     is to start specifying the required instances of the facts using the [of ...]<br>
     construct.  While doing this, keep an eye on the output window to make sure that<br>
     you are in fact specifying the correct instances (this can be done by comparing<br>
     terms in the instances of the facts being used with terms in the goal).<br>
     If you get the instances wrong, then you will waste a lot of time on a proof that<br>
     can't work, so it is best to be careful here.<br>
     In some cases, specifying partial or full instantiations will provide the boost<br>
     needed for one of the proof methods to succeed.  In general, "force" and "fastforce"<br>
     often require that instances be specified, whereas "auto" and "simp" seem to<br>
     be able to find the required instances automatically more often.<br>
     If I find a proof in this way, I then generally attempt to reduce the instance<br>
     information to the bare minimum needed for the proof to succeed.  The reason for<br>
     this is, even though the instance information is useful documentation for a<br>
     human reader, if a change is made later to the facts that have been instantiated,<br>
     the order in which the terms have to be specified will often change, which<br>
     will cause the proof to break.  So a proof with as few instances specified as<br>
     possible will generally be more robust to later changes in the statements of the<br>
     facts it uses.</p>
<p>* One of the most difficult things for me in trying to learn how to<br>
     produce proofs in the system was to come to understand the "personalities"<br>
     of the various proof methods.  Probably knowing how each of them is<br>
     implemented would be very useful, but I don't have such knowledge,<br>
     and probably most normal users wouldn't, either.  From trying to do proofs<br>
     lots of different ways and using "try" and observing the results,<br>
     the following seem to me to be true:</p>
<p>* "simp" is perhaps the main workhorse.  It takes facts, treats<br>
      them as rewrite rules, applies the rules to the goal, accumulates<br>
      consequences of the rules, and ultimately attempts to rewrite<br>
      the goal to "True".  When equations are used as rules, the<br>
      orientation is important: if the rules do not produce something<br>
      "simpler" (it can be hard to figure out what this ought to mean<br>
      in a given situation) then "simp" will not work well.<br>
      "Simp" can loop when presented with incompatibly oriented rules;<br>
      the symptom of this is "by simp" remaining a purple color, rather<br>
      than turning pink (indicating failure) after some time.<br>
          One can sometimes glean some information about why the looping<br>
          has occurred by adding [[simp_trace]] and perhaps also<br>
      [[simp_trace_depth_limit=5]] (or whatever depth is desired)<br>
          to the "using" list and then hovering the mouse over the "by simp"<br>
      or "apply simp" to see the simplifier trace.  The output can be<br>
      voluminous and is not that easy to understand.</p>
<p>Another important thing to understand about "simp" is how it<br>
      uses implications P1 ==&gt; P2 ==&gt; ... ==&gt; Q as rewrite rules.<br>
          It uses such an implication by unifying Q with the goal, then<br>
      recursively attempting to simplify the obtained instances of<br>
      P1, P2, ..., to "True".  If a subgoal fails to simplify, then<br>
      backtracking occurs, and the simplifier gives up on that rule<br>
      and tries another.  As far as I can see, the simplifier considers<br>
      "success" to have occurred whenever <em>some</em> simplification is made.<br>
          Once this occurs, backtracking is apparently suppressed for that<br>
          subgoal.  What this means is that sometimes having "too many"<br>
      simplification rules can cause the simplifier to miss things<br>
      that it actually has rules for.  This can seem mysterious unless<br>
          you are able to examine the simplifier trace, and even then it can<br>
      take time to figure out.  So it is important to be able to control<br>
      the facts the simplifier has and when failure occurs to try to<br>
      understand the reason for it.</p>
<p>* "auto" extends "simp" by doing things like splitting cases and canonicalizing<br>
      the goal in various ways.  Whereas "simp" will not increase the number<br>
      of subgoals, "auto" will often do so.  As far as I know, if something can be<br>
      proved by "simp", it can also be proved by "auto", though the proof might<br>
      take slightly longer.  Just as looking at the output of "apply simp"<br>
      can be helpful to understanding, looking at the output of "apply auto"<br>
      can, as well, though because of the case splitting and other<br>
      transformations that "auto" makes to the goal it can be more difficult<br>
      to understand the result.</p>
<p>The output of "apply simp" or "apply auto" will show a failed subgoal<br>
      of the form P1 ==&gt; P2 ==&gt; ... ==&gt; Q.  I typically focus first on Q,<br>
      as that is generally where the essence of what is going on is located.<br>
      Then work back, looking at the Pi to see among them are rules that<br>
      would unify with Q and try to see whether there is sufficient information<br>
      to verify their hypotheses.  In some cases, Q will be obviously untrue,<br>
      in which case "False" needs to be derivable from the Pi.</p>
<p>* "force" and "fastforce" will use simplification, but they seem to<br>
      restrict the simplifications that are used in some sense that I<br>
      don't really understand well.  They will also generally use introduction<br>
          and elimination rules in more general contexts than what "auto"<br>
      will do.  For example, "auto" seems unwilling to consider the use of<br>
      an elimination rule if the term to which the rule applies happens to<br>
      be conjoined with other terms, but it will use the elimination rule<br>
      if the term stands alone.  On the other hand "force" and "fastforce"<br>
      seem to be able to apply the elimination rule regardless.<br>
      Guessing from the names, "force" and "fastforce" probably also do a<br>
      certain amount of brute-force search.  This seems to make them useful<br>
      in situations where there are permutative facts that need to be applied<br>
      that have no suitable orientations as rewrite rules.  On the other hand,<br>
      this means that these methods may succumb to combinatorial explosion in<br>
      cert<br>

Hi Noam,</p>
<p>If neither "try" or "try0" tries hard enough, why don't you try "try_hard" from PSL [1].<br>
Alternatively, you can write your own proof strategy:</p>
<p>strategy ForNoam =<br>
  Thens<br>
    [Ors <br>
      [Auto,<br>
       Simp,<br>
       User &lt;simp add: field_simps&gt;,<br>
       User &lt;simp add: devide_simps&gt;,<br>
       User &lt;simp add: arith&gt;,<br>
       User &lt;simp add: algebra&gt;,<br>
       User &lt;simp add: ac_simps&gt;,<br>
       User &lt;simp add: algebra_simps&gt;,<br>
       Hammer<br>
       ],<br>
     IsSolved<br>
     ]</p>
<p>and apply this strategy as follows:</p>
<p>lemma "True (<em>just an example</em>)"<br>
  find_proof ForNoam<br>
  oops</p>
<p>Essentially, this strategy keeps applying </p>
<ul>
<li>auto,</li>
<li>simp,</li>
<li>simp add: field_simps,</li>
<li>simp add: devide_simps,</li>
<li>simp add: arith,</li>
<li>simp add: algebra,</li>
<li>simp add: algebra_simps,</li>
<li>sledgehammer<br>
until one of them discharges your proof obligation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If one of them discharges your proof obligation, <br>
PSL shows that proof method with the corresponding arguments<br>
in the output window.</p>
<p>To use PSL, you have to download its source code form GitHub [2] and <br>
import "PSL.thy" using the "import" command as usual with the right<br>
path to "PSL.thy".</p>
<p>It is just a theory file. So, installation should be easy.</p>
<p>The drawback of this approach is that it can be pretty slow at finding a proof script.<br>
But if it finds a proof script, the proof script shown in the output window tends to be efficient.</p>
