Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm working with really large proof states, that may take tens of<br>
seconds only to pretty-print (The pretty-printer seems to scale very<br>
poorly to large terms). </p>
<p>In order to keep interactive proving manageable, I use goals_limit=1,<br>
which drastically reduces the response-time until I see the next proof<br>
state. </p>
<p>However, if a proof method fails, it dumps the whole proof state to the<br>
output buffer, and goals_limit is not applied there. This feature<br>
(introduced newly in Isabelle2013) again renders interactive proving for<br>
big goal states unmanageable: In my case, you have to wait approx. 1<br>
minute only to see that your proof method failed, and this one minute<br>
contains a few milliseconds to find that the method actually fails, and<br>
one minute to pretty print the error message.</p>
<p>Is there a way to deactivate the goal-state being dumped with the error<br>
message?</p>

<p>The pretty printer as such is relatively fast, it depends what else you <br>
have in the context to make it slow (e.g. abbreviations).  Independently <br>
of that, any system has its range where it works well and breaks down when <br>
stretched too far, as usual.</p>

<p>You can edit Isabelle2013/src/Pure/Isar/proof_display.ML to change the <br>
string_of_goal function like this:</p>
<p>fun string_of_goal ctxt goal =<br>
   Pretty.string_of (Pretty.chunks<br>
     [pretty_goal_header goal,<br>
       Goal_Display.pretty_goal<br>
         {main = Config.get ctxt Goal_Display.show_main_goal, limit = true} ctxt goal]);</p>
<p>This is mainly for Isar error messages.  There are a few more situations <br>
where goal states are printed.</p>
<p>I shall see how to refine that again for the next release, although that <br>
is still far ahead.</p>
