People often ask how to enable the [| ... |] ==&gt; output, which many find more readable than the default. It’s certainly my preference.</p>
<p>To do this, open the Plugin Options panel and type the word “brackets” into Print Mode as shown.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Can you explain this? Or is it just due to habits and nostalgy?</p>
<p>The uniform notation of nested ==&gt; goes back to 1998, when Isar concepts<br>
were emerging, with some consequences on Pure. E.g. it became possible<br>
to work with nested rules routinely. Before, rules were mostly flat and<br>
the bracketed notation was adequate. Afterwards, I found nested rules<br>
with brackets very cumbersome to read and to write, and eventually<br>
stopped doing that. Since Isabelle/jEdit is shipped with defaults for<br>
Isar, this print mode also changed approx. 5 years ago.</p>
<p>Note that plain currying (for =&gt; and ==&gt;) without any special notational<br>
tricks has the advantage that the depth of nesting is immediately<br>
visible by the parentheses around complex items. This visual clue is<br>
absent in bracket notation (which is better for long lists of flat items).</p>
<p>Moreover, typing [| |] is almost impossible on a non-English keyboard. I<br>
usually prefer input and output to coincide as much as feasible. I<br>
cannot imagine anybody with a German keyword to prefer these special<br>
brackets.</p>
<p>Another reason from 1998: many people not familiar with Isabelle asking<br>
in presentations "What are these semantic brackets? What are these<br>
semicolons?" Any also: What are these question-mark variables?".</p>
<p>Typical introductions to Isabelle talk about programming language<br>
semantics (even until today, e.g. the "Concrete Semantics" book), so it<br>
looks very odd to me to construct an artificial conflict with standard<br>
notation of semantic brackets and sequential composition. Such<br>
applications then require double semicolons (Or maybe bold ones?). We<br>
have managed to get rid of semicolons in outer syntax some years ago<br>
(making them free for sequential composition of proof methods), so maybe<br>
we can one day do the same for inner syntax.</p>
<p>I have actually started using "if" and "for" notation for the clauses in<br>
inductive definitions, especially in introductions to Isabelle. The<br>
postfix notation is like in Prolog (what most people already know) and<br>
the keywords "if" and "for" look self-explanatory. That Isar rule<br>
notation with semantic brackets and semicolons in their conventional<br>
meaning could make a difference for didactic purposes.</p>
<p>Back to occasional complaints about iterated ==&gt; in output. My<br>
impression is that most people talk about goal state output, not rule<br>
output. Today, there is no particular reason why the outer subgoal<br>
structure should be printed with !! / ==&gt; at all. It could be done in<br>
some Isar notation, either fix/assume/show or show/if/for. Moreover it<br>
could be done in a way that makes it easy to copy-paste (or "sendback")<br>
the result into the emerging Isar proof text.</p>
<p>Also note that the ASCII notation of ==&gt; used to have special<br>
line-breaks for pretty printing, maybe to require less space when it is<br>
iterated. Just as historic accident, the symbolic notation ⟹ was lacking<br>
that: it was introduced as plain infixr in<br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/9dd06eeda95c">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/9dd06eeda95c</a> -- maybe by<br>
accident.</p>
<p>When the default officially changed from ASCII to symbols recently, I<br>
also changed the special formatting of ==&gt; to plain infixr (see<br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/301833d9013a#l3.77">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/301833d9013a#l3.77</a>). I<br>
simply did not dare to ask what is the <em>right</em> way to print the long<br>
arrow notation, after everybody got used to the presumably wrong way in<br>
so many years of Isabelle symbols usage (both in the user interface and<br>
in LaTeX output).</p>
<p>Maybe we should just recover that line-breaking for both the ASCII and<br>
symbolic double-arrow? It could make a difference for screen display,<br>
but also cause surprises in LaTeX documents that are tweaked for a<br>
particular layout.</p>

Different people have different preferences, of course.  For me, it is precisely the nesting that makes a clearly bracketed notation preferable. A flat list like [a,b,c,d,e,f,g] is no less readable if written as a:<span aria-label="b" class="emoji emoji-1f171" role="img" title="b">:b:</span>:c::d::e::f::g::nil. But consider [a,[b,c],[d,e],[f,g]].</p>
<p>Also, with large formulas, it isn’t always clear whether … ==&gt; A is the conclusion or just another premise.</p>

<p>From: Tobias Nipkow &lt;<a href="mailto:nipkow@in.tum.de">nipkow@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
My (and my students') preference for "brackets" concerns mostly the printing of <br>
the proof state. Indeed, part of the problem may be due to the infixr directive <br>
which leads to displays such as this.</p>
<p>1. (A ⟹ B) ⟹<br>
     (B ⟹ C) ⟹<br>
     (C ⟹ D) ⟹<br>
     (E ⟹ F ⟹ G) ⟹ (A ⟹ B) ⟹ (B ⟹ C) ⟹ (C ⟹ D) ⟹ (E ⟹ F ⟹ G) ⟹ A</p>
<p>I agree with Larry that lots of arrows make it harder to grasp the structure. I <br>
think this is related to the fact that mathematicians write A &amp; B ==&gt; C rather <br>
than A ==&gt; B ==&gt; C.</p>
<p>I am not fixated on the brackets format per se. Something like the suggested <br>
fix/assume/show or show/if/for format may be a decent alternative. It would also <br>
clearly separate assumptions from conclusion.</p>
<p>In the end, it is not clear to me what the optimal format is. AFAIK, in Coq each <br>
assumption is on a separate line. I wonder how well that works if there are many <br>
assumptions. Conversely, with "brackets" you get a very compact representation, <br>
which can be hard to read because all the assumptions merge into one.</p>
<p>Jasmin asked students from a course of his (who had previous exposure to Coq) <br>
which output format they preferred and the majority said Coq. Of course there <br>
are many factors at work here.</p>

<p>One more thing, in case you have installed Isabelle2016-1 from scratch: you also <br>
need to tick the "Proof state" box to see the proof state in the output window. <br>
It is disabled by default now.</p>
