<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu">andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi all,</p>
<p>I stumbled across the following (unexpected) behaviour: If I do an Isar proof of <br>
multiple goals I have refined the proof state by including a bundle prior to the <br>
opening "proof", the "next" separator deletes the bundle.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<p>definition test :: "'a list =&gt; 'a list" where "test xs = []"<br>
bundle test = test_def[simp]<br>
lemma shows "test xs = []" and "test ys = []"<br>
   including test<br>
proof -<br>
   show "test xs = []" by simp<br>
next<br>
   show "test ys = []" by simp (* fails *)<br>
qed</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it works if I nest the multiple goals inside a block:</p>
<p>proof -<br>
   {<br>
     show "test xs = []" by simp<br>
   next<br>
     show "test ys = []" by simp (* works *)<br>
   }<br>
qed</p>
<p>Is this behaviour intended?</p>
<p>Andreas</p>

It follows naturally from the true meaning of Isar commands, also from the <br>
principle of liberality in Isar design (cf. the concluding note on "abusus <br>
non tollit usus" in my PhD thesis).</p>
<p>So yes, it is all within the normal parameters of Isar, despite the <br>
potential surprise.  The above example indicates that the new 'including' <br>
command is better not used before a proof block.  BTW, the longer existing <br>
'using', with its later addition to affect the context, already produces <br>
the same effect:</p>
<p>lemma "x = x" "y = y"<br>
   using [[show_types]]<br>
proof<br>
next<br>
   show "y = y" ..<br>
qed</p>
<p>In some sense the above indentation provides a vague hint on the scoping <br>
rules, although it is better not to stretch things that far.</p>
<p>Generally, the 'next' command switches blocks, here the implicit one of <br>
the enclosing goal statement.  So you don't delete declarations from the <br>
context, you go back to an earlier context that does not have them.</p>
<p>In the example above you are using 'next' as if would "separate subgoals", <br>
but this is not really its meaning.  Plain 'show' statements do not have <br>
to be separated.  Separate blocks are only required for goals with their <br>
own local context.  In that case { ... show ... next ... show ... } works, <br>
but is a bit awkward just to get a common context for what you are <br>
proving.</p>
<p>Here is an alternative form that includes a bundle in the context of a <br>
toplevel statement:</p>
<p>lemma<br>
     includes test<br>
     shows "test xs = []" and "test ys = []"<br>
   proof -<br>
     show "test xs = []" by simp<br>
   next -- "redundant"<br>
     show "test ys = []" by simp<br>
   qed</p>
<p>For local statements within a proof you can use 'include' with regular <br>
block structure, if it is really required.</p>

Hi Makarius,</p>
<p>thanks for the explanation.</p>

I have never tried this. So far, I only used "using &lt;facts&gt;" and "unfolding <br>
&lt;some_def&gt;". The latter always worked on all goals and the former affected all <br>
goals if used with the right initial method (-, simp_all, auto, etc.), so I <br>
would have expected that something similar applies to including.</p>

<p>In the example above you are using 'next' as if would "separate subgoals", but<br>
this is not really its meaning. Plain 'show' statements do not have to be<br>
separated.<br>
In my real use case, each goal had the full fix-assume-show chain, so the next <br>
was necessary there.</p>

next -- "redundant"<br>
show "test ys = []" by simp<br>
qed<br>
I read about that alternative, but I actually prefer "including" over <br>
"includes", because including does not clutter the statement of the lemma with <br>
hints to the prover.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Yet another alternative keeps the context and the statement separate:</p>
<p>context includes test<br>
   begin</p>
<p>lemma shows ...</p>
<p>end</p>
