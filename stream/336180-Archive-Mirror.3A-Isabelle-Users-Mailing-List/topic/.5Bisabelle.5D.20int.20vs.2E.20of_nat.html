Hello all,</p>
<p>Isabelle's standard library has two different coercions from the naturals to <br>
the integers: IntDef.thy defines "int::nat=&gt;int" which is monomorphic, and <br>
Nat.thy defines "of_nat::nat=&gt;'a" which coerces from naturals into an <br>
arbitrary semiring. At type "nat=&gt;int" they both mean exactly the same thing <br>
(see lemma IntDef.int_eq_of_nat). The only difference is that they are each <br>
set up with different sets of simp rules.</p>
<p>My question is, why do we have both? If any of you have chosen to use one over <br>
the other, which one did you choose, and why?</p>
<p>Unless there is a compelling reason to keep both, I would propose to either <br>
make "int" an abbreviation for "of_nat::nat=&gt;int", or just eliminate it <br>
altogether. Also, if users prefer the way the simplifier works with "int", <br>
then the simp rules for "of_nat" should be changed accordingly.</p>
<p>I could also ask the same thing about the overloaded function "real::'a=&gt;real" <br>
from the HOL-Complex library, which is redundant with "of_nat::nat=&gt;real" and <br>
"of_int::int=&gt;real" at those types. Do we need separate constants for these?</p>

The duplication is not intentional and it would be nice to eliminate it. <br>
    One could choose either "ty :: 'a =&gt; ty" or "of_ty :: ty =&gt; 'a" as <br>
primitive (int::nat=&gt;int should have been int::'a=&gt;int) and relate them <br>
via (ty :: ty' =&gt; ty) = (of_ty' :: ty' =&gt; ty) for specif ty and ty'.</p>
<p>Function ty :: 'a =&gt; ty has the advantage of being the familiar one <br>
whereas of_ty is somewhat unusual. However, I gather that of_ty often <br>
allows to formulate polymorphic theorems whereas ty does not.</p>
<p>Maybe one could combine both advantages: of_ty is the primitive, but <br>
monomorphic instances are printed as ty (and ty is also allowed upon input).</p>

The reasons are historical. Function "int" belongs to the original  <br>
construction of the integers. When (a few years ago) I reworked the  <br>
numeric types to take advantage of type classes, I realised that a  <br>
polymorphic "of_nat" function could easily be defined. Naturally most  <br>
developments should use of_nat rather than int, but function "int"  <br>
appears to be necessary to develop the integers in the first place  <br>
and to establish the type class axioms.</p>
<p>Note that "of_nat" has a single polymorphic definition. There is a  <br>
similar function of_int, and we could easily define of_rat too, all  <br>
using type classes. On the other hand, "real" is merely an overloaded  <br>
constant, which is far less attractive.</p>
