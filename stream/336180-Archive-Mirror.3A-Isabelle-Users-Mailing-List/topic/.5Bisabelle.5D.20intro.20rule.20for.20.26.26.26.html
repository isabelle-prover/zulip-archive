Dear Isabelle,</p>
<p>When I type...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma assumes "A ∧ B" shows "A" "B"<br>
using assms<br>
apply rule</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...I obtain the following proof state...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>goal (2 subgoals):<br>
 1. A ⟹ B ⟹ A<br>
 2. B </p>
</blockquote>
<p>... which is insoluble. I think the "apply rule" step is using the conjE rule. Which rule should I apply in order to obtain the preferred proof state below? I briefly tried conjunctionI but that doesn't seem quite to fit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>goal (2 subgoals):<br>
 1. A ⟹ B ⟹ A<br>
 2. A ⟹ B ⟹ B </p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, I know I can solve this lemma via auto; my question is pedagogical rather than practical.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>

Hi,</p>
<p>I was told, but don’t understand the reasons, that this works as an<br>
intro rule for &amp;&amp;&amp;:</p>
<p>lemma assumes "A ∧ B" shows "A" "B"<br>
using assms<br>
apply -</p>
<p>goal (2 subgoals):</p>
<ol>
<li>A ∧ B ⟹ A</li>
<li>A ∧ B ⟹ B </li>
</ol>
<p>But I’m also looking forward for pedagogical enlightenment. </p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
Joachim<br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Automated tools are indeed obstructing the understanding how formal proof <br>
really works.  Here is my version of the above example:</p>
<p>notepad<br>
begin</p>
<p>assume ab: "A &amp; B"<br>
   from ab have A and A<br>
     apply rule<br>
      apply assumption<br>
     using ab<br>
     apply rule<br>
     apply assumption<br>
     done</p>
<p>from ab obtain A and B ..</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>General notes on it:</p>
<p>* 'notepad' is better for experimentation than old-fashioned 'lemma',<br>
     because it gives you the full proof language.  In top-level theorem<br>
     statements your possibilities to indicate proof structure are more<br>
     limited and one has to simulate things, and obscure the main points<br>
     more than necessary.  There is also the initial goal hanging around,<br>
     but proof is not primarily about goals.</p>
<p>* The fact "ab" (or your assms) need to be eliminated twice to work on<br>
     the two goals "A" and "B".  The "rule" method implicitly refers to<br>
     conjE, but it works on the head goal only.  Note that in old-fashioned<br>
     tactical reasoning, you would simulate a local fact like "ab" via some<br>
     goal premise "A &amp; B ==&gt; ...", and "apply (erule conjE)" would consume<br>
     that, and the result would indeed become insoluble as you've said.<br>
     In proper Isar, the context grows monotonically, and things can be<br>
     used again as required.</p>
<p>* My second proof above via 'obtain' does the elimination of fact "ab"<br>
     in a single step, saying that it is possible to assume A and B<br>
     simultaneously thanks to the (implicit) conjE rule.  Recall that ".."<br>
     abbreviates "by rule" (actually "by default", which is a bit more).</p>
<p>Formally, there is only one goal behind 'obtain', so it works in a<br>
     single rule application step, not two.  It would be more awkward to<br>
     prove:</p>
<p>from ab have A and B sorry</p>
<p>which are two goals again.</p>
<p>Since the context of assumptions is commutative, you may swap the<br>
     obtain result in-place like this:</p>
<p>from ab obtain B and A ..</p>
<p>Putting it all together, here is my canonical starter proof for Isar:</p>
<p>assume "A &amp; B"<br>
   then obtain B and A ..<br>
   then have "B &amp; A" ..</p>
<p>You can also make implicit rules explicit like this:</p>
<p>assume "A &amp; B"<br>
   then obtain B and A by (rule conjE)<br>
   then have "B &amp; A" by (rule conjI)</p>
<p>Using the projections conjD1/conjD2 instead, it becomes a bit more awkward <br>
and artificial:</p>
<p>assume ab: "A &amp; B"<br>
   from ab have a: A by (rule conjD1)<br>
   from ab have b: B by (rule conjD2)<br>
   from b and a have "B &amp; A" by (rule conjI)</p>
<p>To be more fair, here is another variant that minimizes the spaghetti of <br>
fact references:</p>
<p>assume "A &amp; B"<br>
   then have B ..<br>
   from <code>A &amp; B</code> have A ..<br>
   with <code>B</code> have "B &amp; A" ..</p>
<p>I usually prefer the first-class support of eliminations in Isar via <br>
'obtain' to reduce the formal noise and expose the reasoning more <br>
directly.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
&amp;&amp;&amp; is merely funny Pure notation to say that there are several <br>
simultaneous goals to be proven.</p>
<p>The system needs to retain this structure for advanced methods like <br>
"induct", so it cannot be split into several goals by default.  The <br>
splitting happends implicitly for any other proof method like "rule", <br>
which then acts on the first resulting subgoal only.  There are other <br>
proof methods like "auto" that operate on all available subgoals, and <br>
consequently insert used facts into all of them at the start, so the above <br>
example will work here.</p>
<p>You can see the difference again in "simp" vs. "simp_all", which is the <br>
same tool acting either on the head goal or all goals: "apply simp_all" <br>
will solve the above, but not "apply simp".</p>
<p>Further fine points:</p>
<p>assume "A &amp; B"<br>
   then have A and B by (simp, simp)  -- works</p>
<p>assume "A &amp; B"<br>
   then have A and B by simp simp  -- fails</p>
<p>assume "A &amp; B"<br>
   then have A and B apply simp apply simp done  -- fails</p>
<p>assume "A &amp; B"<br>
   then have A and B<br>
     apply simp<br>
     using <code>A &amp; B</code><br>
     apply simp<br>
     done  -- works</p>
<p>The first one works, because the method expression with sequential <br>
composition "," uses the same facts each time: both simp steps will insert <br>
the given facts into the respective head subgoal before doing <br>
simplification.</p>
<p>The second version puts one simp in the "initial" slot of 'by', and the <br>
other in the "terminal" slot.  Only the initial method expressions sees <br>
the used facts, they are reset afterwards.</p>
<p>The third version imitates the same operationally, using two separate <br>
'apply' steps.  The 'apply' command essentially "consumes" the used facts, <br>
so the second simp won't see them and fail.</p>
<p>The fourth version refreshes the consumed facts by explicit 'using' in the <br>
apply script, so it works again.</p>
<p>This illustrates that "by method1 method2" is structurally different from <br>
"by (method1, method2).  I always emphasize the importance to do canonical <br>
"by induct auto" or "by cases auto" steps that way, and not "optimize" <br>
special cases where old-fashioned sequential composition via "," happens <br>
to work.  The latter is merely an odd imitation of tactical proof style in <br>
Isar, and should have disappeared already 10 years ago.</p>
