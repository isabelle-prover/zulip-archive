Hi all,</p>
<p>With jEdit, I've been experiencing some weird, massive slowdowns <br>
occasionally when I'm editing, and finally figured out why it happens. I <br>
have a habit of sometimes viewing the same buffer in two split frames. <br>
If I edit in the frame viewing a later part of the buffer, all is well. <br>
But if I start editing in the frame viewing an earlier part of the <br>
buffer than the other frame, it seems that every time I change something <br>
in that frame, the parser will immediately try to re-process the file up <br>
to the frame with the latest view of the buffer, causing a massive <br>
slow-down.<br>
Naturally, the larger the space between the two viewing frames, the <br>
worse it gets.</p>
<p>Knowing this, it's pretty easy to work around, but it would be nice not <br>
to have to worry about it. Maybe it's just a question of having it <br>
process only up to the frame that has focus, instead of the <br>
latest-viewing frame?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Note that is not "the parser", but the actual prover doing work in the <br>
background.  It does many things apart from parsing, and it is surprising <br>
to see how well that mode of "continous proof checking" already works in <br>
Isabelle2013 with and most applications that I have seen.  Sometimes there <br>
are very "slow" theories that spoil the game, though.</p>
<p>Generally, the system tries to process the visible parts of the overall <br>
collection of theories, and what is required as imports for that.  There <br>
are also some implicit policies about printing results depending on <br>
visibility -- often printing takes more time than proving.</p>

<p>The idea is indeed that the system takes care of the scheduling such that <br>
the user has as little to worry.  This will be again refined in the next <br>
release (coming within the next few months, before the winter).  There <br>
will be also a few flags to switch off parts of the checking <br>
declaratively, but it needs further experimentation how many "controls" <br>
the user can manage.  The system is no longer driven like a handcart as in <br>
the TTY / Proof General ago, but runs on its own at very high speed.</p>
<p>I would rather not include window focus in any of the implicit policies, <br>
since this is not well-defined in the Java/Swing GUI framework.  Maybe <br>
Sun/Oracle had something specified in mind, but empirically focus is very <br>
unreliable, sometimes lack of focus even locks-up the application.</p>
