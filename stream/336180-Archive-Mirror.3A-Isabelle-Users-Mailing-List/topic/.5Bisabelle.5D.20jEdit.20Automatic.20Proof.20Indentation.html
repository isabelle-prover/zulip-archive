Hi all,</p>
<p>In my spare time I constructed the attached script to attempt to<br>
automatically indent apply-style proofs. It is written in BeanShell,<br>
which was probably a mistake, but what's done is done. To use the<br>
script, it should be sufficient to just drop it in:</p>
<p>~/.isabelle/jedit/macros/</p>
<p>and restart jEdit.</p>
<p>You can then select a block of proof script you want indented, and then<br>
in the jEdit menus select "Macros" -&gt; "proof-indent".</p>
<p>The script has its fair share of problems: multi-line statements are not<br>
handled well, and there seems to be some problems in handling the first<br>
line of proof script.</p>
<p>I am posting that script as-is hoping that somebody else might find it<br>
useful in its current state, and to also ask for a little bit of help:</p>
<p>In particular, does anyone know how I can determine that first and last<br>
characters of each command in the proof script? I am currently using<br>
"snapshot.node().command_at(x)", which gives me the proof state<br>
approximately at character "x" of the file, but doesn't appear to<br>
provide me with the exact start/end of each statement that I desire.</p>
<p>If anyone could point me to the correct way of pulling this information<br>
out of Isabelle (or some documentation), I would very much appreciate<br>
it.</p>
<p>Thanks so much,<br>
David</p>

The second component appears to return the starting offset, and range()/proper_range() provide you with the length of the command (with or without trailing comments/whitespace):</p>

<p>cmd_start = snapshot.node().command_at(x).get();<br>
cmd = cmd_start._1;<br>
start = cmd_start._2;<br>
range = cmd.proper_range();<br>
end = start + range.stop;</p>

I think you have to browse the respective .scala source files. It also helps to experiment in the BeanShell console of jEdit.</p>
