<p>From: Jason Dagit &lt;<a href="mailto:dagitj@gmail.com">dagitj@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
I'm using Isabelle 2015 on OS X 10.10.3 and I'm having a few problems.</p>
<p>First, if I leave jEdit running then when I come back to my computer I will<br>
often find jEdit has crashed:<br>
Application Specific Information:<br>
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'JavaNativeException',<br>
reason: 'java.lang.StackOverflowError'<br>
terminating with uncaught exception of type JNFException<br>
abort() called</p>
<p>I upgraded to the latest JRE (1.8), but I think jEdit is still using 1.7? I<br>
don't know a good way to tell so I'm basing that on what it says in the<br>
"About" screen in the jEdit menu. On the other hand, typing "java -version"<br>
at the command line returns this:<br>
java version "1.8.0"<br>
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0-b132)</p>
<p>Second, I use OS X to remap my keyboard to the dvorak layout, but when I<br>
use a modifier key such as control jEdit interprets my keypress<br>
incorrectly. I can even see this happening from the keyboard test utility<br>
under the troubleshooting menu. This makes it impossible for me to use<br>
certain shortcuts or to even use certain keys. This looks similar to my<br>
problem:<br>
<a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8028617">https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8028617</a></p>
<p>Third, when I use sledgehammer remote_vampire always gives an error about<br>
SystemOnTPTP, which makes me think remote_vampire is broken at the moment.<br>
So instead of continuing to hammer their website, I wanted to remove<br>
remote_vampire. So I removed remote_vampire in the jEdit options, but it<br>
seemed to have no effect. I had to add a line like this to my<br>
theory: sledgehammer_params[cvc4 z3 spass e]</p>
<p>Fourth, at this point I wanted to go back to using emacs so that at least<br>
the first two issues would go away. The official tutorial, dated May of<br>
this year, even has this to say:<br>
"The recommended interface for Isabelle/Isar is the (X)Emacs-based Proof<br>
General [1, 2]." But when I tried to connect Proof General to Isabelle, I<br>
discovered that it never connects because tty support was removed! So is<br>
Proof General still the recommended interface as the tutorial says?</p>
<p>Fifth, there have been several times when I thought Isabelle accepted my<br>
proof, but actually there was an error and jEdit makes this difficult to<br>
see. It's hard to explain this one without lots of screenshots. The problem<br>
seems to be that jEdit tries to be clever and runs parts of the proof in<br>
parallel or something. Is there a way to make it work like Proof General<br>
where you can enter and retract the steps one at a time and explicitly?<br>
I've tried toggling the "Auto Update" checkbox but then I can't tell what<br>
part of the buffer has been accepted. Also, I don't see a way to make a<br>
shortcut for requesting an update. Switching back to the mouse constantly<br>
is annoying. So for now I use the "Auto Update" feature but I don't have a<br>
good way to be sure Isabelle has completely accepted my input. It's also<br>
easy to accidentally interrupt slow queries, such as sledgehammer which is<br>
mildly annoying and a waste of time.</p>
<p>Sixth, I like to version control my configuration files and put them on<br>
github so that I can easy restore my account or setup a new account on a<br>
new computer. How do I export my jEdit settings?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Jason</p>

<p>That might be a generic JVM problem due to scarce resources.  The defaults <br>
are made to ensure that the system comes up in most hardware <br>
configurations, but it is not so much for really big things.  On Mac OS X, <br>
the <a href="http://Isabelle2015.app">Isabelle2015.app</a> has an Info.plist with JVMOptions; you can carefully <br>
edit that to say something like:</p>
<p>-Xms1024m -Xmx4096m -Xss4m</p>
<p>These options correspond to the normal java command-line.  See the <br>
standard documentation by Oracle.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We are talking about the Isabelle application here, which runs the jEdit <br>
text editor as outer shell.  Everything is bundled, even the JDK.  You <br>
should not need to change anything there.  (It can be done in theory, but <br>
requires manual tinkering.)</p>

<p>It just means the shell has a different idea about the default Java than <br>
Isabelle.  On the command-line, you would have to use "isabelle java <br>
-version", where the "isabelle" executable is from the Isabelle <br>
distribution inside the .app directory.  It also has an "isabelle jedit" <br>
command-line tool, but if you use that instead of the .app you need to <br>
provide JEDIT_JAVA_OPTIONS via $ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/settings (which is <br>
a bash script and absent by default).</p>

<p>This sounds like a generic Java or jEdit problem.  You can try plain jEdit <br>
from <a href="http://www.jedit.org">http://www.jedit.org</a> to see if it is the same.  Depending on that, we <br>
can continue the discussion here or on the jedit tracker <br>

<p>That is probably the "tutorial" entry in the Documentation collection, but <br>
that is fairly outdated.  The "prog-prove" tutorial is more up-to-date, <br>
although its Isabelle/jEdit screenshot is a bit old.</p>
<p>We have so many manuals from such a long time, that there are many layers <br>
of historic sediments.  After some time, you should develop a sense which <br>
sources of information help in which situation.  The "Reference Manuals" <br>
section is updated more often, but that is not a tutorial.</p>
<blockquote>

it never connects because tty support was removed! So is Proof General <br>
still the recommended interface as the tutorial says?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NEWS file for each Isabelle release is the most up-to-date piece of <br>
information.  For Isabelle2015 it says:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Proof General and Isar TTY loop has been discontinued.<br>
Minor INCOMPATIBILITY, use standard PIDE infrastructure instead.<p>Makarius</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The way you use the name "jEdit" proves that you did not read the <br>
Isabelle/jEdit manual, which has the label "jedit" in the Isabelle <br>

<p>From: Quentin Hibon &lt;<a href="mailto:quentin.hibon@polytechnique.edu">quentin.hibon@polytechnique.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Regarding the SystemOnTPTP messsage, Jasmin Blanchette gave the solution<br>
to have remote_vampire working again, so I'll just reproduce his answer<br>
below:</p>
<p>[quote]<br>
It turns out SystemOnTPTP has moved to a new URL. If you want it to work<br>
again, you will need to change the file</p>
<p>src/HOL/Tools/ATP/scripts/remote_atp</p>
<p>replacing</p>
<p>"<a href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/cgi-bin/SystemOnTPTPFormReply”">http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/cgi-bin/SystemOnTPTPFormReply”</a>;</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>"<a href="http://pages.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/cgi-bin/SystemOnTPTPFormReply”">http://pages.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/cgi-bin/SystemOnTPTPFormReply”</a>;<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That does not tell you why your settings do not get applied, but at<br>
least you'll get rid of the error message.</p>

<p>From: Jason Dagit &lt;<a href="mailto:dagitj@gmail.com">dagitj@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
It's a Java issue. I tried with the latest JRE and standalone jEdit and<br>
it's still present. It's present in other Java programs as well. I doubt<br>
there is much the jEdit developers can do about it.</p>
<p>By the way, while it doesn't appear to be a problem with this particular<br>
download be careful about sourceforge installers. Some of the installers<br>
bundle additional programs that are not good (they walk the line between<br>
legitimate software and malware):<br>

This didn't help. It still crashes. Given this and the other problems I'm<br>
seeing, I've moved back to Isabelle2013-2 so that I can use emacs and proof<br>
general. I feel like I gave jEdit a try, but it's too frustrating to try<br>
simultaneously adapting to an unfamiliar language, unfamiliar/quirky<br>
editor, AND to deal with frequent crashes / keybinding issues.</p>
