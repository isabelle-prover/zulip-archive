I was trying the jEdit interface in Isabelle 2012 for the first time<br>
today. To me, the vision and its execution are superb.</p>
<p>But, I had one or two questions over very minor details:</p>

<p>I understand that the output panel synchronizes with the line<br>
   selected in the edit panel. But sometimes I seem to lose the goal<br>
   display when entering a new line.</p>
<p>For instance, if I type</p>
<p>lemma "A &amp; B"<br>
        apply _^H</p>
<p>where ^H is a backspace, the goal is updated to:</p>
<p>Unknown proof method: "_"</p>
<p>Is something on my computer misconfigured? Should the current goal<br>
 (i.e., the one associated with the previous line) normally always<br>
 be visible when editing a subsequent line?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had to manually add shortcuts for "--&gt;" and "/\", but I noticed<br>
   that "and" at least works for the latter. Is this expected<br>

This happens from time to time and has nothing to do with your computer. <br>
The asynchronous document model is just a delicate matter, I would guess.</p>

What exactly do you mean by "shortcuts". You can get most of the logical <br>
symbols by just typing their ASCII approximation. As soon as the <br>
approximation fits a symbol a popup will show up where you can choose <br>
(maybe between several different symbols). E.g.,<br>
After typing "--&gt;" I have a popup containing just ⟶, and after typing /\ <br>
I get ∧. For some symbols there are also convenient <br>
"word"-abbreviations, like "forall" for ∀ etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you mean by "and" works for the latter. The word "and" should <br>
not expand to the symbol "∧".</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The auto update follows the command span of the caret, which means the <br>
user needs to know what a command span is (former PG users still do, but <br>
it will soon be forgotten).</p>
<p>There are situations where the Output view does not follow as expected, it <br>
requires a separate "Update" by the button.  This is one of the many <br>
boundary cases of the editor event model and the continous updates of the <br>
prover document model disagree about the time/space continuum.  There used <br>
to be many NPEs from jEdit in the past, but a few anomalies are still left <br>
over.</p>
<p>Above you probably have yet another boundary case: if the command is the <br>
last one in the buffer, jEdit makes a special case for the text address in <br>
the buffer -- it strips of the last newline.  Thus your caret actually <br>
points to nowhere, and the display is conservative in not updating itself. <br>
In reality you usually have at least an 'end' command following.</p>
<p>In the next round if refinements, the relation of the Output panel(s) -- <br>
there can be multiple -- to the source needs to be made more explicit, and <br>
the connection to editor events made more robust. Recently on Google maps <br>
I've seen some nice ways to indicate the boundary of an area (municipality <br>
etc.) as the search result.  It should also be made easy to type in one <br>
spot while watching output from another spot.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
jEdit has its own terminlogy here:</p>
<p>* "Shortcut" means command sequence to invoke an "action"; there is also<br>
     a tiny command line that can be opened via C-RETURN to retrieve<br>
     recent actions according to their name, not the key sequence.</p>
<p>Isabelle/jEdit provides very few shortcuts by default -- in jEdit it<br>
     is uncommon to have plugins define a lot of key sequences.</p>
<p>* "Abbreviation" is a mapping from certain word or symbolic text<br>
     fragments to arbitrary text.  It is easy to add such abbreviations on<br>
     the fly, also in a mode-specific manner.  There are separate key<br>
     sequences (jEdit actions) to define and use abbreviations.</p>
<p>Isabelle/jEdit does not do anything by default here.  It is up to the<br>
     user to define jEdit abbreviations on demand.</p>
<p>* The Isabelle/jEdit completion popup works via the Sidekick plugin,<br>
     with special wiring to accomodate Isabelle symbols or keyword syntax.</p>
<p>See the Plugin options for Sidekick for a number of properties that<br>
     can be changed here.</p>
<p>The completion table is provided by Isabelle/Scala, also the<br>
     syntactic rules for word boundaries etc.  Both the table of outer<br>
     syntax keywords and the information of etc/symbols are taken as a<br>
     starting point.  For symbols you can complete the symbol name (e.g.<br>
     "forall"), actual symbol (e.g. "\&lt;forall&gt;") or optional symbol<br>
     abbreviation (e.g. "!").  There are some boundary cases when there is<br>
     an overlap with keywords, e.g. "and".</p>
<p>In principle you can define further symbol mappings and abbreviations in <br>
ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/symbols, but some care is required to avoid <br>
fundamental changes of the unicode rendering, otherwise copy-pasted <br>
material cannot be exchanged with other people via email etc.</p>

Let's say it does not expand.  I am unsure if it should or not.  The <br>
behaviour stems from the overlap of symbol name with outer keyword.</p>
<p>Anyway, completion should become more context sensitive at some point. <br>
Within a term, "and" does not have any special meaning.</p>
