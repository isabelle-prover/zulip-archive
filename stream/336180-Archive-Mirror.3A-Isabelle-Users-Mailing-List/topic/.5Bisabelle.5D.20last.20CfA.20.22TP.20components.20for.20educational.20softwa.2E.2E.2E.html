<p>THedu'13 Scope</p>
<hr>
<p>THedu is a forum to gather the research communities for computer<br>
Theorem Proving (TP), Automated Theorem Proving (ATP), Interactive<br>
Theorem Proving (ITP) as well as for Computer Algebra Systems (CAS)<br>
and Dynamic Geometry Systems (DGS).<br>
The goal of this union is to combine and focus systems of these areas<br>
and to enhance existing educational software as well as studying the<br>
design of the next generation of mechanised mathematics assistants.</p>
<p>Important Dates:</p>

<p>* Extended Abstracts:     06 May 2013<br>
      * Author Notification:    03 Jun 2013<br>
      * Final Version:          15 Jun 2013<br>
      * Workshop Day:           (still to be defined, 8-12 July)<br>
      * Postproceedings(EPTCS): 15 October 2013</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu13">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu13</a>)</p>
<p>Elements for next-generation assistants include:</p>
<p>* Declarative Languages for Problem Solution: education in applied<br>
   sciences and in engineering is mainly concerned with problems, which<br>
   are understood as operations on elementary objects to be transformed<br>
   to an object representing a problem solution. Preconditions and<br>
   postconditions of these operations can be used to describe the<br>
   possible steps in the problem space; thus, ATP-systems can be used<br>
   to check if an operation sequence given by the user does actually<br>
   present a problem solution. Such "Problem Solution Languages"<br>
   encompass declarative proof languages like Isabelle/Isar or Coq's<br>
   Mathematical Proof Language, but also more specialized forms such<br>
   as, for example, geometric problem solution languages that express a<br>
   proof argument in Euclidean Geometry or languages for graph theory.</p>
<p>* Consistent Mathematical Content Representation: libraries of<br>
   existing ITP-Systems, in particular those following the LCF-prover<br>
   paradigm, usually provide logically coherent and human readable<br>
   knowledge. In the leading provers, mathematical knowledge is covered<br>
   to an extent beyond most courses in applied sciences. However, the<br>
   potential of this mechanised knowledge for education is clearly not<br>
   yet recognised adequately: renewed pedagogy calls for enquiry-based<br>
   learning from concrete to abstract --- and the knowledge's logical<br>
   coherence supports such learning: for instance, the formula 2.Pi<br>
   depends on the definition of reals and of multiplication; close to<br>
   these definitions are the laws like commutativity etc. Clearly, the<br>
   complexity of the knowledge's traceable interrelations poses a<br>
   challenge to usability design.</p>
<p>* User-Guidance in Stepwise Problem Solving: Such guidance is<br>
   indispensable for independent learning, but costly to implement so<br>
   far, because so many special cases need to be coded by<br>
   hand. However, CTP technology makes automated generation of<br>
   user-guidance reachable: declarative languages as mentioned above,<br>
   novel programming languages combining computation and deduction,<br>
   methods for automated construction with ruler and compass from<br>
   specifications, etc --- all these methods 'know how to solve a<br>
   problem'; so, using the methods' knowledge to generate user-guidance<br>
   mechanically is an appealing challenge for ATP and ITP, and probably<br>
   for compiler construction!</p>
<p>In principle, mathematical software can be conceived as models of<br>
mathematics: The challenge addressed by this workshop is to provide<br>
appealing models for mathematics assistants which are interactive and<br>
which explain themselves such that interested students can<br>
independently learn by inquiry and experimentation.</p>
<p>Submission</p>
<hr>
<p>We welcome submission of extended abstracts (4 pages max) presenting<br>
original unpublished work which is not been submitted for publication<br>
elsewhere.</p>
<p>All accepted extended abstracts will be presented at the workshop, and<br>
the extended abstracts will be made available online. A publication<br>
post-proceedings (papers, 16 pages max) under EPTCS is under<br>
consideration.</p>
<p>Extended abstracts and demo proposals should be submitted via THedu'13<br>
easychair (<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu13">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu13</a>).</p>
<p>Extended abstracts should be no more than 4 pages in length and are to<br>
be submitted in PDF format. They must conform to the EPTCS style<br>
guidelines (<a href="http://http://style.eptcs.org/">http://http://style.eptcs.org/</a>).</p>
<p>At least one author of each accepted extended abstract/demo is<br>
expected to attend THedu'13 and presents her or his extended<br>
abstract/demo.</p>
