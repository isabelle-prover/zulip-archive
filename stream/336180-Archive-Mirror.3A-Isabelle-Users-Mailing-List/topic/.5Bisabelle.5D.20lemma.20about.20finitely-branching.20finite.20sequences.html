Hi,</p>
<p>I have a relation "↝" representing the reductions of a small-step operational semantics. By construction, every configuration can only reduce to finitely-many next configurations.</p>
<p>Given an initial configuration C, I would like to prove that if every execution starting from C gets stuck after a finite number of steps, then there are only finitely-many executions of C0.</p>
<p>I'm having quite a bit of difficulty getting my head round how to prove this. I can do it if I assume that the entire "↝" relation is well-founded, but that's too strong an assumption, since I need it to be possible for <em>some</em> executions to diverge, just not those that start from C.</p>
<p>I have a sense that my lemma, if it is indeed true, will have been proven before, perhaps in the context of graph theory, or computability theory.</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate any hints the Isabelle community might have for how I might prove this, or where/whether it has already been proven.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>
John</p>
<p>ps. In case more precision is appropriate...</p>
<p>I'm defining executions like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>definition executions :: "config ⇒ (nat ⇒ config option) set"<br>
where<br>
 "executions C ≡ {π.  π 0 = Some C ∧ (∀i. <br>
 case π i of None ⇒ π (i+1) = None | Some C ⇒ <br>
 if reduce C=[] then π (i+1) = None <br>
                else π (i+1) ∈ Some ` set (reduce C))}"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and my lemma is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma <br>
 assumes "∀π ∈ executions C. ∃i &gt; 0. finite_seq i π" <br>
 shows "finite (executions C)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I define finite_seq like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fun finite_seq where<br>
 "finite_seq 0 π = (∀i. π i = None)"<br>
| "finite_seq (Suc i) π = (π 0 ≠ None ∧ finite_seq i (λi. π (Suc i)))"</p>

At the moment, your induction predicate is "%C. finite (traces C)". You have to generalise <br>
it to arbitrary states reachable from C, i.e.,</p>

Do not use any of the basic proof rules for wf to establish the well-foundedness <br>
assumption. The resulting proof oblications are usually too complicated. Rather show that <br>
the relation "{(C2,C1). C ↝* C1 ∧ C1 ↝ C2}" is a subset of "measure f" for some measure <br>
function f on states (like the longest execution starting in the state as I suggested in <br>
my previous mail). Then, you get well-foundedness from the rules wf_subset and wf_measure.</p>

Hi John,</p>
<p>I had the same concern, but I think that you could avoid the circularity by defining the <br>
longest execution recursively. However, I meanwhile realised that you can show <br>
well-foundedness more easily with the lemma finite_acyclic_wf (without going over the <br>
longest execution). Acyclicity of the reachable graph should be easy to show because <br>
otherwise, you have a loop and you could construct an infinite execution by looping. For <br>
finiteness, you will need something like a Koenig's lemma to go from traces to states (If <br>
every node in a connected graph has finitely many successors and there are infinitely many <br>
nodes, then there is an infinite path). You can find an example of such a lemma (for an <br>
undirected graph) in my AFP entry Coinductive (theory Koenigslemma).</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Andreas</p>
