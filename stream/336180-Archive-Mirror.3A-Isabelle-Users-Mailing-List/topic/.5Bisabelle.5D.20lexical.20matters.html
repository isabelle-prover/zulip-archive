<p>Of course they do.  We also know that in our day-to-day use of our systems, the pretty-printer is not a cause of problems, so we can use the nice readability-enhancing features of these systems.

<p>Depends on the project, of course, and what level of certification. Currently not that many certifications with interactive formal proof exist, but some do (ACL2 has been used quite a bit).

<p>In Isabelle? HOL4 or HOL-light, sure, that's their main interaction mode, but Isabelle hasn't had the ML-as-user-interface paradigm for quite a few years.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that you'll never want to use any ML for bigger advanced projects, but these ML bits are a far way off from complex ML programs. Compared to the effort that should go into validating models and statements, checking small amounts of proof method ML code for pretty printing cheat attempts would be trivial (there's no reason to have any pretty printing code there at all). There's no reason evaluators should have to accept huge amounts of complex ML code.</p>

<p>Well, there is one, you just don't seem to like it: inspecting the term on the ML level. As Michael says, it's as least as good as Lisp s-expressions. </p>
<p>There's a difference between accidentally creating something misleading (reasonably hard to do if you use the normal interface) and a malicious user with motivation and criminal energy.

<p>I guess we're all mostly of the same opinion fundamentally anyway, just different views on where to put resources and emphasis.</p>

<p>And<br>
this is the problem that I am advocating needs a tool that properly supports<br>
the process - the process of determining that the model and final theorem<br>
are right (as well as that the final theorem has actually been proved).<br>
This process involves using the pretty printer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Checking that the proof shows what you think it does involves the pretty printer only at a very shallow level. It's not the case that we can't trust the Isabelle pretty printer to support development and that it will magically show us wrong terms. </p>
<p>I've often seen and written theorems that didn't mean what I thought they meant. It's so far never been the fault of the pretty printer. It can be, because you'd  be able to trick it with some effort, but getting rid of that possibility is about assurance, not about finding the right proof statement. It can have different solutions.</p>

<p>No, I mean variables that are overloaded with other variables.  The sort of<br>
thing that basic Hindley-Milner type inference cannot deal with (but this is<br>
for parsing so let's not get distracted by this).  Apart from HOL Zero, no<br>
other system is capable of printing (or parsing, as it happens) an<br>
expression with overloaded variables.</p>
<p>I suppose your low-tech s-exp printer would throw these out too.  It's<br>
starting to be less trivial than originally envisaged.  Isn't it just best<br>
to have a good trustworthy concrete-syntax printer?</p>

If a trusted prettyprinter is deemed to be important tool for the auditor,<br>
then<br>
the auditor can code one up, or look over your shoulder while you code it.<br>
It's a fairly simple task. Of course, for the paranoid, this just means<br>

projects involving formal proof, I think allowing the contractor to use the<br>

automation and bespoke semi-automation.  Now it's always possible to do a<br>
bit of bespoke pre-processing and still use a restricted, non-ML paradigm,<br>
but this will often have its own integrity risks and is in any case is<br>
fundamentally limited.  We need to give contractors the full power of ML to<br>
get the costs of full formal verification down.  But we shouldn't trust them<br>

<p>The complex Isabelle derived code, outside the relatively small core of code<br>
implementing crucial trusted components such as the inference kernel and the<br>
pretty printer, may be susceptible to constructing expressions that end up<br>
exploiting problems with Isabelle's pretty printer.  I have found that such<br>
things are easy to subtly create maliciously (but of course if the user<br>
cannot use ML, I think we can assume the developers won't do this).  But I<br>
have also found that in practice on large projects, subtle problems with<br>
tools, including theorem provers, just happen accidentally.</p>
<p>For example (forgive me if my lack of deep understanding of the Isabelle<br>
core means I am wrong here), but presumably it is quite feasible, in<br>
principle, that some complex bit of derived Isablle code occasionally<br>
constructs terms that involve overloaded variables.  This is certainly true<br>
in the "3 HOL" systems (i.e. the 4 HOL systems minus HOL Zero :).  So nasty<br>
terms that involve overloaded varaibles could "magically" get innocently<br>
constructed by well-meaning source code developed by well-meaning Isabelle<br>
developers.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the risk is that the wrong theorems are being proved or that things are<br>
being given the wrong definitions, and this is why we need proof auditing,<br>
and this is why we need good concrete-syntax pretty printers, to enable the<br>
auditor to effectively review things.  But I find I'm repeating myself<br>
here...</p>

Hi Mark,</p>
<p>This discussion is a bit strange. It seems this is mostly due to a <br>
conflation of at least three very different functionalities that you <br>
expect from a "theorem prover":</p>
<p>(a) Checking Proofs -- This requires a trusted inference kernel only, <br>
based on abstract syntax. No interesting parsing or pretty printing <br>
here. Challenges: Logical complexities, Performance, Keeping code simple <br>
and understandable.</p>
<p>(b) Developing Proofs -- This requires flexibility and automation, <br>
support for arbitrary user-level code, and a way to reduce everything to <br>
kernel-level inferences. Trusted pretty printing is not an issue here <br>
either. Instead I want as powerful tools as possible.</p>
<p>(c) Auditing Definitions and Theorem Statements -- This is mainly an <br>
interface problem of the auditor trying to understand what has been <br>
proved. Pretty printing plays a role here, but there are many other <br>
things. But note that proofs play no role here. This is just about <br>
definitions and theorem statements.</p>
<p>I hereby make the bold claim that any system trying to do any two of <br>
these things at the same time is bound to make some lousy compromises <br>
that aren't acceptable if you are really serious.</p>
<p>It happens that LCF-style provers traditionally try to do both (a) and <br>
(b), and they do make compromises. Bringing (c) into the picture and <br>
trying to add it into one of those systems would probably make the <br>
situation worse, not better. This is just an argument for a separate <br>
tool, which could be HOL0. I have the impression though that you are <br>
trying to address both (a) and (c) at the same time, which may lead to <br>
new lousy compromises.</p>
<p>The issues about someone maliciously attacking the kernel etc. are <br>
orthogonal and probably have standard solutions. Operating systems and <br>
security people can solve this as soon as it is important enough for <br>
someone to pay the price. But logicians are not the right people to do this.</p>

type that most Isabelle users would be interested in.  Why don't people<br>

</blockquote>
<p>I think it's helpful to the discussion to break it down into different<br>
activities like you have.  You are right to differentiate between checking<br>
proofs and developing proofs.  I have always viewed auditing definitions and<br>
theorem statements as part of the process of checking proofs, but I suppose<br>
you could split it off as a different activity.</p>
<p>But I would say that there is absolutely no conflict in practice in catering<br>
for (a) and (c) together in the same system, and furthermore that they<br>
naturally go hand-in-hand.  The inference kernel does (a), and is<br>
architecturally separate from the pretty printer which supports (c).  Both<br>
have trustworthiness as their top priority.</p>
<p>There is some conflict between (a)/(c) and (b).  So both (a) and (c) ideally<br>
involve using a system where trustworthiness is the top priority, together<br>
with sufficient efficiency to enable (a) and with certain aspects of<br>
usability to support doing (c) effectively (such as good pretty-printing of<br>
definitions and theorems, and good user feedback for certain basic<br>
operations).  To achieve the trustworthiness, the source code for the<br>
trusted parts is ideally written with the utmost simplicity and clarity.<br>
But for (b), its top priorities are general usability and efficiency, with<br>
trustworthiness having less importance.  There is a conflict between general<br>
usability and clarity of the inference kernel, because things like<br>
hierarchical theories, for example, can help usability but (at least<br>
traditionally) involve greatly complicating the inference kernel.  Also, to<br>
pursue efficiency for (b), the inference kernel is typically made<br>
significantly bigger and more complicated.</p>
<p>So yes, HOL Zero was written to support (a)/(c) and avoid the conflicts with<br>
(b).  But no, I don't see there being any significant compromises in the HOL<br>
Zero implementation.  Take a look for yourself and see!  And then compare it<br>
with HOL4, ProofPower HOL and Isabelle.  (I can point out the equivalent<br>
parts of each system if you are really interested in doing this.)</p>
<p>HOL Light is an interesting case.  It's simplicity (and the simplicity of<br>
it's embryonic forerunner - the GTT system implemented by Konrad and John)<br>
is the inspiration for HOL Zero.  I would suggest that HOL Light sits<br>
between (a) and (b) with some slightly uncomfortable compromises (its lack<br>
of theory hierarchy, for example, arguably makes it less usable), but that<br>
at the same time does a surprisingly good job.  The inference kernel has<br>
only 10 inference rules and is very simple, but it is not at all unusably<br>
slow.  And Flyspeck is showing that HOL Light is up to the task of being<br>
used on big projects.  But anyway, I saw HOL Light as still unsatisfactory,<br>
if only due to its pretty printer making it inappropriate for the (c) role,<br>
and reluctantly decided that a new system was required to fill the gap.</p>
<p>I think HOL4, ProofPower and Isabelle are aiming for (b) and get the balance<br>
about right.  Their use of an LCF-style architecture gives good assurance<br>
but without conflicting with (b) in my opinion.  I think the balance is a<br>
bit wrong as regards to their pretty printers (because the problems can be<br>
relatively easily addressed without compromising on (b), and furthermore<br>
this would actually help (b)), and this is what this thread has become<br>
about.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>They are not orthogonal in my opinion, because the LCF-style architecture<br>
itself delivers trustworthiness to protect against both the malicious and<br>
the accidental.  I think the orthogonality comes in when differentiating<br>
between trustworthiness within the scope of the ML program implementing the<br>
theorem prover and trustworthiness outside its scope (e.g. bugs in the ML<br>
interpreter, operating system interrupts, etc, etc).  But I agree that we<br>
should get the security experts in to help with the latter.</p>

<p>I've spent a long time thinking about it and independently came up with the<br>
tightest of Freek's "Pollack consistency" concepts.  I called it<br>
"parser/printer completeness".  But there's more to this than Freek's paper<br>
because he doesn't cover "printing soundness" - i.e. printing what the user<br>
expects (it's misleading to print an "and" when internally it's an "or").</p>

<p>From: <a href="mailto:mark@proof-technologies.com">mark@proof-technologies.com</a><br>
Thanks for your answers, Matthias/Makarius.</p>
<p>I have a follow-up question...  What about variables overloaded with other<br>
variables (i.e. same name but different type) or overloaded with constants<br>
(same name, any type) - can terms with any such overloading be parsed, and<br>
what happens when they are printed?</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
As far as the kernel is concerned, the identity of atoms (variables, <br>
consts) consists of both the name and type, although "overloading" means <br>
something different in Isabelle.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the syntax layer (the so-called "term check/uncheck" <br>
phase, which generalizes the idea of type-inference) variables are <br>
expected to be consistently typed: equal name imples equal type, and <br>
scopes for variables vs. constants are resolved consistently.</p>
<p>If you print a term that violates this, it might look "funny", or outright <br>
misleading.  This effect can already happen due to the customary omission <br>
of type information for variables.</p>
<p>Anyway, it also depends what is meant by "printed" exactly.  In Isabelle <br>
there is quite a bit of extra formal markup in the output, that is not <br>
shown in plain text.  In Proof General you already get the typical <br>
Isabelle color-code of blue/green/brown variables and black constants. <br>
In a Prover IDE like Isabelle/jEdit you could make even more out of that, <br>
e.g. tell the user the full truth about term atoms via tooltips or popups.</p>

"well you can't even trust theorem provers anyway".  There was that debate<br>
in the 1970s...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E.g. when you start moving towards serious Prover IDEs, what I've been<br>
involved for quite some time now, you will find many more issues than the<br>
rather trivial parse/print problem of the low-level term language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, adding layers can present more problems, and I'm sure you have more<br>
experience in this than me.  But surely we should be addressing these<br>
problems as they arise, instead of brushing many of them under the carpet?<br>
Shouldn't there be some sort of research effort concentrating on this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, I always try to keep as much immediate reliability as possible.<br>
But I also feel one should separate concerns here: if you need extreme<br>
trustworthiness, then you should export full theory and proof content to<br>
some tiny external checker.  The latter does not even need concrete syntax<br>
in the traditional sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the external checker needs to have a trustworthy printer<br>
(despite that this has not traditionally been expressed as a priority).  It<br>
needs to be able to print syntax in a highly readable way, so that a proof<br>
auditor can effectively review exactly what the checker has checked.  A<br>
large project involving formal proof might have hundreds of definitions that<br>
need reviewing, as well as the end-result theorems that use these<br>
definitions.  Wading through primitive syntax makes this an almost<br>
impossible task.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HOL0 could be one such checker, if it would be able to absorb huge<br>
theories and proofs (traces of inferences).  Then one could implement some<br>
"HOL0" button in Isabelle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well that's what I designed it for!  Being able to absorb huge theories is<br>
of course crucial.  But also is being able to trust the inference kernel and<br>
the pretty printer.  The HOL Zero button already exists in a prototype HOL<br>
Light variant I developed.  Not so easy for Isabelle HOL....</p>

Once you assume malicious users, you are turning theorem-proving software into security software. The time for this may come, but it will require a significant investment in security engineering. The first step would be to develop a realistic threat model. And this isn't really possible in the absence of actual attacks. It will be interesting to see if there are any over the coming years.</p>

<p>Like the printer problems I mention, I also see these ML trojan horse issues<br>
as important, easy-to-address and yet problems that have not yet been<br>
addressed.  The ML interpreter should support being able to block<br>
overwriting in some way or other.  E.g. supply the interpreter with a<br>
datatype or a function name that cannot be overwritten.  It isn't exactly<br>
rocket science, and it removes a risk.  I just don't understand why nothing<br>
has been done about this.</p>

<p>This is where the Isabelle/ML compiler invocation happens: <br>

<p>If the terms are really so large that printing them in "raw" form is likely to be a problem, then they will be just as incomprehensible in pretty form, and just as unreliable when checked by eye-balling.

anything can be hidden in this, unless very strict coding standards are<br>

the ML code more-or-less as a black box, and review the state of the theorem<br>

advocating a tool that makes life for the auditor easier.  A tool with a<br>
pretty printer that can be trusted.</p>

else print "FAILURE"</p>
<p>And voilà, the pretty-printing "issue" disappears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's assume we don't trust the parser.  How do we know that 'myterm' is<br>
correct?  We need to review definitions and terms, and this is best done<br>
using a trustworthy pretty printer.</p>
<p>I never thought that advocating a trustworthy pretty printer would be so<br>
controversial!!!</p>

It's just not an interesting problem.  We can solve it trivially by writing everything out in sexp-like notation.  ACL2 is demonstrably an acceptable format for security-critical validation, and this is all the pretty-printing they have.</p>
<p>Moreover, with proof terms (in Isabelle) and things like OpenTheory for the 3 HOLs, we can avoid having to look at clients' ML code.</p>
