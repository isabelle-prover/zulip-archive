<p>From: Walther Neuper &lt;<a href="mailto:wneuper@ist.tugraz.at">wneuper@ist.tugraz.at</a>&gt;<br>
Lars,</p>
<p>thanks for continuous support with libisabelle, the wrapper around <br>
Isabelle/PIDE for non-IDE applications [1].</p>
<p>Since a test example is successfully implemented [2], the next questions <br>
are about embedding libisabelle into our application. Embedding concerns <br>
2 sides, (1) our Java front-end and (2) our back-end in Isabelle.<br>
The latter seems to be covered by libisabelle's operation USE_THYS, <br>
which allows to determine the theories loaded in Isabelle.</p>
<p>With (1), however, we see a principal obstacle: Translation from Scala's <br>
XML.Tree into Java objects requires import of the objects' definitions <br>
(somewhere in libisabelle/examples).<br>
These imports need to be handled by libisabelle/sbt such that the <br>
objects are identified; but I am still unable to appropriately change <br>
the respective code in sbt ---<br>
--- can we get help here, or do we have to learn this from scratch?</p>
<p>Or do you see other possibilities (1a)?</p>
<p>Walther</p>
<p>(1a) Another possibility is to configure compilation in the Scala IDE, <br>
but here we are only partially successful, too.<br>
We still hope to finally use libisabelle-full.jar as a library for our <br>
front-end, where the library knows as little as possible about the <br>
front-end.</p>

<p>The "examples" module already depends on all that, so importing that<br>
should work, at least from Scala. From Java, the situation is more<br>
difficult because of the intricacies of how Scala nested classes/objects<br>
are being compiled to JVM class files.</p>

<p>That is indeed the goal. Ideally, the 'libisabelle' sources should<br>
remain unchanged and applications can just include that JAR file and add<br>

not include everything, or does Eclipse doesn't like it?</p>

<p>Right, that works all perfectly and is more or less transparent for us.</p>
<p>My question was more general:<br>
Translation Scala's XML.Tree &lt;---&gt; Isac's Java objects directly in a <br>
Scala file (near libisabelle/examples), which would require imports of <br>
the objects in the Scala file ---<br>
--- and these imports can only be resolved if sbt sets some additional <br>
paths.<br>
So we presently decompose Isac's Java objects, transfer the primitve <br>
datatypes, compose to XML.Tree (and the same back again); direct <br>
translation within one method for one direction would be more concise.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to extend sbt such that is can take such additional <br>
paths???</p>

libisabelle-full.jar does all what we want: if given to Eclipse, <br>
respective imports work and we have IDE feedback in coding.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>when the prover is loaded with a particular session (in your case, it's<br>
probably the session defined in 'libisabelle'), you can't change it<br>
later. You can only load further theories.</p>
<p>However, you can easily start up the prover with a combined session of<br>
all the things you need. You need to make sure that your modified<br>
'Protocol.thy' is included in your 'ROOT' file (either via a theory<br>
import or by listing it explicitly) and then use:</p>
<p>JSystem sys = JSystem.instance(new File("/path/to/isac"), "Isac");</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>
