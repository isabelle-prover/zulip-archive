<p>From: Mathias Fleury &lt;<a href="mailto:mathias.fleury12@gmail.com">mathias.fleury12@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello list,</p>
<p>I would like to prepare code exportation within a locale, in such a way that I only have to instantiate the locale to generate code later. However, my functions do not unconditionally terminate and I need an invariant (called inv in the following email) to prove termination and correctness. Therefore, I wanted to define a typedef within the locale. </p>
<p>But as there cannot be a typedef inside a locale, I axiomatised it (via the theorem that typedef generates) with the idea that I could instantiate it later, while still using the theorems and lift definitions:</p>
<p>locale type_definition_locale =<br>
  fixes Abs :: "'a ⇒ 'inv" and Rep :: "'inv ⇒ 'a" and inv :: "'a ⇒ bool"<br>
  assumes<br>
    Rep_inverse: "Abs (Rep x) = x" and<br>
    Rep: "Rep x ∈ {a. inv a}" and<br>
    Rep_inject: "Rep x = Rep y ⟷ x = y" and<br>
    Abs_inverse: "z ∈ {a. inv a} ⟹ Rep (Abs z) = z" and<br>
    Abs_induct: "(⋀y. y ∈ {a. inv a} ⟹ P (Abs y)) ⟹ P y" and<br>
    Rep_induct: "z ∈ {a. inv a} ⟹ (⋀z. P' (Rep z)) ⟹ P' z" and<br>
    Abs_cases: "(⋀y. x = Abs y ⟹ y ∈ {a. inv a} ⟹ Q) ⟹ Q" and<br>
    Rep_cases: "z ∈ {a. inv a} ⟹ (⋀y. z = Rep y ⟹ Q) ⟹ Q" and<br>
    Abs_inject: "z ∈ {a. inv a} ⟹ z' ∈ {a. inv a} ⟹ Abs z = Abs z' ⟷ z = z'"</p>
<p>Now my question is the following: is there a way to use lift_definition within the previous locale? For now, an error is produced:</p>
<p>context type_definition_locale<br>
begin</p>
<p>definition raw_K :: "'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ 'a" where<br>
"raw_K a _ = a"</p>
<p>lift_definition refined_K :: "'inv ⇒ 'inv ⇒ 'inv" is raw_K</p>
<p>(* Fails with:<br>
       Lifting failed for the following term:<br>
       Term:  raw_K<br>
       Type:  'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ 'a</p>
<p>Reason:<br>
         The type of the term cannot be instantiated to<br>
         "'inv ⇒ 'inv ⇒ ‘inv”.<br>
  *)<br>
end</p>
<p>I tried using setup_lifting, but this does not work either. The error message was not very precise ("The abstract type must be a type constructor.”), but I think that the error comes from:</p>
<p>fun is_Type (Type _) = true<br>
  | is_Type _ = false</p>
<p>Types passed as parameters in locales use the constructor TFree instead of Type.</p>
<p>Is there a way to avoid doing the lifting by hand? Would it be safe to extend the function is_Type to accept TFree?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br>
Mathias</p>

Dear Mathias,</p>
<p>The Lifting package manages the registered quotients in a map with the name of the type <br>
constructor as a key. So even if you could trick setup_lifting into accepting a theorem of <br>
the form</p>
<p>type_definition Rep Abs {x. inv x}</p>
<p>the lift_definition command would not be able to find the setup, because it constructs the <br>
lifting relation based on the type constructors that appear in the types of the raw term <br>
and the lifted constant. One would have to extend the implementation of <br>
Lifting_Term.prove_schematic_quot_thm accordingly to also support TFree.</p>
<p>Moreover, you'd have to make sure that the quotient theorem setup does not leak into any <br>
interpretation, in which the type variables get instantiated or generalised. Otherwise, <br>
the internal data structures of the Lifting package would be messed up.</p>
<p>Finally, I am not sure that your approach will actually work for code generation. The <br>
steps of lift_definition for a subtype copy are fairly limited except when it comes to <br>
code generation for compound return types. For example, if your function returns something <br>
like 'inv list (rather than a plain 'inv), then lift_definition internally generates a <br>
number of types and auxiliary constants and lifts the invariant to those types such that <br>
the code generator can handle them. I cannot see how this construction would work for an <br>
unspecified 'inv (otherwise, we could have done the construction once and for all for such <br>
an arbitrary 'inv and then just reused everything).</p>

Hi Mathias,</p>
<p>independently of lift_definition and code generation: a side remark on your locale.</p>
<p>A type definition locale already exists. It is called type_definition (the term type_definition is actually a locale predicate; the locale is used by typedef). It assumes only three facts (Rep, Rep_inverse, and Abs_inverse) and derives the rest. </p>
<p>There is no need to duplicate those things.</p>

Dear Andreas and Florian,</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not know whether your typedef specification satisfy the<br>
precondition that no dependencies on parameters or assumptions are<br>
introduced, but you may want to try this and see how far you can get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not in that case: I wanted to abstract the concrete representation of two watched literals scheme (allowing to instantiate the locale with arrays or red-black trees).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, I am not sure that your approach will actually work for code generation. The steps of lift_definition for a subtype copy are fairly limited except when it comes to code generation for compound return types. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am mostly interested in the steps of lift_definition for a subtype. I wanted to avoid writing the theorems by hand each time, but it does not matter so much. That seems also easier than changing the Lifting package.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,<br>
Mathias</p>
