Hello,</p>
<p>This doesn't work as one might hope:</p>
<p>theory t<br>
imports Main<br>
begin</p>
<p>locale X =<br>
  fixes a :: "'a"<br>
begin</p>
<p>(* This is fine *)<br>
types 'b Type = "'b set"</p>
<p>(* This should be fine too *)<br>
types 'a Type = "'a set"</p>
<p>*** Locally fixed type arguments "'a" in type declaration "Type"<br>
*** At command "types" ...</p>
<p>Can the implementation be tweaked to account for variable shadowing? I have too many type variables not to use them conventionally...</p>
<p>cheers<br>
peter</p>

What do you mean by "not to use them conventionally"?</p>
<p>When introducing locally fixed parameters (either for types or terms) the <br>
outcome needs to be unique, i.e. something that is fixed already in the <br>
context cannot be fixed again.  There are two different context policies <br>
to achieve this: (1) within a proof body parameters are implicitly <br>
renamed, (2) for toplevel specifications and statements non-unique names <br>
are rejected.</p>
<p>Renaming at the toplevel is ruled out for general simplicity and sanity <br>
reasons, otherwise we would reintroduce very strange effects that we had <br>
before the current infrstructure of specifications within a local context <br>
was introduced.</p>
<p>BTW, you can see the same effect as above here for term parameters:</p>
<p>locale foo = fixes x :: 'a<br>
   begin</p>
<p>lemma fixes x shows "x = x" ..</p>
<p>*** Duplicate fixed variable(s): "x"</p>
<p>One more note on the example above.  In order to avoid unnecessary <br>
confusion and unexpected problems, it is important to stick to established <br>
Isabelle naming conventions:</p>
<p>* Theory names: capitalized words, typically describing the main concept<br>
     in singular, e.g. "theory Foo_Bar_Concept"</p>
<p>* Almost everything else in lower case, especially locale and type<br>
     names.</p>
<p>* Exceptions: capitalized datatype constructors, also some term<br>
     constructions according to typical mathematical usage (e.g. capital<br>
     singleton letters A, B, C, or occasional Foo for "sets" etc.)</p>

<p>You can consider this limitation as an accidental feature of the current <br>
implementation.  Trying a bit harder in the internal structures, one could <br>
support type parameters on the RHS one day.  It is a very important <br>
principle to base a system on assumptions that are as weak as possible, to <br>
leave room for continued unfolding of the concepts behind it.  Exploiting <br>
the inability for type parameters on the RHS now would limit the future <br>
growth of the system.</p>

<p>I promise to mention something like that in the next tutorial on Isar that <br>
should come forward this year.</p>
<p>On the other hand we have a bit too many manuals that are often in an <br>
inconsistent state, while many things that I find myself explaining again <br>
and again are written in the "reference manuals" collection -- these 3 are <br>
in fact mostly up to date: isar-ref, implementation, system.</p>
<p>Maybe the next generation of user interfaces needs to tell users directly <br>
about thing that are better avoided, or point to relevant sections of the <br>
manuals via formal references in the text.</p>
