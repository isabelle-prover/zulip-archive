<p>My successor function works fine. If I instantiate a few states with the<br>
obvious indeces I get, for example...</p>

<p>My Coq colleagues in the room aren't suprised and tell me that my definition<br>

<p>They are wrong. Isabelle (in contrast to Coq) can often execute inductive<br>
definitions. Hence your expectation makes sense. However, there are several<br>
difficulties with the way you have phrased your definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to say</li>
</ol>
<p>code_pred start .</p>
<p>in order to generate code for star (or any inductive predicate).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>star is higher order. This complicates code generation to the point that it<br>
does not work for the situation where all arguments of "star r" are inputs. If<br>
you fix r in the defn of star, it works better. But let's assume we stick with<br>
your star.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What your defn of star will still allow us to do is to translate it into a<br>
Prolog-like enumeration of all y such that "star r x y" for some given r and x.<br>
This means not a single value but a set of values will be computed. The syntax is</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>values "{y. star succ state_0 y}"</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>This does still not quite work because "succ" is not defined in a manner that<br>
the second argument can be computed from the first. It needs to be an inductive<br>
definition</li>
</ol>
<p>inductive succ :: "State =&gt; State =&gt; bool"<br>
where "y = x(|index := Suc(index x)|) ==&gt; succ x y"</p>
<p>code_pred succ .</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Now the above values command does not terminate because there are infinitely<br>
many successor states. You can look at the first 3 states like this:</li>
</ol>
<p>values 3 "{y. star succ state_0 y}"</p>
<p>Happy?</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The way you have written star makes it unsuitable for computing predecessors<br>
from successors: values 3 "{x. star succ x state_2}" will not terminate because<br>
star will call itself recursively forever without getting to a call of succ.</li>
</ol>
<p>For an impressive example of what code generation for inductive predicates can<br>
do see  A. Lochbihler, L. Bulwahn : Animating the Formalised Semantics of a<br>
Java-like Language. ITP 2011<br>

<p>This is the result of the fact that "normal" definitions and inductive ones are<br>

Tobias, hi,</p>
<p>many thanks for your reply. I understand now that you don't need to execute<br>
definitions in order to prove things about them. So, for example, the proof<br>
that <code>star' is indeed transitive doesn't require </code>code_pred star', but<br>
computing with it does. I find it fascinating that you can compute with<br>
Isabelle in this way nonetheless.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, I do not want to create executable code, although I am<br>
giving the impression that I do. I am just adjusting to the use of a theorem<br>
prover after using a model checker. I should be proving things about the<br>
types that I think up, rather than instantiating them. Creating instances of<br>
<code>State' to confirm that </code>succ star' appears to be transitive is stupid when<br>
I already have a proof that `star' is transitive without needing to execute<br>
or indeed instantiate anything.</p>
<p>As an interesting aside, working with Isabelle in a room full of Coq users<br>
seems to be working out fine. Those around me get an introduction to basic<br>
Isabelle syntax amongst other things and I get valuable conversations about<br>
theorem proving and types in general.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>James</p>

Of course, if you have a proof, there is no need to run test cases to check the<br>
property. But with larger definitions, proofs become expensive enough that a bit<br>
of rapid prototyping to weed out the most glaring bugs can be quite beneficial.</p>

Exchange of Isabelle and Coq users can indeed be quite interesting to <br>
learn more about the specifc strengths and weaknesses of either system, <br>
although there is a substantial overlap.</p>
<p>BTW, when a Coq user says "type" he means "proposition" in a more common <br>
sense, which is also the way Isabelle uses term.  So</p>
<p>theorem a: A &lt;proof&gt;</p>
<p>is just a theorem called "a" with proposition "A", which is proven by the <br>
included proof.  A Coq user would call "a" constant and "A" type here.</p>
<p>Anyway, Isabelle also has some terminology that first needs some <br>
interpretation to be understandable to other people out there.</p>

<p>From: James Smith &lt;<a href="mailto:jecs@imperial.ac.uk">jecs@imperial.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
Tobias, hi,</p>
<p>back with Isabelle today...</p>
<p>Hmm, I've just looked at this again. I think I haven't explained myself well<br>
and so have been misunderstood. I have my definition of State:</p>
<hr>
<p>record State =<br>
    index :: nat<br>
    cookies :: "Cookie set"</p>
<hr>
<p>A cookie is just a string for the time being, and I instantiate one:</p>
<hr>
<p>type_synonym Cookie = string<br>
definition c :: Cookie where "counter=[CHR ''c'']"</p>
<hr>
<p>I also instantiate a few states:</p>
<hr>
<p>definition state_0 :: State where "state_0\&lt;equiv&gt;(|index=0,cookies={}|)"<br>
definition state_1 :: State where "state_1\&lt;equiv&gt;(|index=1,cookies={c}|)"<br>
definition state_2 :: State where "state_2\&lt;equiv&gt;(|index=2,cookies={c}|)"</p>
<hr>
<p>Now with the succ predicate defined about the following...</p>
<hr>
<p>value "succ state_0 state_1"</p>
<hr>
<p>...returns false and it took me a while to work out why. If I delete the<br>
cookie from state_1, or, alternatively, add a cookie to state_0, it works.<br>
This is because the inductive predicate, as you rightly point out,<br>
calculates the second argument from the first, taking x and changing its<br>
index to get y. Therefore y is only the successor to x if y agrees in all<br>
its other fields. But this isn't the required behaviour, y should be the<br>
successor if its index is one greater, that's all.</p>
<p>I understand inductive definitions a little better now so I have, for<br>
example:</p>
<hr>
<p>Inductive succ :: "nat =&gt; nat =&gt; bool" where<br>
"succ 1 0" |<br>
"succ n m ==&gt; succ (Suc n) (Suc m)</p>
<hr>
<p>But how can I get this with states? I have a signature...</p>
<hr>
<p>Inductive succ :: "nat =&gt; nat =&gt; bool" where<br>
...</p>
<hr>
<p>...but it's not obvious to me how I create a base step without instantiating<br>
states, which I don't want to do except for ``testing''. I mean with nat you<br>
already have an inductive set to work with, to do induction over, so<br>
defining succ n m is easy from there. But with my states I don't have a<br>
structure already in place so I can't do induction over it.</p>
<p>It seems to me I should just use "State list", in which case, if I take the<br>
time to understand the functionality available with lists, I won't need to<br>
define succ at all.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>James</p>

Hi James,</p>
<p>the relation you want is truly relational, you cannot compute one argument from<br>
the other. Prolog can deal with such relations with the help of logical<br>
variables and backtracking. Isabelle's execution mechanism does not support<br>
logical variables but only backtracking. Thus you would need to enumerate all<br>
the possible values of all the other fields, which is infeasible in general.</p>
<p>Tobias</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>exactly. My point was that my bad explanation in the first place probably<br>
led to a belief that computing states was what was required. </p>
<p>I realised this morning that I'd have to provide my own ``universe'' of all<br>
instances of states in order for such calculations to work. </p>
<p>With type nat you get all the natural numbers to work with. With my type<br>
State you get the type definition and nothing else.</p>
<p>Many thanks for all the help. I'll move on to lists now, thankfully!</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>James</p>
