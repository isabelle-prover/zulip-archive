<p>You probably mean this version <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/b28defd0b5a5">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/b28defd0b5a5</a> and not "the <br>
current" which is hardly defined for an ever growing set of approx. 50000 <br>
elements.  Its changelog reads "replaced quicksort by mergesort, which <br>
might be a bit more efficient for key operations like Ord_List.make, <br>
Sorts.minimize_sort;".  This was the most positive formulation I could <br>
find after spending too much time with the issue to gain almost nothing.</p>
<p>The code has become a bit longer, a tiny little bit better-defined in what <br>
it does, but we also had to unearth a much older sort function to <br>
accomodate the HO unification code with its special demands, see <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/a0d8abca8d7a">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/a0d8abca8d7a</a></p>
<p>When you proposed to use your verified version of mergesort (derived from <br>
the Haskell library) some month ago, I was not very excited for formal <br>
software-quality reasons. Things deep down there that have been used for a <br>
long time in certain ways follow their own requirements.  Formal <br>
specification and formal proofs are fine, but not yet good software <br>
engineering.  Too much "eating your own dogfood" is bad for health.</p>
<p>Since I am usually a bit too open to experimentation, when Stefan <br>
Berghofer came with some measurements about a hot-spot in the management <br>
of sorts in the inference kernel, we gave it a try nonetheless.  One <br>
result was no measureable performance improvement, see the log entry <br>
quoted above.  Another result was the discovery that the Unify module by <br>
Larry from 25 years ago does not really "sort" where it invokes a function <br>
called "sort", but something else.  The "quasi order" it gives here is not <br>
transitive, resulting in funny results with the proven mergesort.</p>

composition "trick" to avoid 'rev' in 'ascending'?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IIRC, the original version copied from Haskell was composing many <br>
functional closures according to the length of the list.  This might be <br>
efficient in Haskell (I have no substantial experience with it), but in <br>
the conventional evaluation model of ML it is not.  Plain rev is not very <br>
expensive, and there is no reason to avoid it as "premature optimization". <br>
David Matthews is quite smart to manage the heap for us, so you don't have <br>
to be afraid of some temporary allocations.</p>

Please tell the story. I'm particularly interested since in the near <br>
