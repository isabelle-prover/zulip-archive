Stefan,</p>
<p>thanks.  But I now find a similar problem: the theorems x.mono, x.unfold <br>
and x.defs<br>
seem to have disappeared.  Actually it seems the theorems x.mono, <br>
x.unfold already don't appear in Isabelle2005 for new-style theory <br>
files, but you could use an old-style theory file, or (sometimes) derive <br>
x.unfold from x.defs.</p>
<p>But in Isabelle2007 you can't use an old-style theory file and even <br>
x.defs doesn't seem to exist.  Where have all these theorems gone?</p>

Quoting Jeremy Dawson &lt;<a href="mailto:jeremy@rsise.anu.edu.au">jeremy@rsise.anu.edu.au</a>&gt;:</p>
<p>Dear Jeremy,</p>
<p>the problem with these rules is that they expose the internal representation<br>
of inductive sets or predicates, which violates the principle of information<br>
hiding. Since the internal representation has been changed recently, proofs<br>
using these rules would not have worked any longer anyway, so I decided to<br>
remove them. The 'official' way of proving something about an inductive<br>
definition is to use the introduction, induction and case analysis rules,<br>
and indeed all proofs using the x.unfold or x.defs rules can easily be<br>
rewritten to use these 'official' rules.</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
Stefan</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I don't understand what you say about "violates the principle of <br>
information<br>
hiding".  If anything provable using x.unfold or x.defs can be proved <br>
using the 'official' rules, then surely the 'official' rules contain (at <br>

<p>If I can prove x.unfold or x.defs using the 'official' rules, then whay <br>

<p>For about 3 years recently I worked on a particular project where they <br>

seems to me that during that time, about half my time on the project was <br>
spent doing useful work and about half was spent changing my work in <br>
response to changes in Isabelle. </p>
<p>Now I'm doing different work, with a mass of Isabelle theories which <br>
work for Isabelle2005.  If I don't adapt them to Isabelle 2007 (and I <br>
obviously have a strong incentive not to do so) it means that any <br>
further work I do is in Isabelle2005; this means that if someone else <br>
does similar things in Isabelle2007, neither of us can use each other's <br>
work.  This is not a good idea, but it is a natural consequence of the <br>
significant incompatibilities which have often been a consequence of <br>
recent developments in Isabelle.</p>

<p>Dear Jeremy,</p>
<p>on Wikipedia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding</a>), I found the<br>
following definition of "information hiding":</p>
<p>The principle of information hiding is the hiding of design decisions<br>
   in a computer program that are most likely to change, thus protecting<br>
   other parts of the program from change if the design decision is changed.<br>
   The protection involves providing a stable interface which shields the<br>
   remainder of the program from the implementation (the details that are<br>
   most likely to change).</p>
<p>In the context of the inductive definition package, the "design decision"<br>
is the way how inductive sets (or predicates) are defined, and the "other<br>
parts of the program" that should be protected from change are the proofs<br>
about inductively defined sets. Moreover, the "stable interface" that we<br>
provide is the introduction, induction and case analysis rules.<br>
This also means that proofs relying on an inductive set being defined<br>
(or "implemented") in a particular way (such as proofs involving x.defs)<br>
will no longer work once the definition has changed.</p>
<p>In the old inductive definition package, an inductive set was defined by<br>
forming the least fixpoint of a function on the complete lattice of sets<br>
of n-tuples, whereas the new inductive command defines inductive predicates<br>
as a least fixpoint of a function on the complete lattice of n-ary predicates,<br>
and the inductive_set command is just a wrapper for the inductive command.<br>
For example, the definition of rtrancl in Isabelle2005 is</p>
<p>r^* == lfp (%S. {x. (EX a. x = (a, a)) |<br>
                       (EX a b c. x = (a, c) &amp; (a, b) : S &amp; (b, c) : r)})</p>
<p>whereas in Isabelle2007, it is</p>
<p>r^** == lfp (%p x1 x2. (EX a. x1 = a &amp; x2 = a) |<br>
                          (EX a b c. x1 = a &amp; x2 = c &amp; p a b &amp; r b c))<br>
   r^* == {(xa, x). (%x xa. (x, xa) : r)^** xa x}</p>

<p>We really tried very hard to ensure backward compatibility when introducing<br>
the new inductive definition package. In particular, we put a lot of work<br>
in the implementation of the inductive_set wrapper that allows most of the<br>
proofs using inductive sets to be ported to Isabelle2007 with a minimal<br>
amount of changes. However, the x.defs and x.unfold rules are really a bit<br>
obscure in my opinion, which is why they were not mentioned in the tutorial<br>
either. It therefore made no sense to me to write additional code for proving<br>
these obscure rules from the "official" ones, in particular because the few<br>
proofs in the Isabelle distributions that were using these rules could easily<br>
be adapted.<br>
For example, the proof of exec_mono in HOL/Induct/Com.thy in Isabelle2005<br>
looked as follows:</p>
<p>lemma exec_mono: "A&lt;=B ==&gt; exec(A) &lt;= exec(B)"<br>
   apply (unfold exec.defs )<br>
   apply (rule lfp_mono)<br>
   apply (assumption | rule basic_monos)+<br>
   done</p>
<p>In contrast, the Isabelle2007 version is</p>
<p>lemma exec_mono: "A&lt;=B ==&gt; exec(A) &lt;= exec(B)"<br>
   apply (rule subsetI)<br>
   apply (simp add: split_paired_all)<br>
   apply (erule exec.induct)<br>
   apply blast+<br>
   done</p>

<p>I can understand your frustration, but with thousands of Isabelle theories<br>
out there, it is almost impossible to achieve that none of the changes we<br>
make affects any of these theories.<br>
A good way of ensuring that your theories will still work with newer versions<br>
of Isabelle is to submit them to the AFP. Once your theories are in the AFP,<br>
every developer who makes a change that breaks any of the theories in the AFP<br>
(or the Isabelle distribution) is responsible for fixing it, which is usually<br>
not too difficult, since the developer knows what kind of changes he has made.</p>
<p>Finally, let me assure you that I am happy to assist in porting any of your<br>
proofs about inductive definitions to Isabelle2007.</p>

Stefan</p>

<p>I think there is some misunderstanding here.  I don't care how the <br>
inductive set is defined, logically, internally.  The point is, if I'm <br>
not mistaken, that the above equality is still true in Isabelle2007.  <br>
That is, the truth of this equality does not depend on the "design <br>
decision" of the way how inductive sets (or predicates) are defined.  <br>
You would provide a "stable interface" by continuing to make it available. </p>

<p>It does not say so anywhere. And some contributions are not in Isar. <br>
Although we do have a preference for Isar and may ask for revisions of <br>
