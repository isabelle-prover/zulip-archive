jEdit is a plain text editor.  So you edit source text with it.</p>
<p>Isabelle/jEdit augments that a little bit to add formal markup from the <br>

prover is telling about the formal content of it.</p>

<p>Makarius,</p>
<p>See, it's not like I'm wanting to rebel on the words I'm going to choose <br>
to start referring to Isabelle, but my needs aren't the needs of 99.9% <br>
of the people who use Isabelle, and I am a member of the masses who will <br>
corrupt the language if given vocabulary that is too hard to use.</p>
<p>I can program some, but I'm not a programmer. There was a point at which <br>
I would have been a programer who wrote diagnostic software for embedded <br>
controllers, but that fell by the wayside.</p>
<p>The word "source" doesn't work in general.</p>
<p>1) In conversation, do I say, "The source on line 300 of Int.thy..."? <br>
(That's not too bad.)</p>
<p>2) When I'm editing a THY, am I "sourcing"?</p>
<p>3) If I get good at using the languages of Isabelle, am I a "Isabelle <br>
sourcer"? (Not to be confused with a sorcerer, one who works software <br>
magic.)</p>
<p>I can try other words, like "specification", "formalize", and "proof".</p>
<p>1) "The specification on line 300 of Int.thy...".</p>
<p>2) "I myself, when specifying in Isabelle...".</p>
<p>3) "Someday, I might have earned the right to be called an Isabelle <br>
specifier".</p>
<p>Will there come a day when I want to be called a "formalizer" or a <br>
"prover"? Only if you take the lead and start calling yourself a <br>
"formalizer" and a "prover" so that I have links to refer to when <br>
someone says, "Uh, you're a formalizer, you say?"</p>
<p>In Isar, with my awareness raised, and because vocabulary used in <br>
isar-ref.pdf, I can see that Isar is a "source language" in general, and <br>
parts of it are a "proof language", so I've figured out the vocabulary I <br>
need to use when referring to Isar.</p>
<p>However, it's not a simple thing to try and talk about the combination <br>
of Isabelle/Pure, Isabelle/Isar, and Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>1) In a THY, you're always in Isar the source language, but from one <br>
line to another, you may or may not be in Isar the proof language.</p>
<p>2) On a particular line, you are always in Isar the source language, but <br>
your syntax may or may not be Isabelle/HOL syntax.</p>
<p>3) An outer syntax keyword may be both an Isar keyword and  Isabelle/HOL <br>
keyword, or it may only be an Isar keyword. One may need to look in <br>
isar-ref.pdf for the characters "(HOL command)" to find out.</p>
<p>I suppose all this complexity is what gives Isabelle its power and <br>
flexibility, but I'm talking about the need for the masses to engage in <br>
polite conversation and not be saying things like, "You really should <br>
try Isabelle, Joe. I've become an Isabelle specifier myself."</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
This email is one too many, other than I'd rather do this now, since the <br>
thread has some momentum. Months from now, I don't want anyone to rehash <br>
what's been said because I've decided to take the liberty to use <br>
whatever vocabulary I want to use.</p>
<p>I'm settling on referring to Isabelle/HOL either as coding or as <br>
programming, when I have a need to casually talk about it.</p>
<p>There's textbook style vocabulary that's used and being used in lots of <br>
different places to label the languages of Isabelle, what Isabelle is, <br>
and what you do when you're working with it. But I don't even see that <br>
the developers are heavily using that type of language in day to day talk.</p>
<p>I'll take two words, "formalize" and "specification". To begin with, <br>
they use too many characters. If you use "formalize", then you need to <br>
use "formalization", which is even worse.</p>
<p>If I saw the Isabelle developers using these kind of words in the same <br>
way that people talk about "programs" and "programming", then I suppose <br>
I'd do it too, but am I suppose to look like a fool by heavily using <br>
these formal sounding words when no one else has incorporated them into <br>
their language similar to "program" and "programming"?</p>
<p>I'm willing to look the fool if there's a good reason, but I prefer to <br>
minimize that kind of thing. And there's the huge issue of something <br>
being practical. You can't expect me to have to use long, two word <br>
phrases to refer to Isabelle code, or to refer to what I'm doing with <br>
the Isabelle code.</p>
<p>This is not directed to anyone in particular, and my bi-monthly email <br>
quota is up. You can blame Christian for badly influencing me.</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
I don't think so Makarius. I'm still rebelling, and Larry has never <br>
officially backed out of saying that Isabelle/HOL is a programming language.</p>
<p>There is "program", "programming", and "programmer", and "code", <br>
"coding", and "coder", where right now I'm preferring "programming".</p>
<p>If someone asks, "What you do for a living?", do I say, "Well, I don't <br>
get paid for it, but I'm a writer who writes writings."</p>
<p>Wouldn't they be more likely to say or think, "Oh, so you write novels, <br>
or maybe you're a journalist?"</p>
<p>I am one over my bi-monthly quota of emails, but this is about the future.</p>
<p>Again, this is not directed at anyone in particular, but in the future, <br>
if I'm corrected for using "programming" in relation to Isabelle/HOL, I <br>
will reference the thread where Larry calls HOL a programming language, <br>
and I will reference this thread.</p>
<p>I will then say, "then please give me three words to replace 'program', <br>
'programming', and 'programmer'".</p>
<p>Me doing that will be much better than writing lengthy emails, as I have <br>
been doing.</p>
<p>My goal is to become a very competent Isabelle/HOL "programmer". It's <br>
the only "programming language" I use at this time. I do some scripting <br>
and text processing, but there's already established vocabulary for <br>
those, which would be "script" and "scripting", and "text" and "text <br>
processing".</p>
<p>As a rebel, I can't see that it's reasonable for me to have to <br>
frequently resort to long phrases like "I write formal source text".</p>

So when the use of a language or product is prolific, such as with LaTeX <br>
or Java, then using the name is enough to define what you do.</p>
<p>"What do you do?"</p>
<p>"I do Oracle."</p>
<p>If the use of Isabelle was prolific, then the use of "Isabelle/HOL" <br>
would set the context. But Isabelle/HOL is relatively unknown in the <br>
programming world, and it wouldn't solve my need for a word like <br>
"programmer". Or maybe it would.</p>
<p>"What do you do?"</p>
<p>"I write HOL source."</p>
<p>But it's not prolific. So to say, "I write HOL source", is to invite the <br>
question, "Oh, that sounds interesting. But what is that exactly?"</p>
<p>Instead of,</p>
<p>"What do you do?"</p>
<p>"I'm a programmer."</p>
<p>"Oh." (Their eyes shift around, looking for someone else to talk to. <br>
That's good. You didn't feel like talking about it either.)</p>

Dear Gottfried,</p>
<p>my 2 cents concerning naming (everyone: please correct and/or complete):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coq is a proof assistant (or interactive theorem prover)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isabelle is a generic proof assistant, where Isabelle/HOL is its <br>
instance for Higher-Order Logic. Thus I would call Isabelle/HOL a proof <br>
assistant (omitting the term "generic"; also "interactive" from <br>
"interactive theorem prover" is sometimes omitted, but I prefer not to <br>
do so).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main purpose of proof assistants, as their name suggests, is to <br>
assist the user to make proofs. That is, <em>proving</em> as opposed to <br>
<em>programming</em> is the main thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the recent literature developing a theory (or a proof for some <br>
statement) A in a proof assistant is called: mechanizing A, or <br>
formalizing A, or certifying A, ... but never programming A</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Christian,</p>
<p>There's no person on the face of the Earth more appropriate to continue <br>
this conversation with than with you. So now, having intentionally tried <br>
to make Larry suffer less, I now make you suffer.</p>
<p>There's a certain forum in which I deemphasized Isabelle as a <br>
"programming language", a point which you countered, a counterpoint <br>
which I partially countered.</p>
<p>As many times, what I reject, after having some time to think, I then, <br>
in some form, embrace. And so, my mental investigations, even now, is in <br>
trying to determine whether "programming language" can be legitimately <br>
applied to Isabelle/HOL, where I'm leaning towards saying "yes", though <br>
that doesn't mean I'll use the label anymore.</p>
<p>Having had my say with too many emails on this, I am now only interested <br>
in choosing vocabulary for Isabelle for pure, practical reasons.</p>
<p>Without explaining any of the thought process that's led to this, I seek <br>
one word, where the following describes some of the criteria:</p>
<p>1) What is one word which I can use to label the many languages that are <br>
used in what I see in jEdit?</p>
<p>2) This word needs to general enough to describe the main languages that <br>
I see: Pure, Isar, and Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>3) This word needs to be able to be used as a noun and a verb.</p>
<p>4) This word, as a noun, needs to describe what someone might want to <br>
call me.</p>
<p>5) This word, as a verb, needs to describe I am doing when I use <br>
Isabelle as a language.</p>
<p>6) This word needs to be acceptable by the experts as being technically <br>
correct.</p>
<p>7) This words needs to have meaning to programmers who know nothing <br>
about Isabelle as a language.</p>
<p>So the word "programming", because it's been used for years, and has <br>
accumulated many connotations, doesn't work.</p>
<p>Below, you give me vocabulary, and I am happy to follow the lead of the <br>
official documentation, the principal developers, and the rest of the <br>
professional developers, like you.</p>
<p>But, as I said, my pursuit of a word is for everyday, practical usage.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, the word is "code".</p>
<p>Isabelle has source code files with the extension "thy".</p>
<p>1) If they are source code files, then what I'm looking at in jEdit must <br>
be code.</p>
<p>2) If I'm editing code in a THY file, then it must be I'm coding.</p>
<p>3) If I ever get good enough at coding with the many languages of <br>
Isabelle, then it must be that I'll be a "coder".</p>
<p>4) "Code" has no connotational requirement that anything be executed.</p>
<p>5) It doesn't have to be a recipe, as with programs.</p>
<p>6) "Code" is merely information that is "encoded".</p>
<p>So, at this point, seeing that "code", though commonly used, hasn't been <br>
totally corrupted, maybe the proof assistant community can usurp the <br>
word for their purposes.</p>
<p>Why? If leading authorities don't give the masses a practical word to <br>
use for something, they'll choose their own word. Compare Latin to <br>
Vulgar Latin. Language usage is heavily determined by anarchy.</p>
<p>Hypothetical scenario: I have 350 characters to make a comment on a <br>
forum. Do I say, "When I myself am writing formal specifications with <br>
Isabelle..."</p>
<p>Yes, I do, if I'm trying to be the benevolent educator, taking advantage <br>
of what can be a teachable moment.</p>
<p>However, no, I don't, not if I'm at 400 characters. The phrase "writing <br>
formal specifications with Isabelle" becomes "coding in Isa".</p>
<p>I've just mentioned an upside to the word "code". It's four letters. I <br>
can't think of a three letter word at all to replace "code".</p>
<p>I'll check out of this thread on what is good or bad vocabulary.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>
