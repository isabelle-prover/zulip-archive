<p>Reasoning about Lists via List Interleaving<br>
<a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/List_Interleaving.shtml">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/List_Interleaving.shtml</a></p>
<p>Abstract:<br>
 Among the various mathematical tools introduced in his outstanding work on<br>
Communicating Sequential Processes, Hoare has defined "interleaves" as the<br>
predicate satisfied by any three lists such that the first list may be split<br>
into sublists alternately extracted from the other two ones, whatever is the<br>
criterion for extracting an item from either one list or the other in each step.<br>
 This paper enriches Hoare's definition by identifying such criterion with the<br>
truth value of a predicate taking as inputs the head and the tail of the first<br>
list. This enhanced "interleaves" predicate turns out to permit the proof of<br>
equalities between lists without the need of an induction. Some rules that allow<br>
to infer "interleaves" statements without induction, particularly applying to<br>
the addition or removal of a prefix to the input lists, are also proven.<br>
Finally, a stronger version of the predicate, named "Interleaves", is shown to<br>
fulfil further rules applying to the addition or removal of a suffix to the<br>
input lists.</p>
<p>The Ipurge Unwinding Theorem for CSP Noninterference Security<br>
<a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Noninterference_Ipurge_Unwinding.shtml">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Noninterference_Ipurge_Unwinding.shtml</a></p>
<p>Abstract:<br>
 The definition of noninterference security for Communicating Sequential<br>
Processes requires to consider any possible future, i.e. any indefinitely long<br>
sequence of subsequent events and any indefinitely large set of refused events<br>
associated to that sequence, for each process trace. In order to render the<br>
verification of the security of a process more straightforward, there is a need<br>
of some sufficient condition for security such that just individual accepted and<br>
refused events, rather than unbounded sequences and sets of events, have to be<br>
considered.<br>
 Of course, if such a sufficient condition were necessary as well, it would be<br>
even more valuable, since it would permit to prove not only that a process is<br>
secure by verifying that the condition holds, but also that a process is not<br>
secure by verifying that the condition fails to hold.<br>
 This paper provides a necessary and sufficient condition for CSP noninterference<br>
security, which indeed requires to just consider individual accepted and refused<br>
events and applies to the general case of a possibly intransitive policy. This<br>
condition follows Rushby's output consistency for deterministic state machines<br>
with outputs, and has to be satisfied by a specific function mapping security<br>
domains into equivalence relations over process traces. The definition of this<br>
function makes use of an intransitive purge function following Rushby's one;<br>
hence the name given to the condition, Ipurge Unwinding Theorem.<br>
 Furthermore, in accordance with Hoare's formal definition of deterministic<br>
processes, it is shown that a process is deterministic just in case it is a<br>
trace set process, i.e. it may be identified by means of a trace set alone,<br>
matching the set of its traces, in place of a failures-divergences pair. Then,<br>
variants of the Ipurge Unwinding Theorem are proven for deterministic processes<br>
and trace set processes.</p>
<p>The Generic Unwinding Theorem for CSP Noninterference Security<br>
<a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Noninterference_Generic_Unwinding.shtml">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Noninterference_Generic_Unwinding.shtml</a></p>
<p>Abstract:<br>
 The classical definition of noninterference security for a deterministic state<br>
machine with outputs requires to consider the outputs produced by machine<br>
actions after any trace, i.e. any indefinitely long sequence of actions, of the<br>
machine. In order to render the verification of the security of such a machine<br>
more straightforward, there is a need of some sufficient condition for security<br>
such that just individual actions, rather than unbounded sequences of actions,<br>
have to be considered.<br>
 By extending previous results applying to transitive noninterference policies,<br>
Rushby has proven an unwinding theorem that provides a sufficient condition of<br>
this kind in the general case of a possibly intransitive policy. This condition<br>
has to be satisfied by a generic function mapping security domains into<br>
equivalence relations over machine states.<br>
 An analogous problem arises for CSP noninterference security, whose definition<br>
requires to consider any possible future, i.e. any indefinitely long sequence of<br>
subsequent events and any indefinitely large set of refused events associated to<br>
that sequence, for each process trace.<br>
 This paper provides a sufficient condition for CSP noninterference security,<br>
which indeed requires to just consider individual accepted and refused events<br>
and applies to the general case of a possibly intransitive policy. This<br>
condition follows Rushby's one for classical noninterference security, and has<br>
to be satisfied by a generic function mapping security domains into equivalence<br>
relations over process traces; hence its name, Generic Unwinding Theorem.<br>
Variants of this theorem applying to deterministic processes and trace set<br>
processes are also proven. Finally, the sufficient condition for security<br>
expressed by the theorem is shown not to be a necessary condition as well, viz.<br>
there exists a secure process such that no domain-relation map satisfying the<br>
condition exists.</p>
