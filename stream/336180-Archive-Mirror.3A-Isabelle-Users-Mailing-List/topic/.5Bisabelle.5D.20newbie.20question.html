[possible duplicate, I jumped the gun on sending the first before I was <br>
properly subscribed].</p>
<p>I'm trying to prove a simple proof related to the "reverse" proof<br>
in the tutorial (I have the rest of the tutorial theory here<br>
as well including lemmas app_Nil2, app_assoc, rev_app and rev_rev):</p>
<p>--- snip ---<br>
          revH :: "'a list =&gt; 'a list =&gt; 'a list"</p>
<p>primrec<br>
   "revH [] ys = ys"<br>
   "revH (x # xs) ys = revH xs (x # ys)"<br>
...</p>
<p>lemma rev_revH: "revH xs ys = rev xs @ ys"<br>
   apply(induct_tac xs)<br>
   apply(auto)<br>
   done</p>
<p>lemma rev_rev2: "rev xs = revH xs []"<br>
   apply(induct_tac xs)<br>
   apply(auto)<br>
   done<br>
--- snip ---</p>
<p>when I evaluate the first lemma it is able to automatically reduce the problem <br>
to the goal:</p>
<p>forall a list.<br>
        revH list ys = rev list @ ys ==&gt;<br>
        revH list (a # ys) = rev list @ a # ys</p>
<p>To me this seems to imply that this is solved, but I guess Isabelle doesn't see <br>
it that way.  I tried to strengthen the proof by saying<br>
"!! ys ." but that didn't seem to have any effect.  What do I need to<br>
do here to complete this proof?</p>

In general it is much better to use the "induct" method insead of the <br>
induct_tac. In your case you need to generalize over ys, since in the <br>
recursive call ys is modified by revH.</p>
<p>The following works for me:</p>
<p>lemma rev_revH: "revH xs ys = rev xs @ ys"<br>
   by (induct xs arbitrary: ys, auto)</p>
<p>If you insist on induct_tac:</p>
<p>lemma rev_revH: "ALL ys. revH xs ys = rev xs @ ys"<br>
   apply (induct_tac xs)<br>
   apply simp_all<br>
   done</p>

<p>when I try this I get<br>
   *** Error in method "HOL.induct":<br>
   *** method "induct": bad arguments<br>
   ***   : ys<br>
   *** At command "by".<br>
using the FreeBSD packages isabelle-2005 and proofgeneral-xemacs-3.6.<br>
(I also tried without the colon and got a different error).</p>

<p>It's not so much that I insist as I was unaware that there is a separate <br>
"induct" :) This worked fine for me and was what I was going for with my <br>
"strengthened proof" I mentioned earlier.  I thought (incorrectly) that <br>
"!! ys ." would do what "ALL ys ." does.  Its still not clear to me<br>
what the difference is, and I guess I need to read up on this some more.</p>
