Hi,</p>
<p>I am new to Isabelle/HOL and Isar in general although I know the principles<br>
and am familiar with languages like Z. And with Haskell and ML.</p>
<p>I am trying to work out how to use the jEdit IDE, but would prefer to work<br>
from command line as well.</p>
<p>How do I generate Haskell and ML and friends from a proof like CoreC++ for<br>
example ?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Aaron</p>

Dear Aaron,</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>As far as I know, you cannot generate Haskell code from a "proof", but just from<br>
definitions and functions, and in certain cases also from inductive definitions<br>
by using the predicate compiler.</p>
<p>In principle, everything that can be written as an equality "lhs = rhs" can be fed<br>
to the code-generator.</p>
<p>lemma [code]: "lhs = rhs"<br>
proof ...</p>
<p>declare my_theorem[code]</p>
<p>then getting the code is as easy as writing</p>
<p>export_code some_function in Haskell file ...</p>
<p>however, it might fail whenever there are non-executable involved.</p>
<p>For example, defining</p>
<p>definition fermat where "fermat n = (?x y z. x &gt; 0 /\ y &gt; 0 /\ x^n + y^n = z^n)"</p>
<p>then </p>
<p>export_code fermat in Haskell file -</p>
<p>will fail, but if you first prove a code-equation</p>
<p>lemma fermat_code[code]: "fermat n = (n &lt;= 2)"<br>
proof ...</p>
<p>then of course it will become executable.</p>
<p>Further information on the code-generator can be found by</p>
<p>isabelle doc codegen</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
René</p>

<p>From: Andreas Lochbihler &lt;<a href="mailto:andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu">andreas.lochbihler@kit.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Aaron,</p>
<p>it is not clear to me what you mean by generating code from a proof like <br>
CoreC++. A proof of a theorem is not executable in ML or Haskell, only Isabelle <br>
can check the proof. However, you can generate ML and Haskell code from <br>
definitions in a formalisation, if they satisfy the restrictions of Isabelle's <br>
code generator. The generated code then executes the definitions, not the <br>
proofs. By the correctness of the code generator (unless someone messed with the <br>
setup), the output of the generated code then is correct in the sense that you <br>
could prove in Isabelle that the result is the denotation of the definitions for <br>
the given input.</p>
<p>For CoreC++ in particular, the big-step semantics and the type system are <br>
executable. This means that you can run CoreC++ programs in the semantics and <br>
that you can infer the type of a statement or expression. Only two weeks ago, I <br>
have spent a few days on reactivating the setup which got broken due to changes <br>
in Isabelle's code generator. So, if you want to execute CoreC++, you need to <br>
use the development version of the AFP. Most probably, this version will not <br>
work with Isabelle2012, so you also have to use the development version, e.g., <br>
from <a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/devel/">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/devel/</a>.</p>
<p>Now, back to your question. The export_code keyword generates such code. For <br>
CoreC++, you might put these five lines into a file in the same folder as <br>
CoreC++ and load it in jedit:</p>
<p>theory Code_Generation imports Execute begin<br>
export_code big_step WT WT_i_i_i_o<br>
   in SML module_name CoreCpp<br>
   file "path_to_my_file.ML"<br>
end</p>
<p>Once this file is processed, the code for the big step semantics, type checks <br>
and type inference is in the file, along with the abstract syntax definition for <br>
the CoreC++ language.</p>
<p>You can export to other language by replacing the "in SML ..." line as needed, <br>
see the code generator tutorial for that.</p>
<p>If you prefer the command line, there's also Isabelle codegen tool with hardly <br>
any documentation.</p>
<p>Once you have managed to get so far, you are now ready to execute CoreC++ <br>
programs. However, the type system and semantics expect the input to be in <br>
CoreC++ abstract syntax, so you cannot feed in C++ programs directly. Daniel <br>
Wasserrab once had a converter from C to CoreC++, but this has never been <br>
adapted to the changes in Isabelle's code generator. So it probably won't work <br>
out of the box. It should still work with the old generated ML files which <br>
Daniel probably has somewhere, so you might ask him.</p>
<p>If you just want to try one small program in CoreC++, the easiest way is to <br>
follow the examples in Execute.thy: Manually convert the program into CoreC++ <br>
syntax and define it inside Isabelle as a constant. Then, you can use the values <br>
command to execute it.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Andreas</p>

Dear Andreas,</p>
<p>Thank you for the information and a path forwards. I will try running Linux<br>
in a VM tomorrow. I have Linux servers but they are headless. And I have<br>
Windows/Cygwin/Java 1.7 problems using the development branch.</p>
<p>Then will look into using Java native on Windows with MinGW for Bash rather<br>
than via Cygwin. It would also be nice to have an environment that is not<br>
dependent upon Bash though.</p>
<p>Has/is Isabelle/HOL been/being migrated to Scala from ML ? If so do you<br>
know what the status is here ?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Aaron</p>

<p>Since "the" development branch is continously moving, you should subscribe <br>
to the isabelle-dev mailing list and post any observations and problems <br>
there.  We are aready moving towards the next stable release, and I have <br>
recently started to make it again easier to get it running on Windows.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know what were your problems with Java 7, <br>
because that will be very important for the coming Isabelle release. (Did <br>
you try to download add-components yourself?  You shouldn't.  See the <br>
explanations in README_REPOSITORY in the toplevel directory of the <br>
Mercurial clone.)</p>
<p>Follow-ups on isabelle-dev, where anything related to arbitrary Isabelle <br>
repository versions belongs.  You should also have changeset ids ready, <br>
when pointing to the version that you have.</p>

<p>Isabelle depends on much more than just bash, and I don't understand why <br>
it should be avoided.  Cygwin is also essential for many add-on tools and <br>
Poly/ML as well.  It is not realistic to change such system integration <br>
things as a "newbie" as you've called yourself.  Even for myself after so <br>
many years of Isabelle integration and distribution management it is <br>
always a struggle to get things forward and work more smoothly for more <br>
users.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Isabelle has many languages and many aspects.  ML remains the main <br>
implementation and extension language for the logical parts.  Scala is <br>
already the main system programming language, including front-end tools <br>
etc.  (Doing POSIX-oid things on Scala/JVM is quite odd to implement, but <br>
it works out in the end.)</p>
<p>There are also connections between the different Isabelle languages.  For <br>
example, you can use</p>
<p>ML {* val a = 1 *}</p>
<p>inside the Isar source language of .thy files routinely for many years.</p>
<p>Moreover you can invoke Isabelle/Scala from there like this:</p>
<p>ML {* Invoke_Scala.method "java.lang.System.getProperty" "user.home" *}</p>
<p>That gives you a String =&gt; String interface between the ML and Scala <br>
world, and you can then use Isabelle XML/YXML data encoding to transport <br>
actual content easily.</p>
<p>Note that Invoke_Scala.method currently only works while Isabelle/jEdit is <br>
running.  Wrapping the Isabelle/Scala process around any Isabelle session <br>
is still open, and won't happen for the coming release.</p>

Dear Aaron,</p>
<p>Sorry for the late response, I have been out of office for 3 weeks.</p>
<p>This looks like you are using the Isabelle2012 version of CoreC++ from <br>
<a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/CoreC++.shtml">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/CoreC++.shtml</a> and not the <br>
development version of the AFP from <br>
<a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/devel-entries/CoreC++.shtml">http://afp.sourceforge.net/devel-entries/CoreC++.shtml</a>. The above code <br>
works fine for me with the latter.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>
Andreas</p>
