How long do you reckon it would take a novice first year undergraduate (no <br>
significant programming or proving experience) to learn to use <br>
Isabelle/Isar well enough to complete induction or case proofs on the <br>
Fibonacci sequence? For example, homework questions like Prove that "fib(n </p>
<ul>
<li>k + 1) = fib(k + 1) * fib(n + 1) + fib(k) * fib(n)"</li>
</ul>
<p>I've found a few courses in Isabelle/HOL that seem to be aimed at the <br>
postgraduate/researcher level, in either 8 * 90 mins or 4*90 mins sessions, <br>
but I can't find much aimed at the first year level.</p>
<p>Sorry to ask a straw poll on the list, but there doesn't appear to be any <br>
literature on this, and I'd like to get a rough idea.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>
Will.</p>

Just last year, I was a fourth-year undergraduate performing a year-long<br>
capstone project for my BSc in mathematics at Stetson University in<br>
DeLand, FL, USA.  A large portion of this project was figuring out how<br>
to formalise a bit of ring theory in Isabelle/Isar.  If it is helpful,<br>
you may find the fruits of my labor at<br>
<a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rob/docs/papers/rings.pdf">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rob/docs/papers/rings.pdf</a> .</p>
<p>The project was independent with weekly meetings with an adviser.<br>
According to my memory, I started working through the Isabelle/HOL<br>
system and reference manuals around the beginning of October 2005, and <br>
didn't really feel comfortable with the system until February 2006.  By <br>
the end of November 2005, I had gathered enough ability to make a <br>
semester's-end presentation to my department and compose a paper <br>
summarising my progress.</p>
<p>If you are exploring the issues of a taught course for first-year<br>
undergraduates, I would suspect that they could do simple things within<br>
10 weeks.  It might take as long as 20 weeks for an average student to<br>
be proficient at the level you are suggesting.  The trouble is that I<br>
leaned on much of my undergraduate coursework (in both mathematics and<br>
computer science) in grasping the concepts from Isabelle, Higher-Order<br>
logic, and functional programming.  If a student comes to the course<br>
without that preparation, it is hard for me to guess the speed at which<br>
they could move through the material.  Another concern is that they have <br>
the ability to do this sort of mathematics by hand.  If you can't write <br>
a proof for Theorem X in (say) English, you won't be able to prove it in <br>
Isabelle.</p>
<p>If I may suggest, there is one important thing which should be impressed<br>
upon these students.  This is something I missed almost completely for<br>
the longest time, but which is being corrected now in my work as a PhD<br>
student.  When one is trying to develop proofs in Isabelle and other<br>
proof assistants, it is very desirable to model the proof structure upon<br>
an existing, natural-language proof.  For one reason or another, I got<br>
it into my head that it would be a good idea for my Isar proofs to have<br>
some semblance of originality.  Looking back, I see that this was only a<br>
hindrance to me, and potentially harmful to the exercise itself:<br>
Formalised mathematics is best when it has an obvious relationship with<br>
the original text.  The student of proof who can grasp this is likely to<br>
have a gentler experience.</p>
<p>I wish you well in the development of this course.  I would be <br>
interested in seeing the plan of instruction at which you arrive.</p>

Yes yes yes! A machine proof is much easier if you already understand  <br>
the intuition behind the traditional proof.  It is a myth that  <br>
machine assistance can replace the need for competence and  <br>
understanding. The machine magnifies competence, but it also  <br>
magnifies incompetence...</p>
