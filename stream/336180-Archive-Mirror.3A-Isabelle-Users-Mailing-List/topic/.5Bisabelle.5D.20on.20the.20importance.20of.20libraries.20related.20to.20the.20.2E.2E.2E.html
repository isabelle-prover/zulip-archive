Libraries related to the subject of the ABC conjecture will be<br>
indispensable for the development of contemporary mathematics, because of<br>
the complexity of the candidates for new proofs. Indeed, I read in a recent<br>
article:</p>
<p>Two mathematicians [Peter Scholze and Jakob Stix] have found what they say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is a hole at the heart of a proof that has convulsed the</p>
</blockquote>
<p>mathematics community for nearly six years [...] Shinichi Mochizuki</p>
<blockquote>
<p>maintains that his proof is not flawed despite the assertions of Jakob Stix<br>
and Peter Scholze that they’ve discovered a “serious, unfixable gap.”</p>
</blockquote>

Back in December 2017, Peter Scholze (for the first time, I believe) publicly <br>
pinpoints what he believes is a flaw in Mochizuki's proof. He concludes with <br>
this remark:</p>
<p>"One final point: I get very annoyed by all references to computer-verification <br>
(that came up not on this blog, but elsewhere on the internet in discussions of <br>
Mochizuki’s work). The computer will not be able to make sense of this step <br>
either. The comparison to the Kepler conjecture, say, is entirely misguided: In <br>
that case, the general strategy was clear, but it was unclear whether every <br>
single case had been taken care of. Here, there is no case at all, just the <br>
claim “And now the result follows”."</p>

Scholze's claim</p>
<p>"I get very annoyed by all references to computer-verification [...] The<br>
computer will not be able to make sense of this step either"</p>
<p>is not the conclusion of a long theoretical research about proof-assistants<br>
(this is not his field), but just a personal prejudice against<br>
computer-verified mathematics. Of course, the computer will not make sense<br>
of a mistake, making sense of a mistake is a subjective feeling. Indeed,<br>
Voevodsky said:</p>
<p>"Each time when I feel myself drifting away thinking about why it is so, I<br>
stop myself, why I not actually check what is actually true and what is<br>
not"</p>
<p>Reference to Voevodsky's quotation, min 18 in the lecture:<br>
<a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/vladimir/sites/math.ias.edu.vladimir/files/VTS_01_4.mp4">https://www.math.ias.edu/vladimir/sites/math.ias.edu.vladimir/files/VTS_01_4.mp4</a></p>
<p>What the computer will do is to show the first line where the mistake<br>
occurs and that is an objective fact. Without proof assistants, the<br>
ultimately reference for truth in mathematics is authority and I am skeptic<br>
of scientific authority  since I read the  following quotation from Lord<br>
Kelvin (who was  President of the Royal Society of England): Heavier than<br>
air flying machines are impossible. Reference to the quotation:<br>

Peter Scholze is simply very realistic wrt the pitiful state of today's proof <br>
assitants in the face of a proof like Mochizuki's. Anybody who thinks that we <br>
could have contributed one iota to spotting the mistake (or providing the proof, <br>
in case there is no mistake), lives in dreamland.</p>

Scholze’s claim gives rise to the following interesting question (I am open-minded for the three possible answers):<br>
Is the main obstacle of today proof assistants a technological problem of the software itself, a theoretical problem related to the type theory or a lack of libraries related to this subject?</p>
<p>In the case of Isabelle/HOL I guess that it is the third option, although I am not an expert in the subject and I may change my opinion after learning more about it.</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
I would like to counteract the negativity in this thread a little bit by<br>
interjecting that theorem provers in general and Isabelle in particular<br>
/have/ been used successfully for research mathematics, big and small.<br>
And problems in proofs (even published and peer-reviewed ones!) have<br>
been found in the process.</p>
<p>Of course, these were mostly cases where the proofs in question were<br>
fairly straightforward to formalise and did not require too much<br>
"non-basic" material. For instance, my BSc thesis in mathematics – which<br>
was a formalisation of a recent small result in social choice theory –<br>
is, of course, in no way comparable to the ABC conjecture, but it is<br>
research mathematics nonetheless, and so I do think the situation is not<br>
quite as hopeless as this thread may suggest.</p>
<p>With the ABC conjecture and things like that, I think the main problem<br>
is, as you also suspected, the lack of "libraries". Most modern<br>
mathematics (especially the really big results like the ABC conjecture<br>
or Fermat's Last Theorem) build on a huge tower of other mathematics. As<br>
a "pen-and-paper" mathematician, you can basically use any theory<br>
developed by another person as long as it's published and not obviously<br>
wrong. You don't have to fully understand their proof, you can just use<br>
the result.</p>
<p>When you want to do the same thing In a theorem prover, in all<br>
likelihood, you will have to formalise the entire thing yourself. And<br>
everything it depends on. And so on. That, I think, is the biggest<br>
problem about what makes formalising "real" modern mathematics so<br>
difficult. Another thing is that once you formalise something, you have<br>
to make lots of technical decisions about how to formulate it precisely<br>
and they can all come back at you and make your life difficult. In<br>
pen-and-paper mathematics, it is easier to argue such technical issues<br>
away informally and focus on the essence of the proof, trusting that the<br>
reader will still know what you mean.</p>
<p>Another problem (especially in the long run) is that, for the most part,<br>
there is only one mathematics, but there are many different theorem<br>
provers and you cannot easily exchange results between them.</p>
<p>In any case, something as massive as the ABC conjecture proof will<br>
present a formidable challenge to anyone who wants to even begin to<br>
understand it. I would guess that even writing things out on paper in<br>
Bourbakian rigour is probably almost impossible, and that is before any<br>
theorem-proving software even gets involved.</p>

<p>From: "Eugene W. Stark" &lt;<a href="mailto:isabelle-users@starkeffect.com">isabelle-users@starkeffect.com</a>&gt;<br>
Mathematics is the one area of human endeavor in which the concept of an<br>
absolute truth potentially has some meaning.  Whether or not a mathematical<br>
result is accepted as true ought not to be dependent on a clash of egos,<br>
personalities, and reputations.  It should be the responsibility of the<br>
proposer of a theorem to address all reasonable challenges to its veracity,<br>
not to simply argue by blatant assertion that it is fact and that those who<br>
say otherwise have simply not managed to think deeply enough about it to see<br>
the light.  Formally checkable proofs and proof assistants hold the promise<br>
of finally expurgating the social dynamic from mathematical truth; thereby<br>
clearly illuminating the distinction between mathematics and the "subjective"<br>
sciences.</p>

<p>I guess it's not quite that easy. It's not just the proofs, one also has<br>
to state these theorems formally (and be extremely certain about getting<br>
that right when a 'sorry' is involved), and one needs to define all the<br>
required constants and concepts. That alone can be an immense amount of<br>
work.</p>
<p>And even then, the ‘new’ material with this particular proof is so<br>
immense that it is probably almost infeasible. Even if one were to find<br>
a problem with the proof, it would then be quite unclear whether it is<br>
an issue of the original proof or one of the formalisation, i.e. if the<br>
person formalising it just misunderstood something.</p>
<p>In any case I think w.r.t. the ABC conjecture, Scholze is certainly<br>
correct in saying that computer verification is the wrong thing to look<br>
at at the moment. I interpret what he said as saying that no one could<br>
possibly formalise a proof that they don't understand even informally,<br>
and that seems to be the case with the ABC conjecture at the moment.<br>
Mathematicians looked at it and found a step that they don't understand,<br>
and until that is resolved and every step of the proof is<br>
well-understood, computer verification makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>Of course, even when all of that is resolved, it still seems that a<br>
verification is completely feasible simply because there is so much<br>
material.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess that, following the “sorry” approach, this controversy could be ended in one year, rather than the 6 years and even today we do not know the answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I doubt that. I highly doubt that, even with this approach, a<br>
formalisation of any proof of that size is feasible within a year.<br>
Perhaps you think one should tackle this particularly controversial<br>
aspect alone and ‘sorry’ everything before it?</p>
<p>Well, as I said above, if a problem /is/ found, the controversy will<br>
then be whether it's a genuine problem or whether it can be fixed<br>
somehow. Or if perhaps there is some mistake in the formalisation to<br>
begin with. And if no problem is found, one will have to worry about<br>
whether the statement that was proven is really what is required: Are<br>
all the involved definitions correct? Are the assumptions perhaps<br>
vacuous due to some mistake in how they were written down? And even<br>
then, one still relies on a huge tower of sorries in front of it.</p>

<p>From: "Dr A. Koutsoukou-Argyraki" &lt;<a href="mailto:ak2110@cam.ac.uk">ak2110@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
just adding two points supporting what Manuel just wrote:</p>
<p>1) In praxis, it is very easy to end up proving something wrong with a <br>
proof assistant by assuming a false statement. One can convince <br>
themselves of this by making up any trivial example. Now imagine how <br>
dangerous this becomes in a much more sophisticated setting where<br>
a very subtle mistake can go unnoticed and lead one to assume a false <br>
statement.<br>
That is to say, a proof assistant is not completely immune to errors by <br>
"human" mathematicians and one should be extremely responsible and <br>
careful with assumptions -even more so in the "sorrys" approach that <br>
José suggests. Regarding the ABC conjecture, the level of difficulty is <br>
such that the risk increases a lot.</p>
<p>2) When a step in a proof is unclear from the point of view of informal <br>
mathematics, as is the case for the suggested proof of the ABC <br>
conjecture, a proof assistant will not always<br>
give a definitive answer, i.e. :  If it happens that a counterexample  <br>
is found,<br>
the step (and thus the proof) is of course wrong. If no counterexample <br>
is found, nor a proof is given by automation, the step may or may not be <br>
wrong.<br>
And we cannot expect that a formal proof can necessarily be discovered <br>
where an informal one is missing.</p>
