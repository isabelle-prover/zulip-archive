<p>I've already commented on an earlier version of this material, and you seem <br>
to have improved it further. It generally looks good -- above the average of <br>
various ML experiments that are already in AFP.</p>

<p>Your comments have been very helpful! The main thing I wanted to finish<br>
before submitting it to the "lawnmower phase" was to finish the move to<br>
use morphisms in all relevant places (which is only half-finished, if I<br>
recall correctly).</p>
<p>Hopefully I will just sit down on a rainy weekend one day and do that,<br>
once that is done you'll hear back from me :)</p>

<p>That's what I've heard from the colleagues in Karlsruhe as well, so this<br>
was not a concern.</p>

<p>At least in Karlsruhe there seemed to be some use-cases for it, although<br>
some additional hand-holding (i.e. automation) in my code would make it<br>
considerably more user-friendly. That was labelled "future work" though,<br>
maybe for when another bachelor/master student is looking for thesis<br>
material -- or when I become very bored for a longer period of time.</p>
