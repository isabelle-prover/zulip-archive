Subject: p-adic numbers and model theory in Isabelle<br>
To: &lt;<a href="mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am working on a project this summer to formalize some basic results of<br>
p-adic model theory in Isabelle, and have some questions about the best way<br>
to go about some aspects of it.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, it is not possible to define each p-adic field as a<br>
type in Isabelle, because of the dependence on the prime parameter p.<br>
Instead we have opted to construct the p-adic integers using records, as an<br>
inverse limit of finite rings in the HOL algebra library, and the p-adic<br>
field as the fraction field of the p-adic integers.</p>
<p>Our eventual goal is to prove that the first-order theory of the p-adics in<br>
a certain first order language admits quantifier elimination, but before<br>
doing this we need to decide on a formalism for talking about first-order<br>
languages and interpretations. I understand that one approach is to define<br>
a first-order language recursively as a datatype as is done for Presburger<br>
arithmetic here:</p>
<p><a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/lpar05.pdf">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/lpar05.pdf</a></p>
<p>As of now, I'm not sure whether this approach, or defining a record and<br>
locale for general first-order languages and semantics in the style of the<br>
HOL algebra library would be the best approach. My intuition is that the<br>
latter approach would make it easier to develop general facts about<br>
first-order model theory, of which the p-adic example would be a special<br>
case, but perhaps this would also be possible when constructing languages<br>
at the type level as well?</p>
<p>I apologize if my questions aren't completely clear, and I'm happy to<br>
provide more information if that would make it easier to understand my<br>
question.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Aaron Crighton</p>

Dear Aaron,<br>
   You could also define the p-adic numbers as the completion of the rational numbers with respect to the topology of a non-Archimedean absolute value (Ostrowski's theorem).  The p-adic integers are just the ball of radius 1. This definition is independent of p. Indeed, for your project in model theory the number p is just a distraction: the non-Archimedean property of the norm is the essential feature. In this way, the analogy with real numbers is stronger.</p>
<p>In my own research I am formalizing a functional analysis over the complex numbers, but it would be nice to generalize my results to a algebraic structures over an arbitrary topological field, in order to include the p-adic numbers, e.g., Hilbert snd Banach spaces over the p-adic numbers.</p>
<p>It would be nice to develop a software in order to automatically generalize proofs in Isabelle in cases where the generalization is trivial: the user should only take care when the generalization is non-trivial.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
José M.<br>

That seems like a reasonable thing to do, although you may want to<br>
consider formalising a generalisation of this instead (e.g. formalising<br>
limits in general and maybe going to the more general setting of a<br>
Discrete Valuation Ring).</p>
<p>By the way, Jeremy Sylvestre is also currently working on a<br>
formalisation of p-adics. If I recall correctly, his idea was not to use<br>
HOL-Algebra but to do it with types. He also wanted to construct the<br>
ring of adeles directly using Laurent series and then carve out p-adics<br>
as needed. I didn't quite understand why he wants to do it that way, but<br>
I don't know much about p-adic numbers.</p>
<p>In any case, if one were not to use HOL-Algebra, it should be fairly<br>
straightforward to construct the type of p-adic numbers in Isabelle<br>
using a similar trick that John Harrison uses to encode n-dimensional<br>
vectors (real ^ 'n) or that René Thiemann et al. used to encode finite<br>
fields of prime characteristic p. One could define e.g. a type 'p adic,<br>
where 'p is a finite type with "p" elements. The main issue with that is<br>
that /using/ this type becomes somewhat painful when the type parameter<br>
p is not fixed but depends on some term. It can be done using Isabelle's<br>
Types-to-Sets mechanism, and Thiemann et al. have done it.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear to me which way is better. I think I have a<br>
slight preference for following the standard mathematical approach,<br>
which is what you are planning to do – but, as I said, some things might<br>
be fairly easy to generalise, in which case I think they should be<br>
generalised.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

Dear Aaron,</p>
<p>as Manuel already indicated, we (Jose, Sebastiaan, Akihisa and myself) did some <br>
formalization with algorithms in GF(p), both via types and via records. <br>
If you’re interested, just write me an email and I can give you access to an <br>
upcoming journal paper where several details on the various formalizations of GF(p) <br>
are described in detail.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
René</p>
