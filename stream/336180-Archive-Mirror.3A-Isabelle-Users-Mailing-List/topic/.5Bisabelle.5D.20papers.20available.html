Dear all,</p>
<p>it is a pleasure to present two papers for the research field "Test&amp;Proof", <br>
aiming at novel combinations of (Isabelle)-proofs and test-generation techniques.</p>
<p>A) Authors: A. Brucker, L. Brügger, P. Kearney and Burkhart Wolff:<br>
  Title: Verified Firewall Policy Transformations for Test Case Generation<br>
    Abstract: <br>
      We present an optimization technique for model-based generation of test cases <br>
   for firewalls. Based on a formal model for firewall policies in higher-order logic, <br>
   we derive a collection of semantics-preserving policy transformation rules and an <br>
   algorithm that optimizes the specification with respect of the number of test <br>
   cases required for path coverage.  The correctness of the rules and the algorithm <br>
   is established by formal proofs in Isabelle/HOL. Finally, we use the normalized <br>
   policies to  generate test cases with the domain-specific firewall testing tool <br>
   Isabelle/TestGen/FW.<br>
    The resulting procedure is characterized by a gain in efficiency<br>
    of two orders of magnitude and can handle configurations with<br>
    hundreds of rules as occur in practice.<br>
   Appeared in ICST 2010, URL: .pdf</p>
<p>B) Authors: A. Brucker, L. Brügger, P. Kearney, and B. Wolff. <br>
      Title: An approach to modular and testable security models of real-world health-care applications.<br>
      Abstract: We present a generic modular policy modelling framework and instantiate it with a <br>
       substantial case study for model- based testing of some key security mechanisms of applica- tions and services <br>
       of the NPfIT. NPfIT, the National Pro- gramme for IT, is a very large-scale development project aiming to modernise <br>
       the IT infrastructure of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Consisting of heteroge- neous and distributed <br>
       applications, it is an ideal target for model-based testing techniques of a large system exhibiting critical security features.<br>
       We model the four information governance principles, com- prising a role-based access control model, as well as policy <br>
       rules governing the concepts of patient consent, sealed en- velopes and legitimate relationships. The model is given in <br>
       Higher-order Logic (HOL) and processed together with suit- able test specifications in the hol-TestGen system, that <br>
       generates test sequences according to them. Particular em- phasis is put on the modular description of security policies <br>
       and their generic combination and its consequences for model-based testing.</p>
