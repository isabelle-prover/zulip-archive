Hi Chris,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, my current idea is to have something, where I could do the <br>
following:</p>
<p>monad option: "option" begin<br>
  definition "return x == Some x"<br>
  definition "bind m f == case m of Some x =&gt; f x | e =&gt; e"<br>
  (* maybe 'fail' for pattern-match errors? *)<br>
  definition "fail = None"</p>
<p>monad_laws by (...)<br>
end</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>which then provides the usual &gt;&gt;= and &gt;&gt; combinators as well as <br>
do-notation for the option type and the sum type (I'm not yet sure if it <br>
is a good idea / necessary to proof the monad laws for every instance).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What would the tool do with the proofs of the monad laws?<br>
If they are just thrown away or stored under some name, then there is <br>
little value to it. One could also imagine the tool defining derived <br>
operations like mapM and prove laws about them, but this may be going <br>
too far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This looks very much like type classes. Hence an obvious question would <br>
be: will there ever be higher-kinded type classes in Isabelle? Is this <br>
even possible? Of course, it would be futile to make a special "monad" <br>
version if there is a more general solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Constructor classes is not something that one can easily mount on top of <br>
an existing logic, so I am quite sure that this can only happen if one <br>
finds a way of moving all this into user-space... But this is a <br>
different story.</p>
<p>I think the main advantage of a "monad package" as you describe it is<br>
that it streamlines the syntax translations. Making a few extra <br>
definitions and proving some laws is something that a user easily does <br>
himself, but the translations are always painful and hard to get right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another question: would this be useful/used for/by users/you? :D</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it is simple and does it's job well, I am sure that there are as many <br>
uses for it as there are monads out there.</p>
<p>One further point: The begin-end syntax you have in mind is something <br>
that can only be implemented by a "target". Targets are the most complex <br>
part of the local theory infrastructure, and you probably don't want to <br>
implement one "at home" unless you have a very very good reason.</p>
<p>A simpler interface would do just as well, such as</p>
<p>monad option<br>
   where return = "Some"<br>
   and bind = "option_bind"</p>
<p>Maybe one should not make new constant definitions here but simply <br>
assume that they are already constants with the appropriate definition <br>
(So one can use inductive/primrec/function to define them). Then the <br>
monad command would basically be equivalent to the translation <br>
functions, except that it would work out of the box.</p>

Hi all,</p>
<p>@makarius:<br>
1) Sorry for mixing up notions. I do fully agree that it is very <br>
important to be concise in order to avoid misunderstandings :)</p>
<p>2) Syntax.add_term_check sounds interesting and I will give it a try.</p>
<p>@alex:<br>
1) My interest in the do-notation was actually caused by <br>
HOL/Library/State_Monad.thy when browsing Isabelle's library. I will <br>
also have a look at the heap monad.</p>
<p>2) I would very much like to unify all this :D, however, I'm not sure if <br>
I can manage. Nevertheless, I'll give it a try and consider it as a <br>
training session in Isabelle ML programming.</p>
<p>In general, my current idea is to have something, where I could do the <br>
following:</p>
<p>monad option: "option" begin<br>
   definition "return x == Some x"<br>
   definition "bind m f == case m of Some x =&gt; f x | e =&gt; e"<br>
   (* maybe 'fail' for pattern-match errors? *)<br>
   definition "fail = None"</p>
<p>monad_laws by (...)<br>
end</p>
<p>monad error: "+" begin<br>
   definition "return x == Inr x"<br>
   definition "bind m f == case m of Inl x =&gt; f x | e =&gt; e"<br>
   (* maybe 'fail' for pattern-match errors? *)<br>
   definition "fail = Inl undefined"</p>
<p>monad_laws by (...)<br>
end</p>
<p>which then provides the usual &gt;&gt;= and &gt;&gt; combinators as well as <br>
do-notation for the option type and the sum type (I'm not yet sure if it <br>
is a good idea / necessary to proof the monad laws for every instance).</p>
