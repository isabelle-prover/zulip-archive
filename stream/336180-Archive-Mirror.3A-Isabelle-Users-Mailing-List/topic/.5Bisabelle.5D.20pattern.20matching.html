<p>From: Chris Capel &lt;<a href="mailto:pdf23ds@gmail.com">pdf23ds@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
I'm trying to define an inductive set of type "token list set", where<br>
"token" is just some datatype. Initially I had definitions along the<br>
lines of this:</p>
<p>datatype token = C1 nat | C2 nat</p>
<p>inductive_set P where<br>
base: "[C1 1, C2 2] : P" |<br>
other: "ws @ [C1 x, C2 y] @ zs : P ==&gt; ws @ [C1 x, C1 m, C2 n, C2 y] @ zs : P"</p>
<p>This is a clear, correct way of defining it. However, it's not at<br>
<em>all</em> easy to work with when proving membership, whether forwards or<br>
backwards, because of the need to break of the list one is unifying<br>
with before applying the rule. So I tried changing it to this:</p>
<p>inductive_set P where<br>
base: "[C1 1, C2 2] : P" |<br>
other: "[| base : P; take 2 (drop n base) = [C1 x, C2 y] |] ==&gt;<br>
insert_list [C1 m, C2 n] base (n + 1) : P"</p>
<p>("insert_list x y n" puts x into y at n.) This definition, besides<br>
being less clear, doesn't actually work, as "= [x, y]" doesn't perform<br>
pattern matching. Instead, the equality asserts that (take a b) = [x,<br>
y] for any x and y, which is obviously not true.</p>
<p>Is there a better way to do this? Is there maybe a way to get the<br>
second example to work?</p>

Your second definition looks correct to me. But it is probably not much<br>
easier to use than the first. I would stick to the first definition and<br>
write structured proofs where you rearrange the list into the required<br>
form (one simp step will do that) before apply the rule.</p>

<p>I <em>believe</em> so, but I'm not sure. I didn't mean to imply otherwise. My<br>
point was that unification doesn't instantiate them.</p>

<p>Oops. My actual theory does not do this. :)</p>

<p>Well, with some more testing I've seen that this will work (i.e. it's<br>
correct), but the problem is I have to manually instantiate x and y,<br>
whereas ideally they would be instantiated by unification. That was<br>
the same problem with the first formulation--manual instantiation of<br>
stuff that you would wish wasn't necessary. However, maybe, as per<br>
Tobias, I need to learn to do structured proofs.</p>
