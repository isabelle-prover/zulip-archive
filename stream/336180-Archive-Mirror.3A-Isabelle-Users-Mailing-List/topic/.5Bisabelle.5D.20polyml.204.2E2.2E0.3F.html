Has anyone tried building Isabelle with the new 4.2.0 release of<br>
polyml?  I was able to build with the binary provided on the Isabelle<br>
website but using 4.2.0 doesn't seem to work at all - do I need some<br>
support libs in polyml?</p>
<p>Sorry for such an elementary question - I'm looking at putting together<br>
an ebuild for gentoo linux and matters would be somewhat simplified if<br>
4.2.0 worked, since the license on that release is LGPL.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

The 2005 release of Isabelle doesn't type-check with the 4.2 release of <br>
PolyML as some library things changed. However PolyML4.1.4 is the same <br>
as 4.2 with some small changes for backward compatibility. The CVS <br>
version of Isabelle builds fine with PolyML 4.2</p>

This sounds a bit strange to me -- users cannot be controlled like this. <br>
Even more, all of this is free software, so people out there are free to <br>
do what they want (ideally help other people to simplify their life).</p>
<p>Anyway, I suppose it is possible to produce Gentoo packages in the spirit <br>
of the original Isabelle ones, while minimizing the potential for <br>
surprise. (I've once seen a BSD port of Isabelle where everything was torn <br>
to bits and pieces -- doc into /usr/share/doc, src into /usr/src etc. -- <br>
just to have a point to package things in the first place.)</p>
<p>By default, Isabelle expects everything at the same directory level as <br>
itself (e.g. /opt/Isabelle2005, /opt/polyml, /opt/ProofGeneral), or within <br>
its own contrib (e.g. /opt/Isabelle2005/contrib/polyml, <br>
/opt/Isabelle2005/contrib/ProofGeneral etc.).</p>
<p>ProofGeneral can also go into some central /usr/lib/emacs place, but then <br>
users are forced to that version -- emacs will ignore private ones! PolyML <br>
setup has various traps and pitfalls, too, but I cannot recall all of them <br>
on the spot.</p>
<p>Also note that some users have several Isabelle/PolyML/ProofGeneral <br>
versions at the same time.</p>

<p>Not quite so.  If you look at the Linux File System Standard, for example, <br>
it leaves the freedom for vendors to put everything in one place, such as <br>
/opt/my-application or /usr/local/my-application.  Then there is little <br>
need to do extra packaging, of course.</p>
<p>In contrast Isabelle does expect certain things in certain positions <br>
relative to its main directory (doc, src, lib, etc).  The idea is that an <br>
Isabelle installation is a single integral unit, not a collection of files <br>
floating through the global file system.</p>

<p>So why bother at all? Why make simple things complicated anyway? With the <br>

<p>The main reason I was asking is I was hoping to provide ebuild files<br>
for Gentoo Linux.  Gentoo is a bit uncommon in that the entire<br>

a sane environment.</p>
<p>Would there be objection to creating ebuild files for Isabelle, if the<br>
ebuild instructed the person installing the software that they should <br>
not contact the Isabelle team with support issues related to the ebuild<br>

<p>I didn't mean to suggest controlling the users.  This is done in (for<br>
example) the e17 ebuild to inform the end users that the gentoo ebuilds<br>
are not a supported method of installing the software and advising them<br>
that the core development team may not wish to respond to bug reports<br>
generated from the ebuild installed software.  Of course, the user may<br>
decide to raise a given issue anyway.</p>
<p>Of course, free software allows the freedom for many things.  It is<br>

them and respect their wishes in cases such as this.  Unilateral action<br>

<p>This was more probably done in order to allow Isabelle users to locate<br>

<p>proofgeneral is actually already available in the Gentoo ebuild system,<br>
and polyml is installable in its 4.2.0 form (the ebuild has not yet<br>
been made mainstream.)  Hmm - it's a bit of a surprise that you can't<br>
specify a specific location for the proofgeneral package.  I'll have to<br>
check into that. </p>

<p>Obviously, in a case such as that the packaging mechanisms are seldom<br>
the best way to go.  It is actually possible to do this in Gentoo using<br>
a slot mechanism, but I doubt it is worth that trouble.  I was merely<br>
hoping to make the "most current" Isabelle available for automatic<br>
install (and more important, file tracking by the emerge system.)  For<br>
those doing serious development, package managers are usually a poor<br>
fit.  Perhaps for software like Isabelle there is little distinction<br>
between user and developer?  In any case, Isabelle's expectation of<br>
having all activity at the same root level location does make packaging<br>
problematic.  Just out of curosity, what motivated that design<br>
decision?  Is the core Isabelle system itself changed by the<br>
manipulations performed?  (Sorry about my ignorance in such matters. <br>
It's looking like this is a much more difficult problem than I had<br>
anticipated, so I'll have to do some research first.)</p>

<p>The latter, pretty much by definition, is not an issue for Gentoo users<br>
;-).  Building a complete system, particularly with KDE and OpenOffice<br>
installed, usually takes a couple of days.</p>
<p>As to the former, the major benefit of the emerge system is not<br>
automatic installation (although that is a convenience) but the ability<br>
to track all files associated with the core install of the software,<br>
and the ability to cleanly and automatically remove old/upgrade to new<br>
versions of said software.  The case of root vs. user logic builds,<br>
however, is a sticky one.  Normal practice would be for the "builtin"<br>
logic to be built and protected, and user experimentation on top of<br>
that or replacing it would take place in a user directory.  I gather<br>
that it is normal for each researcher to have their own copy or copies<br>
of Isabelle which are altered, and for there to be no "installed"<br>
benchmark from which everyone diverges? (For instance, the way Firefox<br>
has a core browser installed but each user may significantly alter its<br>
behavior for themselves via config and plugin extensions?)  This<br>
definitely would explain the absence of most major proof software from<br>
Gentoo and other distributions.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry to cause all the fuss.  If it works, it works.  Certainly<br>
the binaries seem functional on Gentoo in a "normal" install.</p>

Which means that there is no point to package Isabelle like this, because<br>
it can be put into a single directory of the user's choice, and removed<br>
with rm -rf.</p>
<p>So is there actually a problem you are trying to solve here, or is this<br>

<p>I guess you could say the "problem" I was trying to solve was providing<br>
a convenient installation method for Isabelle within the framework of<br>
the Gentoo system.  My own experience with software outside the package<br>
management system is somewhat mixed, as I have on more than one<br>
occasion had "abandoned" programs hide for some time in isolated<br>
directories and cause trouble when trying to run newer versions of the<br>
same software.  Or, on rarer occasions, a mistake on my part results in<br>
the accidental corruption or removal of a user level tree in some<br>
fashion.  Also, binary only packages will age as core system libraries<br>
are updated, eventually resulting in a non-working setup.  (For<br>
example, I cannot currently run Wolfram's MathReader.)  All of these<br>
situations can be avoided with a managed install in Gentoo, which not<br>
only tracks the package but has an automated way to rebuild any<br>
software that breaks as a result of an upgrade to some other library.</p>
<p>I grant that Isabelle might be a less logical prospect for package<br>
management then most software - I am more accustomed to the model of<br>
having a "core" set of functionality defined in a program which is<br>
shared among multiple users and has the user specific<br>
code/functionality/settings defined in the user directory.  If Isabelle<br>
doesn't have a logical "core" that should be protected/shared, that<br>
does tend to make it a less attractive prospect.  That also means I<br>
need to make a much more careful study of how Isabelle works.</p>
<p>I seem to have stirred up a bit of a hornet's nest, for which I<br>
apologize - that was not my intention.  Mostly my thinking was that I<br>
would like to see tools such as Isabelle in much wider use, and one way<br>
to help might be to "incorporate" Isabelle as a standard package in<br>
Gentoo.  Isabelle looks to be one of the best tools in this particular<br>
field of research, so it was a natural place to start.  If there are<br>
sound reasons for avoiding package management then that is no problem.</p>

No, it's the other way around. By default ~/isabelle/heaps is looked in first.</p>
