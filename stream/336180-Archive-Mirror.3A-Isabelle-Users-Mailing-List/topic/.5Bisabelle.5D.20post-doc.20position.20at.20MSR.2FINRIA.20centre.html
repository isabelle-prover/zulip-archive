<p>From: Stephan Merz &lt;<a href="mailto:Stephan.Merz@loria.fr">Stephan.Merz@loria.fr</a>&gt;<br>
Since the TLA+ proof system is partly based on Isabelle, the following announcement may be of particular interest to this mailing list.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration,</p>

<p>Research team: Tools for Proofs, MSR-INRIA Joint Centre<br>
=======================================================</p>
<p>The Microsoft Research-INRIA Joint Centre is offering a 2-year<br>
position for a post-doctoral researcher to contribute to a proof development<br>
environment for TLA+ developed in the Tools for Proofs project (see<br>
<a href="http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr">http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr</a>).</p>
<p>Research Context<br>
================</p>
<p>TLA+ is a language for specifying and reasoning about systems,<br>
including concurrent and distributed systems.  It is based on<br>
first-order logic, set theory, temporal logic, and a module system.<br>
TLA+ and its tools have been used in industry for over a decade.  More<br>
recently, we have extended TLA+ to include hierarchically structured<br>
formal proofs that are independent of any proof checker.  We have<br>
released several versions of the TLAPS proof checker<br>
(<a href="http://msr-inria.inria.fr/~doligez/tlaps/">http://msr-inria.inria.fr/~doligez/tlaps/</a>) and integrated it into the<br>
TLA+ Toolbox, an IDE for the TLA+ tools<br>
(<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/toolbox.html">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/toolbox.html</a>).</p>
<p>TLAPS and the Toolbox support the top-down development of proofs and<br>
the checking of individual proof steps independently of the rest of<br>
the proof.  This helps users focus on the part of the proof they are<br>
working on.  Although still lacking important features, TLAPS is<br>
already a powerful tool and has been used for a few verification<br>
projects, including a proof of the safety properties of a Byzantine-fault<br>
tolerant consensus algorithm<br>
(<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/byzpaxos.html">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/byzpaxos.html</a>).</p>
<p>TLAPS consists of the Proof Manager (PM, an interpreter for the<br>
proof language that computes the proof obligations corresponding to<br>
each proof step) and an extensible list of backend provers. Current backends<br>
include the tableau prover Zenon, an encoding of TLA+ as an object logic<br>
in the Isabelle proof assistant, and a generic backend for SMT solvers.<br>
When possible, we expect backend provers to produce a detailed proof that<br>
is then checked by Isabelle.  In this way, we can obtain high assurance<br>
of correctness as well as satisfactory automation.</p>
<p>The current version of the PM handles only the "action" part of TLA+:<br>
first-order formulas with primed and unprimed variables, where a<br>
variable v is considered to be unrelated to its primed version v'.<br>
This allows us to translate non-temporal proof obligations to standard<br>
first-order logic, without the overhead associated with an encoding of<br>
temporal logic into first-order logic.</p>
<p>Description of the activity of the post-doc<br>
===========================================</p>
<p>You will work with other members of the project, including Leslie<br>
Lamport, Damien Doligez, and Stephan Merz, on the extension of the<br>
TLA+ proof language to temporal operators.  This extension poses<br>
interesting conceptual and practical problems.  In particular, the new<br>
translation must smoothly extend the existing one since temporal proof<br>
steps rely on action-level subproofs.  You will have the primary<br>
responsibility for designing and implementing algorithms to generate<br>
corresponding proof obligations.</p>
<p>As time permits and depending on your interests, you will have the<br>
opportunity to contribute to further improving the proof checker.<br>
This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>adding support for certain TLA+ features that are not yet handled by<br>
  the PM, such as recursive operator definitions and elaborate patterns<br>
  for variable bindings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>finding what improvements are needed by verifying real examples, perhaps<br>
  including liveness of the aforementioned consensus algorithm;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integrating new backends to improve the automation of proofs;</p>
</li>
<li>adding validation of proofs by backends whose proofs are not<br>
  now checked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Skills and profile of the candidate<br>
===================================</p>
<p>You should have a solid knowledge of logic and set theory as well as<br>
good implementation skills related to symbolic theorem proving.  Of<br>
particular relevance are parsing and compilation techniques.  Our<br>
tools are mainly implemented in OCaml.  Experience with temporal and<br>
modal logics, Isabelle, Java or Eclipse would be a plus.</p>
<p>Given the geographical distribution of the members of the team,<br>
we highly value a good balance between the ability to work in a team<br>
and the capacity to propose initiatives.</p>
<p>Location<br>
========</p>
<p>The Microsoft Research-INRIA Joint Centre is located on the Campus of<br>
INRIA Saclay south of Paris, near the Le Guichet RER station.</p>
<p>Starting date<br>
=============</p>
<p>The normal starting date of the contract would be September 2012,<br>
but we can arrange for an extremely well-qualified candidate to<br>
start sooner.</p>
<p>Contact<br>
=======</p>
<p>Candidates should send a resume and the name and e-mail addresses of<br>
one or two references to Damien Doligez &lt;<a href="mailto:damien.doligez@inria.fr">damien.doligez@inria.fr</a>&gt;.<br>
The deadline for application is April 15, 2012.</p>
