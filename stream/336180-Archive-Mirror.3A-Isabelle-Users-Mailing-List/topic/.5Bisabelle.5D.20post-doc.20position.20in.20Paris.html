Research team: Tools for Proofs, MSR-INRIA Joint Centre</p>
<p>The Microsoft Research-INRIA Joint Centre is offering a 2-year<br>
position for a post-doctoral researcher to work on a proof development<br>
environment for TLA+ in the Tools for Proofs project-team (see<br>
<a href="http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr">http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr</a>).</p>
<p>Research Context</p>
<p>TLA+ is a language for formal specifications and proofs designed by<br>
Leslie Lamport.  It is based on first-order logic, set theory,<br>
temporal logic, and a module system.  While the specification part of<br>
TLA+ has existed for several years, the proof language is more recent,<br>
and we want to develop tools for writing and checking proofs.</p>
<p>Our development environment for TLA+ proofs will have the following<br>
structure: TLA+ source files will be translated to low-level proofs<br>
that will be checked by Isabelle.  These will include calls to the<br>
Zenon automatic theorem prover to fill in the "trivial" details<br>
omitted from proofs at the TLA+ level.  Within the Isabelle framework<br>
we will have an axiomatization of TLA+ (Isabelle/TLA+).  Isabelle will<br>
provide high assurance by checking all the proofs provided by the<br>
user or by Zenon.  As the user writes and modifies the TLA+ source<br>
code, a proof manager will keep track of which parts of the proofs<br>
need to be modified and re-checked by Isabelle.  The proof manager<br>
will also support direct interaction from the user with Isabelle when<br>
needed.</p>
<p>Description of the activity of the post-doc</p>
<p>The task devoted to the post-doc will be to develop the tools that<br>
make up the TLA+ development environment: the translator to Isabelle,<br>
the Zenon-Isabelle interface, and the proof manager.  He will also<br>
complete the development of the TLA+ theory in the Isabelle framework<br>
(Isabelle/TLA+), which is currently incomplete.</p>
<p>Skills and profile of the candidate</p>
<p>We are looking for a candidate with skills in some or all of the<br>
following subjects: parsing and compilation, logic and set theory,<br>
Isabelle, OCaml, Eclipse and Java.  Moreover, the applicant must have<br>
a good command of the English language.</p>
<p>Location</p>
<p>The Microsoft Research-INRIA Joint Centre is located on the Campus of<br>
INRIA Futurs, in South part of Paris, near the Le-Guichet RER<br>
station. The Tools for Proofs project-team is composed of Damien<br>
Doligez, Leslie Lamport and Stephan Merz.</p>
<p>Contact</p>
<p>Candidates should send a resume to Damien Doligez<br>
