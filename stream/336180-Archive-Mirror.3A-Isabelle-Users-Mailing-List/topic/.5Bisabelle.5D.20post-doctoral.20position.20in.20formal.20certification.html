<p>From: Sandrine Blazy &lt;<a href="mailto:Sandrine.Blazy@inria.fr">Sandrine.Blazy@inria.fr</a>&gt;<br>
The Compcert project, funded by the French National Agency for<br>
Research in its program on the security of computer systems<br>
(ANR-SSIA), is offering two post-doctoral positions for durations of<br>
up to 18 months, starting in the first half of 2007.</p>
<p>The Compcert project is concerned with the formal description of<br>
optimizing compilers for high-level languages, including a significant<br>
subset of the C programming language, and computer-verified proofs of<br>
correctness for these compilers.  Foundational aspects of this project<br>
include the mechanization of programming language semantics and<br>
mechanically verified proofs of correctness for functional and<br>
imperative programs.  Most proofs and algorithms are verified using<br>
the Coq proof assistant.</p>
<p>The project is looking for applicants having a solid background<br>
in one or preferably two of the following domains:</p>
<p>* programming language semantics,<br>
  * compiler development,<br>
  * computer-based proof assistants,</p>
<p>and a real interest in the other aspects.</p>
<p>The topics to be investigated during the post-docs range over the<br>
scope of the project, from formal compiler verification to mechanized<br>
semantics to connections with other tools (program provers, static<br>
analyzers) used to develop high-assurance software.  For instance, we<br>
envision the following two topics:</p>
<p>* A formalization of domain theory inside the type theory of the Coq<br>
   proof assistant and a study of its applications in the development<br>
   of correct functional programs, with a special focus on potentially<br>
   non-terminating programs such as interpreters, debuggers, or<br>
   semi-algorithms for optimisation problems.</p>
<p>* A study of separation logic for the Compcert subset of the C<br>
   programming language, including formal proofs of consistency<br>
   between this axiomatic semantics and the operational semantics used<br>
   in the compiler verification task.</p>
<p>Proposals for other relevant topics are welcome and will be discussed<br>
between applicants and the investigators of the Compcert project:<br>
  Xavier Leroy (INRIA, main investigator), Yves Bertot (INRIA),<br>
  Sandrine Blazy (ENSIIE), Pierre Courtieu (CNAM), Damien Doligez  <br>
(INRIA),<br>
   Pierre Letouzey (University of Paris 7), Laurence Rideau (INRIA).</p>
<p>The positions are located either in Evry (Paris area, under the<br>
supervision of Sandrine Blazy) or Sophia Antipolis (Nice area, French<br>
Riviera, under the supervision of Yves Bertot).</p>
<p>The gross salary is around 2200 Euros per month (1800 Euros net salary<br>
after deduction of social benefits).</p>
<p>To apply, please send a detailed vitae and a research statement<br>
(indicating the topics on which you'd like to work) to the following<br>
address: <a href="mailto:compcert@yquem.inria.fr">compcert@yquem.inria.fr</a>.  Other inquiries concerning these<br>
positions can be sent to this address as well.</p>
