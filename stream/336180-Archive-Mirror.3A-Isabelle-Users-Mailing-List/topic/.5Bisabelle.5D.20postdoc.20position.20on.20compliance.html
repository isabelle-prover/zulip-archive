POSTDOC POSITION</p>
<p>Compliance with contractual, legal and business rules<br>
Formal approach and application to privacy and security</p>
<p>INRIA  Grenoble  France</p>
<p>KEYWORDS<br>
formal specification, privacy, security, legal rule, contract, <br>
compliance, model, monitoring,<br>
accountability, traceability, liability, audit, organization, <br>
enterprise, business</p>
<p>CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES<br>
Compliance with legal, contractual, business or organizational rules is <br>
becoming a serious<br>
concern for companies because regulatory requirements are increasingly <br>
complex and<br>
numerous. Companies have to adapt their internal organization to ensure <br>
that they<br>
comply with a variety of rules related to privacy, accountability, <br>
security, duty of information,<br>
quality, etc.  They may be subject to independent audits and, in some <br>
cases, executive or<br>
employees may be liable for breaches of the rules. Software tools can be <br>
devised to<br>
help companies minimizing the risks of breaches but several challenges <br>
need to be met in<br>
order to provide solutions that are effectively usable: first, the rules <br>
(which are originally<br>
expressed in natural or legal language) have to be defined precisely; <br>
the system to<br>
implement them must be user-friendly and self-explanatory because <br>
typical users<br>
don't necessarily have specific legal background; appropriate mechanisms <br>
should<br>
be put in place to ensure accountability; last but not least, the system <br>
must be flexible<br>
and consistent with the internal organization of the company (business <br>
process, share of<br>
roles and responsibilities, etc.).<br>
The first phase of the  postdoc project is the specification of legal <br>
and contractual<br>
rules as well as organizational constraints using formal and semi-formal <br>
methods.<br>
Depending on the results of the first phase, a compliance enforcement <br>
and monitoring<br>
system may be proposed in a second phase, based on the formal and <br>
semi-formal<br>
specifications. Emphasis will be put on the enforcement of privacy and <br>
security rules.<br>
This project is part of a larger multidisciplinary initiative launched <br>
in 2008 to foster interactions<br>
between computer scientists and lawyers. In this context, the postdoc <br>
researcher will have the<br>
opportunity to interact with a variety of partners involving, in <br>
addition to computer scientists,<br>
actors of the security industry and lawyers.</p>
<p>DURATION<br>
At least one year (to start as soon as possible)</p>
<p>REQUIRED SKILLS:<br>
Minimal knowledge and motivation for formal and semi-formal methods in <br>
the general sense<br>
(formal specification, verification, software design, model design, <br>
etc.) and their application to<br>
concrete problems. Some knowledge in privacy or security would also be <br>
appreciated but is not<br>
a pre-requisite for the position.</p>
<p>LOCATION:<br>
Grenoble, capital of the French Alps, and one of the most active areas <br>
in Europe for research<br>
in Information and Communication Technologies. Inria is the French <br>
National Institute for<br>
Research in Computer Science and Control. Created in December 1992, the <br>
Inria Rhône-Alpes<br>
research unit hosts about 600 people, including about 150 researchers <br>
and the same number of<br>
PhD students.</p>
