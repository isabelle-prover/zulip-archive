<p>From: Gopalan Nadathur &lt;<a href="mailto:gopalan@cs.umn.edu">gopalan@cs.umn.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Postdoctoral Opportunity at the University of Minnesota</p>
<p>Applications are invited for a one-year postdoctoral position, possibly<br>
extendable into a second year, at the University of Minnesota related to an<br>
NSF-funded project entitled "A Higher-Order Framework for Meta-Theoretic<br>
Reasoning." The position is available immediately and reviews of<br>
applications will be conducted as they are received.</p>
<p>The project within which the appointment is to be made concerns the further<br>
development of a logic that incorporates a treatment of fixed-point<br>
definitions and the enhancement of the capabilities of the Abella proof<br>
assistant (see http:\\abella-prover.org) that is based on this logic. One<br>
particular extension to the underlying logic that is being investigated is<br>
the addition of predicate quantification. The research group is also<br>
interested in building into the Abella system the capability to reason<br>
about specifications written in linear logic and dependently typed lambda<br>
calculi, and in demonstrating the benefits of the system in tasks such as<br>
compiler verification.</p>
<p>To be suitable for the position, the candidate should be broadly conversant<br>
with the areas of computational logic and programming languages and should<br>
have the mathematical and programming skills necessary for conducting<br>
research in them. Prior exposure to a proof  assistant or logical framework<br>
such as Coq, Isabelle or Abella, programming experience with a functional<br>
language such as OCaml, an understanding of proof theoretic treatments of<br>
aspects such as induction and co-induction, and familiarity with issues<br>
related to proof search in sequent calculi and other similar logical<br>
systems would be needed for participating in the research at the<br>
appropriate  level. For more details about the necessary background and<br>
possible topics of research within the project, please feel free to contact<br>
me (Gopalan Nadathur) via email at <a href="mailto:ngopalan@umn.edu">ngopalan@umn.edu</a>.</p>

letter indicating your interest, a current CV, one or two of your papers<br>
broadly related to the topics of research and the names and contact details<br>
for two references who might be contacted as part of the application review<br>
process. Note that a prerequisite for employment is a doctoral degree in<br>
Computer Science or closely related field.</p>

<p>From: Gopalan Nadathur &lt;<a href="mailto:gopalan@cs.umn.edu">gopalan@cs.umn.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Postdoctoral Opportunity at the University of Minnesota</p>
<p>Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position at the University of<br>
Minnesota related to an NSF-funded project entitled "A Higher-Order<br>
Framework for Meta-Theoretic Reasoning." The position is available<br>
immediately and is expected to be of duration of one to two years.<br>
Applications will be reviewed and acted upon as soon as they are received.</p>
<p>The project within which the appointment is to be made concerns the further<br>
development of a proof environment for reasoning about relational<br>
specifications that supports the so-called higher-order abstract syntax<br>
approach. A key component of this environment is the Abella proof assistant<br>
(see <a href="http://abella-prover.org">http://abella-prover.org</a>), which is based on a logic that incorporates<br>
a treatment of fixed-point definitions. One thrust for ongoing work is the<br>
enhancement of the underlying logic, for example through the addition of<br>
predicate quantification. The research group is also interested in building<br>
into the Abella system the capability to reason about specifications<br>
written in linear logic and dependently typed lambda calculi, and in<br>
investigating the benefits of the system in tasks such as compiler<br>
verification.</p>
<p>To participate successfully in the research outlined above, you would need<br>
to be broadly conversant with the areas of computational logic and<br>
programming languages and to have the mathematical and programming skills<br>
necessary for conducting original work in these areas. Prior exposure to a<br>
proof  assistant or logical framework such as Coq, Isabelle or Abella,<br>
programming experience with a functional language such as OCaml, an<br>
understanding of proof theoretic treatments of aspects such as induction<br>
and co-induction, and familiarity with issues related to proof search in<br>
sequent calculi and other similar logical systems would help in engaging<br>
immediately with the research problems of interest.</p>

the position, a current CV, one or two papers broadly related to the topics<br>

to serve as your references in the review process.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in the position<br>
but would like answers prior to applying to questions related to matters<br>
such as the expectations, possible projects, and the suitability of your<br>
qualifications for the position. The best way to reach me would be via<br>
