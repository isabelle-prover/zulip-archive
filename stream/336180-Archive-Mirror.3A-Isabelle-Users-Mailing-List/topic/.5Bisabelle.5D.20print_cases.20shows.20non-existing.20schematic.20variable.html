<p>From: Lars Hupel &lt;<a href="mailto:hupel@in.tum.de">hupel@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
I have an introduction rule which has a lot of premises. These premises<br>
also have some assumptions. It is very tedious to fix all the variables<br>
and assume all the assumptions over and over again, so I decided to<br>
investigate whether I can leverage Isar's 'case' notation for proofs<br>
using this rule.</p>
<p>My first attempt was to start my proof like this:</p>
<p>lemmas irule_cases = irulesI[case_names a b c d e]</p>
<p>proof (cases rule: irule_cases)</p>
<p>This works out almost as I expected. I can write down</p>
<p>case a<br>
    show ...<br>
      ...<br>
  next<br>
    case b<br>
    show ...</p>
<p>However, the schematic variable '?case' does not exist. In other<br>
situations, I can just use 'show ?thesis', but this is not applicable here.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, this is what 'print_cases' prints:</p>
<p>cases:<br>
    a:<br>
      let "?case" = "is_fmap ?rs"</p>
<p>But the variable is just not there, which can be confirmed via<br>
'Query/Print Context'.</p>
<p>I've browsed through the Isar reference and found the attribute<br>
'case_conclusion':</p>
<p>lemmas irule_cases =<br>
    irulesI[case_names a b c d e,<br>
            case_conclusion a foo, ...]</p>
<p>Now, 'print_cases' claims that '?foo' exists, but it doesn't.</p>
<p>Now, if I change the initial proof step to use 'induct' instead of<br>
'cases', I get the '?case' variable. However, I would argue, that using<br>
'induct' for this situation feels even more unnatural than using 'cases'.</p>
<p>In §6.6.1 of the Isar reference, it is stated about the 'case' command<br>
that "Term bindings may be covered as well, notably ?case for the main<br>
conclusion." I haven't found anything about when exactly '?case' is<br>
present or absent.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>

Hi Lars,</p>
<p>I don't know the design choices for cases, as I have not implemented them, but here are my <br>
comments: cases assumes that you give it a conventional case analysis rules. These rules <br>
do not change the conclusion, so cases has some point in not providing any term <br>
abbreviations for the conclusions. Anyway, you are trying to use sophisticated proof <br>
methods just to benefit from a certain side effect. I used to do that regularly, too (and <br>
sometimes still do, but much less).</p>
<p>I guess that it should be fairly easy to implement your own method that does nothing but <br>
applying a rule and setting up the cases. The infrastructure should be all there.</p>

After looking at the code a bit I was wondering, how the cases method<br>
manages to not declare the term bindings -- the term bindings are<br>
present in the cases and I could not find an obvious flag or similar<br>
which would hide the term bindings.</p>
<p>Does anybody know how this is achieved?</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Indeed.  Proof methods can always produce cases as they see fit, cf. <br>
existing uses of METHOD_CASES and type cases_tactic.  These things have <br>
been slightly tuned and cleaned up for Isabelle2015, as part of the <br>
integration of Eisbach.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, proof method definitions with cases are rare in practice. <br>
It requires some care and sometimes technical tricks to get material from <br>
the internal goal state into the proof text, without breaking down normal <br>
Isar principles of proof composition.</p>
<p>One example that is not from the "cases" and "induct" family is <br>
"eventually_elim" in ~~/src/HOL/Filter.thy (in Isabelle2015-RC1).  It uses <br>
some basic tools to compose cases from module Rule_Cases, which is also <br>
the basis for the other cases methods.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Things really happen in ~~/src/Pure/Isar/proof_context.ML at his point:</p>
<p>fun case_result c ctxt =<br>
   let<br>
     val Rule_Cases.Case {fixes, ...} = c;<br>
     val (ts, ctxt') = ctxt |&gt; fold_map fix fixes;<br>
     val Rule_Cases.Case {assumes, binds, cases, ...} = Rule_Cases.apply ts c;<br>
   in<br>
     ctxt'<br>
     |&gt; bind_terms (map drop_schematic binds)<br>
     |&gt; update_cases true (map (apsnd SOME) cases)<br>
     |&gt; pair (assumes, (binds, cases))<br>
   end;</p>
<p>val apply_case = apfst fst oo case_result;</p>
<p>Later on in proof.ML, apply_case is turned into Proof.invoke_case, which <br>
is the Isabelle/ML definition of the Isar command 'case'.</p>
<p>The drop_schematic above drops term bindings that happen to contain <br>
left-over schematic variables, i.e. have not been properly determined by <br>
other means (further instantiation by the proof method etc.).</p>
<p>It is a classic Isar principle that proof text (and cases are part of <br>
that) cannot be schematic.  When implementing these things about 15 years <br>
ago, I kept it rather simple by leaving schematic parts for informative <br>
purposes until the last moment.  Something similar happens for schematic <br>
type variables, e.g. due to hidden polymorphism.</p>
<p>So instead of halting and catching fire due to schematic variables <br>
somewhere, things only fail late for situations where the user insists to <br>
make use of uninstantiated proof context elements.  Note that the user may <br>
also choose to ignore the debatable case definitions, and proceed by other <br>
means.</p>
<p>Today, we have higher ambitions in comfort (also IDE support).  I am <br>
trying to revisit all this for some years already, but again did not <br>
manage for Isabelle2015.</p>

Oh, so that's indeed done by this mechanism. Thanks for the explanation.<br>
(I was sure I had constructed a situation where "cases" produced<br>
non-schematic bindings before, but was apparently not careful enough).</p>

<p>From: Lars Hupel &lt;<a href="mailto:hupel@in.tum.de">hupel@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
The problem is that the 'cases' method doesn't instantiate the rule<br>
before setting up the cases, as opposed to what 'induct' does. If I write</p>
<p>proof (cases rule: foo[where ...])</p>
<p>I get the '?case' bindings.</p>
<p>I completely understand why Isar text can't be schematic, which is why<br>
I'm wondering whether the 'cases' method can be changed to perform<br>
matching before setting up the cases.</p>
