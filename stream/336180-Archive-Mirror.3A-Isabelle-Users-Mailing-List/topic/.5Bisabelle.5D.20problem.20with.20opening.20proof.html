<p>From: Chris Capel &lt;<a href="mailto:pdf23ds@gmail.com">pdf23ds@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
OK, I gave Isar another try and I'm making some progress with it. Anyway.</p>
<p>I have some statements like</p>
<p>fix ...<br>
assume ... and ...<br>
thus "EX x y. ..."<br>
proof</p>
<p>The "proof" line fails, with "empty result sequence", unless I change<br>
it to "proof -" or change "thus" to "show", hence taking the<br>
assumptions out of "this". Why are my assumptions getting in the way<br>
of what should be a simple application of exI? This makes no sense to<br>
me, as exI only cares about the conclusion. Let me know if I need to<br>
send an example.</p>
<p>On a completely different note, it would be cool if abbreviations<br>
could be made that are local to proofs. Often I have expressions<br>
repeated several times throughout a goal that make it quite large,<br>
when it would be manageable with some abbreviations. Let statements<br>
are nice, but they're expanded in the goal display. Such a command<br>
might not semantically differ from the let command.</p>

Hi Chris,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fix ...<br>
assume ... and ...<br>
thus "EX x y. ..."<br>
proof</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"proof" is short for "proof default", where the "default" method performs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>introduction using a suitable predeclared rule if no facts are<br>
chained in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>elimination using a suitable predeclared rule if any facts are<br>
chained in.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So in your case it fails because there are no suitable elimination rules<br>
for your assumptions.</p>
<p>What you can try instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fix ...<br>
assume P: ... and Q: ...<br>
show "EX x y. ..."<br>
proof<br>
  from P Q ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or perhaps</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fix ...<br>
assume ... and ...<br>
show "EX x y. ..."<br>
proof (intro exI)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope this helps<br>

<p>From: Brian Huffman &lt;<a href="mailto:brianh@cs.pdx.edu">brianh@cs.pdx.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Chris,</p>
<p>I have often used local definitions to help manage the size of large<br>
subgoals. There are two ways to use them. First, you can use "defines"<br>
in the theorem statement:</p>
<p>lemma foo:<br>
  fixes x and y ...<br>
  assumes ...<br>
  defines wibble_def: "wibble == ... x ... y ..."<br>
  shows "... wibble ..."</p>
<p>Note that if the rhs of the definition mentions any free variables,<br>
they must be previously declared using "fixes". Once you finish the<br>
proof, the local definitions are unfolded, and the locally-defined<br>
constants do not appear in the resulting theorem.</p>
<p>The other method is to use the "def" command. Note the unusual<br>
placement of the quote marks---only the rhs is quoted.</p>
<p>lemma foo: ...<br>
proof -<br>
  fix x and y<br>
  def wibble == "... x .. y ..."<br>
  show ...</p>
<p>Local definitions are not abbreviations; you will still need to<br>
fold/unfold the definitions manually within the proofs. But if your<br>
subgoal terms are really big, this is an advantage: Not only do your<br>
goals look smaller, they really are smaller---which makes<br>
simplification and other proof tactics run faster.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it would be nice to have both local definitions and<br>
local abbreviations. I'm sure that it would be possible to implement<br>
an "abbrev" command that works much like "def", but I'm just not sure<br>
how to do it.</p>

<p>The manual is indeed less accurate than the true source text. <br>
Conceptually, 'proof' without argument performs a "default" step, but the <br>
method of that name is essentially dynamically rebound by some later <br>

<p>The main idea of a default step is represented by the Pure "rule" method; <br>
the later additions for type classes and classical reasoning can be <br>

<p>No, method "rule" is always just that.  Any proper Isar method is <br>
sensitive to the facts being chained.  Thus chaining + rule acts like an <br>
elimination, and no chaining + rule like a plain introduction.</p>
<p>The variants "erule" etc. are from a slightly different (tactical) layer, <br>
which are never required in properly structured Isar proofs.</p>

<p>The "intro" method repeatedly unfolds introduction rules.  As a weakly <br>
structured tool, it merely inserts facts into the goal initially, without <br>
taking them a seriously as "rule".  This is analogous to "simp", "auto" <br>
etc.</p>
<p>You should be able to ignore the "intro" and "elim" methods most of the <br>
time -- they stem from a very early stage of Isar when structured proofs <br>
were not fully understood yet.</p>

<p>Generally, I see the structured proof game as coaxing the proof engine  <br>

since this will tend to make the reader uneasy about the "formal  <br>

<p>Let's say, the understanding has greatly improved since then, but is not <br>
really a "full" one.</p>
<p>An up-to-date exposition of general Isar concepts and machinery is now in <br>
section 2 of the isar-ref manual.  This spot has been empty for ten years <br>
and has been filled only a few months ago.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are many things that are not written anywhere, notably <br>
about the deeper reasons for various design details.  I am already glad <br>
enough to have occasional readers of the more basic stuff, and did not see <br>
a market yet for the really arcane lore.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This basic principle has been there in Isar from the very beginning, but <br>
its focus has shifted more and more away from goals, towards more direct <br>
composition of facts (with nice derived concepts like 'also' and 'obtain', <br>
free-form blocks { ... } etc.).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To this end, I find intro and elim necessary quite often, when the <br>
default reasoning set returns a proof state that is incomprehensible to <br>
a human reader.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "intro" and "elim" methods are probably best understood as logical <br>
counterparts to "unfold".  This category of methods can be used at the <br>
start of an Isar proof, but the demand for this has greatly diminished <br>
over the years.</p>
<p>For example, in 1999 (when doing the HahnBanach case-study) we found <br>
ourselves using "elim" a lot to simulate what 'obtain' would become a bit <br>
later.  Moreover, free-form blocks with moreover/ultimately + auto/blast <br>
are often more convenient for arbitrary composition of intermediate <br>
stepping stones than fiddling on goals with "intro" etc.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, intro/elim/unfold are in no way blacklisted as initial proof <br>
step (in contrast to bad things like "proof auto" which is really just a <br>
leftover from a very ancient attempt of mine at structure reasoning in<br>
1997).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, it is suboptimal to have long convoluted chains of methods <br>
that result in the "obvious" goal state, since this will tend to make <br>
the reader uneasy about the "formal nonsense" that is meant to be <br>

</blockquote>
<p>Maybe this paper <a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/papers/isar-reasoning.pdf">http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/papers/isar-reasoning.pdf</a> <br>
helps to reduce formal nonsense a bit.  (After the presentation at the <br>
conference some Coq expert told me that they have essentially always done <br>
the same, although with quite different means and ends.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I still must say, that I can't follow the reasoning behind the way<br>
default/rule is implemented. My confusion is well described by the<br>

    a2: "B"<br>

  using a2 a1 ..</p>
<p>and the second of which is not.</p>
<p>This can be seriously annoying when trying to chain facts</p>
<p>assume b1: "B"<br>
have b2: "A"<br>
  -- proof<br>
with b1 show "A &amp; B" ..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the "rule" method (of the '..' step) asks you to present facts in <br>
proper order, i.e. "from this and by".</p>
<p>In 1998, I did have a version of "rule" that was much more liberal, but <br>
never worked out so well.  The critical question is how much variance <br>
(degrees of freedom) is acceptable in Isar proof checking, before either <br>
the system or the reader can no longer work things out with reasonable <br>
efforts.</p>
<p>If "rule" would admit arbitrary permutations of facts, for example, there <br>
would be a much larger search space for seamingly trivial steps.  Even <br>
worse, it would stop working in most "open" situations via plain "proof <br>
... qed', because the first choice needs to be the right one.  It is <br>
better to leave free rearrangement of facts and goals to automated tools, <br>
and use something like "from a b c show D by blast" instead.</p>
<p>In contrast, there is no problem to allow the user write the required <br>
sub-proofs (fix/assume/show) in any order, because explicit text is given, <br>
and both the system and the user usually manage to fit things together <br>
quickly.  (Actually, there used to be a performance bottle-neck here until <br>
recently; it has been sorted out for Isabelle2009.)</p>
