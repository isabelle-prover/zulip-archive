<p>One of the reasons why beta-conversion is not recorded in the proof object is<br>
that Isabelle's central inference rule - higher-order resolution - works modulo<br>
beta-conversion, too.<br>
Interestingly, the Coq theorem prover goes even further and not only leaves<br>
beta-conversion, but also iota-conversion (i.e. unfolding of recursive<br>
definitions) implicit in proof terms. The ability to elide such<br>
computations in proof terms turns out to be essential for applications<br>
such as proof-carrying code, where the size of the transmitted proofs<br>
needs to be kept as small as possible. One of my colleagues, who built<br>
a proof-carrying code system based on Isabelle, noticed that even proof<br>
terms for relatively simple safety properties of programs can reach an<br>
enormous size just because of the numerous calls to Isabelle's simplifier<br>
that are recorded in the proof term.</p>

<p>This is exactly what the proof replaying function in Pure/Proof/proofchecker.ML<br>
does as well. It uses only very primitive inference rules such as Thm.implies_elim,<br>
which are <em>not</em> modulo beta-conversion (unlike higher-order resolution). Note<br>
that eta-conversion needs to be done as well.</p>
