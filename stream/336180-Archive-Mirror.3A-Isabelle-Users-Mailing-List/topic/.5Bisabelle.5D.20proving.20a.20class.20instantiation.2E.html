<p>From: Viorel Preoteasa &lt;<a href="mailto:viorel.preoteasa@abo.fi">viorel.preoteasa@abo.fi</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>I have a problem proving a class instantiation.</p>
<p>after the instance keyword I get the following proof obligation:</p>
<p>OFCLASS('a N, some_algebra_class)</p>
<p>First question is how do I unfold this expression to be able to<br>
use apply scripts and not isar structured proofs.</p>
<p>Second if I start an isar proof using the keyword proof,<br>
then I get 8 proof  subgoals:</p>
<ol>
<li>/\ a b c . a * b = a * c ==&gt; b = c</li>
<li>
<p>/\ b a c . b * a = c * a ==&gt; b = c<br>
...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have 8 lemmas proved already for all these subgoals.</p>
<p>Now if I use:</p>
<p>fix a b c::"'a N" show "a * b = a * c ==&gt; b = c"  by (rule <br>
cancel_times_left, simp) next;</p>
<p>I cannot get rid of the first suboal. The first subgoal changes to:</p>
<ol>
<li>/\ a b c . a * b = a * c ==&gt; ?a12 a b c * b =?a12 a b c * c</li>
<li>
<p>/\ b a c . b * a = c * a ==&gt; b = c<br>
...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I find this proof style very difficult. As I mentioned I have<br>
already lemmas for all these subgoals, but I am not<br>
able to use the lemmas to prove the subgoals. Is there an easier<br>
way of discharging the subgoals without retyping them?</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Viorel</p>

Hi Viorel,</p>
<p>I think what you basically have to write is</p>
<p>instance<br>
apply intro_classes<br>
apply (fact &lt;all your already proved facts)+<br>
done</p>
<p>which can be collapsed to</p>
<p>instance proof<br>
qed (fact &lt;all your already proved facts)+</p>
<p>See the Isar Reference manual for the intro_classes and fact methods.</p>
<p>However I do not recommend to have the obligations proved as separate<br>
lemmas: after instantiation, you can use the corresponding theorems of<br>
the class specification, so this introduces perhaps confusing duplication.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br>

<p>Isar proofs behave strangely when you 'show' something with a<br>
meta-implication (==&gt;) in it, as you've done here. This has been<br>
discussed on the mailing list before:</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2009-April/msg00052.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2009-April/msg00052.html</a><br>

<p>The quick fix is to avoid using this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fix a b c::"'a N" show "a * b = a * c ==&gt; b = c"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and instead use explicit 'assume' commands:</p>
<p>fix a b c::"'a N" assume "a * b = a * c" thus "b = c"</p>
<p>Hopefully this strange behavior can be changed in a future release of<br>
Isabelle, because using 'show' with meta-implications is useful<br>
sometimes, and users seem to get stuck on the same problem on a<br>
regular basis.</p>

<p>This is mainly due to the historic goal state output: when the system <br>
prints a subgoal "!!x. A x ==&gt; B x" it means "for arbitrary but fixed x <br>
you may now assume A x and then have to show B x", but this is not <br>
immediately clear. Since the post-Proof-General model is less centered <br>
around goal states anyway, the confusion might disappear by itself at some <br>
point.  There are also other reforms in the pipeline (for many years <br>
already) that did not make it into the light of reality yet.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Can you give an example for that?  I.e. where show "!!x. A x ==&gt; B x"<br>
is needed as such, instead of something that is equivalent to<br>
{ fix x assume "A x" then show "B x" ... } ?</p>

<p>You can use 'next' -- with plain blocks { ... } without restating a nested <br>
goal.  See also section "6.1.2 Blocks" in the isar-ref manual of <br>
Isabelle2009-2.</p>

<p>The situation of Isabelle manuals is very complex.  In general you cannot <br>
expect a tutorial to tell the full story, although the explanation of <br>
'next' in the Isar tutorial is especially misleading, since it suggests a <br>
connection to subgoals that does not exist.</p>
<p>While the reference manuals that are maintained by myself are more <br>
precise, they are often harder to understand.  In recent years I have <br>
started to add some examples, so this should become better.  (The isar-ref <br>
manual is still lagging behind, but the implementation manual already <br>
gives many concrete standard schemes that work.)</p>

<p>I'd say it is just a small detail that has not found its proper <br>
application yet.  The behaviour is not accidental, and I was fully aware <br>
of it around 1999 when that part of Isar emerged.  If I would have forced <br>
other aspects of the language like that in the past, many useful patterns <br>
would have been eliminated.</p>
<p>The recurrent user confusion is always of the same pattern: people think <br>
in terms of tactical goal states and suddenly find themselves in the world <br>
of structured Isar proofs, typically via class instantiation proofs. <br>
This problem can be solved by having the system react on user input in a <br>
way that immediately guides in the right direction.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
It is in fact a short form of this:</p>
<p>{ fix x presume "A x" show "B x" ... }</p>
<p>The question about "short-cuts" in general is of a slightly different <br>
nature. One way is to have the "IDE" make it quick and easy to produce the <br>
right text.  Another way is to come up with some extra notational devices <br>
that address this point, and maybe 2 or 3 other ones.</p>
<p>I did start to experiment with various short versions of<br>
{fix x assume "A x" show "B x" ... } in 2006, analogous<br>
to fixes/assumes/shows/obtains at the theory level, but it got swamped in <br>
the release chaos of 2006/2007.  But it is not forgotten, and will <br>
re-emerge and some point ...</p>

So of the two possible interpretations of show "!!x. A x ==&gt; B x", you<br>
specifically chose the version with 'presume' rather than 'assume'.<br>
Why did you think this was the right choice? Comments on the mailing<br>
list have clearly shown that users uniformly expect the 'assume'<br>
interpretation, and are thoroughly confused by the current behavior.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The behaviour of show "!!x. A x ==&gt; B x" is a natural consequence of how <br>
rule application works in Isar, and I did not force it into another <br>
direction when it emerged many years ago.  This is the same principle that <br>
made most of the language work out very well in the end.  So you are <br>
asking to close a door where you have entered yourself before.</p>
<p>Moreover, the "expected" treatment of such inlined rules would dilute <br>
important concepts of the Isar language design, and make it harder to <br>
learn it properly later on.  One such principle is that native structural <br>
language elements are preferred over logical formulae.  If you take the <br>
existing fixes/assumes/shows/obtains for example, it gives the user an <br>
opportinity to add names, attributes, is patterns etc. that can be later <br>
used in the proof.  It also avoids an argument, if !!/==&gt; are just copies <br>
of !/--&gt; in HOL, or a separete notation for rules, or whatever.</p>
<p>Abbreviating { fix assume "A x" show "B x" ... } as<br>
show "!!x. A x ==&gt; B x" looses the advantages of Isar structure.<br>
Instead, one could support something simular to fixes/assumes/shows inside <br>
a proof, but as always it requires substantial time to study the <br>
consequences of adding new trees to the garden, and maybe removing some <br>
old ones.</p>
<p>This delicate process of tending the arboretum is further complicated by <br>
different traditions being present at the same time. The whole Isar <br>
framework grew out of certain ideas of tactical reasoning, natural <br>
deduction rule composition, semi-automated reasoning, and fit together so <br>
smoothly that many people still think that "apply" scripts are native to <br>
Isar (although they are only guests).</p>
<p>A marginal question concerning consistency and least surprise: Why do many <br>
people still indent toplevel Isar proofs differently from local ones? E.g. <br>
like this:</p>
<p>lemma foo<br>
by simp</p>
<p>instead of the proper form according to the true logical structure of <br>
Isar:</p>
<p>lemma foo<br>
   by simp</p>
<p>Here the "surprise" has again historical roots, because the first version <br>
is how unstructured proof scripts would look like, before they where <br>
manually converted to the new language many years ago.</p>

<p>Lambda calculus terms do not need outermost parentheses. Paragraphs in<br>
Ennglish texts are indented, except for the first one in a section. Etc.<br>
For good reasons in each case. And in this case there is not just a<br>
sctructural reason but also the similarity with standard mathematical<br>
practice.</p>

I did some thorough research on such details before setting a certain <br>
default in formal proof documents.</p>
<p>The point of paragraph markup is to emphasize the division of the text. <br>
There are two traditions.  The one with the indentation and without line <br>
spacing is a bit more "anglo saxon" than the other, and more common in <br>
software packages from the US.  But it is not universal, and fails to <br>
achieve its intention with the typical mix of formal and informal parts in <br>
Isar documents.</p>
<p>Here is a recent example: <br>
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/b8d89db3e238">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/b8d89db3e238</a> that made a big <br>
difference in the clarity of the structure of a text where many paragraphs<br>
are shorter than one line.</p>

You misunderstood me. I have not argued that paragraphs should be<br>
indented but that there is an exception to this rule for the first<br>
paragraph - this being another instance of the rule-with-an-exception<br>
pattern. Indeed, your default latex spacing and indenting avoids<br>
excessive and unnecessary indentation. Interestingly avoiding more or<br>
less the indentation pattern you get by the "proper" Isar indentation<br>
rules at the proof level:</p>
