<p>From: Julian Brunner &lt;<a href="mailto:julianbrunner@gmail.com">julianbrunner@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>While using Isabelle, I keep running into the problem of not being able to<br>
prove existentially quantified statements using a witness with the show<br>
statement telling me that the "Local statement will fail to refine any<br>
pending goal".</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>theorem "EX x. x = (0 :: nat)"<br>
proof<br>
  obtain x where x_def: "x = (0 :: nat)" by simp<br>
  show "x = 0" using x_def by simp<br>
qed</p>
<p>This example results in "Local statement will fail to refine any pending<br>
goal" in line 4 of the proof. Furthermore, replacing line 3 with</p>
<p>def x == "0 :: nat"</p>
<p>makes everything work just fine. This is a minimal example built from a<br>
bigger proof where the witness used for proving the existential statement<br>
was an expression containing variables that originated in an obtain<br>
statement. From what I've observed so far, it appears that whenever<br>
variables from an obtain statement are part of the witness, the show<br>
statement fails. I've used [[show_types]] to confirm that the types aren't<br>
part of the issue, both x and 0 are of type nat. Also, the output doesn't<br>
give me the usual "Failed attempt to solve goal by exported rule" line<br>
stating why the show statement failed, as is the case with assume<br>
statements that don't match any assumption in the goal.</p>
<p>Of course I can work around this by invoking proof with the '-' method and<br>
using automation to prove the existentially quantified statement using the<br>
witness, but it'd be nicer if it'd work like this, I feel like this is just<br>
a minor technical issue, but I couldn't figure out what's going on.</p>
<p>I think I've also run into a similar problem that didn't involve obtain<br>
statements but I can't find the theory where that happened right now, maybe<br>
I'll post again if I run into that issue once more. For now, I'd be happy<br>
with figuring this one out.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
 Julian</p>

<p>This error message is not very helpful (and I seem to remember there <br>

<p>{ obtain x where "x = Suc 0" by auto<br>
     then have "x &gt; 0" by auto }</p>
<p>results in:</p>
<p>Result contains obtained parameters: x</p>
<p>This is due to the same reason. When you use "fix" or "def" to define a <br>
variable, they either get just generalized (i.e. turned into schematics) <br>
(fix) or replaced by their right hand side (definitions)<br>
when a block is closed / a show is performed.</p>
<p>This cannot be done for obtained variables.</p>

<p>A good scheme for proving such things is</p>
<p>lemma "EX x. P x"<br>
proof -<br>
   obtain x where &lt;...&gt;<br>

<p>From: Tobias Nipkow &lt;<a href="mailto:nipkow@in.tum.de">nipkow@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
The reason for this failure is consistency: when proving P(?x), you delay the<br>
point at which you give the actual witness t for ?x. But that is just an<br>
operational rearrangement of the proof. Logically it must be possible to<br>
construct that t right away. Hence t must not depend on anything that only came<br>
into existence while proving P(?x). Otherwise you could prove EX x. ALL y. x=y:</p>
<p>apply(rule exI)</p>
<ol>
<li>ALL y. ?x = y</li>
</ol>
<p>apply(rule allI)</p>
<ol>
<li>!!y. ?x = y</li>
</ol>
<p>apply(rule refl)</p>
<p>fails because you would need to instantiate ?x with the local y, which Isabelle<br>
prevents. (Contrast this with a proof of ALL x. EX y. x=y)</p>
<p>Your failed proof attempt was morally correct, but you need to convince the<br>
system that the witness could have been constructed up front, usually by<br>
rearranging your proof text, eg as Lars suggested.</p>

Hi Julian,</p>
<p>a further comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>theorem "EX x. x = (0 :: nat)"<br>
proof</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the statement to prove here contains a schematic variable ?x or such.<br>
This is something better to be avoided except for good reason.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

<p>It seems that I've destroyed that error messahe by accident in Jan-2009, <br>
but it is likely to work again in the coming release.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>
<p>theorem "EX x. x = (0 :: nat)"<br>

qed</p>

<p>BTW, a more compact way to write that wrong proof is this:</p>
<p>theorem "EX x. x = (0 :: nat)"<br>
proof<br>
   obtain x where "x = (0 :: nat)" by simp<br>
   then show ?this .<br>
qed</p>
<p>But that does not work for logical reasons, as has been pointed out <br>
before.  You cannot apply an obtained result with parameters to the <br>
enclosing goal.  This is also the deeper reason why there is 'have' for <br>
local results, and 'show' for local results that get exported into the <br>
enclosing goal context, but only 'obtain' and not 'obtain_show'.</p>
<p>(And you don't need to obtain local definitions in the first place, has <br>
has been said already.)</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Just for fun some further vacuous 'obtain' proofs:</p>
<p>notepad<br>
begin<br>
   obtain x where "x = (0 :: nat)" by (rule that) (rule refl)<br>
next<br>
   obtain x where "x == (0 :: nat)" by (rule that) (rule reflexive)<br>
next<br>
   obtain x where "x == (0 :: nat)" ..<br>
end</p>
<p>The last form works, because "that" is declared as Pure.intro, and Pure <br>
"reflexive" implicit (like assumption).</p>
<p>The better form is this:</p>
<p>def x == "0 :: nat"</p>
<p>Here the system does the reflexicity step for you, and it bypasses the <br>
full "may-assume-that-holds" mechanism of 'obtain', that involves the <br>
restriction on variable occurrences (as seen in the exE rule).</p>
