<p>This question might sound trivial to some people, but I have struggled <br>
with the problem over many years, to make it really really work -- <br>
robustly, efficiently, portably.</p>
<p>There is a brief sketch on "PIDE Protocol Layers" in my ITP-2014 paper:</p>
<p>Makarius Wenzel. Asynchronous User Interaction and Tool Integration in<br>
   Isabelle/PIDE. In G. Klein and R. Gamboa, editors, Interactive Theorem<br>
   Proving (ITP 2014). 2014. Springer, LNCS 8558.</p>
<p><a href="http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/papers/itp-pide.pdf">http://www4.in.tum.de/~wenzelm/papers/itp-pide.pdf</a></p>
<p>The relevant text is cited here for convenience:</p>
<p>\para{PIDE Protocol Layers.}  Conceptually, the two processes are<br>
   connected by two independent streams of \emph{protocol functions}.<br>
   These streams are essentially symmetric, but input from the editor<br>
   to the prover is called \emph{protocol command}, and output from the<br>
   prover to the editor is called \emph{protocol message}.<br>
   Syntactically, a protocol function consists of a name and argument<br>
   list (arbitrary strings).  Semantically, the stream of protocol<br>
   functions is applied consecutively to a private \emph{protocol<br>
   state} on each side; there are extensible tables in Isabelle/Scala<br>
   and Isabelle/ML to define the meaning for protocol functions.</p>
<p>The arguments of protocol functions usually consist of algebraic<br>
   datatypes (tuples and recursive variants). This well-known ML<br>
   concept is represented in Scala by case classes<br>
   \cite[\S7.2]{Scala:2004}.  The PIDE implementation starts out with<br>
   raw byte streams between the processes, then uses YXML transfer<br>
   syntax for untyped XML trees \cite[\S2.3]{Wenzel:2011:CICM}, and<br>
   finally adds structured XML/ML data representation via some<br>
   combinator library.  Further details are explained in<br>
   \cite{Wenzel:2013:CoqPIDE}, including a full implementation on a few<br>
   pages of OCaml; the Standard ML version is part of Isabelle/PIDE.<br>
   This elementary PIDE protocol stack is easily ported to other<br>
   functional languages to connect different back-ends, but actual<br>
   document-oriented interaction requires further reforms of the<br>
   prover.</p>
<p>See also the included fragment of some slides that explain that (and a bit <br>
more).</p>
<p>The citation Wenzel:2013:CoqPIDE is here: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6626">http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6626</a> <br>
-- it explains more things in a prover-agnostic fashion.</p>

<p>I don't think modularity in the Java ecosystem is significantly weaker<br>
than anywhere else. The problem with system integration in Isabelle is<br>
that Isabelle has "high gravity", i.e. it usually assumes that<br>
applications are centered around Isabelle. From that point of view, it<br>
also makes sense that Isabelle/Scala observes ML coding conventions wrt<br>
naming and architecture. With the rise of the document model, new<br>
applications become possible, some of which can't (or don't want to)<br>
adhere to that world view.</p>
<p>So far, I know of two major applications where significant development<br>
effort has been spent to integrate Isabelle into existing software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isabelle/Eclipse with Eclipse being the "center of the universe"</li>
<li>Clide [0] with a Play! web application</li>
</ul>
<p>(There's also Leon+Isabelle, but that was more of a "proof of concept".)</p>
<p>The Isabelle integration in Clide works almost exactly in the same way<br>
as libisabelle: They copied the Isabelle/Pure JAR into some suitable<br>
'lib' directory. (Taking a JAR instead of the full sources has the<br>
disadvantage that cross-compiling against different versions of Scala is<br>
ruled out, and that the Scala version for Clide must be the same as the<br>
Scala version for Isabelle.)</p>
<p>I think it is fair to say that we already have practical experience. It<br>
might be worth getting feedback from Clide's authors (not sure if they<br>
read this mailing list) [1].</p>
<p>But all this brings me back to my original point: Modularity. It would<br>
be entirely possible to ship an "official" JAR file with some metadata<br>
(in Java lingo: "artifact") to a repository. Integrating Isabelle into a<br>
Scala application then becomes a matter of one line in the build definition:</p>
<p>libraryDependencies += "de.tum.in.isabelle" %% "pide" % "2014"</p>
<p>Of course, the PIDE sources would need to be enriched with functionality<br>
to fetch an Isabelle distribution, unpack it, and build the required<br>
components in a way that doesn't require shell scripts or Perl. (I have<br>
that on my agenda.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't understand all low-level details myself, but a useful intuition<br>
is that the JVM spawns a prover process and then exchanges XML trees<br>
with it. This mechanism is extensible: Both processes speak a common<br>
protocol for process management (e.g. jEdit can tell the prover "here's<br>
an updated document", to which the prover replies "annotate this piece<br>
of text with a warning message"), but users can extend the communication<br>
with custom messages. These XML messages are transmitted via the<br>
intermediate "YXML" format which is a space-efficient representation of<br>
most of XML. A reasonable summary of this is "a custom IPC protocol".</p>
<p>The low-level implementation can be found in the files<br>
'System/system_channel.scala' and 'System/system_channel.ML'. In<br>
Isabelle2014, this is done with FIFOs or sockets (depending on the OS),<br>
but the current development version uses sockets exclusively.</p>
<blockquote>

and the *.ML files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conceptually, the Scala files are not required for running the prover<br>
process. They merely provide one way to interact with it. On the other<br>
side, the JVM process doesn't need the ML file to do whatever it's<br>
doing. Files of both languages could be separated without any problems<br>
(it wouldn't even complicate the build of Isabelle).</p>
<p>The reason why both sources are being kept together is because there's<br>
some symmetry which can be exploited. Some modules (e.g. XML processing,<br>
graph algorithms) are actually the same in both languages so that it<br>
makes sense to keep them together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But in</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/larsrh/libisabelle/tree/master/pide-core/src/main/scala">https://github.com/larsrh/libisabelle/tree/master/pide-core/src/main/scala</a></p>
<p>there are some directories from ~~/src/Pure/, and all of the copied <br>
directories contain exact copies of all the *.scala files and while <br>
dropping all *.ML files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could've just taken the 'Pure.jar' file unmodified from Isabelle and<br>
used that. There are two reasons against this:<br>
1) I wouldn't be able to cross-compile 'libisabelle' against different<br>
Scala versions, since 'Pure.jar' would be fixed to whatever Scala<br>
version is currently used in Isabelle.<br>
2) I would include some extra dependencies (e.g. Scala Swing) which are<br>
not needed for a non-GUI library.</p>
<p>I did that for my work on Isabelle integration with Leon, but figured<br>
that there ought to be a better way. Copying source files is also what<br>
Andrius Velykis did for isabelle-eclipse.</p>
