Is there supposed to be any sort of guarantee of consistency between a<br>
term A and the term B that results from printing A and then reading<br>
the result, when the "show types" option is off? I have found a case<br>
where the types in B are more general, in a way that caused problems<br>
trying to do a lemma. I can give more details if desired.</p>

Similar situations can also arise even when "show types" is on. This happens<br>
often if you use functions like "of_nat :: nat =&gt; 'a::semiring_1" or "of_int<br>
:: int =&gt; 'a::ring_1" that are polymorphic in the return type. For example,<br>
if you type "thm of_int_less_iff", you get:</p>
<p>"(of_int (?w::int) &lt; of_int (?z::int)) = (?w &lt; ?z)"</p>
<p>Even with "show sorts" enabled, you get no indication that this lemma<br>
applies only to class "ordered_idom".</p>
<p>I would say that the "show types" and "show sorts" options were designed<br>
solely for making terms easier for humans to parse; I don't think any<br>
guarantees about re-parsing by Isabelle were intended.</p>
<p>With the prevalence of Isar-style proofs nowadays, users are doing a lot<br>
more cut-and-paste from the goals buffer back into their proof scripts than<br>
they used to. Maybe it is time to add a new option, "show exactly enough<br>
type annotations for Isabelle to be able to re-parse terms". Maybe the other<br>
developers could comment on the feasibility of this?</p>

<p>'Fraid you are right, Brian. Although these options do help ;-)</p>

I thought a bit about this recently when fiddling with HOL4's<br>
pretty-printer.  In the absence of user code getting in the way, I<br>
believe you can do a reasonable job with the following algorithm:</p>
<p>* all variables get type annotations<br>
   * terms with constants at their head, and where the constant "might<br>
     be polymorphic" (see below) get their types printed as well if the<br>
     constant is applied to n arguments and there are type variables<br>
     that occur after the nth argument that don't appear in the first<br>
     n.</p>
<p>For example, K is a constant with type : 'a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'a.  If the<br>
     term is</p>
<p>K x</p>
<p>Then the term K x will get a type annotation because the 'b of the<br>
     term's type doesn't occur among the arguments that are present<br>
     (the x).  K itself will not get an annotation.</p>
<p>Nil, the empty list constant, would always get a type annotation<br>
     in this scheme.  In Isabelle, so too would constants like zero.<br>
     This is because they are never applied to any arguments, so their<br>
     polymorphism would always be left dangling.</p>
<p>The "might be polymorphic" test has to do with HOL4's overloading<br>
system.  Terms that are known to print with a form that can in turn<br>
parse back to multiple possible terms are considered polymorphic, even<br>
though they are not in fact polymorphic at all.</p>
<p>With user code about (users can dynamically update the parser/printer<br>
systems with their own code in both Isabelle and HOL4), all bets are<br>
off of course.</p>
