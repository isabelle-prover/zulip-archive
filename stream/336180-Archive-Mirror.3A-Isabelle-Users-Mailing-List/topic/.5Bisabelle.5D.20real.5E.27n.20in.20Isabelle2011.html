<p>No, I haven't tried it yet.  I keep changing my mind about how <br>
much work it might require to make my project work with <br>
Isabelle2011.  Perhaps I should just try it.</p>

<p>Either you rewrite your terms (which is mostly Search &amp;<br>
Replace) or you try to stay with the "real ^ 'n" constants and<br>
use the simplifier to rewrite them at each proof (but I'm not<br>
sure how well this approach works).</p>
<p>Alternatively we could try to add the real^'n version of all<br>
changed lemmas back (by specialising the lemmas about<br>
euclidean spaces).</p>

<p>I often think my work would have been simpler if Isabelle2011 <br>
existed when I started (in early 2009).  As well as the recent <br>
introduction of euclidean_space, the quotient types introduced in <br>
Isabelle2009-2 might have helped if they had existed earlier.  But <br>
Isabelle is still improving, so I'll just have to be glad that <br>
these features are available now, for future work.</p>

<p>When we introduced this changes I were not aware of any<br>
existing work using Multivariate_Analysis. Hence we did not<br>
care about backwards compatibility. But we can try to add<br>
compatibility lemmas so you can port your work to the next<br>
Isabelle release. Is your work available anywhere? Is it<br>
possible to take a look at it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My work is still a work in progress (for a Master's thesis), but <br>
if you want, I could send you off-list the current files, or <br>
perhaps I could try to figure out how to give you at least read-<br>
only access to my subversion repository.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
