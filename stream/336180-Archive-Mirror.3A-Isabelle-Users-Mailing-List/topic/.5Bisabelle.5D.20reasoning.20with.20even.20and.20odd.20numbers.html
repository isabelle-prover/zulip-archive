<p>From: Amarin Phaosawasdi &lt;<a href="mailto:phaosaw2@illinois.edu">phaosaw2@illinois.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>I have a series of short, related questions regarding reasoning with <br>
even and odd numbers.</p>
<p>There are a lot of examples on the inductive definitions of even <br>
numbers, such as the following from the book Concrete Semantics.</p>
<p>inductive ev :: "nat ⇒ bool" where<br>
ev0: "ev 0" |<br>
evSS: "ev n ⟹ ev (n + 2)"</p>
<p>Proving that 4 is even can be done like this.</p>
<p>lemmas four_is_even = evSS[OF evSS[OF ev0]]</p>
<p>lemma "ev (Suc(Suc(Suc(Suc 0))))"<br>
by (rule four_is_even[simplified])</p>
<p>Q1: Is there anyway to simplify "evSS[OF evSS[OF ev0]]" on the fly such <br>
that I don't need the lemma "four_is_even"?</p>
<p>Q2: I am not able to prove "ev 4". The closest that I got is this.</p>
<p>lemma "ev 4"<br>
apply (subgoal_tac "ev (0 + 2 + 2)")<br>
sorry</p>
<p>Simplification just yields "ev (Suc(Suc(Suc(Suc 0))))", not "ev 4".</p>
<p>How can I prove "ev 4"?</p>
<p>Q3: I also wanted to prove that "¬ev 1", so I tried modifying the <br>
inductive definition as follows.</p>
<p>inductive ev :: "nat ⇒ bool" where<br>
ev0: "ev 0" |<br>
evS: "¬ev n ⟹ ev (n + 1)" |<br>
evSS: "ev n ⟹ ev (n + 2)"</p>
<p>Isabelle told me that proof failed for the goal.<br>
mono (λp x. x = 0 ∨ (∃n. x = n + 1 ∧ ¬ p n) ∨ (∃n. x = n + 2 ∧ p n))</p>
<p>What's going on? If I can't define ev this way, what's the best way to <br>
prove "¬ev 1"</p>
<p>Maybe the questions weren't that short, sorry about that.</p>
<p>Any help on any of the questions are much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>
Amarin</p>

By ‘simplify’, you probably mean ‘derive automatically’. evSS[OF evSS[OF<br>
ev0]] is basically a ‘hand-crafted proof’ where you put together the<br>
existing lemmas by hand to derive a new lemma. Isabelle proof methods<br>
like simp and auto basically do the same thing automatically in the<br>
background.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have correctly deduced that the problem here is that in order to<br>
apply the introduction rules for ev (ev0 and evSS), the goal must be in<br>
the shape ‘ev 0’ or ‘ev (n + 2)’. This is what your subgoal_tac achieves.</p>
<p>When the goal /is/ in that shape, you can simply apply the introduction<br>
rules for ev to solve it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>apply (rule evSS)<br>
apply (rule evSS)<br>
apply (rule ev0)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or shorter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>apply (rule evSS ev0)+</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or even shorter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>apply (intro evSS ev0)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>apply (intro ev.intros)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma "ev 4"<br>
proof-<br>
  have "(4::nat) = 0 + 2 + 2" by simp<br>
  also have "ev (0 + 2 + 2)" by (intro ev.intros)<br>
  finally show ?thesis .<br>
qed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, as for the matter of getting from ‘4’ to ‘Suc (Suc (Suc (Suc 0)))’:<br>
the representation of numeral constants (such as 4) in Isabelle is a bit<br>
tricky for technical reasons. There is a collection of rewrite rules to<br>
convert something like ‘4’ into its ‘Suc’ notation. It is called<br>
eval_nat_numeral. If you write</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma "ev 4"<br>
apply (simp only: eval_nat_numeral)<br>
you get the new goal "ev (Suc (Suc (Suc (Suc 0))))". You can usually<br>
also use ‘simp add: eval_nat_numeral’, the ‘only’ just means that /only/<br>
the given rules will be applied, which can be useful sometimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that evSS cannot be applied then, because they want the<br>
form ‘ev (n + 2)’. Therefore, I would recommend to define the inductive<br>
differently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>inductive ev :: "nat ⇒ bool" where<br>
ev0: "ev 0" |<br>
evSS: "ev n ⟹ ev (Suc (Suc n))"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you can simply prove even ‘ev 1000’ easily:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma "ev 1000"<br>
  by (auto simp: eval_nat_numeral intro!: ev.intros)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, if you don't want to define the inductive differently,<br>
you could just prove a derived introduction rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma evSS': "ev n ⟹ ev (Suc (Suc n))"<br>
  using evSS by simp<br>
And then you can prove your lemmas with that.</p>

mono (λp x. x = 0 ∨ (∃n. x = n + 1 ∧ ¬ p n) ∨ (∃n. x = n + 2 ∧ p n))<br>
As far as I know: inductive definitions require the properties to be<br>
monotonic, i.e. among other things you can't have something like ‘¬ev n’<br>
anywhere in it. This is not an inductive property anymore, you could<br>
otherwise define something silly like ‘¬ev n ⟹ ev n’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless, you don't need this rule anyway. First of all, it is already<br>
subsumed by the other rules and secondly, it does not help you at all in<br>
proving ‘¬ev 1’. For that, ‘¬ev _’ would have to be on the right-hand<br>
side of the implication.</p>
<p>The way to prove ‘¬ev 1’ is by case distinction: if ‘ev 1’ were to hold,<br>
then either 1 = 0, which is obviously false, or 1 = Suc (Suc n), which<br>
is also obviously false. The idea here is that ev is the ‘smallest’<br>
predicate that fulfils the introduction rules given in its definition,<br>
so if ‘ev n’ cannot be derived by ev0 and evSS, it is false.</p>
<p>A simple way to do this case distinction is by using the simplification<br>
rules for ev, ev.simps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma "¬ev 1"<br>
  by (subst ev.simps) auto<br>
Using ev.simps with the ‘simp’ method is not a good idea because it will<br>
probably cause the simplifier to loop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For more complicated examples, you can prove the following (intuitively<br>
obvious) lemma:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma ev_imp_not_ev_Suc: "ev n ⟹ ¬ev (Suc n)"<br>
I will not give you the proof – it can be proven by induction over the<br>
inductive definition of ‘ev’ and I think it makes a nice exercise. You<br>
may also want to look up the ev.cases rule and the ‘inductive_cases’<br>
command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that lemma, if you want to prove that something is not even, you<br>
can just rewrite it to ‘Suc’ notation with ‘eval_nat_numeral’, apply<br>
ev_imp_not_ev_Suc, and thus reduce the problem to proving that the<br>
predecessor of the number is even – which you have already done.</p>
<p>As a side note: with the command ‘code_pred ev .’, you can generate<br>
executable code for the predicate ‘ev’. Then you can check evenness with<br>
‘value "ev 3"’ and even prove or disprove it by using the ‘eval’ method.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemma "ev 4" by eval<br>
lemma "¬ev 3" by eval<br>
Note that, for technical reasons, a proof involving ‘eval’ is arguably<br>
not as nice as a ‘normal’ proof.</p>

Other people have answered your questions in detail, but I just wanted to stress one point about inductive definitions. They give you rules for building up the elements of a set (equivalently, for constructing elements were a predicate is true), but the negative cases are implicit. Therefore, once you have defined the notion of even, you have also defined the notion of odd. And inductive references in the rules can only be positive. You should regard the rules as stating “0 is even”; “if N is even then so is N 2”; "there are no other even numbers”. A statement such as “if N is odd then N+1 is even” should be provable.</p>

I definitely learned a lot here. Thanks.<br>
Here's one way I did it.</p>
<p>lemma suc0:"¬ev (Suc 0)"<br>
by (subst ev.simps, simp)</p>
<p>lemma sucSS:"⋀n. ev n ⟹ ¬ ev (Suc n) ⟹ ¬ ev (Suc (Suc (Suc n)))"<br>

<p>lemma "ev n ⟹ ¬ev (Suc n)"<br>
by (induction rule: ev.induct) (simp add: suc0 sucSS)+</p>
<p>The other way, as you hinted, was adding the elimination rules so that <br>
auto can use them.</p>
<p>inductive_cases evE[elim!]: "ev n"<br>
lemma "ev n ⟹ ¬ev (Suc n)"<br>
by (induction rule: ev.induct) auto</p>
<p>I'm a little curious though.</p>
<p>How did evE[elim!] help me with, for example, "¬ev (Suc 0)"?</p>
<p>As you can see above, without evE, I would prove it as follows.</p>
<p>lemma "¬ev (Suc 0)"<br>
by (subst ev.simps, simp)</p>
<p>But with it, I can simply do.</p>
<p>lemma "¬ev (Suc 0)"<br>
by auto</p>
<p>How would I prove "¬ev (Suc 0)" using evE (or ev.cases) explicitly the <br>
way that auto is presumably using behind the scenes?</p>

<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href="mailto:eberlm@in.tum.de">eberlm@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hallo,</p>
<p>The typical way of proving negations is by assuming the statement holds<br>
and deriving False. You can do<br>
this with the rule notI:</p>
<p>lemma "¬ev (Suc 0)"<br>
    apply (rule notI)</p>
<p>This leaves you with</p>
<p>goal (1 subgoal):</p>
<p>1. ev (Suc 0) ⟹ False</p>
<p>Now you can use evE to perform a case distinction on ‘ev (Suc 0)’: if<br>
‘ev (Suc 0)’ holds, it was either derived by ev0 (in which case ‘Suc 0’<br>
would have to be ‘0’) or it was derived by evSS (in which case ‘Suc 0’<br>
would have to be ‘Suc (Suc n)’ for some n). Both are trivially false and<br>
can be discharged by ‘simp_all’.</p>
<p>lemma "¬ev (Suc 0)"<br>
    apply (rule notI)<br>
    apply (erule evE)<br>
    apply simp_all<br>
    done</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that your evE is the same as the<br>
automatically-proved ev.cases. inductive_cases is for deriving more<br>
specialised elimination rules, i.e. ones where you don't have ‘ev n’,<br>
but something more restricted, such as ‘ev 0’ or ‘ev (Suc n)’ or ‘ev<br>
(Suc (Suc n))’. inductive_cases simply uses the ev.cases rule and<br>
performs some simplification on it. In your case, you could do the<br>
following:</p>
<p>inductive_cases evS: "ev (Suc n)"</p>
<p>Then, in the above proof of ‘¬ev (Suc 0)’, you applying the elimination<br>
rule would leave you with the goal ‘Suc 0 = 0’. In this case, it doesn't<br>
make much difference though – you might as well just use ev.cases.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to say that declaring rules as elimination rules<br>
([elim]), especially safe ones ([elim!]) should be done with care. The<br>
evE rule you defined is probably not a good choice for an automatic<br>
elimination rule, since it doesn't always make the goal ‘simpler’ and<br>
can be applied infinitely often, blowing the goal up indefinitely. In<br>
these examples, it all works out, but in more complicated ones, auto<br>
(and force, blast, etc.) might loop because of it, applying the rule<br>
infinitely often.</p>

<p>Is there a difference between using a proof vs adding it to simp like this?</p>

<p>Yes, with "using" the fact becomes part of the proof state and is simplified itself.</p>
