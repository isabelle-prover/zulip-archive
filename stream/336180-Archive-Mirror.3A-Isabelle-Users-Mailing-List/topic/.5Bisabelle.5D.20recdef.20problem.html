<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:christian.sternagel@uibk.ac.at">christian.sternagel@uibk.ac.at</a>&gt;<br>
In <code>Isabelle/HOL - A Proof Assistant for Higher-Order Logic' ([1] in the following) </code>recdef' is used to define functions for the datatype</p>
<p>datatype ('v,'f)"term" =<br>
    Var 'v<br>
  | Fun 'f "('v,'f)term list"</p>
<p>For me it gets interesting as soon as higher-order functions can be used to define functions with `recdef'. In [1] there is following example:</p>
<p>consts trev :: "('v,'f)term =&gt; ('v,'f)term"<br>
 recdef trev "measure size"<br>
  "trev (Var x) = Var x"<br>
  "trev (Fun f ts) = Fun f (rev (map trev ts))"</p>
<p>which could be proved terminating after the hint </p>
<p>t : set ts --&gt; size t &lt; Suc (term_list_size ts)</p>
<p>I wanted to define following function (which gives the set of positions of a term---where a position is a possibly empty list of natural numbers):</p>
<p>consts pos :: "('v,'f)term =&gt; nat list set"<br>
  recdef pos "measure (% t. size t)"<br>
   "pos (Var v) = {[]}"<br>
   "pos (Fun f ts) = <br>
    {[]} Un {(i#p) | i p. i : {0..&lt;length ts} &amp; p : pos (ts!i)}"</p>
<p>which is not possible automatically because of the unsolved goal:</p>
<p>\&lt;forall&gt; :001 ts. size (ts ! :001) &lt; Suc (term_list_size ts)</p>
<p>now my questions:<br>
1) what does :001 mean (I just assumed its the index variable i from my definition).<br>
2) why is the information i : {0..&lt;length ts} lost, which would make the unsolved goal equivalent to: </p>
<p>t : set ts --&gt; size t &lt; Suc (term_list_size ts)</p>
<p>3) is it possible to do a termination proof for a recdef definition fully by hand in order to make sure, that i : {0..&lt;length ts} is used?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>cheers</p>

<p>It's an internal variable produced by the simplifier. I am not sure why<br>
you get to see this strange name, but reading it as "i" is probably just<br>
right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) why is the information i : {0..&lt;length ts} lost, which would make  <br>
 the unsolved goal equivalent to:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are missing a congruence rule here. Congruence rules are needed for recdef<br>
to know at which values the recursive call actually occurs. In your  <br>
example, the<br>
following congruence rule for conjunction helps:</p>
<p>lemma conj_cong[recdef_cong]:<br>
   "[| A = A'; A' ==&gt; B = B' |] ==&gt; A &amp; B = A' &amp; B' "<br>
by blast</p>
<p>In the second premise, you see the hypothesis A'. This gives you the  <br>
extra hypothesis for the termination proof.</p>
<p>You can see congruence rules as if they express something about evaluation<br>
order, which is not otherwise defined, since we're just doing logic. By giving<br>
this congruence rule to recdef you state (and have proved) that the  <br>
second part of the conjunction only relevant if the first part is  <br>
satisfied. In the tutorial<br>
(end of 9.2.2) this is only mentioned briefly, but the example given  <br>
there works<br>
out-of-the-box, because the map_cong rule is there already (and  <br>
conj_cong should<br>
probably also be). In general you need a suitable congruence rule for every<br>
higher-order combinator you use in the definition.</p>
<p>You can see the preconfigured congruence rules by issuing</p>
<p>ML "RecdefPackage.print_recdefs (the_context ())"</p>
<p>By looking at some of them you will quickly learn how to make your own ones if<br>
you need them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3) is it possible to do a termination proof for a recdef definition   <br>
fully by hand in order to make sure, that i : {0..&lt;length ts} is used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes you can, by a largely unkown feature:</p>
<p>Issue your recdef definition using the "permissive" keyword:</p>
<p>recdef (permissive) pos ....</p>
<p>Then the defintion goes through, but the unproven termination  <br>
conditions end up as premises of the pos.simps rules:</p>
<p>thm pos.simps</p>
<p>Then you can set up a manual proof by</p>
<p>recdef_tc abc: pos</p>
<p>and when you have finished the proof, the lemmas will be stored as "abc". You<br>
will still have to remove the premises manually from pos.simps though.</p>
<p>The above information is for Isabelle 2005. In the developer snapshot  <br>
you would<br>
instead use the new "function" package. There, handling termination proofs is<br>
easier and can be done manually, but the issue with congruence rules remains.</p>
<p>Hope this helps...</p>
<p>Alex</p>
