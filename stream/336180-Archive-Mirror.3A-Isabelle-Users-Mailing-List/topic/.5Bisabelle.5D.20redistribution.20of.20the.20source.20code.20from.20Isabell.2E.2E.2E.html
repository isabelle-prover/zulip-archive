<p>From: mailing-list anonymous &lt;<a href="mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear All,</p>
<p>I have a soft question related to the redistribution of the source code<br>
from the library HOL. Hopefully, my understanding/interpretation of the<br>
legalese involved is correct. However, I would like to confirm<br>
my understanding with someone more knowledgeable.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that HOL is a part of Isabelle and, therefore, it is<br>
distributed under the terms of the BSD license. Thus, if I am not mistaken,<br>
I can amend and redistribute any code from HOL under a compatible license<br>
(e.g. LGPL v3), provided that the file COPYRIGHT that is located in the top<br>
directory of Isabelle is included together with the amended files from HOL.<br>
Is it acceptable to rename the file COPYRIGHT (e.g. to COPYRIGHT-ISABELLE)?<br>
Does it need to be located in the top directory of the project that<br>
contains the amended file(s)? Are there any other files that I should<br>
include? Should I provide any additional information?</p>
<p>As a side note, I would like to mention that my intention is merely to<br>
include some of the source code from several files that are located in<br>
"HOL/Types_To_Sets/Examples" (with certain amendments) in my personal<br>
project that is licensed under LGPL v3.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
