Dear All:</p>
<p>Suppose you have two Isabelle theories, T1.thy and T2.thy, and you<br>
want to check which axioms of T2 are provable in T1, and, conversely,<br>
which axioms of T1 are provable in T2.</p>
<p>To make things simpler, let's suppose both theories are written in the<br>
same signature (containing thus constructors identified by the same<br>
strings, but possibly characterized by different sets of rules), and<br>
are based on the same formalism (say, both are formulated as sequent<br>
calculi, or in natural deduction).  The case where the theories have<br>
different constructors is also interesting, however, if T1 and T2 are<br>
intended for instance to be two different axiomatizations of the same<br>
theory (T1 could be, say, a formulation of classical logic over<br>
negation, conjunction and disjunction, while T2 could be classical<br>
logic over implication and co-implication).</p>
<p>One way of accomplishing this task, of course, is typing the axioms of<br>
T2 by hand as goals inside T1 and proving them, and vice-versa<br>
(appropriate rewrite rules could be added somewhere to take care of<br>
the case with different constructors).  Another obvious way is to<br>
write a new theory T0 containing the axioms and definitions of both T1<br>
and T2 and doing proofs there with some care not to mix axioms with<br>
"different origins".</p>
<p>My question is: Is there a more "natural" way of doing this in Isabelle?<br>
(What I have in mind is some way of referring to the axioms of T2<br>
directly from inside T1, or referring to the axioms of both theories,<br>
in turn, from "outside" them.)</p>
<p>The next step will be then to prove things by induction using theory<br>
T1 as the "meta-theory" of T2, that is, proving properties of T2 by<br>
induction using the properties and axioms of T1 as facts.<br>
How can that be smoothly done inside Isabelle without "dirty tricks"?<br>
(Do consider that the axioms of both theories might have similar<br>
names, and some of them might even coincide, independently of their<br>
particular names.)</p>
<p>I thank you in advance for your practical advice on this issue,<br>
Joao Marcos</p>

I'm afraid that Isabelle does not interpret these activities directly on<br>
the level of theories. If you want to show implicational relations<br>
between axiomatizations, Isabelle's locales are probably a good<br>
framework. If you need to take the inductive definition of derivability<br>
into account, you need to set up your own inductive definition of the<br>
different logics involved.</p>

A somewhat similar question relates to axiomatic type classes.</p>
<p>It is possible to define two type classes (defining them unrelated to <br>
each other, and in two theories which are independent of each other).</p>
<p>Then, in a supertheory which sees both type class definitions, it is <br>
possible to express and prove that one type class is a subclass of the <br>
other (by the &lt;-form of the instance command).  Unfortunately it is not <br>
possible to express (except, I guess, in two independent theories) that <br>
type class a &lt; type class b, and vice versa - understandably, Isabelle <br>
doesn't like cyclic subclass relationships.</p>

In contrast, locales permit cyclic relationships.  That is, if two  <br>
locales have equivalent specifications and the parameters are the  <br>
same (up to renaming) you can declare them to interpret each other.</p>
