Hi Lars,</p>
<p>with great interest I studied your code [1] (cited below), followed the <br>
function calls into <del>/src/Pure/System, </del>/src/Pure/PIDE etc and tried <br>
to understand.</p>
<p>So far I understood, that<br>
(1) Session.protocol_handler starts a persistent session<br>
(2) Isabelle_Process.protocol_command takes a string list, interpretes <br>
the strings, accordingly executes a predefined collection of ML <br>
functions and returns results as strings.</p>
<p>However, I could not yet find out, how to use isabelle_process or the <br>
isabelle wrapper (or what else?) to feed the strings such that they <br>
drive (1) and (2).</p>
<p>Could you, please, help once more?</p>

Hello,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So far I understood, that<br>

</blockquote>
<p>it works in the opposite direction. The JVM process spins up a prover<br>
process. Then, the protocol is initialized and both sides "register"<br>
some handler for bidirectional communication. That is,<br>
"Session.protocol_handler" tells the JVM that the specified class should<br>
receive messages from the prover.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) Isabelle_Process.protocol_command takes a string list, interpretes<br>
the strings, accordingly executes a predefined collection of ML<br>
functions and returns results as strings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"protocol_command" is in some sense "dual" to "protocol_handler": it<br>
tells the prover that the specified function should receive messages<br>
from the JVM. You're correct in that the function is called with some<br>
strings and can then do whatever is necessary. However, it does not<br>
actually return anything.</p>
<p>Bi-directional communication in the PIDE model is message-driven. That<br>
means that sending data has a "fire and forget" semantics: It<br>
immediately returns and there's no waiting for a reply or anything. Both<br>
JVM and prover can send messages to each other at any point in time.</p>
<p>In the sources, you can see that the "exec" function actually always<br>
sends a reply, but does so via "protocol_message", which generates a new<br>
message which is completely independent from the one the handler<br>
received earlier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, I could not yet find out, how to use isabelle_process or the<br>
isabelle wrapper (or what else?) to feed the strings such that they<br>
drive (1) and (2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As written above, your JVM application drives the whole process. You<br>
invoke the appropriate functions for starting up the prover, load the<br>
"Isac" section where your handler is waiting for input. Then you can<br>
send messages to your handler.</p>
<p>I hope that sheds some light onto the somewhat delicate procedure. We<br>
could definitely do with more documentation on the system integration<br>
aspect of Isabelle/Scala (which would presumably go into system.pdf,<br>
whose chapter on that topic is very sparse). I reckon that with the<br>
removal of "isabelle tty", more applications of Isabelle/Scala will emerge.</p>

<p>Isabelle/Scala is indeed the main system programming language for <br>
Isabelle, so the manual should say more about it.  The reason why so <br>
little Isabelle/Scala is in the manuals is that code snippets cannot be <br>
formally checked, as is done for Isabelle/ML. Without formal checking, it <br>
is pointless to make examples, because they will stop working in no time,<br>
after the next round of refinements of the system implementation.</p>

<p>Probably yes, and for two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Without the TTY baggage it becomes more feasible to introduce formal<br>
       Isabelle/Scala checking in the documentation, in the sense above.</p>
<p>(2) Removal of obsolete things makes people active, who are still using<br>
       very old archeological layers of the system.  Actual use of new<br>
       programming interfaces always helps to make them more smooth and<br>
       easier to use.</p>
<p>The Isabelle process protocol concepts covered here are in fact already <br>
quite well-established and polished for some years. So now is the right <br>
time to convert old applications, and to forget that there was ever a TTY <br>
loop in Isabelle.</p>

Indeed.</p>
<p>What could be done is writing a minimal PIDE application demonstrating<br>
bi-directional communication, possibly in the style of literate<br>

<p>From: Cezary Kaliszyk &lt;<a href="mailto:cezarykaliszyk@gmail.com">cezarykaliszyk@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Walther,</p>
<p>There is also a different approach to simulating the TTY/ProofGeneral<br>
interaction with Isabelle.</p>
<p>I have written a small 20-line script that lets me imitate<br>
minimal Isar-interaction via isabelle-console. It only allows<br>
sending single lines to Isabelle, there is no "back" or error<br>
handling, but this is enough for simple sending of commands to<br>
Isabelle and analysing their outputs.</p>
<p>The reason why I use this script, is because I use Isabelle<br>
on a headless server. It has enough memory to do bigger<br>
experiments, but I cannot run graphical applications there,<br>
in particular I cannot run PIDE. As ProofGeneral and TTY<br>
support have been removed, I needed to implement some minimal<br>
interaction, and the minimum, following the indispensable<br>
help from Makarius is:</p>
<p>The script runs:<br>
  "isabelle console",<br>
Then sends it:<br>
  "val s = Toplevel.toplevel;"<br>
And for every line of user input sends:<br>
  "val s = fold (Toplevel.command_exception true) (Outer_Syntax.parse<br>
Position.start \"%s\") s;"</p>
<p>I suppose this could be extended to support a "go-back" or even<br>
some more complicated protocol like the one from ProofGeneral<br>
which I presume you are currently using.</p>
<p>Attached, sorry for yet another programming language, but the<br>
above should explain it.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Cezary<br>

Dear Cezary,</p>
<p>thank you for the surprising mini-solution ...</p>
<p>... we have an even simpler protocol than ProofGeneral, so your solution <br>
would be quite appropriate for a quick shortcut.</p>

solution via Isabelle/Scala would be beyond our present resources.</p>

Lars,</p>
<p>thank you for the helpful explanations.</p>
<p>Now I studied [2] and see, that this scala colde establishes the other <br>
side for communication with Session.protocol_handler and <br>
Isabelle_Process.protocol_command from [1].<br>
So I prepare to adapt both [1]+[2] for Isac and come back to your <br>
discussion with Makarius:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My impression in<br>
the past 7 years was that these things do change between major releases<br>
of Scala, and direct Java access is not properly supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed. The only guarantee is calling Java from Scala, and even that<br>
breaks from time to time because of mismatches between their type systems.<br>
;-(( we need to call Scala from Java</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Isabelle/Scala attitude towards that problem is to ask users to<br>
write their own little Scala module to access the PIDE infrastructure,<br>
and expose it to an existing Java program, if they really have to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. If there are only a handful of different commands which need to<br>
be supported, such a wrapper seems to be the best idea. But even then,<br>
one needs to think about whether the interaction is supposed to be<br>
asynchronous, because Java is lacking in that regard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to start with a minimal solution, I'd like to bypass <br>
asynchronous interaction (which is no restriction on Isac's present <br>
solution).</p>
<p>First question: what is your experience with NetBeans versus Eclipse in <br>
projects combining Java and Scala?</p>

The problem posed here is technically trivial, i.e. a non-problem.  It is <br>
just a matter to overcome old ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>Isabelle/Scala is well-established as the main system programming <br>
interface for several years.  When you want to connect to some Isabelle <br>
prover process, the Scala APIs are the way to do it.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, it will be no longer possible to use the Isabelle process at <br>
all, without the Scala process around it.  The remaining TTY loop was <br>
hindering important reforms long enough.  After Isabelle2014 it is no <br>
longer there, without any traces of it left.</p>
<p>Then it becomes possible to assume that things like Invoke_Scala.method <br>
work in Isabelle/ML all the time, and many problems from the past can be <br>
resolved in the proper way.  (E.g. a brushed-up version of document <br>
preparation.)</p>

<p>Asynchronous interaction is already the minimal solution.  It is simpler <br>
than synchronous interaction in many ways.</p>
<p>Just give up the notion that you are mutating an implicit "current state". <br>
You can easily pass around explicit handles to immutable values that are <br>

manner.</p>

<p>Last time I used NetBeans with Scala was in 2010. It was quite unstable,<br>
and when I revisited it a couple of months ago, the situation has not<br>
improved significantly.</p>
<p>IntelliJ is good, but implements its own type checker for Scala which<br>
may or may not agree with the official Scala compiler. I found its "type<br>
aware" highlighting annoying to use because of spurious error markers.</p>
<p>The recommended IDE to use with Scala/Java is Eclipse. It is<br>
commercially supported from Typesafe and should be stable enough. I<br>
don't have practical experience with it, though.</p>

We did not engage for "Remaining uses of Proof General" because we hope <br>
for easy ways to replace "isabelle tty" in our prototype, and because we <br>
look forward to replace our self-made front-end by Isabelle/jEdit as <br>
soon as Isabelle goes collaboration and includes session management.</p>
<p>Until Isabelle2013-2, our prototype had the communication between its <br>
front-end (client) in Java and its mathematics-engine (server) in <br>
Isabelle/ML via stdin/stdout of the server process:</p>
<p>(a) Java started the server by<br>
      "isabelle tty -l Isac"<br>
(b) the first text line written to stdin was<br>
      "theory TTY_Communication imports Build_Isac begin"<br>
(c) the client requests were ML functions   f : a1 -&gt; .. -&gt; an -&gt; unit<br>
      written to stdin as text "ML {* f a1 .. an *}"<br>
(d) the functions f wrote data in XML-format, which was read from stdout<br>
      by a Java XML parser.</p>
<p>We want to invest into replacement of this outdated communication the <br>
more, the closer Isabelle comes to a session management. So presently <br>
our questions are</p>
<p>(1) Is the code around the removed "isabelle tty" already stable enough <br>
to start replacement of "isabelle tty" in our project now ?<br>
(2) If "yes", what are the options to replace the above (a..d) "isabelle <br>
tty" communication in our prototype ? Where should we start to look to <br>
in the Isabelle code ?</p>
<p>We are aware, that the above questions are at the borderline of this <br>
mailing list's scope --- so we are really grateful for any help!</p>

Hello,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(d) the functions f wrote data in XML-format, which was read from<br>
stdout by a Java XML parser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>firstly, I'm going to assume that your front end is running on the JVM.</p>
<p>I did something highly relevant in August, when I was visiting Viktor<br>
Kuncak's group at EPFL. There, I integrated Isabelle into their existing<br>
system which was written in Scala.</p>
<p>This was really easy, because the protocol with which the prover and<br>
Isabelle/jEdit communicate is exposed as a somewhat stable API. By<br>
putting a specific JAR file ("Pure.jar" somewhere in $ISABELLE_HOME) in<br>
your client's classpath, you have access to all the necessary<br>
functionality (i.e. spawning up a prover, sending protocol messages etc.).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) Java started the server by<br>
     "isabelle tty -l Isac"<br>
(b) the first text line written to stdin was<br>
     "theory TTY_Communication imports Build_Isac begin"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be trivially done with the above mechanism. You can even<br>
trigger the build of the "Isac" session first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(c) the client requests were ML functions   f : a1 -&gt; .. -&gt; an -&gt; unit<br>
     written to stdin as text "ML {* f a1 .. an *}"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is more interesting. Is the scope of what these functions do<br>
limited, or can the user somehow specify arbitrary functions?</p>
<p>If the scope is limited, then you can do something like [1] and treat<br>
the prover process as some sort of "REPL" which only understands a fixed<br>
set of commands and acts accordingly. Notably, the support of multiple<br>
clients in a single Isabelle session is almost trivial.</p>
<p>If not, there should be a way to make it work (after all, an ML block is<br>
a regular command), but I can't offer any concrete advice there, except<br>
maybe studying the implementation of the ML and ML_val commands in Isar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) Is the code around the removed "isabelle tty" already stable enough<br>

</blockquote>
<p>I would say yes, even though a canonical discipline on how to write an<br>
application using only a minimal subset of the features of PIDE has not<br>
emerged yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) If "yes", what are the options to replace the above (a..d) "isabelle<br>
tty" communication in our prototype ? Where should we start to look to<br>
in the Isabelle code ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other relevant bit in the code I wrote at EPFL is [2], although it<br>
is cluttered with rather ad hoc session management required by the<br>
system I was integrating with. If you're inclined, I can put together a<br>
smaller example which should be sufficient to demonstrate the general<br>
patterns.</p>
<p>There's one caveat left: All of the above presumes that using Scala is<br>
not a problem. It's certainly possible to do all of the above with Java,<br>
although I guess it's going to be rather verbose syntactically.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Lars</p>

That is the old question of accessing a Scala library from Java.</p>
<p>You probably understand yourself more about the Scala compiler and its <br>
representation of Scala things on the JVM than I do.  My impression in the <br>
past 7 years was that these things do change between major releases of <br>
Scala, and direct Java access is not properly supported.</p>
<p>The Isabelle/Scala attitude towards that problem is to ask users to write <br>
their own little Scala module to access the PIDE infrastructure, and <br>
expose it to an existing Java program, if they really have to.  In some <br>
sense, Isabelle/jEdit does the same, because jEdit is just another Java <br>
program.</p>
<p>Big commercial frameworks like Akka advertize dual Java and Scala APIs, <br>
but that is not for free -- it was implemented like that from the start <br>
(with the intention to make money in the Java market).</p>

<p>Indeed. The only guarantee is calling Java from Scala, and even that<br>
breaks from time to time because of mismatches between their type systems.</p>

<p>Exactly. If there are only a handful of different commands which need to<br>
be supported, such a wrapper seems to be the best idea. But even then,<br>
one needs to think about whether the interaction is supposed to be<br>
asynchronous, because Java is lacking in that regard.</p>
