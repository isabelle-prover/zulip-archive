<p>Title: Smallfoot: Static Assertion Checking for C programs</p>
<p>Salary: £22,870 - £33,330 inclusive of London Allowance per annum</p>
<p>Deadline for Applications: 28th July 2006</p>
<p>A postdoctoral Research Fellowship is available in the Department of<br>
Computing to work with Cristiano Calcagno and Philippa Gardner on an<br>
EPSRC project joint with Peter O'Hearn at Queen Mary. This is a fixed<br>
term post of 3 years starting on 1 October 2006 with some flexibility.<br>
The aim of the project is to develop a static assertion checker for C<br>
based on separation logic, and demonstrate it on systems code such as a<br>
memory manager. See<br>
<a href="http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/research/logic/theory/projects/smallfoot/">http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/research/logic/theory/projects/smallfoot/</a> for<br>
more details.</p>
<p>Applicants must hold, or being nearing completion of, a PhD in Computer<br>
Science in a relevant subject. Preference will be given to applicants<br>
with a proven record in software development or theoretical computer<br>
science. Experience in one or more of the following is desirable: logic<br>
(especially separation logic), verification, program analysis, model<br>
checking.</p>
<p>Formal applications should be sent to the address at the end of this<br>
message. Please send informal enquiries to</p>

<p>Background of the Project</p>
<hr>
<p>Pointers have long been one of the dark corners of programming<br>
languages. Tractable proof and analysis tools are lacking for all but<br>
the most simple, shallow, properties of the program heap. A recent<br>
theory, separation logic, has shed fresh light on this area, and has<br>
generated considerable interest worldwide. It has lead to much simpler<br>
by-hand specifications and program proofs than previous formalisms, and<br>
it suggests, for the first time, the possibility of scalable analysis<br>
methods for expressive heap properties. To date though, separation logic<br>
remains mainly a theoretical advance; there are no tools based on<br>
separation logic for any real programming languages.<br>
We propose to develop a static assertion checker for C based on<br>
separation logic. Separation logic works naturally with a low-level RAM<br>
model, and thus appears to be well suited to code that must run close to<br>
the hardware without an intermediate abstraction of the kind found in<br>
the runtimes of high-level languages such as ML or Java. Much<br>
fundamental code of this sort is written in the C programming language,<br>
and is outside the effective range of current tools.<br>
Our tool, Smallfoot, will accept precondition and postcondition<br>
assertions written in separation logic, and programs will be checked<br>
using a combination of symbolic execution and specialized proof<br>
procedures. Abstract interpretation will be used to alleviate the need<br>
to state invariants. We will check structural integrity properties of<br>
programs -- such as that data structures are in consistent states, or<br>
that resource boundaries are respected -- rather than full functional<br>
correctness. In this way we hope to keep specifications simple, and to<br>
achieve a high degree of automation. As it is aimed at low-level<br>
programs, Smallfoot will be complementary to static assertion checkers<br>
for higher-level languages such as the ESC tool for Java and the Spec#<br>
tool for C#.<br>
Success on the problems in this project could have a significant impact<br>
on the use of logic to check properties of systems programs.</p>
