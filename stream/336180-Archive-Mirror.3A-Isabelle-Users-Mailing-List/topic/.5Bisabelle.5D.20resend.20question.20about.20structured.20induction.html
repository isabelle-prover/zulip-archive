Sorry for just sending an incomplete message.</p>
<p>In the following example (taken from<br>
~~/src/HOL/Induct/Common_Patterns.thy) there is apparently unnecessary<br>
duplication.</p>
<p>lemma<br>
 fixes n :: nat<br>
 shows "P n" and "Q n"<br>
proof (induct n)<br>
 case 0 case 1<br>
 show "P 0" sorry<br>
next<br>
 case 0 case 2<br>
 show "Q 0" sorry<br>
next<br>
 case (Suc n) case 1<br>
 note hyps = <code>P n</code> <code>Q n</code>              (<strong>** this line ... </strong>**)<br>
 show "P (Suc n)" sorry<br>
next<br>
 case (Suc n) case 2<br>
 note hyps = <code>P n</code> <code>Q n</code>              (<strong>** ... duplicated </strong>*)<br>
 show "Q (Suc n)" sorry<br>
qed</p>
<p>I want to know how to avoid this duplication.  I have the common example</p>
<p>lemma<br>

shows "Q1 x" and "Q2 x"<br>
using h proof (induct)<br>
  (case ...) case 1 have "P x0" by fact show "Q1 x0" ...<br>
                case 2 have "P x0" by fact show "Q2 x0" ...</p>
<p>I want to eliminate the duplication in the last two lines.</p>
<p>In fact, playing with examples shows that</p>
<p>lemma<br>

         case 1 have j:"P x0" by fact<br>

<p>works.  I don't understand the scoping of facts in this example.</p>

<p>I think I understand your problem now. Did you mean to say, "using h j<br>
proof (induct)" above?</p>
<p>Here is another example adapted from HOL/Induct/Common_Patterns.thy;<br>
I've added the extra assumption "C n" which is added to the inductive<br>
hypothesis. At the point of "case (Suc n)", you might like to be able<br>
to use the assumption "C (Suc n)" to derive some other facts, and use<br>
those in both subcases 1 and 2. The problem is that the "case" command<br>
does not assume "C (Suc n)" for you until you get all the way down to<br>
the subcases.</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  fixes n :: nat<br>
  assumes "C n"<br>
  shows "A n ==&gt; P n"<br>
    and "B n ==&gt; Q n"<br>
using <code>C n</code> proof (induct n)<br>
  case 0<br>
  {<br>
    case 1 note <code>A 0</code> show "P 0" sorry<br>
  next<br>
    case 2 note <code>B 0</code> show "Q 0" sorry<br>
  }<br>
next<br>
  case (Suc n)<br>
  note <code>A n ==&gt; C n ==&gt; P n</code><br>
    and <code>B n ==&gt; C n ==&gt; Q n</code><br>
  (<strong>* <code>C (Suc n)</code> has not been assumed yet at this point </strong>*)<br>
  {<br>
    case 1<br>
    note <code>A (Suc n)</code> and <code>C (Suc n)</code><br>
    show "P (Suc n)" sorry<br>
  next<br>
    case 2<br>
    note <code>B (Suc n)</code> and <code>C (Suc n)</code><br>
    show "Q (Suc n)" sorry<br>
  }<br>
qed</p>
<p>I can think of two solutions, one of which you already discovered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, playing with examples shows that</p>
<p>lemma<br>
assumes h:"inductiveR x" and j:"P x"<br>
shows "Q1 x" and "Q2 x"<br>
using h proof (induct)<br>
 (case ...x0...)                  (<strong> the fact "P x0" is not known here </strong>)<br>
        case 1 have j:"P x0" by fact<br>
                   show "Q1 x0" proof (... j ...)<br>
        case 2 show "Q2 x0" proof (... j ...)  (<strong> why is j in scope here? </strong>)</p>
<p>works.  I don't understand the scoping of facts in this example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By omitting the "next" between subcases 1 and 2, Isabelle doesn't<br>
reset the proof context, so "j" is still in scope. This technique<br>
wouldn't work for my example above though, since when you use two<br>
"case" commands without using "next" in between, you get a proof<br>
context that is essentially the union of the two cases. Here the<br>
second subcase fails because too many assumptions are in scope.</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  fixes n :: nat<br>
  assumes "C n"<br>
  shows "A n ==&gt; P n"<br>
    and "B n ==&gt; Q n"<br>
using <code>C n</code><br>
proof (induct n)<br>
  case (Suc n)<br>
  case 1<br>
    note <code>A (Suc n)</code> and <code>C (Suc n)</code><br>
    show "P (Suc n)" sorry<br>
  case 2<br>
    note <code>C (Suc n)</code> and <code>C (Suc n)</code><br>
    show "Q (Suc n)" (*** error because assumption <code>A (Suc n)</code> is<br>
still in scope ***)</p>
<p>Solution 2: If the "case" command doesn't make the necessary<br>
assumptions early enough for you, you can always "assume" them<br>
yourself, like this:</p>
<p>lemma<br>
  fixes n :: nat<br>
  assumes "C n"<br>
  shows "A n ==&gt; P n"<br>
    and "B n ==&gt; Q n"<br>
using <code>C n</code> proof (induct n)<br>
  case 0<br>
  {<br>
    case 1 note <code>A 0</code> show "P 0" sorry<br>
  next<br>
    case 2 note <code>B 0</code> show "Q 0" sorry<br>
  }<br>
next<br>
  case (Suc n)<br>
  assume foo: "C (Suc n)"<br>
  from foo have bar: ...<br>
  {<br>
    case 1<br>
    note <code>A (Suc n)</code><br>
    show "P (Suc n)" using bar sorry<br>
  next<br>
    case 2<br>
    note <code>B (Suc n)</code><br>
    show "Q (Suc n)" using bar sorry<br>
  }<br>
qed</p>
<p>The validity of this might make a bit more sense if you remember that<br>
the "case" command is essentially syntactic sugar for a bunch of "fix"<br>
and "assume" commands. Whenever you do a "show" command, Isar only<br>
requires that the assumptions in scope are a subset of the ones in the<br>
goal you are trying to solve.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

Thanks Brian,</p>
<p>You understood the question as I meant it.  I consider it a weakness<br>
that the fact <code>C (Suc n)</code> is not in scope where it logically should<br>
be.  Of the two solutions you suggest, the one I first discovered is<br>
illogical, and the second one you point out is less comfortable for<br>
the user because the assumption isn't checked by Isabelle at the point<br>
it is introduced.  Due to the profusion of renamed variables under the<br>
"case" it is easy to misstate such assumptions.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Randy</p>

<p>First of all, the boundaries of nested cases are determined by the <br>
"induct" method.  Further refinement of this behaviour is on the TODO list <br>
for several years, but that method has accumulated so many features <br>
already, that it takes a long time to clear it out again.</p>
<p>Given the current behaviour there are still many ways how to express the <br>
proof.  The "Common_Patterns" are just some examples to explain the main <br>
ideas.  E.g. the above duplication of "P n" and "Q n" as propositions can <br>
be avoided by using the fact names produced by each case, i.e. "Suc", <br>
"Suc.hyps", "Suc.prems".  You can also project from there using syntax <br>
such as "Suc(2)" although such numbers make proofs a bit hard to read and <br>
maintain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, playing with examples shows that</p>
<p>lemma<br>
assumes h:"inductiveR x" and j:"P x"<br>
shows "Q1 x" and "Q2 x"<br>

 (case ...x0...)                  (<strong> the fact "P x0" is not known here </strong>)<br>
        case 1 have j:"P x0" by fact<br>
                   show "Q1 x0" proof (... j ...)<br>
        case 2 show "Q2 x0" proof (... j ...)  (<strong> why is j in scope here? </strong>)</p>
<p>works.  I don't understand the scoping of facts in this example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another example why it is a bad idea to invent new Isar <br>
indentation rules on the spot.  The indentation that is hard-wired into <br>
Proof General is quite precise approximation of important semantic aspects <br>
of the language.  In particular, the 'case' command merely augments the <br>
context monotonically, without introducing any block structure on its own. <br>
So no change of indentation here.</p>
<p>I've also made a mistake many years ago in calling it 'case' in the first <br>
place, which sounds too much like a rigid structure in corellation with <br>
the goal state, which it isn't.</p>
<p>To understand Isar block structure in general, you can always use { ... } <br>
explicitly, but in practice it is usually suppressed due to the following <br>
implicit principles -- using ( ... ) for the true internal parantheses <br>
that do not have concrete syntax:</p>
<p>(1) a proof body opens an extra pair of spare parentheses like this:</p>
<p>(<br>
        have A<br>
        (<br>
          proof method<br>
            body<br>
          qed method<br>
        )<br>
        )</p>
<p>(2) concrete user commands are defined as follows:</p>
<p>{    == ((<br>
         }    == ))<br>
         next == )(</p>
<p>More precisely</p>
<p>next == ) note nothing (</p>
<p>which explains why you cannot push results over that boundary.</p>
