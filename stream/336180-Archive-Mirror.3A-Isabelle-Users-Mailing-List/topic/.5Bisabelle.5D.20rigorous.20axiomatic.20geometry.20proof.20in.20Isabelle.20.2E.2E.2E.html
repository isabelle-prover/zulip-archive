<p>From: Luke Serafin &lt;<a href="mailto:lserafin@andrew.cmu.edu">lserafin@andrew.cmu.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Mr. Richter,</p>
<p>It might be helpful to look at a mathematical logic book which develops<br>
HOL rather than set theory as the foundation of mathematics, such as Peter<br>
Andrews' _An Introduction to Mathematical Logic and Type Theory: To Truth<br>
Trough Proof_ (let us abbreviate this TTTP; note that type theory is<br>
essentially another term for HOL). There we find (remark after the proof<br>
of theorem 5402) that the primitive version of HOL which the author calls<br>
Q0 is a conservative extension of FOL. The basic logic used in Isabelle<br>
and HOL Light is also a conservative extension of FOL (Coq uses<br>
constructive logic which is more restrictive than classical logic; I don't<br>
know whether its basic logic is a conservative extension of constructive<br>
predicate logic). Any stronger HOL system (e.g. Q0^\infty from the book<br>
mentioned above; this system is adequate for the formalization of a very<br>
significant portion of mathematics), can be viewed as this basic HOL<br>
together with a set of axiom schemata. Choose such a stronger HOL system,<br>
and denote its set of axioms by H. Then a sentence A is a theorem of this<br>
stronger system iff there exists a finite subset H0 of H such that H0 |- A<br>
(because proofs are finite, at least in this context). Note that the<br>
turnstile means provable from basic HOL, e.g. Q0. This is equivalent to |-<br>
B --&gt; A, where B is the conjunction of all elements of H0. Hence any<br>
theorem of any (recursively axiomatized) version of HOL can be viewed as a<br>
theorem of a conservative extension of FOL. Furthermore, we could<br>
introduce type predicates and axioms about them into FOL and thereby fully<br>
import Q0 into FOL (this construction is elementary but tedious), which by<br>
the above argument means that we can effectively translate any HOL system<br>
into FOL. In this sense, you are right that HOL does not go beyond FOL.</p>
<p>However, the notion of proof is completely different between FOL and HOL.<br>
In the second paragraph of the remark referred to above (TTTP p. 243), we<br>
find quoted a result of Statman that "the minimal length of a proof in<br>
first-order logic of a wff of first-order logic may be extraordinarily<br>
longer than the minimal length of a proof of the same (as in, translated<br>
canonically) wff in second-order logic." The paper referred to may be<br>
found here: &lt;<a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/22467">http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/22467</a>&gt;, I have<br>
not studied it carefully but do know that the function from n to the<br>
maximal m such that m is a minimal-length FOL proof of a HOL wff which has<br>
a proof of length n asymptotically grows at least as fast as a<br>
hyper-exponential function. Thus, using HOL wffs and rules of inference is<br>
of great practical advantage when doing proofs with a computer. If we<br>
insist on everything being done in FOL, we could change our definition of<br>
proof to allow derived rules of inference to be used directly, and then<br>
derive translated versions of HOL rules of inference for some translation<br>
of HOL into FOL. However, it is practically much simpler to just think in<br>
terms of using HOL directly.</p>
<p>Regarding set theory, ZF is strictly stronger than Q0^\infty, but its lack<br>
of intrinsic types makes proof searches in ZF much more difficult than<br>
those in Q0^\infty. Thus it is often advantageous to work with a typed HOL<br>
theory than directly with ZF. Isabelle allows the dynamic addition of new<br>
axioms, so if we ever need to go beyond Q0^\infty (say), we can just add<br>
whatever new facts we need as axioms, and perhaps prove the validity of<br>
these axioms in ZF if we believe that is necessary. Also, though ZF is<br>
normally considered to be based on FOL, there is no danger of introducing<br>
a contradiction if we conservatively extend its background logic, and so<br>
we can just as easily consider ZF in the context of HOL (e.g.<br>
Isabelle/ZF). This brings with it the possibility of gaining the<br>
advantages of types and HOL's much shorter proofs for ZF (e.g. we can<br>
define type-parameterized isomorphism predicates between types with<br>
associated operations and sets with associated operations, and use these<br>
to port theorems between HOL and ZF within this unified system).</p>
<p>Hopefully this clarifies things somewhat, let me know if you have any<br>
questions about what is written above.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
   Luke Serafin</p>
