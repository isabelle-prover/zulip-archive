<p>From: Bill Richter &lt;<a href="mailto:richter@math.northwestern.edu">richter@math.northwestern.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Hi, I'm a mathematician writing a rigorous axiomatic geometry paper<br>
<a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf">http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf</a> <br>
using Hilbert's axioms.  I want to cite geometry proofs nicely coded<br>
and checked by proof-checker like Isabelle.  I've written Mizar code<br>
<a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/RichterTarskiMizar.tar">http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/RichterTarskiMizar.tar</a> <br>
and I want to port it to Isabelle, which Freek Wiedijk seems to<br>
suggest is an improvement.  Makarius has been helping me, and he said<br>
I should ask here about formalizations of geometry.  My feeling, which<br>
could be mistaken, is that Coq and HOL Light are primarily<br>
theorem-provers (procedural) and require considerable tweaking to<br>
allow folks to type in readable axiomatic geometry (declarative)<br>
proofs, but that Isabelle is both procedural and declarative.  </p>
<p>My Mizar code is a largely a port of Julien Narboux's Coq pseudo-code<br>
<a href="http://dpt-info.u-strasbg.fr/~narboux/tarski.html">http://dpt-info.u-strasbg.fr/~narboux/tarski.html</a>.  I partially prove<br>
the theorem of the 1983 book Metamathematische Methoden in der<br>
Geometrie by Schwabhäuser, Szmielew, and Tarski, that Tarski's<br>
(extremely weak!) plane geometry axioms imply Hilbert's axioms.  I get<br>
about as far as Narboux, with Gupta's amazing proof which implies<br>
Hilbert's axiom I1 that two points determine a line.  I don't think my<br>
Mizar code is that great, but it's a lot more readable than Julien's<br>
Coq pseudo-code.  No doubt some Mizar experts could improve my code,<br>
but I'm putting them off as a last resort, because Mizar seems<br>
unsuitable as a language to use in a high school math class.</p>
<p>So I'd appreciate your Isabelle help, including the easiest way run<br>
Isabelle programs.  Do I really need Proof General?  I'll also accept<br>
geometry help!  I haven't seen Schwabhäuser's book, and I can't see<br>
how to go any farther with Tarski's axioms.  I'm basically missing<br>
Hilbert's Pasch Betweenness axiom (Tarski's axiom is about 1/3 of it)<br>
and Hilbert's angle construction axiom.</p>

<p>From: Bill Richter &lt;<a href="mailto:richter@math.northwestern.edu">richter@math.northwestern.edu</a>&gt;<br>
I appreciate your work [...] Maybe we could join our efforts.</p>
<p>Julien, I'd be thrilled to work with you and Gabriel Braun, especially<br>
as you &amp; Makarius are on a committee studying Theorem Proving<br>
Components for Educational Software.  So you &amp; Makarius are people I<br>
want to talk to about teaching geometry, and not only vital<br>
programming resources.  This is very interesting:</p>
<p>I appreciate your work, your proofs seem to be really more readable<br>
   than Coq proofs. Of course my LCF style proofs are not meant to be<br>
   readable. In fact, I believe that these proofs about Tarski's<br>
   axioms are really low level and it is hard to have intuition about<br>
   the proofs because there are basic facts which are hard to prove<br>
   (for instance existence of the midpoint arrives only at chapter 7<br>
   !) and therefore it is not really the kind of proof one wants to<br>
   show in high-school, that is why I did not try to produce readable<br>
   proofs.</p>
<p>Surely no one should teach Tarski's axioms in high school, as the<br>
proofs are way too hard since his axioms are so weak.  But the Tarski<br>
proofs are still worth understanding, for the same reason that high<br>
school kids (arguably) ought to learn Hilbert's axioms and not use the<br>
stronger axioms of Moise &amp; Venema, based on Birkhoff's real line for<br>
distances and angles, and taking the plane separation axiom instead of<br>
Hilbert's weaker Pasch axiom.  </p>
<p>Moise proofs are a lot easier than Hilbert proofs.  But only using<br>
Moise raises the question in the student's mind: am I smart enough to<br>
understand the supposedly harder Hilbert axioms?  And if I'm not smart<br>
enough, maybe I shouldn't even be using the simpler Moise axioms!<br>
The only way to reassure the students is to write up nice Hilbert proofs,<br>
and I think I succeeded, or at least made a start, in <br>
<a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf">http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf</a><br>
The same remarks go for Tarksi, at least for me (the teacher).  I know I<br>
couldn't figure out the Tarski proofs myself, I needed your Coq code,<br>
but am I even smart enough to understand the proofs?  </p>
<p>I think there is definitely is Tarski geometry intuition, although<br>
it's hard to come by.  Gupta's amazing proof is definitely based on<br>
intuition, and you can see the intuition in the pictures you and the<br>
wikiproofs folks draw.  Gupta's theorem<br>
a ≠ b ∧ Babc ∧ Babd → Bacd ∨ Badc<br>
would be easy if we could find two points p &amp; q that are equidistant<br>
from a, b &amp; c.  We could easily do that if we had Hilbert's angle<br>
construction axiom, but we don't.  So Gupta (as you explained to me in<br>
your Coq code) first finds a rhombus (which turns out to be flat), and then<br>
shows the diagonals of the rhombus bisect each other (that's generally<br>
true, and in our flat case it follows easily from the Inner Pasch<br>
axiom), and then we can do enough angle construction using this<br>
bisected rhombus to find the points p &amp; q, which turn out to be on the<br>
same line after all.  Isn't that an amazing proof?  </p>
<p>Your email from last week reactivated my interest in these proofs<br>
   and I worked on the proof of Hilbert's Pasch axiom. </p>
<p>Excellent!  I noticed that your proof of the full Pasch axiom in your <br>
(in progress) <a href="http://dpt-info.u-strasbg.fr/~narboux/Tarski/Hilbert.html">http://dpt-info.u-strasbg.fr/~narboux/Tarski/Hilbert.html</a><br>
seems to be still  in progress.<br>
Also, you didn't quite prove the midpoint theorem, but only<br>
Lemma l7_25 : forall A B C, Cong C A C B -&gt; exists X, is_midpoint X A B.<br>
Your C should exist, by constructing an isosceles triangle, but I<br>
can't even do that.</p>
<p>I don't know why my address from hol-info bounced, as I've gotten mail<br>
from other hol-info users.  Can you check what my bad address was?  </p>
<p>About your questions about Isabelle, I think you could use the<br>
   latest use interface based on Jedit.</p>
<p>Thanks.  Makarius told me this after I posted.  I still don't know how<br>
to use Isabelle.  Makarius stressed that I ought to try Coq.</p>

<p>From: Bill Richter &lt;<a href="mailto:richter@math.northwestern.edu">richter@math.northwestern.edu</a>&gt;<br>
they have built a large Coq library about high school geometry.<br>
   [...] But this [ Coq declarative proof] language is not used much<br>
   by the Coq community so you may encounter bugs.</p>
<p>Julien, I think that you and your coauthors in<br>
<a href="http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/58/49/18/PDF/iccsaConf.pdf">http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/58/49/18/PDF/iccsaConf.pdf</a> are using Coq<br>
to figure out how to teach the course, and not asking the students to<br>
write Coq code proofs.  This sentence in your paper concerns me:</p>
<p>The work closest to ours is the one by<br>
   P. Scott and J. Fleuriot [17].<br>
<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/b715100716u1t347/?MUD=MP">http://www.springerlink.com/content/b715100716u1t347/?MUD=MP</a></p>
<p>I know I just got here, and I'm not trying to fight with anyone, but I<br>
think this paper shows I have some value to the group already.  </p>
<p>Scott and Fleuriot took on a challenging and interesting HOL Light<br>
project, to fill in the gaps of Hilbert's book FoG.  That will show<br>
the power of HOL Light and their programming skill.</p>
<p>But their paper doesn't seem helpful in teaching a rigorous Hilbert<br>
geometry course.  Reading Greenberg's &amp; Hartshorne's books (or my<br>
paper <a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf">http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf</a>) would<br>
much more helpful.  The authors don't seem to understand the gaps in<br>
Euclid's work which were fixed by Hilbert's axioms.  Euclid messed up<br>
every single result that involved angle addition, including the<br>
triangle sum theorem (sum 3 angles = 180).  That's a result kids<br>
taking a Hilbert geometry course need to know!  The authors study<br>
instead possible deficiencies of Hilbert's book FoG, and there may be<br>
plenty, but you can't teach a geometry course out of FoG, as there<br>
isn't enough interesting material.  Euclid's errors are much more<br>
interesting, as Euclid was often used as a textbook (for centuries?).<br>
Scott and Fleuriot say something misleading in their intro:</p>
<p>Indeed, it is sufficient to note that Hilbert followed Euclid in<br>
   one pervasive omission: they both give proofs on an ambient plane<br>
   when the axioms characterise solid geometry [8].</p>
<p>First, they're citing Heath (a valuable Euclid resource), who mentions<br>
Hilbert quite often but shows absolutely no understanding of how<br>
Hilbert's work fixes Euclid's pervasive angle-addition errors.</p>
<p>Second, is there even an error, as Scott and Fleuriot quote Heath as<br>
saying?  I don't see any plane/solid-geometry error in Hilbert's<br>
axioms listed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms</a></p>
<p>In my paper I explain (following Moise's rigorous book) how to handle<br>
this solid geometry biz.  Basically, for all the 2-dim stuff you have<br>
to say "in a plane" and in the 3-dim part you then use the planar<br>
stuff plus extra incidence axioms.  Euclid's book XI is a fantastic<br>
treatment of solid geometry, which Moise simplifies.</p>

Hi Bill,</p>
<p>transforming the raw Mizar texts is often painful. Depending on<br>
the application, it is often better to transform the XML layer or<br>
even the Prolog (MPTP) layer. A simple XSL stylesheet that<br>
implements your mizar-&gt;isar function is now at<br>
<a href="https://raw.github.com/JUrban/xsl4mizar/master/ISA/isa_main.xsl">https://raw.github.com/JUrban/xsl4mizar/master/ISA/isa_main.xsl</a> .</p>
<p>Use it as follows:</p>
<p>git clone git://github.com/JUrban/xsl4mizar.git</p>
<p>mizf joe.miz<br>
xsltproc xsl4mizar/addabsrefs.xsl joe.xml &gt; joe.xml1<br>
xsltproc --param display_thesis \'0\' xsl4mizar/ISA/isa_main.xsl<br>
joe.xml1 | html2text</p>
<p>You can extend it by overloading in isa_main.xsltxt the other<br>
printing functions from MHTML/. The API description is at<br>
<a href="http://mizar.org/version/current/doc/xml/Mizar.html">http://mizar.org/version/current/doc/xml/Mizar.html</a> . I can<br>
probably help with some harder parts if this leads somewhere.</p>
<p>This can only get you so far. For the general issues with<br>
transforming the Mizar dependent type system to HOL-like systems,<br>
see Ondrej Kuncar's paper:<br>
<a href="http://ktiml.mff.cuni.cz/~kuncar/kuncar-wds10.pdf">http://ktiml.mff.cuni.cz/~kuncar/kuncar-wds10.pdf</a> .</p>
<p>It might also be easier for you to first transform your code to<br>
HOL Light's Mizar mode, because it does not have the keyword<br>
incompatibilities that Isar introduced, and it has quite faithful<br>
implementation of the Mizar "by" inference. In Isabelle, you<br>
could later try to replace such calls with "metis" calls. If you are<br>
interested in Coq, it also has a declarative Mizar-like mode, but it<br>
is much less used than Isar.</p>
<p>And one more translation alternative: You could also ask the OMDoc<br>
people (Florian Rabe I guess) about OMDoc-&gt;Isabelle export. They<br>
do have quite fresh import of Mizar (using the XML layer).</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Josef</p>

<p>From: "Tim (McKenzie) Makarios" &lt;<a href="mailto:tjm1983@gmail.com">tjm1983@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
At the end of February, I submitted my Master's thesis, which was about<br>
an Isabelle formalization of the independence of the parallels<br>
postulate.  Specifically, I chose Tarski's axioms, and showed that his<br>
Euclidean axiom (Axiom 10 in Metamathematische Methoden in der<br>
Geometrie) is independent of the others, by proving that the<br>
Klein--Beltrami model of the hyperbolic plane satisfies the rest of<br>
Tarski's axioms, but not the Euclidean axiom.</p>
<p>As you will have gathered, my work was primarily about models of<br>
Tarski's axioms, rather than consequences of them, but if you're<br>
interested, ask me off-list, and I can send you a copy of my thesis, or<br>
my Isabelle files, or whatever interests you.  Please understand,<br>
though, that I haven't heard back from the examiners yet, and I think<br>
they're entitled to ask me to make changes to my thesis, so what I send<br>
you shouldn't be considered to be the final version of my thesis.</p>

<p>From: Bill Richter &lt;<a href="mailto:richter@math.northwestern.edu">richter@math.northwestern.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Josef, as you're a real Mizar expert, I'll be grateful if you look at<br>
<a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/RichterTarskiMizar.tar">http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/RichterTarskiMizar.tar</a> <br>
I'll endure pain to manually transform my 1467 lines of Mizar Tarski<br>
geometry proofs to Isabelle (or Coq or HOL Light even).  I'm grateful<br>
to the Mizar folks for writing a language I could learn and code up my<br>
Tarski proofs, not least because I now believe my proofs.  But I think<br>
Mizar is too clunky a language to recommend high school students to<br>
code in.  That brings up HOL Light's Mizar mode, as you mentioned, or<br>
Freek's miz3, but I couldn't get any of them to run on HOL Light 3.09,<br>
nor could I compile the latest version of HOL Light, and Freek<br>
suggests often that Isabelle is an improvement over Mizar.</p>
<p>Could you just get me started on Isabelle?  I finally ran the<br>
executable ./Isabelle, and up popped jedit.  I'm reading various<br>
Isabelle dox, and it's all great, but I haven't found what I want:</p>
<p>How do we code up first order logic (FOL) proofs that follow from some<br>
FOL axioms?  I really think the Isabelle dox ought to explain this.</p>
<p>You can't exactly do that in Mizar, I believe, and maybe you can't do<br>
it in any of the proof assistants.  Mizar is all about set theory<br>
(using I think Tarski's FOL set theory axioms), so we have to talk<br>
instead about a model of my FOL axioms.  That's fine.  </p>
<p>So we have to define some ``class'' of mathematical objects, which is<br>
the sets, functions &amp; relations that define a model.  In my case,<br>
that's a set S with a 3-ary and 4-ary relation equiv and between<br>
satisfying various properties (Tarski's axioms).  Now we have to code<br>
up proofs about this class i.e. prove theorems about models of<br>
Tarski's axioms, which amounts to the FOL proofs we want.  This must<br>
be explained somewhere in the Isabelle dox.</p>

These are not "keyword incompatibilities", but fundamental differences in <br>
the approach to structured proofs, and the meaning of the language <br>
elements.  It all follows Isabelle/Pure and its higher-order natural <br>
deduction environment.  Similarities with Mizar and other "declaritive <br>
proof" modes are quite superficial.  I never use the "declarative" <br>
terminolgy for Isar, it does not quite fit what it actually is.</p>
<p>In particular, their is no built-in automation in Isar.  Users can draw on <br>
an existing repertoire of proof methods taken from the library, such as <br>
"metis" in Isabelle/HOL, but they don't have to.</p>

Mizar is too clunky a language to recommend high school students to<br>

Freek's miz3, but I couldn't get any of them to run on HOL Light 3.09,<br>

<p>You can't exactly do that in Mizar, I believe, and maybe you can't do<br>

satisfying various properties (Tarski's axioms).  Now we have to code<br>
up proofs about this class i.e. prove theorems about models of<br>
Tarski's axioms, which amounts to the FOL proofs we want.  This must<br>
be explained somewhere in the Isabelle dox.</p>

I don't think they're saying that there's a problem with the axioms;<br>
they're saying that there's a problem with some of Hilbert's proofs.<br>
See, for example,<br>
Meikle, L. I., and Fleuriot, J. D.  Formalizing Hilbert’s Grundlagen in<br>
Isabelle/Isar.  In Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics, D. Basin and<br>
B. Wolff, Eds., vol. 2758 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science.<br>
Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, 2003, pp. 319–334.<br>
In particular, on page 327, they say "The Grundlagen proof then applied<br>
Axiom(II,4).  This was not possible in the mechanical proof until all<br>
nine assumptions of the axiom were present. ...<br>
Hilberts_missing_assumptions was a lemma used to achieve this.  Its<br>
proof was difficult, especially having to show that EG lay on the plane<br>
AFC.  Hilbert failed to mention these difficulties."</p>

Jeremy, I'll look at your paper, but don't want to discuss Euclid with<br>
you or anyone else here unless they understand Hilbert's formal (not<br>
informal) first order axiomatization of plane geometry as explained in<br>
Hartshorne's book: 3 incidence axioms, 4 betweenness axioms, 6<br>
congruence axioms, the parallel postulate and the circle-circle axiom.</p>
<p>With these axioms, you can prove every plane geometry result Euclid<br>
stated, and you ought to be able to code the proofs up nicely in<br>
Isabelle, and maybe even teach a high school or college course where<br>
the students code up their own rigorous axiomatic Hilbert proofs.  You<br>
can't code up proofs of Euclid's propositions using Euclid's axioms.</p>
<p>Your paper is relevant to this group if you can code up your<br>
enhanced-Euclid proofs in Isabelle.  I couldn't tell from my brief<br>
glance at your paper if this is possible.  What do you think?</p>

<p>From: Bill Richter &lt;<a href="mailto:richter@math.northwestern.edu">richter@math.northwestern.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Tim and Makarius, I can't follow the Isabelle dox, and I need<br>
something like ``Isabelle for Dummies.''  I just want to know how to<br>
write my FOL proofs in Isabelle, how to compile them, with examples.</p>
<p>Now I feel strongly that Isabelle (like Mizar) ought to be able to<br>
check FOL proofs without specifying any proof strategies like Tim's<br>
<code>simp add' or </code>blast'.  Mizar makes lots of proof shortcuts that I<br>
wouldn't have expected, and I'd be happier if Isabelle did few proof<br>
shortcuts.  I want the students to have to write up most of the proof.<br>
I think in strict FOL, you have to insert so many needless steps that<br>
the proofs become unreadable.  I guess we need a good compromise.</p>
<p>I untarred Isabelle2011-1_bundle_x86-linux.tar.gz and went to the<br>
directory Isabelle2011-1.</p>
<p>I ran the executable ./Isabelle and up popped jedit.  I pasted in<br>
Isabelle code from Tim's master's thesis into Scratch.thy.  There's<br>
extensive jedit help on the Help menu, but I couldn't figure out how<br>
to compile my buffer.    So then I tried </p>
<p>bin/isabelle emacs po.thy &amp;</p>
<p>and up popped a Proof General Emacs frame displaying my short file<br>
po.thy based on the first example in the<br>
Isabelle2011-1/doc/locales.pdf.</p>
<p>------ po.thy ----<br>
theory PO<br>
imports Main <br>
begin</p>
<p>locale partial_order =<br>
  fixes le :: " 'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ bool " (infixl "\&lt;sqsubseteq&gt;" 50)<br>
  assumes refl [intro, simp]: "x \&lt;sqsubseteq&gt; x"<br>
    and anti_sym [intro]: "[[ x  \&lt;sqsubseteq&gt;  y; y \&lt;sqsubseteq&gt; x ]] =⇒ x = y"<br>
    and trans [trans]: "[[ x \&lt;sqsubseteq&gt; y; y \&lt;sqsubseteq&gt; z ]] =⇒  x \&lt;sqsubseteq&gt; z"<br>
------ end po.thy ----</p>
<p>Now I can see how to compile my file!  I click on menu item<br>
Isabelle -&gt; Start Isabelle <br>
I think that's the much the same thing as clicking the down-arrow<br>
button which says ``process whole buffer''.  I get an error message:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inner lexical error at: ⇒ 'a ⇒ bool  (line 6 of "/home/richter/Isabelle/Isabelle2011-1/po.thy")<br>
*** Failed to parse type<br>
*** At command "locale" (line 5 of "/home/richter/Isabelle/Isabelle2011-1/po.thy")</li>
</ul>
<p>I have no idea what this means.  Posibly I'm using the wrong quote.<br>
I'm writing 'a, but locales.pdf actually shows ’a.  So I changed to<br>
this quote, and I got a new error message:</p>
<p>*** Inner lexical error at: ’a ⇒ ’a ⇒ bool (line 6 of "/home/richter/Isabelle/Isabelle2011-1/po.thy")<br>
*** Failed to parse type<br>
*** At command "locale" (line 5 of "/home/richter/Isabelle/Isabelle2011-1/po.thy")</p>
<p>Maybe that's progress, because Proof General is now noticing my first<br>
quote a, and not just the second one.  </p>
<p>I'm actually trying to understand Tim's Tarski geometry axiom code.<br>
So I tried compiling a simple version of it below.   Proof General<br>
gives me an error message similar to the above one:</p>
<p>*** Outer syntax error (line 5 of "/home/richter/Isabelle/Isabelle2011-1/Scratch.thy"): command expected,<br>
*** but symbolic identifier - (line 5 of "/home/richter/Isabelle/Isabelle2011-1/Scratch.thy") was found</p>
<p>But it's the code I'm more interested in now.  Tim's axioms make<br>
perfect sense, except for the (- - ≡ - - [99,99,99,99] 50) on the line<br>
defining C.  I'm concerned about lemma A1, which just restates the<br>
axiom A1.  I do something like that in my Mizar code, and I was really<br>
hoping it wouldn't be necessary in Isabelle.  Maybe I don't know what<br>
lemma A1 is for.  But there's plenty of stuff I don't understand in<br>
Tim's proof, like<br>
by (simp add: A1)<br>
with A2 show ?thesis by blast</p>
<p>On p 123 of isar-ref.pdf, this is somewhat explained:</p>
<p>Typically, the soundness proof is relatively straight-forward,<br>
   often just by canonical automated tools such as “by simp ” or “by<br>
   blast ”.</p>
<p>I'm guessing that simp and blast are like what HOL Light calls<br>
tactics, search strategies for Isabelle to concoct a proof.  One of<br>
the nice things about Mizar is that you don't ever have to specify any<br>
proof strategies, although clearly Mizar is using a strategy.</p>
<p>Tim's ?thesis I bet can understand, from p 6:</p>
<p>?thesis — the main conclusion of the innermost pending claim</p>
<p>Tim's show ?thesis seems to be explained on p 126:</p>
<p>Typical idioms for concluding calculational proofs are “finally show ?thesis .”</p>

<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:c-sterna@jaist.ac.jp">c-sterna@jaist.ac.jp</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Bill,</p>
<p>As soon as you open a theory file (extension ".thy") with jEdit, it is <br>
constantly "checked" (even in parallel, for lemmas that are not <br>
dependent in a linear fashion). (There is a thin column next to the main <br>
text buffer, where the total progress or errors are indicated. <br>
Furthermore, errors are marked by red wavy lines inside the text buffer.)</p>
<p>On a more general note. In principle I would strongly suggest to start <br>
with trivial proofs in order to get acquainted with the mechanisms of <br>
Isabelle. And only afterwards try to formalize something serious.</p>
<p>Concerning some of the points you mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PDFs or HTML sites that are generated from Isabelle theory files often <br>
use slightly different symbols/notation than is actually used as input. <br>
A good way to get "the real thing" is having a look (e.g., with jEdit) <br>
at the example theory files that are located in &lt;Isabelle <br>
directory&gt;/src/HOL/ex/.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In parallel to referring to reference manuals (like isar-ref) it is a <br>
good idea to read more tutorial-like texts, e.g., tutorial.pdf and <br>
isar-overview.pdf, that are part of the documentation of Isabelle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is mostly your own decision how big the steps of a proof are. You <br>
can do single steps (using the "rule" method) which results in huge <br>
undigestable proofs. Or you can use methods like "simp" (equational <br>
reasoning), "blast" (logical reasoning which should succeed on many <br>
first-order proofs), "auto" (somewhat a combination of the previous <br>
two), "induction" (for ... well, induction), "cases" (for case <br>
analysis). (In courses it is often done that students are only allowed <br>
to use certain rules in order to proof a statement, since the automatic <br>
tools would outright solve many typical examples.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>hope this helps,</p>
<p>chris</p>

I've posted a number of times without getting the help I wanted.<br>

I couldn't have written it without the help of John Harrison, who got<br>
me started in 3 separate ways, and also Freek Wiedijk.  Someone can<br>
probably tell me how to port this code to Isabelle.  The Isabelle dox<br>
for proofs look great, but to me they are impenetrable.  I think I<br>
coded in the axioms correctly, in the file light below (Tarski) but I<br>
can't figure out how to write any Isabelle proofs.</p>

I think what you might be looking for is Isabelle's locales.  In my<br>
thesis, I used a locale (actually, several incremental locales) to<br>
characterize Tarski's axioms.  Then, I could prove consequences of the<br>
axioms inside the locales, and I could define models of the axioms<br>
outside the locales that I later proved were instances of the locales.</p>

Jeremy, if you or anyone else wants to talk about Euclid off-line, I'd<br>
be happy to talk.  As I try to explain in my paper, I love the Elements<br>
<a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf">http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf</a><br>
It's very creative and forms the basis of non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>Thanks, Chris, that's very helpful.  I'll look for the red wavy error<br>
lines in jedit.  I'll look at /src/HOL/ex/.  I've looked at<br>
tutorial.pdf, but I'll look again, and isar-overview.pdf sounds good.<br>
Thanks for explaining simp, blast etc, although I don't really know<br>
what you mean.  Is there somewhere an FOL example, with a long<br>
(perhaps indigestible) single step "rule" method proof, which is<br>
shortened with simp, and then shortened even more with blast &amp; auto?</p>
<p>(In courses it is often done that students are only allowed to use<br>
   certain rules in order to proof a statement, since the automatic<br>
   tools would outright solve many typical examples.)</p>
<p>Wow!  Can you point me to any of these courses?  That sounds like what<br>
I need to know.  As I posted earlier, I'm mostly trying to cite some<br>
good code for my geometry paper above (which I'll then submit).  I<br>
don't have to write the code myself, although I did<br>

Well, not really indigestible, but consider the following Isabelle/HOL <br>
proof of Pierce's Law:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>lemma Pierce1: "((P --&gt; Q) --&gt; P) --&gt; P"<br>
proof (rule impI)<br>
   assume 1: "(P --&gt; Q) --&gt; P"<br>
   have "(~ P) | P" by (rule excluded_middle)<br>
   thus P<br>
   proof (rule disjE)<br>
     assume "P" thus "P" by assumption<br>
   next<br>
     assume 2: "~ P"<br>
     have "P --&gt; Q"<br>
     proof (rule impI)<br>
       assume "P"<br>
       with 2 show "Q" by (rule notE)<br>
     qed<br>
     with 1 show "P" by (rule mp)<br>
   qed<br>
qed</p>
<p>Which just uses the existing lemmas</p>
<p>impI: (?P ==&gt; ?Q) ==&gt; ?P --&gt; ?Q<br>
excluded_middle: ~ ?P | ?P<br>
disjE: ?P | ?Q ==&gt; (?P ==&gt; ?R) ==&gt; (?Q ==&gt; ?R) ==&gt; ?R<br>
notE: ~ ?P ==&gt; ?P ==&gt; ?R<br>
mp: ?P --&gt; ?Q ==&gt; ?P ==&gt; ?Q</p>
<p>where the question marks indicate that variables can be instantiated <br>
arbitrarily (i.e., they are so called "schematic variables"). In this <br>
proof every step (w.r.t. some given set of rules) is done explicitly. If <br>
we use "blast" (or "auto" for that matter) it reduces to.</p>
<p>lemma Pierce2: "((P --&gt; Q) --&gt; P) --&gt; P" by blast</p>
<p>But note that both proofs are equally rigorous, since blast just applies <br>
existing lemmas that are setup as introduction and elimination rules for <br>
logical symbols (besides others). (The whole idea of proof assistants <br>
like Isabelle, is that internally everything is reducible to the initial <br>
axioms, whether this is done by hand or left to the system is to some <br>
extend the users choice [sometimes the automatic methods are just not <br>
powerful enough to solve a goal and the user has to divide it in smaller <br>
pieces manually].)</p>

<p>From: Bill Richter &lt;<a href="mailto:richter@math.northwestern.edu">richter@math.northwestern.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Makarius ported to Isabelle 100+ lines (below) of my HOL-Light/miz3<br>
code I posted here on May 20, which is more or less a port of Julien<br>
Narboux's Coq pseudo-code.  I'm thrilled the Isabelle maintainers took<br>
such an interest in Tarski axiomatic geometry:</p>
<p>M&gt; I've spent maybe 1 or 2 hours on the various versions of the Tarski<br>
M&gt; axiomatization by Bill, Julien Narboux, John Harrison, and<br>
M&gt; Wikipedia.  Bill had a slight divergence in some details in his 2<br>
M&gt; or 3 versions that I did not follow to the bottom.</p>
<p>Makarius's port proved a theorem that's false, the last theorem below,<br>
C1.  The problem seems to be Makarius's axiom</p>
<p>A5: "a ≠ b ⟹ Bet a b c ⟹ Bet a' b' c' ⟹ a b c ≐≐ a' b' c' ⟹<br>
      b d ≐ b' d' ⟹ c d ≐ c' d'"</p>
<p>I think this is my error, from my Isabelle file 6Tarski.thy, which I<br>
think I posted here.  My deepest apologies!  I should have written</p>
<p>and A5: "∀ a b c d a' b' c' d' . not(a = b) ∧ B a b d ∧ B a' b' d'<br>
              ∧ a b ≡ a' b' ∧ b c ≡ b' c' ∧ a d ≡ a' d' ∧ b d ≡ b' d'<br>
                        =⇒ c d ≡ c' d'"</p>
<p>which is basically Tarksi's version of the SAS axiom (which Tarski<br>
cleverly defined without having angles!), which I got right in miz3</p>
<p>let A5 = new_axiom<br>
<code>!a b c d a' b' c' d'.
        ~(a = b) /\ a,b,c cong a',b',c' /\
        Between(a,b,d) /\ Between(a',b',d') /\ b,d === b',d'
        ==&gt; c,d === c',d'</code>;;</p>
<p>Makarius, I think you needed <br>
Bet a b d ⟹ Bet a' b' d',<br>
but you sure did a whole better than I did!  I couldn't even get the<br>
axiom locale to work, or prove anything.  I made the change, and now<br>
jedit gives an error, with do-not-enters on the last 4 lines:</p>
<p>with neq Bet Bet have "y x ≐ y y" using <code>b x ≐ b y</code> by (rule A5)<br>
  then show ?thesis by (rule A3)<br>
qed</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>So I uncommented the assumption<br>
    and "Bet a b x"<br>
but I still get these 4 do-not-enters.  Uh, would you try try again? </p>
<p>A few things confuse me about your code, e.g.</p>
<p>defines "a b c ≐≐ x y z ≡ a b ≐ x y ∧ a c ≐ x z ∧ b c ≐ y z"</p>
<p>So ≡ means "if and only if", which in HOL-Light is &lt;=&gt;? </p>
<p>Two of Tarski's first 7 axioms are constructive (some point x exists),<br>
A4 and A7, and you proved rules for them, using what I thought was a<br>
very powerful automation tool blast:</p>
<p>lemma A4_rule: obtains x where "Bet q a x" and "a x ≐ b c"<br>
  using A4 by blast</p>
<p>and then used A4 by e.g. writing </p>
<p>obtain x where x: "Bet q a x" "a x ≐ a a" by (rule A4_rule)</p>
<p>Hmm, you don't have to do that in Mizar or Freek's miz3.</p>
<p>Now I ran your code in the spanking new Isabelle:</p>
<p>(poisson)Isabelle2012&gt; ./Isabelle ../Tarski.thy &amp;</p>
<p>I'm a newbie, but it sure looks to me that jedit thinks your code is<br>
perfect.  Let me explain why your last result shouldn't be true:</p>
<p>lemma C1:<br>
  assumes neq: "a ≠ b"<br>
    and Bet: "Bet a b y"<br>
(*  and "Bet a b x"    -- "FIXME unused"  *)<br>
    and "b x ≐ b y"<br>
  shows "y = x"<br>
proof -<br>
  have 1: "a b ≐ a b" ..<br>
  have 2: "b y ≐ b y" ..<br>
  have "a b y ≐≐ a b y" ..<br>
  with neq Bet Bet have "y x ≐ y y" using <code>b x ≐ b y</code> by (rule A5)<br>
  then show ?thesis by (rule A3)<br>
qed</p>
<p>Tarski's axioms hold in the plane R^2, in which the result means this.</p>
<p>Let <code>l' be the line containing two distinct points </code>a' and <code>b'.  Take
</code>y' to be a point on `l' so that b is between a and y.  (That means<br>
that y can equal b.)   Now take a point x in the plane so that <br>
length bx = length by.<br>
Then x = y.</p>
<p>Of course that's false (unless y = b).  There's a whole circle of such<br>
points x, with center b and radius length by.</p>

<p>From: Bill Richter &lt;<a href="mailto:richter@math.northwestern.edu">richter@math.northwestern.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks, Makarius, I'll run your code and study it.  Is this explained<br>
somewhere in the Isabelle dox, or could you explain it better:</p>
<p>We are doing precise single step reasoning here, which means all<br>
   the slots for the rules need to be filled in the correct order.<br>
   This is not Mizar or any of the Mizar modes for HOL, which are<br>
   centered around classic predicate logic with some builtin proof<br>
   automation to bridge larger gaps.</p>
<p>I would have said FOL instead of predicate logic, does that mean the<br>
same?  I'm not an expert in FOL, but I think FOL proofs tend to be<br>
very tedious, and the builtin Mizar proof automation turns these FOL<br>
proofs into something that is a real pleasure to code up.  Is that<br>
right?  And Isabelle (Isar?) is doing something different from that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course that's false (unless y = b).  There's a whole circle of<br>
such points x, with center b and radius length by.</p>

<p>That is an informal argument.  It merely motivates why something in<br>

<p>Absolutely!  </p>
<p>In Mizar or miz3, it would have intruded the proof, and the mistake<br>
   in your A5 would not have been discovered.  </p>
<p>I bet it would have been discovered!  I wrote 1500 lines of Mizar<br>
proofs (slimmed down to 1000 miz3 lines), that's bound to shake out<br>
bugs in the axioms.</p>
<p>(You did not have it in the miz3 version that you sent me, but in<br>
   the Isabelle attempt.)</p>
<p>Let me apologize again for sending you the busted A5 Isabelle code.</p>
<p>This is why unguarded axiomatizations are so dangerous.  Here we<br>
   made a locale definition instead, and in the worst case the<br>
   corresponding predicate tarski_first7 could turn out to be always<br>
   False, not more no less.</p>
<p>Yes, and thus locales are definitely a real advantage of Isabelle over<br>
HOL Light right now.  Still, I wonder why one can't just define all<br>

<p>I can only guess what you mean by "strict axiomatic FOL proof".  There are <br>
many ways to define what a logical inference system is, and how proofs are <br>
done.</p>
<p>In Isabelle Pure it is done over lambda-calculus as syntax, and via <br>
backchaining of natural deduction rules with implicit unification to solve <br>
the instantiation problems arising here.  BTW, Isar means "Intelligible <br>
semi-automated reasoning", because the only proof automation built into <br>
the proof language is unification, which is typically used together with <br>
implicit selection of rules from the context (library etc.) as determined <br>
from the structure of the text.  That's the whole secret of it.</p>
<p>Any other proof automation is quoted explicitly in the Isar text, via <br>
"proof methods": blast, simp, auto, metis, smt, ... ad infinitum. You go <br>
to the store and order the kind of washing machine you prefer, or do <br>
things purely by hand ...</p>

<p>You should not spend to much time with that.  If you take HOL as a <br>
simplified version of set-theory with explicit syntactic types it is OK as <br>
a start.  Foundationally, HOL is not so interesting than it was in 1940 or <br>
1950.</p>

<p>You get such a predicate already from the locale tarski_first7 that I've <br>
produced for you.  It is called "tarski_first7" and can be used within the <br>
logical language:</p>
<p>term "tarski_first7"</p>
<p>The system will check that and print the most general type for it:<br>
"('a ⇒ 'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ bool) ⇒ ('a ⇒ 'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ bool) ⇒ bool". You <br>
can also hover over the formal term to get it explained.</p>
<p>Note that the type is naturally curried as everything by default in <br>
Isabelle Pure -- just like in good HOL families.</p>
<p>Moreover your carrier set S is actually modeled as a type here, in the <br>
usual manner in HOL.  You can relativize it to a set over the base type, <br>
but that is a different story of the larger HOL family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>assume TarskiModel(S, Between, Equiv)...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what the locale context "begin" does for you implicitly, and then <br>
you start to define derived things and state theorems and do proofs from <br>
it.  This means you are developing a concrete "theory", but this is not <br>
meta-theory.</p>
<p>Meta theory means you speak about things, by stepping aside or outside <br>
from it.  Here is an arbitrary example from AFP, which I have happened to <br>
have browsed two weeks ago with a student: <br>
<a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Completeness.shtml">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Completeness.shtml</a></p>
<p>The example develops the logical inference system and semantics of a <br>
version of first-order logic in the usual way, almost literally from the <br>
book (I don't know which one).  There are just the usual formalization <br>
tweaks to represent it as concrete formal things inside HOL (and a slight <br>
tendency of redundant copies of basic mathematical HOL concepts used in <br>
the development).</p>

<p>That is a global axiomatic theory.  In Isabelle/HOL is would look like <br>

<p>axiomatization<br>
   Cong :: "point ⇒ point ⇒ point ⇒ point ⇒ bool"  ("_ _ ≐ _ _" [1000, <br>

<p>From: Bill Richter &lt;<a href="mailto:richter@math.northwestern.edu">richter@math.northwestern.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks, Tim!  I'll look carefully at your code, and study locales.</p>
<p>I should read Scott and Fleuriot's HOL Light article carefully, and<br>
also Meikle and Fleuriot's Isabelle paper you cited<br>
<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/6ngakhj9k7qj71th/fulltext.pdf">http://www.springerlink.com/content/6ngakhj9k7qj71th/fulltext.pdf</a>.<br>
I'm annoyed Hilbert wrote such an unreadable book FoG, and I wonder he<br>
didn't take too much credit from Pasch.  So I can learn from Scott,<br>
Fleuriot &amp; Meikle.  But they need to learn how Euclid's errors were<br>
corrected using Hilbert's axioms.  I explain this nicely in<br>
<a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf">http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf</a> <br>
Almost no working mathematicians understand the Euclid and<br>
Hilbert's-axiom story, and I only learned it this year, to help my son<br>
with Geometry, as his textbook was incredibly unrigorous.  He read my<br>
paper and my Mizar code quite carefully, and that's why I'm here.</p>
<p>What Meikle and Fleuriot write here is misleading:</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that Hilbert’s work managed to eradicate<br>
   the need for INTUITION in deriving results.</p>
<p>That's OK if we replace INTUITION by `drawing pictures instead of<br>
using axioms'.  What is generally accepted is that Hilbert’s work<br>
managed to eradicate Euclid's pervasive angle-addition errors.</p>
<p>Back to Scott and Fleuriot, you may be correct that they found an<br>
error involving solid geometry vs plane geometry.  I'll look into it.<br>
But Scott and Fleuriot's full quote is very misleading:</p>
<p>in their attempt to formalise the axiomatics and its elementary<br>
   theorems, Meikle and Fleuriot found many missing lemmas<br>
   [11]. Indeed, IT IS SUFFICIENT to note that Hilbert followed Euclid<br>
   in one pervasive omission: they both give proofs on an ambient<br>
   plane when the axioms characterise solid geometry [8].</p>
<p>It is not sufficient.  We must note that textbooks by Greenberg &amp;<br>
Hartshorne gave acceptably rigorous treatments using Hilbert's axioms,<br>
and nobody has ever given rigorous proofs using Euclid's axioms.</p>
<p>Tim, you really ought to understand the Euclid and Hilbert-axiom<br>
story, being a Tarski geometry guy.  Can you find</p>

<p>From: Bill Richter &lt;<a href="mailto:richter@math.northwestern.edu">richter@math.northwestern.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Our paper aims to provide a formal system, E, that mirrors the<br>
   structure of Euclid's proof. We show how such a system can be<br>
   interpreted in terms of more conventional proof systems (like<br>
   Hilbert's), </p>
<p>Jeremy, this is very interesting, and explained on p 69 of your paper:</p>
<p>ADM&gt; Below, however, we will show that with a modicum of tinkering,<br>
ADM&gt; Tarski’s axioms can be expressed in a restricted form, namely, as<br>
ADM&gt; a system of geometric rules. We will then invoke a cut<br>
ADM&gt; elimination theorem, due to Sara Negri, that shows that if a<br>
ADM&gt; sequent of suitably restricted complexity is provable in the<br>
ADM&gt; system, there is a proof in which every intermediate sequent is<br>
ADM&gt; also of restricted complexity. This will allow us to translate<br>
ADM&gt; proofs in Tarski’s system to proofs in E.</p>
<p>I don't see where you went the other way, translating your proofs into<br>
Tarski axiomatic proofs.  You are saying that rigorous Hilbert/Tarski<br>
axiomatic proofs are simpler than proofs in your framework, right?</p>
<p>Probably you understand the advantage of Tarski's axioms over<br>
Hilbert's, but I'll say it anyway: Mostly the advantage is that Tarski<br>
in a first order axiom basically said that every line is the real<br>
line, so that the model is R x R.  Hilbert got that earlier with a<br>
second order logic axiom, a Dedekind cuts axiom.  Tarski actually only<br>
got F x F, for a real closed field F, but that's good enough, as he<br>
showed that the theory of real closed fields is decidable.  But do you<br>
need decidability?  I see you mention it often.  Ziegler's result that<br>
you cite is used by Greenberg (Amer. Math. Monthly 2010) to show that<br>
Hilbert's first order geometry is undecidable.</p>
<p>but getting Isabelle to verify proofs in E as such would require<br>
   extending Isabelle with some automation to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>But the Isabelle folks are looking for that kinda work (so I copied<br>
the list)!  I think that's why Scott, Fleuriot &amp; Meikle are coding up<br>

<p>From: Bill Richter &lt;<a href="mailto:richter@math.northwestern.edu">richter@math.northwestern.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks for the example, Chris!  I'll have to study it.  Your links<br>
<a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community/Course_Material">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community/Course_Material</a> seemed more about<br>
learning Isabelle (and so relevant to me) than teaching undergraduate<br>
math courses.  But I know Julien Narboux and others are thinking that<br>
way.  I took your advice to read the tutorial, and have a bug report:</p>
<p>I learned interesting Isabelle from Proof General, but not jedit.  I<br>
learned the main thing that I wanted to know: we you can use fancy<br>
symbols Mizar disallows, like ⇒, in isabelle proofs.  I pasted in the<br>
tutorial.pdf file Toylist.thy below of sec 2.3, with the last `done'<br>
commented out. I opened it in jedit:<br>
(localhost)Isabelle2011-1&gt; bin/isabelle jedit Toylist.thy &amp; <br>
and get only the error message</p>
<p>Bad filename "Toylist.thy" for theory ToyList.</p>
<p>So I can't do any of the sec 2.3 tests in jedit!  I think I got some<br>
red wiggly lines of yours, and definitely a red-and-white do not enter<br>
sign on the left of the first line theory ToyList.  So instead I<br>
opened it in Proof Generaland everything works. <br>
(localhost)Isabelle2011-1&gt; bin/isabelle emacs Toylist.thy &amp; </p>
<p>I get the message<br>
       proof (prove): step 2<br>
       goal:<br>
       No subgoals!</p>
<p>By commenting things out and looking at the Proof General output, I<br>
can understand the proof, which I'll explain.  It's about Scheme-type<br>
lists, built with cons (although no car &amp; cdr), and the two simple<br>
list functions append (@) and reverse.  They inductively prove</p>
<p>xs @ [] = xs<br>
(xs @ ys) @ zs = xs @ (ys @ zs)<br>
rev(xs @ ys) = (rev ys) @ (rev xs)<br>
rev(rev xs) = xs</p>
<p>with each proof using the previous results.  We prove each statements<br>
is true for xs = [], and then we prove that the statement for xs<br>
implies the statement for x # xs.  Let's just do the last one:</p>
<p>The base case is easy: <br>
rev(rev []) = rev([]) = []<br>
Now note that <br>
rev([x]) = rev(x # []) = rev([]) @ (x # []) = [] @ (x # []) = x # []</p>
<p>Now assume theorem rev_rev is true xs.  Then using lemma rev_app, the<br>
induction assumption and the above, we prove the induction equation:</p>
<p>rev(rev (x # xs)) = rev(rev(xs) @ [x]) = rev([x]) @ rev(rev(xs)) <br>
= (x # []) @ xs = x # ([] @ xs) = x # xs</p>
<p>That's a nice proof.  I don't know why we have to use strategy auto as<br>
well as induct_tac, because it sure looks like just induction to me. </p>
<p>But if we comment out just the apply(auto) in the proof of theorem<br>
rev_rev, we get the output</p>
<p>proof (prove): step 1</p>
<p>goal (2 subgoals):</p>
<ol>
<li>rev (rev []) = []</li>
<li>\&lt;And&gt;a list. rev (rev list) = list \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; rev (rev (a # list)) = a # list</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, isabelle did nothing put state the inductive case.  It didn't<br>
even prove the base case.  Page 12 of tutorial.pdf says </p>
<p>apply(induct_tac xs)<br>
    This tells Isabelle to perform induction on variable xs. </p>
<p>Apparently that's not true: to perform induction we need also auto.</p>
<p>If we instead comment out  app_assoc and rev_app, we get message<br>
goal (1 subgoal): </p>
<ol>
<li>\&lt;And&gt;a list. rev (rev list) = list \&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; rev (rev list @ a # []) = a # list *)</li>

<p>You're a good teacher, Chris!  You made me think: I was supposed to<br>
write <code>theory toylist', and not </code>theory ToyList' in my Isabelle file.</p>

<p>I need to understand what you mean in order to understand how to write<br>
Isabelle or HOL Light proofs, but what I did is certainly what<br>
mathematicians call an inductive proof.  I showed the results were<br>
true for lists of length 0 (just []), and then assumed the results<br>
were true for all lists of length n, and used that to prove the<br>
results were true for all lists length n+1.  I've heard Schemers call<br>
that tree induction.</p>

<p>From: Lars Noschinski &lt;<a href="mailto:noschinl@in.tum.de">noschinl@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
There are two steps in an inductive proof: In a first step the original <br>
goal ("property holds for all lists") is transformed with an induction <br>
rule in a number of new goals ("property holds for lists of length 0" <br>
and "assuming property holds for all lists of length n, it holds for all <br>
lists of length n + 1"). In a second step these new goals have to be proven.</p>
<p>Isabelle's "induct" and "induct_tac" methods only perform the first <br>
step. This transformation is done purely schematic -- even if e.g. the <br>
base case is trivial, it will not be solved automatically. The second <br>
step needs to be performed explicitly (here "auto").</p>

Dear all,</p>
<p>At the risk of taking the discussion too far from Isabelle, I'd like to <br>
mention that Ed Dean, John Mumma, and I have carried out a detailed <br>
analysis of the style of reasoning one finds in Euclid:</p>
<p>A formal system for Euclid's Elements<br>
   Review of Symbolic Logic, 2:700-768, 2009<br>
<a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/repo_A674ohNM">http://journals.cambridge.org/repo_A674ohNM</a><br>
   (additional links and errata are on my web page)</p>
<p>We argue that Euclid is more rigorous than is commonly acknowledged, in <br>
that there are clearly discernible norms to diagrammatic reasoning <br>
(though they are different from the norms of axiom-based proof). We also <br>
note that Euclidean theorems have a very restricted logical form, and <br>
show that his methods are complete (for that class of sentences) with <br>
respect to the modern semantics of ruler-and-compass constructions.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>

Thank you very much Makarius, for a long interesting lecture.  I<br>
didn't know any of that stuff.  This in particular:</p>
<p>If you take HOL as a simplified version of set-theory with explicit<br>
   syntactic types it is OK as a start.</p>
<p>But I think we'd communicate a lot better if you understood math<br>
logic, from say Enderton's book Mathematical Logic.  Until then you<br>
won't know why I'm floundering.  I apologize if I misunderstand you.</p>
<p>I can only guess what you mean by "strict axiomatic FOL proof".</p>
<p>I mean what Enderton means (same for `models'), and I'd like you to<br>
know too.  Look, you're really good at what you do, and you<br>
communicate really well, and you go to the trouble to speak<br>
intelligibly to newbies like me... but don't you want to know the<br>
proof of the Goedel incompleteness theorem?</p>
<p>Anyway, eventually I'll take all of your suggestions.  I'll go through<br>
the Isar manuals and learn Pure + Isar and see how close that is to<br>
Enderton's FOL.  I want to learn!  Isabelle is the only proof<br>
assistant with nice fonts and serious documentation.</p>

Dear Bill,</p>
<p>I haven't been following this thread in detail, so I am not sure what<br>
you've been told already. Surely you realize that FOL is just one logic<br>
(albeit an important one). There are many other logics, and interactive<br>
proof assistants are usually <em>not</em> built on FOL.</p>
<p>There are very good reasons for this design choice, but it also has its<br>
drawbacks. For instance, it tends to puzzle mathematicians with an<br>
interest in foundations who have been taught that everything rests on<br>
FOL and ZFC.</p>
<p>If you are specifically looking for systems that perform (automated)<br>
first-order reasoning, take a look at<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving</a></p>

Thanks, Tjark and Konrad!  I'll read the HOL paper, which looks pretty<br>
old, and so is maybe something that everyone just assumes nowadays.  I<br>
don't know about those other first-order reasoning<br>
Automated_theorem_provers, or why folks don't use them.  My interest<br>
in proof assistants (HOL Light, Isabelle, Coq) is that Tom Hales is<br>
using them to formalize his Kepler conjecture proof.  </p>
<p>it tends to puzzle mathematicians with an interest in foundations<br>
   who have been taught that everything rests on FOL and ZFC.</p>
<p>Tjark, you understand my confusion!  Is something written about this?<br>
I do contend that it's true what mathematicians are taught, but it may<br>
not appear to be true at the technical level that proof assistants<br>
operate on.  That's of course fine, but I need to see the underlying<br>
FOL and ZFC, even if the proof assistants aren't coded that way.</p>

<p>Possible reasons include:</p>
<p>1. FOL isn't expressive enough for their problems. It might technically<br>

<p>That having been said, I'm under the impression that the world of automated<br>
proving is always getting better. I don't know much about it because I<br>

Ideally, interactive provers should only benefit from progress in<br>
automation, since automatic tools can be integrated into interactive proof<br>

<p>It's not just a matter of how the proof assistant is coded. The underlying<br>
logic of Isabelle/HOL is not FOL. (There is, of course, Isabelle/ZF, which<br>
does use FOL and the ZF axioms.)<br>
The piece of writing I think you might find enlightening is Andy Pitts's<br>
document on the semantics of HOL.<br>
It is the "Logic" manual available here<br>
<a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/documentation.html">http://hol.sourceforge.net/documentation.html</a>.<br>
Note it is for the HOL4 system, not Isabelle/HOL, but since it's mainly<br>
about the logic, HOL, itself, that those proof assistants basically share,<br>
this shouldn't matter too much.<br>
It gives a precise description of the syntax and semantics of HOL. The<br>
semantics is given in terms of set-theoretic models, with which you're<br>
probably more familiar.<br>
I'll be happy to answer any questions about it. I was thinking of giving<br>
you syntax and semantics of FOL and then of HOL so you could see them<br>
compared, but that document is better presented than what I would have<br>
written.<br>
(By the way, FOL formulas can be embedded in HOL.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The phrase "all theorems of a model of the natural numbers" would perhaps<br>
better read "all and only true statements about the natural numbers".<br>
To me, theorems are statements with proofs, and models of a statement or a<br>
theory are structures that make that statement or theory true.</p>
<p>The Completeness Theorem says that if a statement is true in every<br>
structure (i.e. every structure models the statement), then the statement<br>
has a proof.<br>
(Implicitly, we first fix a first-order theory, i.e. a set of axioms and a<br>
signature, then only consider statements in the language of that signature,<br>
structures over that signature, and proofs over those axioms. The<br>
Completeness Theorem holds no matter what theory we choose.)<br>
If the set of axioms can be generated by a computer, then all (and only)<br>
the provable statements of a theory can also be generated by a computer.<br>
This is why first-order logic is "semidecidable".</p>
<p>The First Incompleteness Theorem says that if we fix a theory whose axioms<br>
can be generated by a computer, whose signature allows the natural numbers<br>
as a structure, and which proves various statements about the natural<br>
numbers (e.g. Peano's axioms) but doesn't prove every statement (i.e. it is<br>
consistent), then there exists some statement which is true in the natural<br>
numbers but not provable.<br>
Notes: Since the theory proves Peano's axioms but is consistent, the<br>
natural numbers must be a model of this theory. But by the Completeness<br>
Theorem, the unprovable statement cannot be true in all models of this<br>
theory. Therefore the theory must have another "non-standard" model where<br>
the unprovable statement is false.</p>
<p>What you said about a computer program not being able to print all theorems<br>
is not a limitation of computer programs (because a program can always<br>
print out all theorems of a first order theory). It's a limitation of<br>
first-order theories to capture the natural numbers: they always end up<br>
also being true of non-standard models that differ from the natural numbers<br>
but the theory can't tell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's a simpler related result I don't know the name of, which says<br>
that given any nice set of FOL axioms, you can write a computer<br>
program to print out all the theorems that follow from them,<br>
i.e. theorems which have axiomatic FOL proofs using these axioms.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. I'm not sure this result has any particular name. The "nice set" of<br>
FOL axioms means a "recursively enumerable set".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mathematicians basically restrict themselves to the FOL ZFC set theory<br>
axioms, and so we can write a computer program that will print out (if<br>
it runs indefinitely) every theorem that mathematicians well ever<br>
prove (unless they adopt new axioms). Turing's proof of the Halting<br>
problem (you can't write a infinite-loop checker) is just a<br>
restatement of the Goedel incompleteness theorem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lambda Calculus comes out of math logic, as it gives a definition of a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>recursive<br>
function that's equivalent to Turing-machine definable.</p>
<p>The whole point of proof assistants is to make this math logic work!<br>
Nobody's gonna run the simple program that prints out all the theorems<br>
that follow from the FOL ZFC axioms and wait for a good theorem to pop<br>
up.  But you folks have written lots of smart proof assistants which<br>
do great work on today's incredibly fast machines.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit of clarification: proof assistants usually consist of a proof<br>
checking part and a proof development part. The proof checking part simply<br>
checks that proofs are valid proofs, i.e. they come from the axioms via<br>
inference rules. The proof development part may include tools for<br>
structuring theories and tools for generating proofs automatically or<br>
semi-automatically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what do proof assistants (Coq, Isabelle, HOL Light) do?  I would<br>
assume they all start with some FOL axioms and then deduce axiomatic<br>
FOL proofs as one discusses in math logic.  I contend that the proof<br>
assistants must do that, because (by math logic) they can't do<br>
anything else!  And the mathematicians can't do anything else either!<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No it's not true, because neither proof assistants nor mathematicians are<br>
restricted to FOL.<br>
Also, none of the proof systems really do any proving (unless you count the<br>
automated components); rather, they enable you to construct a formal proof,<br>
while checking all the time that what you're doing is valid.<br>
In HOL Light and Isabelle/HOL (Isabelle itself is a logical framework that<br>
can be instantiated at many different logics) let you conclude statements<br>
that are either HOL axioms or derived from other theorems via HOL rules of<br>
inference. The Wikipedia page has a list of the inference rules for HOL<br>
Light <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOL_Light">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOL_Light</a>. These systems don't actually<br>
construct proofs (by default); rather, they construct "theorem" objects,<br>
and limit the methods for constructing theorems to exactly the rules of<br>
inference, thereby ensuring that whenever you have a theorem object, you<br>
know a proof of it must exist (it was created ephemerally and dynamically<br>
in the object's creation). This is the so-called "LCF approach".<br>
Coq, on the other hand, does construct proofs by default, but in another<br>
logic again: dependent type theory. In this logic, the proofs and the<br>
statements live in the same language.<br>
I'm sure others will be able to fill in more details here if you're<br>
interested...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I'm puzzled because almost nobody talks this way in the proof<br>
assistant world.  Mizar (and Freek's miz3 port to HOL Light) seems<br>
reasonably close to FOL axiomatic proofs.  Although I don't know<br>
exactly how close.  I have this vague idea that Mizar does axiomatic<br>
FOL proofs with a lot of the tedium automated away, e.g. manually<br>
substituting variables.  But I don't know.  The things that folks<br>
actually do---HOL, Isar, Pure---I don't understand.  I would need to<br>
have them explained in terms of Goedel's field of math logic,<br>
i.e. axiomatic FOL proofs. So I propose that if someone knows the answer,<br>
they tell me, and if nobody knows the<br>
answer, let's run a thread on math logic which will eventually explain<br>
how HOL, Isar, Pure etc relate to Goedel's FOL.  I have very little to<br>
contribute to such a thread beyond the note on the LC Y combinator and<br>
Goedel incompleteness below.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, perhaps we can continue after you've read about the syntax and<br>
semantics of HOL and let's see if you have more specific questions then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>--<br>
Best,<br>
Bill</p>
<p>We can understand Odifreddi's [p 80--1] startling remark that the Y<br>
combinator "embodies the argument used in Russell's paradox" from<br>
Boolos &amp; Jeffries [Ch 14-15].</p>
<p>That is, I'll show how the Lambda Calculus Y combinator comes from<br>
Goedel Incompleteness, and how Goedel I sort of comes from Russell's<br>
paradox.  In particular, B&amp;J's treatment of the Goedel fixed point<br>
theorem is much clearer than Barendregt's [Thm (Goedel), sec 6.7].</p>
<p><strong>*</strong><strong>* Goedel's fixed point thm =&gt; Y combinator </strong><strong>*</strong>*</p>
<p>For any expression B(y) of number theory, B&amp;J [Lem 2, p 173] show<br>
there exists an expression F(x) such that for any expression M(x),</p>
<p>Q |-   F( #M ) &lt;--&gt; B( #M(#M) )</p>
<p>where Q is the minimal axiom set for number theory [B&amp;J Ch 14], s.t. a<br>
partial function N ---&gt; N is representable in Q iff it's<br>
recursive.  I'm denoting Goedel numbers by #.</p>
<p>Then letting G = F(#F) and plugging in, we have Goedel's result</p>
<p>Q |-  G &lt;--&gt; B( #G )</p>
<p>Well, that gives us the Y combinator, just take out the #s and the<br>
Qs.  We want</p>
<p>(F M) = (B (M M))</p>
<p>for all M, so we let</p>
<p>F = \m. B (m m)<br>
         G = F F<br>
then<br>
         G = B G</p>
<p>giving us the fixed point for B, which we encode as the Y combinator</p>
<p>Y = \b. (\f. f f) (\m. b (m m))</p>
<p>That's the only reasonable motivation I've ever seen for the Y<br>
combinator.  And maybe that explains that LC_v requires LC: as you<br>
say, LC_v is for programming, LC is for Math logic.  But we need Y in<br>
order to be able to derive the harder Y_v.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong><strong>* Goedel fixed point thm =&gt; Goedel I </strong><strong>*</strong>*</p>
<p>Let E be the expression of number theory, E_0 the closed expressions,<br>
or statements.  Let Th(N) be the statements that are true in the<br>
standard model of N.  We'll write, for statements f in E_0,</p>
<p>|= f</p>
<p>if f in Th(N).</p>
<p>Goedel proved that Th(N) is not decidable, meaning there is no<br>
expression B(x) in E such that for any statement f in E_0,</p>
<p>|=  f   if   Q |-  B(#f)<br>
|= -f   if   Q |- -B(#f)</p>
<p>But this statement implies the more tractable sounding</p>
<p>|= f <br>

<p>From: <a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a><br>
Define a system of logic as a language with rules of inference to <br>
interpret the language.</p>
<p>Define a language as a set of symbols with a set of rules for combining <br>
the symbols.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is the meta-language which is used to describe and <br>
define the object-language.</p>
<p>Let the choices of the meta-language be Isabelle/FOL or Isabelle/HOL, <br>
and let the object-language be Tarski Geometry.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski's_axioms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski's_axioms</a></p>
<p>The question becomes this: Can either of these be used as a <br>
meta-language to implement the object-language of Tarski Geometry?</p>
<p>To answer that question we can ask these questions:<br>
       1) Do these object-languages have the symbols we need for<br>
          Tarski Geometry, and let us combine them in the proper way<br>
          to create the language of Tarski Geometry.<br>
       2) Do these object-languages have rules of inference that allow<br>
          us to interpret the language correctly.</p>
<p>Isabelle/HOL has the standard set of logical connectives and <br>
quantifiers, and it has natural deduction rules of inference. The syntax <br>
it forces on you appears to be compatible with Tarski Geometry. It looks <br>
like Isabelle/HOL can work as a meta-language to describe, define, and <br>
use Tarski Geometry.</p>
<p>But I drop back concerning FOL.</p>
<p>Slawomir, you say that ZF is built on FOL. But the language of <br>
first-order logic is a family of languages. Zermelo-Frankael sets isn't <br>
built on a language of FOL, it is a first-order language, that is, a <br>
language of first-order logic. Conceptually, Isabelle/FOL + Isabelle/ZF <br>
is the first-order language of Zermelo-Frankael sets.</p>
<p>[pg.19, Language, Proof, and Logic, Barwise &amp; Etchemendy]<br>
    ...we talked about FOL as though it were a single language.<br>
    Actually, it is more like a family of languages, all having a<br>
    similar grammar and sharing certain important vocabulary items,<br>
    known as the connectives and quantifiers. Languages in this family<br>
    can differ, however, in the specific vocabulary used to form their<br>
    most basic sentences, the so-called atomic sentences.</p>
<p>Please refer to Bilaniuk's free book "A Problem Course in Mathematical <br>
Logic", Def.5.1 Symbols pg.24, Def.5.2 Terms pg. 26, and Def.5.3 <br>
Formulas pg.27, though a friendlier definition of the symbols would give <br>
us the full set of logical connectives and both the quantifiers.</p>
<p><a href="http://euclid.trentu.ca/math/sb/pcml/pcml.html">http://euclid.trentu.ca/math/sb/pcml/pcml.html</a></p>
<p>Every first-order language must meet the requirements of the logical <br>
symbols, which are Definition 5.1 items 1 to 5; it's the non-logical <br>
symbols that allow them to be unique, Definition 5.1 items 6 to 8.</p>
<p>For the non-logical symbols, ZF has no constant or function symbols, and <br>
it has membership as the one predicate symbol.</p>
<p>Now I switch to Tarski Geometry. I look at the wiki page, and it tells <br>
me that it can formulated as a first-order language with the predicates <br>
"betweenness" and "congruence".</p>
<p>Okay, but to elaborate on question 2 above, can Isabelle/FOL provide the <br>
predicate "betweenness" to the first-order language of Tarski Geometry?</p>
<p>I go out on a limb now, and I say that first-order languages can only be <br>
given predicates; that is, one language of FOL acting as a meta-language <br>
can't create new predicates when creating a new language of FOL.</p>
<p>I could be wrong in my last paragraph. Regardless, if you're creating <br>
predicates for Tarski Geometry, where the logic you're using is <br>
Isabelle/FOL, aren't you really operating in the realm of "functional <br>
programming"/"Isabelle's meta-logic"/ML/HOL/etc..</p>
<p>Regardless again, Isabelle/HOL appears to have the necessary ingredients <br>
to act as a meta-language for any FOL object-language. When different <br>
logics can be cleanly used as a meta-language to implement a particular <br>
object-language, can it not be a case of "six of one, or a half dozen of <br>
the other"?</p>
<p>There is the issue of minimalism. But if you only had to import <br>
src/HOL/HOL.thy to implement Tarski Geometry, that would be pretty minimal.</p>
<p>I stop here. These have been the comments of a novice speaking from the <br>
peanut gallery.</p>

I certainly do not want to get dragged into these interminable discussions. However, as a general remark: there is nothing mysterious about diagonalization functions. For example, the one for Russell's paradox is simply {X. X notin X}. Here, of course, the notion of computable is irrelevant, but it's certainly easily defined.</p>
<p>For proving undecidability of the halting problem, the definition is equally simple and it is computable if you assume the halting test itself to be computable, which is the point of the theorem.</p>

Jens:</p>
<p>It is certainly possible to prove in Coq (= constructively,<br>
I hope)  that there is no surjection from a set to its<br>
powerset.  I am not a regular Coq user so my proof probably<br>
is twice as long as is necessary, and also it feels rather<br>
strange to post a Coq script to an Isabelle mailing list,<br>
but something like</p>
<p>Lemma diagonal : forall A : Type,<br>
    ~(exists F : A -&gt; (A -&gt; Prop), forall f, exists x, f = F x).<br>
  unfold not. intros A [F H]. set (f := fun x =&gt; not (F x x)).<br>
  elim (H f). clear H. intros x H. assert (H' : f x &lt;-&gt; F x x).<br>
  rewrite H. tauto. unfold f in H'. tauto.<br>
  Qed.</p>
<p>seems to work.</p>

<p>From: Bill Richter &lt;<a href="mailto:richter@math.northwestern.edu">richter@math.northwestern.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Ramana, I've been discussing the issue with Freek, who I'm very<br>
impressed with, as miz3 is holding up very well under the torture<br>
testing my 1300 lines of Hilbert axiomatic geometry code<br>
<a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/OpenIntervalHilbertAxiom.ml">http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/OpenIntervalHilbertAxiom.ml</a>.<br>
The issue is almost entirely a matter of terminology.  I say that the<br>
proof assistant (PA) world ought to explain how to translate the<br>
language of mathematical logic books (e.g. Enderton's) into PA<br>
terminology.  In particular there's the vexing issue of the term FOL.</p>
<p>I'm really happy with your understanding of Goedel Incompleteness:</p>
<p>The First Incompleteness Theorem says that if we fix a theory whose<br>
   axioms can be generated by a computer,[...] </p>
<p>Yes!  And in math logic books, this is called FOL, and the infinite<br>
set of axioms in ZFC fit into what they call axiom schemes.  You<br>
understand the infinite axiom biz quite well, as we see again here:</p>
<p>If the set of axioms can be generated by a computer, then all (and<br>
   only) the provable statements of a theory can also be generated by<br>
   a computer.  This is why first-order logic [FOL] is "semidecidable".</p>
<p>Great!  That's my meaning of FOL, which you used again here:</p>
<p>Right. I'm not sure this result has any particular name. The "nice set" of<br>
   FOL axioms means a "recursively enumerable set".</p>
<p>But now you mystify me by disagreeing with me at the end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what do proof assistants (Coq, Isabelle, HOL Light) do?  I<br>
would assume they all start with some FOL axioms and then deduce<br>
axiomatic FOL proofs as one discusses in math logic.  I contend<br>
that the proof assistants must do that, because (by math logic)<br>
they can't do anything else!  And the mathematicians can't do<br>
anything else either!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No it's not true, because neither proof assistants nor<br>
   mathematicians are restricted to FOL.</p>
<p>Now I think you switched over to to the (apparently more restrictive)<br>
PA meaning of FOL.  I contend that what I said is true, in the<br>
following sense explained commonly in set theory books: Every theorem<br>
proved today by mainstream mathematicians (let's forget large cardinal<br>
axioms) has an FOL proof in ZFC.  Of course it would be extremely<br>
inconvenient for mathematicians to write up FOL ZFC proofs!  Are we<br>
arguing about what's convenient?  I just want to see the big picture<br>
right now, how PAs relate to the FOL math logic which I only<br>
understand at a big picture level anyway.</p>

<p>From: Bill Richter &lt;<a href="mailto:richter@math.northwestern.edu">richter@math.northwestern.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Makarius, I don't care for the way I wrote last time, and it took me<br>
this long to come up with a nicer way to say it, which is:</p>
<p>I'm trying to use my math skills to get into the proof assistant game.<br>
I know all of you are much better than I am at CS, and I would think<br>
that you would all be better than I at mathematical logic as well.<br>
And maybe you are, but I think I understand something that nobody ever<br>
writes, so I wonder if folks do understand this.  </p>
<p>Mathematical logic studies what you can and can't prove axiomatically<br>
in first order logic (FOL). The Goedel Completeness Theorem<br>
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoedelsCompletenessTheorem.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoedelsCompletenessTheorem.html</a> says<br>
truth in every model implies an axiomatic proof, and the Goedel<br>
Incompleteness Theorem says you can't write a computer program that<br>
will print out all theorems of a model of the natural numbers:<br>
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoedelsFirstIncompletenessTheorem.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoedelsFirstIncompletenessTheorem.html</a><br>
There's a simpler related result I don't know the name of, which says<br>
that given any nice set of FOL axioms, you can write a computer<br>
program to print out all the theorems that follow from them,<br>
i.e. theorems which have axiomatic FOL proofs using these axioms.<br>
Mathematicians basically restrict themselves to the FOL ZFC set theory<br>
axioms, and so we can write a computer program that will print out (if<br>
it runs indefinitely) every theorem that mathematicians well ever<br>
prove (unless they adopt new axioms).  Turing's proof of the Halting<br>
problem (you can't write a infinite-loop checker) is just a<br>
restatement of the Goedel incompleteness theorem.  The Lambda Calculus<br>
comes out of math logic, as it gives a definition of a recursive<br>
function that's equivalent to Turing-machine definable.</p>
<p>The whole point of proof assistants is to make this math logic work!<br>
Nobody's gonna run the simple program that prints out all the theorems<br>
that follow from the FOL ZFC axioms and wait for a good theorem to pop<br>
up.  But you folks have written lots of smart proof assistants which<br>
do great work on today's incredibly fast machines.</p>
<p>So what do proof assistants (Coq, Isabelle, HOL Light) do?  I would<br>
assume they all start with some FOL axioms and then deduce axiomatic<br>
FOL proofs as one discusses in math logic.  I contend that the proof<br>
assistants must do that, because (by math logic) they can't do<br>
anything else!  And the mathematicians can't do anything else either!</p>
<p>But I'm puzzled because almost nobody talks this way in the proof<br>
assistant world.  Mizar (and Freek's miz3 port to HOL Light) seems<br>
reasonably close to FOL axiomatic proofs.  Although I don't know<br>
exactly how close.  I have this vague idea that Mizar does axiomatic<br>
FOL proofs with a lot of the tedium automated away, e.g. manually<br>
substituting variables.  But I don't know.  The things that folks<br>
actually do---HOL, Isar, Pure---I don't understand.  I would need to<br>
have them explained in terms of Goedel's field of math logic,<br>
i.e. axiomatic FOL proofs. So I propose that </p>
<p>if someone knows the answer, they tell me, and if nobody knows the<br>
answer, let's run a thread on math logic which will eventually explain<br>
how HOL, Isar, Pure etc relate to Goedel's FOL.  I have very little to<br>
contribute to such a thread beyond the note on the LC Y combinator and<br>
Goedel incompleteness below.</p>

It's lemma A1', not just A1.  Its purpose is to turn axiom A1, which is<br>
a sentence, into something more useful, with schematic variables that<br>
can be instantiated.  I think I figured out later that A1 [rule_format]<br>
would achieve the same thing, without having to prove lemma A1' separately.</p>
<p>Sorry; it's taken me an awfully long time to get around to this, and<br>
perhaps it's already been answered, but perhaps my answer will be useful<br>
for someone.</p>

<p>From: "Tim (McKenzie) Makarios" &lt;<a href="mailto:tjm1983@gmail.com">tjm1983@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Tarski's axiom of continuity comes in two versions: a first-order axiom<br>
schema, or a single higher-order axiom.  If you use the higher-order<br>
axiom, his axiom system is categorical.  So, yes, there is a good reason<br>
for using HOL for Tarski's axioms.</p>
<p>Again, sorry for taking so long to make this point.</p>
