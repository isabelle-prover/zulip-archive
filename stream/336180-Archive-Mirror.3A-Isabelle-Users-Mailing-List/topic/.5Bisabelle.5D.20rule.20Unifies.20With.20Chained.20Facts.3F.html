<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
The treatment of chained facts by "rule" is inherent in the way how Isar <br>
really works.  Part of the confusion stems from the very liberal language <br>
design which also admits many "improper" elements in the same language.</p>
<p>If you really want to understand structure Isar proofs, not proof scripts, <br>
you need to become acquainted with Isar rule composition.</p>

<p>Yes, the initial proof method of 'by' is just one big expressen, where <br>

<p>Isar is about structure, but here it would get lost in the dark goal <br>

<p>The manuals are not really up to date.  I hope to be able to work again on <br>
a proper Isar tutorial for structured proofs.</p>
<p>I did not understand what you mean by "general difference between <br>

<p>Probably there is again a confusion by taking the printed goal state too <br>

"by blast" and "by - blast" should be always the same.</p>
<p>Since blast is a "simple method" it first uses "insert" to dump the facts <br>
into the goal state and then tries its luck on the result.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Actually you can have a difference if the goal state has &gt; 1 subgoals, <br>
e.g. like this:</p>
<p>notepad<br>
begin<br>
   assume B<br>
   then have "A --&gt; A" and B by - blast<br>
end</p>
<p>Here the "dumping" of facts is only weakly structured: all subgoals are <br>
augmented uniformly.  The "blast" then solves the first, while the other <br>
is implicitly closed as trivial in the end.</p>
<p>The defaults of the Isar language attempt to maximize proof structure, <br>
e.g. one should not attempt to escape from that without good reasons.</p>

<p>There is no problem with that.  In general there are many very delicate <br>
points in Isar, but it is partly successful since it can be used without <br>
going to the bottom of every detail.  Instead, the usual way is to imitate <br>
"best-style" proofs.  Unfortunately, not all examples in the libraries are <br>
good ones.</p>

<p>By being lucky in the selection of manuals or chosing the teacher.  This <br>
very issue of "initial method" vs. "terminal method" should also have been <br>
mentioned quite often on the mailing list.</p>

more explicitly (e.g. in the Prover IDE), although I can also foresee lots <br>

Hi, I'm having trouble understanding how the rule/erule method interacts<br>
with the subtle difference between `this' and ==&gt;.  Given an<br>
introduction rule</p>
<p>P<br>
  -<br>
  Q</p>
<p>and a goal state with a chained fact</p>
<p>(* call this state 1 *)<br>
  using this:<br>
    R<br>
  goal:<br>
    Q</p>
<p>the tutorial says the rule method unifies only the Q's, but it appears<br>
to be matching P to R as well, failing if they don't match.  But if the<br>
goal state were</p>
<p>(* call this state 2 *)<br>
  (`this' is empty)<br>
  goal:<br>
    R ==&gt; Q</p>
<p>then no matching seems to happen between P and R, and the method<br>
succeeds.  I'm including a minimal concrete example below.  A similar,<br>
but opposite, thing seems to happen with erule, which appears to<br>
(sometimes?  always?) neglect chained facts when it searches for<br>
formulas to consume.</p>
<p>So exactly which combinations of formulas do rule and erule unify?<br>
Where could I have found this information?</p>
<p>When I have state 1, how do I massage it into state 2 so that I can<br>
invoke rule without unifying the rule's premises to anything, or erule<br>
with unification to `this'?  Why wouldn't Isabelle do this massaging for<br>
me?</p>

<p>Hi Jun,</p>
<p>This particular question, at least, has an easy answer: just use<br>

(rule exI)" in several places in HOLCF where "by (rule exI)" fails for<br>

<p>The theorem list "assms" only includes propositions listed in<br>
"assumes" clauses. Since there are no "assumes" clauses in either of<br>
the last two theorems, "assms" is actually empty, so there are no<br>

<p>For the record, if anyone reads this in the archives: "by - (rule foo)"<br>

<p>I tripped over this separation between assumptions before, when I found<br>
that "show" doesn't unify exported premises with any pending goal's<br>
premises but only assumptions with goals' premises.  Why does Isar have<br>
this (IMHO idiosyncratic) distinction between assumptions and premises?<br>
I suppose it's there for a reason, but to me it seems like Isar would be<br>
more streamlined and novice-friendly if the two notions are identified,<br>
or always automatically bridged.</p>
<p>PS.  Not to be too nosy here, but if the authors of the Isabelle<br>
Tutorial ever see this, please consider making a little note of this<br>
behavior of "rule" in Section 5.7 (or maybe in the "Structured Proofs in<br>
Isar/HOL" document).  Clearly pointing out the general difference<br>
between assumptions and premises could be even better...</p>

<p>The theorem list "assms" only includes propositions listed in<br>
"assumes" clauses. Since there are no "assumes" clauses in either of<br>
the last two theorems, "assms" is actually empty, so there are no<br>
chained facts, and "rule" doesn't try to unify with any assumptions.</p>

<p>From: Rafal Kolanski &lt;<a href="mailto:rafalk@cse.unsw.edu.au">rafalk@cse.unsw.edu.au</a>&gt;<br>
I agree. At the very least, this is non-obvious. I still get caught by <br>
this occasionally. I've trained myself that rule/erule/drule and <br>
assumption require the use of - first, while auto and (clar)simp do not. <br>
I still remain surprised whenever I have to replace "by blast" with "by </p>
<ul>
<li>blast". As for fastsimp, force and metis... I just don't remember.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I suppose I could just go around using auto and metis everywhere, <br>
I don't think that's necessarily a good idea, as it miscommunicates to <br>
the reader/maintainer how involved the proof step is. I will use <br>
assumption when that's all that's needed, blast when there's no <br>
simplification needed, and prefer simp over auto.</p>
<p>Anyway, my proposal would be to add an implicit "-" to blast and any <br>
official tactic that can finish a proof, and document in the tutorial <br>
and reference the fact that rule/erule/drule (and whatever else) don't <br>
do this, like Jun suggested.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rafal Kolanski.</p>
