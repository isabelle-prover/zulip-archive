<p>From: "Elsa L. Gunter" &lt;<a href="mailto:egunter@illinois.edu">egunter@illinois.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Dear Isabelle Community,<br>
   I am having grave problems with the execution of Isabelle-2014, and I <br>
have not found a thread on this mailing list that seems to address my <br>
problem.  Isabelle is taking arbitrarily long in between steps of proof, <br>
and other things, where arbitrarily long is minutes to hours to <br>
overnight without completing.  And while I suspect that I may be <br>
contributing to the problem by there being a rewrite that I have added <br>
that has led to a non-confluent system, the system tight now has taken <br>
more then an hour to try to do a thin_tac, which should never be <br>
non-terminating.  And despite the length of time I have waited, it <br>
almost surely will come back, eventually (in the temporal logic sense of <br>
unbounded eventually). But this is making it really painful to try to <br>
make any progress.<br>
   Some background for anybody who might have an idea how to help me.  <br>
First, my system is a mac running Mac OX X 10.9.5 (maverick, with <br>
patches); processor is a 2.8 GHz Intel Core 17 with 4 cores (1 <br>
processor), 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Memory.  I am running Isabelle 2014 with <br>
a fairly recent version of the Archive of Formal Proofs.  My preferences <br>
file is quite minimal, and makes no mention of threads.   My code <br>
depends on the List-Infinite and JinjaThreads.  I have a collection of <br>
twelve locally developed theories upon which I also depend.   The local <br>
theories accumulate to something more than 10000 loc. I have previously <br>
built a heap containing the AFP theories, and I start form that heap.  I <br>
thought I might reduce the problem by building a heap containing the all <br>
the local theories upon which I depend, but that build never terminated <br>
(I let it run overnight, ~10 hours).  I found that strange, since it <br>
takes about 10 minutes for it to build the local theories upon which I <br>
am depending when I am interactively loading the desired theory from a <br>
base containing just the AFP stuff I need.  I've tried it twice, but it <br>
is a time-consuming, unproductive exercise.<br>
   When Isabelle is semi-non-responsive, it usually colors all of the <br>
text grey (not purple).  I haven't been able to tell which of the greys <br>
it is.   Just now, while writing this message, the thin_tac I requested <br>
can back (correctly), and then I deleted the line after it, causing the <br>
cursor to be again immediately after the thin_tac.  The text was greyed <br>
out again, and then after a couple of minutes it became clear with the <br>
thin_tac line yellow, but it is failing to display the output.  I <br>
presume it will in a little while.   I have had problems along these <br>
lines, but less severe ever since switching to jEdit from Proof General, <br>
with the problem seeming to grow some since the beginning of the <br>
semester (January), but with it getting an order of magnitude worse in <br>
the last week.  The problem's getting worse seemed to be temporally <br>
correlated with my doing a proof that involved a term that was about 40 <br>
lines long (the term, that is).  Other than that, I'm not using metis or <br>
smt, and rarely auto or force or blast.  simp and clarsimp get used a <br>
fair amount, so nonterminating rewrites might have something to do with <br>
my problem, except I would expect it to just always fail to come back, <br>
which is not its behavior.  There are a few bits of orange (warnings) in <br>
some of the files upon which I depend, but I have removed them all from <br>
the current file.  I have observed that ambiguous parses, where only one <br>
is type correct, slow Isabelle down very considerably.  My proofs ar a <br>
mix of Isar style and old apply style, with most of the recent additions <br>
being in the old apply style.    I do have a fairly large number of <br>
locales I'm working with, and doing a print_locale! is just out of the <br>
question.   Each time the evaluation has to go through the creation of a <br>
new layer of locale by combining specialized versions of previous one, <br>
together with additions, that is always a choke point in the <br>
computation.  I can't  think of any other observations I have made that <br>
might be relevant.<br>
   This matter is rather urgent to me. I am teaching a course this <br>
semester based on the use of Isabelle, with students working on a large <br>
combined project, each with his or her own part.  I need to be helping <br>
them fairly regularly, in part by giving them extra lemmas about the <br>
core infrastructure that groups of them need to overcome various hurdles <br>
they face in their subprojects.  I have told them lemma statements to <br>
add to their code with a sorry, and they are proceeding with these, but <br>
the course ends next week, and it would be a great pity not to be able <br>
to provide them with a sense of closure from having all theorems really <br>
and truly proved.  Also, so far the students do not seem to be <br>
struggling with Isabelle delays to the extent I am, but if they suddenly <br>
start having the same problems, I can not feasibly ask them to continue <br>
their work, with would definitely leave them with a lack of closure.  I <br>
would appreciate any help anyone can give to improve this situation.<br>

more.</p>

<p>Non-termination alone should not be a problem: you get deep-purple <br>
feedback in the Prover IDE, and should be able to delete the material to <br>
recover.  Serious problems are usually caused by:</p>
<p>(a) Massive amounts of "potentially useful tracing information" that<br>
       tool implementors sometimes leave in by default (which is very bad<br>
       programming style).  That is the easyiest way to bomb the front-end.</p>
<p>(b) Really huge intermediate goal states that are printed, either<br>
       accidentally or on purpose, e.g. via print_tac. It occasionally<br>
       helps to reduce output size like this:</p>
<p>declare [[goals_limit = 1, show_markup = false]]</p>

<p>This is already quite substantial material.  JinjaThreads is always at <br>
120% of system resources, no matter how much are available.</p>

<p>Here I suspect that the JVM default heap is too small for this amount of <br>
sources.  Try something like this in $ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/settings:</p>
<p>ISABELLE_BUILD_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -Xms1024m -Xmx4096m -Xss4m"</p>
<p>Using a suitable base image can significantly reduce the resource <br>
requirements of the Prover IDE.  Note that the build of the selected base <br>
session of the Prover IDE actually uses the JVM parameters of <br>
Isabelle/jEdit.  The above only applies to "isabelle build" on the <br>
command-line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Isabelle is semi-non-responsive, it usually colors all of the text <br>
grey (not purple).  I haven't been able to tell which of the greys it <br>

<p>That could be outdated_color.  You can change the color value in Plugin <br>
Options / Isabelle / Rendering to check this hypothesis.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Here it is again important to know if poly or java is busy, or both. For <br>
example, it could be a rather long garbage collection of Poly/ML, which is <br>
normal with JinjaThreads in the back.  To amend this, you should use <br>
Poly/ML in 64bit mode like this in $ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/settings:</p>
<p>ML_PLATFORM="$ISABELLE_PLATFORM64"<br>
   ML_HOME="$ML_HOME/../$ML_PLATFORM"</p>
<p>Another possibility is JVM heap space.  You can enlarge that for the <br>
Prover IDE in the .app bundle Info.plist in its &lt;key&gt;JVMOptions&lt;/key&gt; <br>
entry.  For the command-line version of "isabelle jedit" the same <br>
information is in $ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/settings e.g.:</p>
<p>JEDIT_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xms1024m -Xmx4096m -Xss4m"</p>
<p>In both situations, you need to "reboot" the application.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Ambiguous grammars or input can cause exponential blowup of parse trees. <br>

<p>JinjaThreads is already stretching locales and locale interpretation <br>
beyond feasibilty.  If you build on top of some very big locales of that <br>
session, it is likely to cause problems.</p>

wrong, but I think the total code I'm adding on top of bisimulation is <br>
less than the amount I have left out of JinjaThreads.</p>

Hello Elsa.</p>
<p>I'm not completely sure about this, but I have taken the following<br>
actions a couple of times and I <em>think</em> they might have reduced polyML's<br>
memory footprint.</p>
<p>1) Restart Isabelle if polyML is getting too big. I am anecdotally<br>
convinced that sometimes polyML's heap size drifts upwards over time,<br>
and that a restart can reset this.</p>
<p>2) Try enabling "skip-proofs" during the reset while rebuilding up to<br>
where you were before. You can find an option for skipping proofs in<br>
Isabelle's options panel: jEdit menu Plugins-&gt;Plugin Options, pick<br>
Isabelle-&gt;General, find the skip proofs setting. This will not only save<br>
time, it will cause polyML to build less proof-related objects<br>
internally, which may save memory.</p>
<p>Caveat emptor ; all of the above may simply be a superstitious ritual I<br>
go through as a result of confirmation bias.</p>
<p>Good luck,<br>
     Thomas.</p>

Another strategy I find useful is processing the following line when you're running very low on<br>
available memory, which I believe forces a garbage collection.</p>
<p>ML {* PolyML.fullGC () *}</p>
<p>Forcing a garbage collection in a managed language seems rather silly, but I have found it is<br>
sometimes the only way to regain a responsive system.</p>

<p>Isabelle/PIDE is no longer based on a TTY loop, so it is not really <br>
waiting for the next user input.  Rather the editor is continously <br>
streaming edits towards the prover, and the prover continously streaming <br>
results towards the editor.  In practice, this eventually converges, and <br>
both sides can become mostly idle, except for a few percent of CPU time.</p>
<p>If you see 200% CPU usage of poly, despite nothing really going on, it is <br>
something to be investigated.  E.g. there could be a bit too much garbage <br>
collection due to excessive use of heap space.  Or there could be "auto <br>
tools" that did not terminate and could not be canceled properly, or even <br>
just long-running tasks to print proof states after scrolling in the <br>
editor.</p>
<p>Isabelle/jEdit also has a Monitor panel to inspect certain aspects of the <br>
ML run-time system.</p>

<p>Looking in just the right corners of big projects usually helps to get a <br>
factor 2 improvement concerning resource usage.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have already some ideas to reduce the ML heap space <br>
requirements once again, but not for this release of Isabelle2015. The <br>
question is how long we can hold out in 32bit address space, without <br>
having to move to 64bit and thus practically into the cloud, e.g. see the <br>
sketches on my blog <br>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
Here is a rather drastic way to reclaim a lot of heap space by maximal <br>
sharing of equal data structures:</p>
<p>ML "ML_System.share_common_data ()"</p>
<p>It can take minutes, but can shrink the heap by a factor of 2-3, or more. <br>
This is normally used when dumping heap images.</p>
<p>A limited form of that is also used in normal operation of the Poly/ML <br>
runtime-system.  It is the reason why most applications still work within <br>
the tiny 32bit address space.</p>
<p>David Matthews can say more about the various GC phases of Poly/ML.</p>
<p>The "Monitor" dockable in Isabelle/jEdit also has a heap section, which <br>
helps to get some idea about resource usage, and the effect of the above <br>
operations.  Note that while the run-time system is busy doing such jobs, <br>
there is no update of the statistics, because the ML user space is <br>
inactive.</p>

<p>From: David Matthews &lt;<a href="mailto:dm@prolingua.co.uk">dm@prolingua.co.uk</a>&gt;<br>
The garbage collector isn't just a simple case of: run out of heap; <br>
perform GC; resume.  Or at least it hasn't been for a very long time. <br>
The GC code has to decide whether to run a cheap, but incomplete minor <br>
collection; a full but more expensive major collection; increase or <br>
sometimes decrease the size of the heap or run the very expensive data <br>
sharing pass that Makarius mentions.  There's no easy answer to this <br>
because it depends on the pattern of allocations and the kind of data <br>
structures being built.  Indeed the best choice would really depend on <br>
what happens AFTER the collection; the application may be just on the <br>
point of completing when the GC decides to start an expensive operation.</p>
<p>The GC has heuristics to help decide what to do and uses the results of <br>
previous choices to guide the next choice.  For example, if a sharing <br>
pass was run and found lots of sharing it may be worth running it sooner <br>
rather than later.  Much of the tuning was done by looking at large <br>
Isabelle problems and JinjaThreads was the archetypal example.</p>
<p>I'm very happy to look at this and see whether the tuning can be <br>
improved or indeed if garbage collection is the issue or not.  It may be <br>
that there needs to be some extra hints to the GC that can be given as <br>
command line arguments in situations where a user is approaching the <br>
limits on their machine.  One suggestion I'd make is to increase the <br>
value of --maxheap closer to the memory available on your machine (e.g. <br>
--maxheap 14000).  It's not a good idea to increase it above the <br>
physical memory size since that can introduce thrashing but if you're <br>
close to the limit it could be better to tolerate a bit of it.</p>
