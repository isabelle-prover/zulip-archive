<p>From: Matthias Schmalz &lt;<a href="mailto:Matthias.Schmalz@inf.ethz.ch">Matthias.Schmalz@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to use the scala library Pure.jar to communicate with the <br>
Isabelle process. A typical use case is to send a theory snipped like <br>
the following and to check whether the proof attempt succeeds:</p>
<p>theory Test imports Main begin</p>
<p>lemma foo:<br>
fixes x :: bool<br>
assumes "x = True"<br>
shows "x | x"<br>
using assms<br>
by simp</p>
<p>I have already discovered the Isabelle_System.init method and I am aware <br>
of the classes "Isabelle_Process" and "Session". My attempts to <br>
communicate the above snippet to an Isabelle_Process failed due to my <br>
unawareness of the input format of Isabelle_Process.input. (Perhaps, <br>
this is not the intended interface anyway?)<br>
I also tried to use Session.init_node, but I am not sure how to choose <br>
the parameters and how to receive the result.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help on this very much!</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Matthias</p>

First let's fix the Isabelle version for this thread: the latest release <br>
Isabelle2011-1.  It does not make sense to use an older Isabelle version <br>
with Isabelle/Scala, due to the many substantial improvements of the same <br>
that went into Isabelle2011-1.</p>
<p>Direct use of Isabelle_Process.input connects you with the protocol <br>
interpreter on the other side.  It is theoretically possible to extend its <br>
set of protocol commands in user space, but that would mean to produce <br>
your own protocol implementation, which is a bit challenging to get really <br>
right.</p>
<p>It is better to use the official Isabelle/Scala document model, even <br>
though its API in Isabelle2011-1 is still a bit rough, and there are more <br>
details of the mechanics of the underlying interaction model still visible <br>
than I would like to have after 4 years working on that.</p>
<p>Attached is an example for doing the initial startup of the session <br>
together with the theory context; see also <br>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/pide/pide_examples/src/2a4cfab96b3e/ex.scala">https://bitbucket.org/pide/pide_examples/src/2a4cfab96b3e/ex.scala</a> (that <br>
repository might evolve further).</p>
<p>This is how to build and run it with Isabelle2011-1:</p>
<p>shell&gt; isabelle scalac ex.scala<br>
   shell&gt; isabelle scala<br>
   scala&gt; val session = PIDE_examples.Ex.Theory_Session()</p>
<p>The Theory_Session.apply() function has some further optional arguments; <br>
e.g. verbose = true gives you all the low-level protocol messages.</p>
<p>What makes the implementation a bit delicate is the bias of Session <br>
towards the current main application in the Isabelle/jEdit Prover IDE. <br>
Here the user throws edits at the prover, which in turn answers them <br>
incrementally in an fully asynchronous manner.  There is never a point <br>
where a finished execution of some command transaction is enforced. I have <br>
recovered the latter in the above Theory_Session for the first half of the <br>
problem: prover startup and processing the theory header.</p>
<p>So you will get synchrous errors on the command line if anything fails <br>
here, say giving a bad logic image or imports.  If you have your own GUI, <br>
you might reconsider asynchronous startup, see also <br>
~~/src/Tools/jEdit/src/plugin.scala which should give an idea about the <br>
specific wiring with the main jEdit event bus.</p>
<p>What is still missing in the above ex.scala is the part about emitting the <br>
statement and proof, and inspecting its results.  This requires some extra <br>
care due to potential non-termination of that part of the document.</p>
<p>We can discuss in further detail what your application really requires.</p>

<p>Thanks for this example. It clarifies the situation a lot. So new output <br>
by the Isabelle process is announced through the commands_changed bus <br>
and the details on the new document state can be queried with the <br>
snapshot method. I still have difficulties understanding what kind of <br>
information a snapshot provides.</p>
<p>My current view is the following; feel free to correct any <br>
misinterpretations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Document.Node is somehow the counterpart of a text buffer in jEdit.</li>
<li>A Document.Snapshot is the response of the system to a Document.Node.</li>
<li>
<p>The Document.Snapshot.command_state field indicates the response to a <br>
given Isar command within the document node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Command.State.results field indicates what is usually displayed in <br>
the Output Window of jEdit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Command.State.status field gives the annotations displayed with <br>
jEdit's theory buffer.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Document.Node identifies each document node in a semi-abstract manner. <br>
It is indeed modeled after editor text buffers, can be used in other ways <br>
as well.  In the example, I've identified the fresh theory node by some <br>
something like /dummy-42/Theory.thy</p>
<p>Document.Snapshot is the main access point of the totality of a collection <br>
of document nodes in a document version, with semantic markup attached <br>
(via the internal Command.State components).  This is the main programming <br>
interface to access results.  It provides a defined point in space and <br>
time of the ongoing process of continous checking of the sources.  The key <br>
operation is Snapshot.select_markup, but in the present example I have <br>
uses more low-level status and results fields from individual command <br>
states.</p>
<p>Command.State.results and Command.State.status are special cases of the <br>
primary "markup" component of accumulated state information.  In fact, <br>
after Isabelle2011-1 the focus is shifting further to that general markup <br>
tree, and result messages and status information might have to be <br>
retrieved via <a href="http://Snapshot.select">Snapshot.select</a> and some further variants of it.</p>

<p>From: Holger Gast &lt;<a href="mailto:gast@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de">gast@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hi Matthias,</p>
<p>since similar questions have popped up now and then on the list, I<br>
have taken a closer look at your request on the basis of the implementation<br>
of the I3P interface (see my web-page), because in principle<br>
it already offers the required API to do "background proving".</p>
<p>To explain: as desirable for user interface software (see the MVC pattern),<br>
the functionality of I3P is implemented entirely in a self-contained<br>
infrastructure layer that is independent of the Netbeans interface<br>
that happens to access that functionality now.<br>
As a result, extended unit tests can be run against the functionality<br>
(which have greatly helped in maintainance and debugging through<br>
the different Isabelle releases of the past 2 years) and the bulk of the<br>
software becomes portable (e.g. to Eclipse, as done prototypically<br>
in a bachelor thesis in Tübingen). For a fuller motivation and<br>
architecture description, see my UITP '10 paper.</p>
<p>In principle, the infrastructure layer thus enables running Isabelle<br>
as a background prover directly, analogously to the existing unit tests<br>
of the Isabelle driver module. At the core, the it provides a simple<br>
execute/revoke model for commands (based on two methods of<br>
CommandState), while I3P takes care of sending<br>
appropriate Isabelle commands, interrupt signals, etc. as necessary.<br>
(I3P even keeps sending INT until the command stops executing.)</p>
<p>However, the abstractions built into the architecture lead to some<br>
boilerplate code (see the @Before methods of the tests) that is not nice<br>
for the specific application.</p>
<p>I have now added a small IsabelleFacade class (in module APIAccess;<br>
for Facade see Gamma et al. "Design Patterns", 1995),<br>
which hopefully makes the procedure straightforward. The attachment<br>
contains a demonstration of the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>start &amp; stop the prover</li>
<li>
<p>execute theories / individual commands and</p>
<ul>
<li>check for sucess, failure, or non-termination</li>
<li>access the command's results</li>
<li>
<p>interrupt (explicit or automatic) looping commands after<br>
  some specified timeout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bulk proof of several proof attempts in different theories,<br>
  with automatic switching between theories.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SyncExec wrapper adapts the overall asynchronous<br>
  architecture of I3P to the requirement of synchronous processing<br>
  as necessary for testing or background proving. Its (straightforward)<br>
  implementation shows how to work with the signalling mechanisms<br>
  about changes in the processing state of some command in order to<br>
  wait for the completion of processing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The new facade, as well as the most important API classes of the<br>
infrastructure module IAPP, have JavaDoc explanations attached. Please<br>
get back to me if I omitted some lazily, such that I can supply them lazily.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Holger<br>
