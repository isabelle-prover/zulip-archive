<p>From: Peter Sewell &lt;<a href="mailto:Peter.Sewell@cl.cam.ac.uk">Peter.Sewell@cl.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>
We're advertising several positions, as below - if you know suitable<br>
candidates, please pass this on. Thanks - Peter</p>
<p>Research Associates/Senior Research Associates in Rigorous Engineering for<br>
Mainstream Systems (Fixed Term), University of Cambridge</p>
<p>Research Associate £32,816 - £40,322 or Senior Research Associate £41,526 -<br>
£52,559</p>
<p>Fixed-term: The funds for these posts are available for 2 years in the<br>
first instance, with a possibility of extension.</p>
<p>Are you interested in developing and applying semantics and verification<br>
techniques to improve the foundations and security of mainstream computer<br>
systems? We are looking for multiple postdoctoral researchers to do exactly<br>
that, in two related projects:</p>
<p>(1) CHERI verification. CHERI (<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/</a>) extends<br>
conventional Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs) with architectural<br>
capabilities, for fine-grained memory protection and scalable software<br>
compartmentalization. CHERI allows memory-unsafe programming languages, eg<br>
C and C++, to be adapted to protect against many currently widely exploited<br>
security vulnerabilities. CHERI is a hardware/software/semantics co-design<br>
project, combining computer architecture, systems software, security, and<br>
semantics.</p>
<p>In October 2019, Arm announced Morello (<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-morello.html">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-morello.html</a>),<br>
an experimental CHERI-extended ARMv8-A processor, to be available from late<br>
2021. Morello is part of the UKRI £187M Digital Security by Design<br>
Challenge (DSbD), supported by the UK Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund<br>
and over £50M from Arm. Morello will support industrial-scale evaluation of<br>
CHERI, with a view to mass-market adoption - which would transform the<br>
security landscape.</p>
<p>We have previously developed rigorous engineering methods (<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-formal.html">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-formal.html</a>)<br>
to precisely define the CHERI ISA, for CHERI-MIPS and CHERI-RISC-V<br>
variants, and to prove (in Isabelle) that they satisfy key intended<br>
security properties (<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-940.pdf">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-940.pdf</a><br>
).</p>
<p>We are now collaborating with Arm and researchers at Edinburgh to do the<br>
same for the full Morello CHERI ARMv8 ISA, building on our Sail ARMv8-A ISA<br>
semantics (<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/</a>), and to study the<br>
semantics and security of higher-level languages and system software above<br>
CHERI, building on our Cerberus C semantics (<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/</a>). This verification could improve<br>
the security of all Arm mobile device software.</p>
<p>(2) Arm system software verification. We have an ongoing project, in<br>
collaboration with Google and with researchers at multiple institutions, to<br>
establish correctness and security properties of key system software above<br>
the ARMv8-A ISA semantics (<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/</a>),<br>
integrated with the ARMv8-A concurrency architecture (including both the<br>
previous "user-mode" models and the system concurrency semantics, being<br>
developed in collaboration with Arm) (<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/armv8-mca/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/armv8-mca/</a>).</p>
<p>We are looking for postdocs to contribute to all aspects of both projects.<br>
You should have a strong background in semantics and verification, the<br>
motivation and flexibility to develop practical ways to use them at scale<br>
for real systems, and experience in one or more of:</p>
<ul>
<li>interactive theorem proving, in Coq, HOL4, and/or Isabelle</li>
<li>program logics</li>
<li>low-level system software</li>
<li>programming language semantics and type systems</li>
<li>program analysis</li>
<li>hardware verification</li>
<li>functional programming</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also seeking candidates with a research engineering focus, to assist<br>
in the development of robust and widely usable tools based on the above.<br>
For this, you should have experience in functional programming, especially<br>
OCaml.</p>
<p>There might also be the possibility of internship or PhD positions; for<br>
these contact Prof. Sewell.</p>
<p>For more details of our recent work, see (<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/</a>),<br>
and especially REMS (<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/index.html">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/index.html</a>).</p>
<p>The positions are available to start as soon as possible. For candidates<br>
with substantial relevant expertise, we may be able to appoint at the<br>
Senior Research Associate level.</p>
<p>Further details may be obtained from Prof. Peter Sewell,<br>
