Hello all,</p>
<p>Peter Gammie recently brought this issue to my attention (with<br>
"domain" instead of "datatype", but the behavior is the same for<br>
both).</p>
<p>The following datatype definition is accepted without any warning messages:</p>
<p>datatype tree = "tree list"</p>
<p>Can anyone guess what this type definition actually means?</p>
<p>That's right, it defines a datatype with a single nullary constructor,<br>
which is called "tree list". Never mind that the constructor's name<br>
contains a space, and is therefore impossible to parse.</p>
<p>Clearly, no one would ever write such a datatype definition on purpose.</p>
<p>A feature request: If the name of a constant contains a space or other<br>
illegal character, the datatype package should issue an error (or at<br>
the very least, a warning message).</p>

This known problem shows up once a year or so.  By using the proper local <br>
theory layer for the package, it will just dissappear, because there are <br>
sanity checks built in.  Numerous other problems will be solved by <br>
localizing old-style packages.</p>
<p>Just today Alex has pointed out another yearly accident: sort constraints <br>
within type definitions (this time for record).  The basic packages can <br>
(typedecl, typedef, record) now handle that.  The more complex ones <br>
(datatype family, domain) still have their own partial ways of coping with <br>
sorts.</p>
<p>Maybe now is a good time for some spring cleaning, before we get too close <br>
to the next Isabelle release.  (It is already &gt; 4 months after <br>
Isabelle2009-1.)</p>

<p>So will the conversion of the datatype package be part of this "spring<br>
cleaning"? Has anyone committed to doing the conversion? Of course,<br>
I'll take responsibility for converting the domain package, but I need<br>
to have the datatype package done first, so I can see how it's done.</p>

<p>So far it is just another motivitation to start moving towards a localized <br>
version.  The datatype package is very complex, and Stefan Berghofer is <br>
probably the only one who can update it without causing collateral damage.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think Stefan is already trying some small-scale improvements, <br>
although such long standing oddities are hard to reform.  For example, <br>
old-style mixfix notation involves constant names with spaces and with <br>
non-identifier characters, e.g. "op #".  Due to earlier spring cleaning it <br>
might actually work out this time.</p>

<p>Full localization is certainly beyond the spring cleaning, it will take <br>
more time.  If you want to do some moves towards it for the domain <br>
package, I can point to some spots that are probably easy to update.</p>
