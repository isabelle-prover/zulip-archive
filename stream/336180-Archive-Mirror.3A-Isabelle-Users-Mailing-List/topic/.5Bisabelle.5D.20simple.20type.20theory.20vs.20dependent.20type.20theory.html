<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href="mailto:unruh@ut.ee">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>
This is a thing I've always wondered about:</p>
<p>Is there a formal reason why dependent type theory and constructive <br>
logic tend to come together (e.g., difficulties in soundly integrating <br>
the LEM or something),<br>
or is that more of a community thing, i.e., the people who like type <br>
theory just happen to also like constructive math?</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Dominque.</p>

Hi Dominique,</p>
<p>There certainly are also type theories for classical math<br>
("lambda-bar mu mu-tilde" comes to mind :-)), but they are<br>
more complicated and less trivially computational than the<br>
normal type theories, which correspond to constructive math.<br>
So it's not just a community thing, I think.</p>
<p>Basically, throwing an exception corresponds to the<br>
ex-falso rule, and catching it corresponds to LEM, or<br>
rather to elim-style rule "(~A ==&gt; B) ==&gt; (A ==&gt; B) ==&gt; B",<br>
which amounts to the same thing.  In other words,<br>
constructivists only get half of the exception mechanism:<br>
they can throw, but can't catch.</p>
<p>However you can take an exception and run with it, so to<br>
implement this in an implementation, you really need to<br>
save the full state of the system (including the stack and<br>
heap and everything) in an exception.  For Lisp this is the<br>
"call-with-current-continuation" function.</p>
<p>So constructive math is functional programming without<br>
exceptions.  And using an exception monad instead of built-in<br>
exceptions corresponds to the double negation translation :-)</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>I have to admit that I didn't really get the connection between <br>
exceptions and LEM.</p>
<p>But it seems to me what you explained is why it is problematic to give <br>
computational meaning to a theory with LEM, right? That much I get.</p>
<p>But I don't see why dependent type theories have to necessarily come <br>
with a computational meaning. (It could again be a community thing: <br>
people doing types like computation.)</p>
<p>Basically, as I see it, the idea in classical math is that we do not <br>
care about a computational meaning of our formulas. (While <br>
constructivism does.)</p>
<p>So, my question would be: is there an inherent reason why dependent type <br>
theory is more difficult if we want LEM and do not care about computability?</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Dominique.</p>

<p>Yes, LEM breaks computation, as it is a axiom without a computational<br>
rule.</p>
<p>And this is a distinction which is usually done in dependent type<br>
theory, but not in HOL: axioms and computational rules. In HOL there<br>
are no computation rules besides alpha and eta equivalence and beta<br>
reduction. While in DTT a lot of people prefer not to have any<br>
constants which do not have a computation rule associated with them,<br>
but often do not have a problem with introducing complex type formers<br>
as long as one can compute with it.</p>
<p>HOL:<br>
  oh is is a small logic, only AC+LEM+funext+propext+typedef+...<br>
  and then we derive (co)datatypes</p>
<p>DDT:<br>
  oh it is a small logic, no "axioms" but a powerful datatype formers<br>
  so we can do a lot of (constructive) mathematics.</p>
<p>But in many cases both approaches can be merged, in Coq you can use the<br>
Axiom of Choice. And in Lean we use it by default. On the other hand,<br>
if you want to go to HoTT you can't use Axiom of Choice on arbitrary<br>
types (but still on the HOL subset of HoTT)</p>

<p>Yes, this is usually the case. The advantage of using a limited logic<br>
is that one gets additional properties for free. When you write down a<br>
function in HoTT (without classical axioms) you get a continuous<br>
function, where continuity is for free.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>I would not say that dependent type theory is more difficult with LEM.<br>
It is as difficult as HOL.</p>
<p>What you miss if you don't enjoy computability of your constants is<br>
powerful unification/definitional equality! For example, a lot of proof<br>
steps where the simplifier is used in Isabelle are just application of<br>
one rule in Lean. Mind: definitional equality breaks abstraction (often<br>
the definition should not be part of an module interface), but for many<br>
basic constants this is a huge bon. ssreflect and mathcomp uses it a<br>
lot.</p>
<p>So, yes it gets more difficult: one needs a powerful rewrite engine<br>
like in Isabelle.</p>

<p>I quote from nlab: <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Boolean+topos">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Boolean+topos</a></p>
<p>The internal logic of a Boolean topos with natural numbers object can serve</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as foundations for "ordinary" mathematics, except for that which relies on<br>
the axiom of choice. If you add the axiom of choice, then you get (an<br>
internal version of) ETCS [Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets];<br>
conversely, if you use an arbitrary topos, then you get constructive<br>
mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dependent type theory corresponds to the internal logic of an arbitrary<br>
topos. The particular case of a dependent type theory, in which the LEM was<br>
accepted, corresponds to the internal logic of a Boolean topos. Reference<br>
about the relationship between topos theory and dependent type theory:<br>
<a href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/LCCC/LCCC.pdf">http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/LCCC/LCCC.pdf</a></p>
<p>A concrete example.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the topos to formalize the Birkhoff -von Neumann quantum<br>
logic is a Boolean topos, because it is just classical mathematics (it is<br>
natural to formalize it in Isabelle/HOL). On the other hand, the topos used<br>
to formalize the "intuitionistic" version of Birkhoff -von Neumann quantum<br>
logic (in which LEM does not hold, but the distributive property holds) is<br>
the Bohr topos (this is not a Boolean topos). Some references:<br>
