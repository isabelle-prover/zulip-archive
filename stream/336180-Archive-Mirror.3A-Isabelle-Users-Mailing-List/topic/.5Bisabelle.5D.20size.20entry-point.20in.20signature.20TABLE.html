Wow.  That’s a fascinating number.  Note of course that the obvious way to store table sizes would not affect sharing of substructure.</p>

<p>It only gives a hint about the order of data in the main context <br>

plain List.list; e.g. a graph uses that for its adjacency relation.</p>
<p>This all works well and nicely, because the 2-3 tree data structure is a <br>
bit better than the more commonly known read-black tree.  In the Scala <br>
library they have the latter, and it causes so many problems that are <br>
absent in our fine ML world.</p>

<p>It is still a waste of resources: heap space and (equally important) <br>
source space in the implementation.  The size is not needed for the data <br>
structure, so why should it be stored.</p>

Is there any chance the signature TABLE (from src/Pure/General/table.ML) could be extended to support a constant time</p>
<p>size : 'a table -&gt; int</p>
<p>operation?  At the moment, it seems as if I have to calculate this “by hand” (perhaps with fold), and with O(n) complexity.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
This is indeed the canonical way to do it:</p>
<p>fun size tab = Symtab.fold (fn _ =&gt; fn n =&gt; n + 1) tab 0</p>
<p>The canonical fold combinator for this (and other data structures) <br>
subsumes many applications, without having to saturate signatures <br>
unnecessarily.  The above size definition could be added (probly under the <br>
name "lentgh"), but in practice it is hardly ever needed, and canonical <br>
fold expressions work well.</p>
<p>Of course that operation is linear in the size, just like List.length. The <br>
reasons for not storing local sizes in the data structure for constant <br>
size operations are the same as for lists: extra redundancy that needs to <br>
be maintained at run-time and requires more space in memory.</p>
<p>Our Table implementation is almost as fundamental as List.  It is at the <br>
bottom of large-scale data management.  Any change down there will impact <br>
almost everything, and many people will have to get 32 GB machines at <br>
last.</p>
<p>If you need an augmented version of Table, you can look at these examples<br>
how it is done:</p>

   ~~/src/Pure/General/graph.ML</p>

I appreciate the desire not to meddle with something fundamental, but I don’t think the concern about wasted space is justified.  Assuming an extra int is going to take 8 bytes to store, in order to waste even 1MB (which is in turn just 1/16000th of a 16GB machine), you’d have to have 125000 live tables in memory.  Tables can get big (motivating the desire to avoid O(n) operations), but I’d be surprised if a running Isabelle really had that many tables around.</p>
<p>Thanks for the pointers to the extended table examples.</p>

My guess is that we normally have millions of live tables around, and it <br>
is important that their substructure is sharable as much as possible.</p>
<p>2-3 years ago when I made some measurements about the number of persistent <br>
theory values, it was about 0.5 million for big applications. The number <br>
of theory data slots is at the order of 100. This may sound insane, but we <br>
have quite successfully violated old schemes to poke around destructively <br>
in mutable global storage.</p>
<p>I need to revisit this once again soon, to see if we can extend the 32bit <br>
age a bit further.  Many users today have small mobile devices instead of <br>
proper workstations.  So the question will again be what can be taken <br>
away, rather than added at the very bottom.</p>
