Hi Marco,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am currently removing smt from a lot of Isabelle proofs, and I noticed, strictly empirically, what follows.</p>
<p>A number of such proofs kept working by merely (and manually) replacing "by smt" (or "by smt2") with something like "by (metis(no_types,lifting))", (or metis with other combinations of options (e.g., hide_lams, mono_tags, etc...)).</p>
<p>I think that it would be nice, given the licensing issues, that sledgehammer would suggest these alternatives, rather than (or at least in addition to) "by smt".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By default, "smt" calls are only proposed if all else failed. More precisely, whenever Sledgehammer gives a "by (smt ...)", it's because the variations of "metis" failed or timed out. So if you successfully replaced "by smt" by something like "by (metis (no_types, lifting) ...)", it's either because it timed out or because the specific combination of "metis" options wasn't tried. (Those that are tried can be seen by passing "[verbose]" or "[debug]".)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, I couldn't find a way of influencing s/h behaviour in such a way, by reading s/h manual. <br>
I tried with smt_proofs=false, to no avail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well setting "smt_proofs=false" surely must have changed something, namely that you never get any "smt(2)" proofs, right? If not, that's really a bug, and I would like you to send me an example that reproduces the problem.</p>
<p>Already in Isabelle2014, Sledgehammer should attempt to generate Isar proofs (cf. "isar_proofs" option in the manual) for Z3 when offering "by (smt2 ...)". This support has been improved further in the repository version and should help you produce "smt(2)"-free proofs, fit for the AFP.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jasmin</p>

<p>The specific combinations usually take less then a second once I manually enter them, hence I think it's the second case.<br>
Given that, I find that it would be nice if sledgehammer would try those combinations, too.<br>
Of course I have no clue about whether this is technically possible.</p>

<p>I think this is a useful suggestion; however, at the moment I cannot try it.</p>

<p>Exactly, no bugs. I just hoped that using that setting would have helped emerging alternative metis combinations.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed a couple of Isar proofs generated by SH were readable, and I happily used them.<br>
It was a very nice sensation, by the way :)<br>
I mean, reading a proof that nobody wrote.</p>

<p>Thank you for the answer!<br>

<p>It's technically possible but would put more of a burden on the user's patience. All in all, it's a matter of calibration, of trade-offs. The state you described is clearly suboptimal, but things have changed a lot in the past year or so.</p>
<p>So once you've upgraded to the repository version or the forthcoming Isabelle2015, keep an eye on proof reconstruction, and if you still feel things could be improved further, I would be happy to get your feedback. I have myself started using Isabelle and Sledgehammer (as opposed to developing it) and did notice a number of misfeatures, which I quickly resolved. I will still not claim that everything is perfect. ;)</p>
