<p>From: Matthias Schmalz &lt;<a href="mailto:Matthias.Schmalz@inf.ethz.ch">Matthias.Schmalz@inf.ethz.ch</a>&gt;<br>
Hi,</p>
<p>Out of curiosity and for my thesis introduction, I have the following <br>
question.<br>
I am wondering whether there is a theorem prover out there that gives <br>
stronger soundness guarantees than Isabelle/HOL and whether there is <br>
empirical evidence showing that the difference is practically relevant.<br>
I would also like to know when the last unsoundness bug in Isabelle's <br>
inference core has been observed.</p>
<p>I already know that Isabelle follows the LCF approach and that HOL is <br>
built from a modest number of axioms using conservative extension <br>
methods. It is therefore very likely that proofs by Isabelle are <br>
correct. I also know that this soundness guarantee is restricted to the <br>
inference core; for example, nothing prevents users from configuring the <br>
parser to parse "False" as "True" and therefore giving the impression <br>
that "False" can be proved. (And of course, soundness rests on the <br>
assumption that compiler, ML libraries, operating system, and hardware <br>
behave correctly.)</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance,<br>
Matthias</p>

I think HOL Zero tries to make sure that you cannot reconfigure parser <br>

<p>From: "\"Mark\"" &lt;<a href="mailto:mark@proof-technologies.com">mark@proof-technologies.com</a>&gt;<br>
I would summarise the potential soundness-related vulnerabilities of<br>
LCF-style systems as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Small risk that the inference kernel still has problems with the<br>
design/implementation of its logic.  This might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a) errors in tricky term operations such as substitution (most or<br>
perhaps every HOL system has had problems with this at some stage);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b) errors in the inference rules or axiom/definition commands (this risk<br>
is amplified if the kernel implements various derivable inference rules as<br>
primitives).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vulnerabilities in the implementation of the LCF-style architecture.<br>
This might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a) backdoors to creating theorems, thus sidestepping the logic (e.g. by<br>
importing theorems from disk purely as statements without proof);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b) not keeping track of theory (e.g. not maintaining a list of the<br>
definitions of each constant in the theory, thus making it difficult to<br>
review definitions and what has been assumed);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c) ability to overwrite crucial ML values and/or abstract datatypes<br>
(such as the list of axioms or the datatype for theorems);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>d) vulnerability from aspects of the implementation language (e.g.<br>
OCaml's mutable strings, OCaml's Obj.magic) .</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Problems associated with the pretty printer (and arguably the parser)<br>
fooling the user about what has been proved.  This might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a) ambiguously displaying theorems (such as not annotating theorems with<br>
their types, or not distinguishing between overloaded entities).  This has<br>
become know recently as Pollack Inconsistency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b) vulnerability to having the pretty printer overwritten or extended in<br>
a problematic way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My HOL Zero system addresses most of these vulnerabilities, although there<br>
is little that can be done about some of the 2c), 2d) and 3b)<br>
vulnerabilities if an ML toplevel is allowed.  It is implemented in OCaml,<br>
but does manage to avoid the mutable strings problem.  I will be porting it<br>
to SML sometime soon hopefully, which is a fundamentally more secure<br>
language.  I give out $100 bounty rewards for anyone uncovering new<br>
unsoundness-related vulnerabilities.  The website includes a list of all<br>
soundness-related vulnerabilities that have been uncovered (even those found<br>
by myself).  See the HOL Zero page at:<br>
<a href="http://www.proof-technologies.com/holzero.html">http://www.proof-technologies.com/holzero.html</a></p>
<p>The inference kernels of most other LCF-style systems are actually a bit<br>
complex, involving a few thousand lines of ML.  As of 2012, the risks of<br>
vulnerability 1 are probably quite small because they get used so much, but<br>
there have been some unsoundnesses uncovered in the 1990s, and I would very<br>
much like developers to clearly publish all discovered soundness-related<br>
vulnerabilities in their systems.</p>
<p>HOL Light manages to keep the inference kernel down to about 500 lines<br>
(depending on exactly how you count the lines) by various measures,<br>
including: not implementing derivable inference rules in the kernel (other<br>
than TRANS) and having a monolithic theory instead of maintaining a theory<br>
hierarchy.  John Harrison has proved the consistency of the HOL Light<br>
kernel, but this just addresses vulnerability 1.  Indeed I can prove false<br>
without leaving a trace in the HOL Light state in about 5 lines of ML!</p>
<p>I'm fairly sure that alll existing HOL systems (other than HOL Zero) still<br>
have various known vulnerabilities in their pretty printer, although some<br>
have been addressed.</p>

Larry, you rightly point out that there are more important worries for<br>
theorem prover users.  But this doesn't mean that soundness-related<br>
vulnerabilities should be ignored now.</p>
<p>And also, importantly, I would say that theorem proving hasn't yet reached<br>
its potential.  Nowadays formal proof is largely confined to university<br>
departments and a handful of reputed specialist companies.  If/when theorem<br>
proving does become big, commercial realities mean that there will be<br>
considerable outsourcing of proofs to contractors.  Undoubtedly commercial<br>
pressures will tempt some contractors to maliciously exploit<br>
soundness-related vulnerabilities, and so we should be taking steps now to<br>
address this.  I'm sure there would have been many in 1970s/80s pooh-poohing<br>
the risk of computer users exploiting security-related vulnerabilities.</p>

That's right, what I didn't say was that proof checking can address many of<br>
the remaining soundness-related vulnerabilities (and HOL Zero is very much<br>
intended to be used in precisely this way, as a proof checker).  For<br>
example, any concern that the datatype for theorems is being overwritten by<br>
the proof script can be addressed by recording the proof and exporting it to<br>
another system.</p>
<p>But this proof checking can still suffer problems if the system importing<br>
the proof is not suitably trustworthy.  For example, if both systems have a<br>
pretty printer that have the same vulnerability (e.g. not distinguishing<br>
between two overloaded HOL variables), then the problem won't get noticed in<br>
either system.</p>

<p>A well known approach to soundness, not discussed here yet, is<br>
independent checking.</p>
<p>As Larry points out, a user must read and understand the statements of<br>
theorems s/he wants to believe, and all definitions they hereditarily<br>
depend on.</p>
<p>Further there must be confidence that whatever form these theorems are<br>
presented in is correctly captured by a proof tool's internal<br>
representation (issues of printing/parsing/overloading, etc).</p>
<p>But the actual proofs are no cause to worry, at least in principle, at<br>
least in a system like Coq or Isabelle that can produce complete,<br>
independently checkable proof scripts. in some completely unambiguous<br>
notation.</p>

<p>Larry, you rightly point out that there are more important worries for<br>
theorem prover users.  But this doesn't mean that soundness-related<br>

<p>And also, importantly, I would say that theorem proving hasn't yet<br>
reached<br>
its potential.  Nowadays formal proof is largely confined to university<br>
departments and a handful of reputed specialist companies.  If/when<br>
theorem<br>
proving does become big, commercial realities mean that there will be<br>
considerable outsourcing of proofs to contractors.  Undoubtedly<br>
commercial<br>
pressures will tempt some contractors to maliciously exploit<br>
soundness-related vulnerabilities, and so we should be taking steps<br>
now to<br>
address this.  I'm sure there would have been many in 1970s/80s<br>
pooh-poohing<br>
the risk of computer users exploiting security-related vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Out of curiosity and for my thesis introduction, I have the following<br>
question.<br>
I am wondering whether there is a theorem prover out there that gives<br>
stronger soundness guarantees than Isabelle/HOL and whether there is<br>
empirical evidence showing that the difference is practically<br>
relevant.<br>
I would also like to know when the last unsoundness bug in Isabelle's<br>
inference core has been observed.</p>
<p>I already know that Isabelle follows the LCF approach and that HOL is<br>
built from a modest number of axioms using conservative extension<br>
methods.<br>
It is therefore very likely that proofs by Isabelle are correct. I<br>
also<br>
know<br>
that this soundness guarantee is restricted to the inference core; for<br>
example, nothing prevents users from configuring the parser to parse<br>
"False"<br>
as "True" and therefore giving the impression that "False" can be<br>
proved.<br>
(And of course, soundness rests on the assumption that compiler, ML<br>
libraries, operating system, and hardware behave correctly.)</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance,<br>
Matthias<br>

Before everything is repeated, see also the following thread from Jan <br>
2011: <br>
<a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2011-January/msg00047.html">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2011-January/msg00047.html</a></p>
<p>IIRC, the thread also contains some explanations why your points 2c), 2d) <br>
and 3b) concerning the "ML toplevel" are merely an accidental feature of <br>
your implementation that follows the classic Cambridge HOL paradigm.  The <br>
Isabelle/ML toplevel is integrated with the prover differently -- it would <br>
easily allow to amend these issues if they were of practical relevance, <br>
but there are more imporant things to do.</p>
