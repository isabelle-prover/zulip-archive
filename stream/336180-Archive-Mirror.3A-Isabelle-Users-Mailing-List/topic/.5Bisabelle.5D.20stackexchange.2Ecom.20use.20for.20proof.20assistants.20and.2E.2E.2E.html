<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
It's first come first serve, so I hijack a suggestion from <br>
[isabelle-dev], to try and get my point in first:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg03860.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg03860.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg03864.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/isabelle-dev@mailbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/msg03864.html</a></p>
<p>Mentioning the general downsides to <a href="http://stackexchange.com">stackexchange.com</a> are irrelevant <br>
here because they only affect whether a person will use <br>
<a href="http://stackexchange.com">stackexchange.com</a> in general.</p>
<p>As I see it, there could be three wrong choices made by someone or some <br>
people in trying to initiate the use of stackexchange for proof <br>
assistants, ATPs, computational logic, or whatever word it is that best <br>
categorizes these and related fields of study.</p>
<p>(1) People choose the wrong stackexchange site as a springboard for the <br>
future site <a href="http://proofassistants.stackexchange.com">http://proofassistants.stackexchange.com</a>, or whatever other <br>
site would be broad enough to get some traffic.</p>
<p>(2) All competing groups don't choose to listen in on the stackexchange <br>
site that is chosen as a springboard site. In particular, the HOL4 et <br>
al., Mizar, Coq, Isabelle, etc. groups don't all choose to be a part of <br>
the springboard site.</p>
<p>(3) Someone doesn't choose to make it practical for people to listen in <br>
on the small number of proof assistant, etc. related questions that will <br>
be asked on the springboard site.</p>
<p>Now, I give my opinions about (1), (2), and (3).</p>
<p>The challenge for (1) requires a list of 3 questions:</p>
<p>(a) On what site are the experts who have knowledge that is most closely <br>
related to proof assistants, etc.?</p>
<p>(b) For that particular site, will those experts tolerate questions <br>
about proof assistants, etc.?</p>
<p>(c) For that particular site, will those experts tolerate questions <br>
about proof assistants from non-experts?</p>
<p>As an example, there is <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com">math.stackexchange.com</a>, and there is <br>
<a href="http://mathoverflow.net">mathoverflow.net</a>, and though mathoverflow is not a stackexchange site, <br>
it is comparable.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com">math.stackexchange.com</a>, there are many experts in math, and they <br>
tolerate a wide range of questions. On <a href="http://mathoverflow.net">mathoverflow.net</a>, there are many <br>
experts in math, and many of those experts work to protect their domain, <br>
to the point of keeping out advanced areas of math that overlap with <br>
things like computer science.</p>
<p>I looked briefly at <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">http://stackexchange.com/sites</a></p>
<p>1.8m users, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a></p>
<p>4.9k users, computer science, <a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/">http://cs.stackexchange.com/</a></p>
<p>11k users, theoretical computer science, <a href="http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/">http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/</a></p>
<p>2.6K users, computational science, <a href="http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/">http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/</a></p>
<p>The choice of a site ties (1) and (2) together, because eventually for <br>
any user, the important questions are not just about how to use the <br>
software, but also about the application.</p>
<p>Based on my observation, if I was going to pick one word to describe the <br>
group of experts that proof assistants, etc. revolve around, it would be <br>
"logician". So it appears to me that the experts are mainly going to <br>
come from logicians, mathematicians, and computer scientists.</p>
<p>So which of those four sites has the highest concentration of logicians, <br>
mathematicians, and computer scientists who will be tolerant in the ways <br>
I describe above?</p>
<p>And to increase the size of the group of experts, you need the people I <br>
listed in (2) listening in. Someone using Coq would be more likely to <br>
answer certain questions of mine than someone using Isabelle, because <br>
certain questions will be more application specific than software specific.</p>
<p>Finally, someone would need to make it practical for everyone to listen <br>
in, like post a daily summary of the proof assistant, etc. questions <br>
posted on the springboard site. I have <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com">math.stackexchange.com</a> in my RSS <br>
reader, but I never check what messages are retrieved. At this time, I <br>
have only a very narrow interest, which happens to be learning how to <br>
implement some math in Isabelle, where the math is sufficiently <br>
explained in textbooks. I'm not going to browse the message titles <br>
looking for something very unlikely to be there.</p>
<p>This daily summary email on lots of different mailing lists might make <br>
the specific site chosen less important. But you would need a <br>
combination of it being practical to find the pertinent, daily questions <br>
using a search, and the people on that site would need to not be hostile <br>
to proof assistant, etc. questions.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Serguei,</p>
<p>I'm going to try and check out of this thread as fast as possible <br>
because it would take people like Makarius, who have connections with <br>
groups like the Coq group, to get things going as I described.</p>
<p>But, off the top of my head, I would say the reason to not use any site <br>
other than stackexchange would be because of the momentum that <br>
stackexchange has.</p>
<p>One downside to using stackexchange is that a person has to have an <br>
account. But, <a href="http://discourse.org">discourse.org</a> also requires a person to have an account, <br>
so if you're looking for the most potential traffic, then you pick the <br>
site which has the largest number of people with accounts.</p>
<p>The other general downside is the voting, but that's independent of all <br>
this, and they're all going to have that, and the voting raises the <br>
quality of questions in some ways. That's my observation. I don't have a <br>
stackexchange or mathoverflow account.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>

<p>there is Coq on that list, and if you include, say, Agda, then it begins<br>
to read a bit like a list of programming languages, some with a special<br>
purpose. That reasoning would maybe make  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a> the<br>
right side to start on. There are already tags for some of these<br>
provers:<br>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/agda">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/agda</a><br>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coq">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coq</a><br>
and even<br>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/isabelle">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/isabelle</a><br>
so maybe we just have to spread the word that there are answers to be<br>
gotten on SO about Isabelle?</p>

<p>From: Gottfried Barrow &lt;<a href="mailto:gottfried.barrow@gmx.com">gottfried.barrow@gmx.com</a>&gt;<br>
Joachim,</p>
<p>It's enough to put the feed in my reader.</p>
<p>That's an example that you can't depend on people knowing certain <br>
things. I knew how to put a stackexchange site in my RSS reader, but <br>
I've never even considered the idea that the tags are there to get a RSS <br>
feed. And the nature of tags is that there can be a lot of overlap, and <br>
people don't take the time to tag things in a way that all the <br>
information can be found based on tags.</p>
<p>But even now, my motivation remains low to put any thought into <br>
stackexchange as a meaningful source of information about Isabelle. I <br>
see here a total of four questions that are tagged "Isabelle".</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/isabelle">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/isabelle</a></p>
<p>If I was going to make another point in my initial email it would be this:</p>
<p>The people who are running these proof assistant shows will have to<br>
    promote the use of a stackexchange site for it to become, any time<br>
    soon, a hub of activity for proof assistants.</p>
<p>I present an analogy. If none of the proof assistant groups promoted <br>
their mailing lists on their web sites, would very many people subscribe <br>
to their mailing lists?</p>
<p>It's a common problem. To get people to jump on the bandwagon so you're <br>
not forgotten, you have attain critical mass. You can't attain critical <br>
mass because no one will jump on the bandwagon, which leads to everyone <br>
totally forgetting about you, tuning you out, and turning you off, to <br>
where you've lost any ability to get their attention, because you got <br>
taken out of their RSS reader, or got unsubscribed to because your <br>
channel was a dead channel.</p>
<p>I'll try to make this my last comment about this. Getting all this going <br>
is way bigger than me. It's not my problem; it's just I have lots of <br>
opinions.</p>
<p>People higher up on the ladder like you would have to get things rolling.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
GB</p>
