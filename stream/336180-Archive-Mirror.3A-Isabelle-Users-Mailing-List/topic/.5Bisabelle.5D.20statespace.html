Hello,</p>
<p>want to use the statespace construct to model state spaces and i have<br>
some questions:</p>
<p>0) is there some reference to statespace which might answer my<br>
questions? until now i only have "State Spaces - The Locale Way" and<br>
in there i could not find the answers to the following questions. (and<br>
i found StateSpaceEx.thy which has similar examples)</p>
<p>1) before, i tried to model the statespace as a record. I defined<br>
operational semantics of the type "record =&gt; instruction =&gt; record =&gt;<br>
bool" to have a function that indicates, whether the transition from<br>
one state to another via an instruction is allowed. How can I do this<br>
with statespaces, as they are not a variable type?</p>
<p>2) is there a way to instantiate such a statespace? Or is there no<br>
need to? i'm still thinking in terms of records or functions, whose<br>
variables could be updated bit by bit, but maybe<br>
this just not the way statespaces are meant to be.</p>
<p>3) i played around with the variable renaming of statespaces. here's my example<br>
statespace A = a::nat<br>
statespace B = A + b::nat<br>
statespace C = B[a=z] --- does not work</p>
<p>so my perception is, that i can only rename variables, that were<br>
introduced in the named statespace, not in its parents.<br>
why is it like this? is there some conceptual meaning?</p>
<p>thanks in advance<br>
best regards<br>
Nils</p>

<p>As a statespace is just a locale, you<br>
can define the function in the context of the statespace / locale using the "local-theory" concepts of Isabelle e.g.:</p>
<p>statespace state = ...</p>
<p>context state<br>
begin</p>
<p>fun myfun <br>
where<br>
"myfun s = use s with selectors and updates here"</p>
<p>end</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes by the standard means of locale instantiation. <br>
There is currently not more automation.<br>
For example you can define a record with all the fields, then instantiate the statespace-locale which leaves you with the obligation to proof that the record selector / update functions fulfill the locale assumptions, which they should.</p>

statespace A = a::nat<br>
statespace B = A + b::nat<br>

<p>This seems to be a bug or missing feature, but no conceptual thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
