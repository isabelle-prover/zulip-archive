<p>Copy-paste works more often than having things visible.  The former is <br>
about encodings, which normally work unless the web server is configured <br>
in a bad way.  The latter is about fonts, which often do not work.</p>
<p>HTML5 also allows to specify server-side fonts for local display.  So one <br>
could in principle force IsabelleText on the user even on the Web, but <br>
this is still a very theoretic possibility.</p>

Dear all,</p>
<p>despite my initial skepticism, I found stackoverflow a convenient place <br>
for asking and answering Isabelle questions. (And to my great surprise I <br>
already had an account for several years that just lay dormant ;).</p>
<p>With this e-mail, I intend two things:</p>
<p>1) Encourage people to have a look at stackoverflow (others already <br>
indicated how one can subscribe, e.g., to a news feed for the isabelle <br>
posts).</p>
<p>2) Ask if anybody would be interested in developing isabelle syntax <br>
highlighting for stackoverflow ;)</p>

Is there a certain encoding to be used, or are posters entering <br>
information with a non-standard encoding? I've tried "Western <br>
(ISO-8859-1)" and "Unicode (UTF-8)" in Chrome, but it doesn't make a <br>
difference. I see boxes with a question mark in this question, and in <br>
lots of other questions:</p>

<p>Are there additional tags to see the comments and answers for this tag?</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/isabelle">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/isabelle</a></p>
<p>I can subscribe to a feed for a particular question, which is not what I <br>
want to do.</p>
<p>What I'm doing is subscribing to the feed for many of the people who are <br>
showing up, with a tag like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/476803/chris">http://stackoverflow.com/users/476803/chris</a></p>
<p>Doing that is pretty ridiculous because it requires that I see <br>
everything they do on the site. But polling and scanning questions to <br>
try and find new information would be more ridiculous. Nothing much is <br>
ever perfect.</p>
<p>More imperfection.</p>
<p>Rather than implement LaTeX on stackoverflow as it's done on other <br>
sites, certain people tell you how to properly think about the matter.</p>

<p>I've already spent some time looking around several sites, just see my <br>
profile at SE. For the majority of technical questions around Isabelle, <br>
stackoverflow tag "isabelle" looks like the right place.</p>
<p>On "Computer Science" and "Theoretical Computer Science" there are some <br>
more conceptual topics covered under "proof-assistants", for example. <br>
Someone made a "coq" tag there, but I found it odd and did not imitate it.</p>
<p>I find it more difficult to get into <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com">http://math.stackexchange.com</a>, <br>
although its "logic" tag is a starting point.</p>
<p>What is also interesting is the "interdisciplinary" and "multi-cultural" <br>
aspect of SE: e.g. someone asking under "isabelle" and "scala" will make <br>
Scala people aware of what can be done with Isabelle, which they did not <br>
know before.  (This has already happened in the past few days.)</p>
<p>I also hope to see more people learning from the different provers, not <br>
just "my prover is best and the only thing I need to know".</p>

<p>I am unsure what you mean by police.  So far I found myself received <br>
rather well, e.g. I've earned several +2 points for brushing up some if <br>
the tag wikis.</p>
<p>The maintenance men at stackoverflow never sleep, though.  When you start <br>
editing wildly, a certain automated review system becomes alert, and 5 <br>
experienced stack-exchangers will vote thumbs up or thumbs down for your <br>
proposal.  That way you can also loose points.</p>
<p>There is also a special review system for contributions by fresh users.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>It is probably not a question of encoding; The correct encoding<br>
(text/html; charset=utf-8) is transferred in the HTTP header, and things<br>
look good here. Maybe your are missing some fonts, of have some<br>
font-overwrite in place?</p>

At first I thought "it just works", quite unusually for unicode.  Now I <br>
also see problems here on Mac OS X Mountain Lion / Firefox, and some other <br>
SE user has observed problems with my unicode copy-past as well, <br>
potentially on Windows.</p>
<p>So we are back at field one, where we've been 20 years ago: "Unicode is <br>
comming, really, believe me, it is there right now to solve all our math <br>
typesetting problems".  Luckily the prover does not depend on Unicode at <br>
all.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I shall continue with the copy-pasting from Isabelle/jEdit <br>
for the time being.  These snippets are not fully authentic source anyway.</p>

Joachim,</p>
<p>That's probably the case, so I at least know where the problem is.</p>
<p>But I'm using Windows 7, and so at this stage of the game, if fonts <br>
across operating systems aren't standardized enough to prevent this kind <br>
of thing, then I don't care to set my system up to be bullet proof, <br>
because all that does is allow me to have the impression that others are <br>
seeing what I see.</p>
<p>Eventually, if possible and I'm thinking right, then I try and adapt to <br>
others, rather than expect others to be just like me.</p>
<p>There is ASCII, LaTeX, images, THY files, and PDF files (where even PDFs <br>
can have font dependency problems). Those are what I can depend on. <br>
Nothing else. So I'm trying to come up with practical ways to use those <br>
to ask questions, and say what I want to say.</p>
<p>Here's another person complaining about the same problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/323029/how-to-show-that-vdash-forall-x-beta-to-alpha-leftrightarrow-exists-x/325877#comment705043_325877">http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/323029/how-to-show-that-vdash-forall-x-beta-to-alpha-leftrightarrow-exists-x/325877#comment705043_325877</a></p>
<p>If you look at the question that's asked, you see that LaTeX is that <br>
sites solution to the problem of dealing with non-ASCII characters.</p>
<p><a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/posts/323029/edit">http://math.stackexchange.com/posts/323029/edit</a></p>
<p>LaTeX can be a pain, but at least it's consistent and dependable. So <br>
it's annoying when the admins on stackoveflow tell us that "programmers" <br>
don't need LaTeX. If they don't want to implement it, they're the boss, <br>
but attempts at brainwashing to deflect criticism are to be frowned upon.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

<p>Yea, so I guess it wouldn't be a good host. Some of the buzz words are <br>
the same, but the foundation and emphasis is different. They would be <br>
lacking on making contributions to the programming side of things, which <br>
is probably why I would partly feel more at home there.</p>
<p>But it represents what a good balance can be. It's diverse but not so <br>
diverse and large that going to the main page is near useless, and they <br>
tolerate questions from beginner to advanced. These sites are about <br>
community, and a single tag isn't a community. Also, there can't be any <br>
real cohesion for a group if the questions are spread out over four or <br>
five sites, and it takes more energy to keep track of all that than I <br>
want to put into it.</p>

<p>The police are the majority of people who assert themselves. The police <br>
who act as tyrants are the admins and the in-crowd who vote to close <br>
questions which they're not qualified to vote on, and do so to protect <br>
their domain. When I see that happen, I become more interested in <br>
fighting the establishment.</p>
<p>I'm in no hurry to get an account to fight the man. Fighting the man is <br>
generally a losing proposition.</p>

I still don't see the problem, and tend to agree with Gilles who pointed <br>
out that there are sufficiently many SE sites to cover the topic.  Why all <br>
this fragmentation, and every tiny fringe group on its own site?</p>

I agree with your feeling in the large. I too much see how that applies,  <br>
I've seen it too many times (the last hard time was just today on an  <br>
Ubuntu forum where I opened some topics to promote some interoperable  <br>
standards in software). The crowd effects is as much present in the  <br>
software domain as it is with many more popular and non‑technical issues  <br>
(every one know an example at least). I don't know if that applies as much  <br>
in the logic and mathematics world though (I have no experience with these  <br>
communities).</p>
<p>Well, to get back to StackOverflow precisely, I have an account there, I  <br>
ask and answer question, a bit from time to time, I had no bad experiences  <br>
there personally so far, but I could already witness some cases where  <br>
people posting relevant questions could see their questions closed for  <br>
obscure reasons, at least, no other reasons than negative votes from  <br>
people who did not see anything relevant in the question.</p>

<p>From: Christian Sternagel &lt;<a href="mailto:c.sternagel@gmail.com">c.sternagel@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,</p>
<p>Just some general remarks on the format of theory-snippets on <br>
stackoverflow (and in principle also all other possible occurrences). In <br>
my opinion it should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy'n'paste-able to and fro jEdit (for creation and afterwards)</li>
<li>human readable (without effort, i.e., nothing like \&lt;subseteq&gt;)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that already excludes LaTeX, or not? (Besides, creating a <br>
snippet using LaTeX is much more cumbersome than just copy'n'paste from <br>
your current theory.)</p>
<p>The main choices I see are plain ASCII (which would not be very <br>
convenient, since this usually means that you manually have to change <br>
your snippet from using Unicode tokens to plain ASCII before publishing <br>
it; or something like 'isabelle unsymbolize' could be used... but it <br>
would have to cover all "standard" symbols) or some variant of Unicode <br>
(which works for me on Linux with firefox, but e.g. not on Android with <br>
chrome).</p>
<p>Another question: if one only sees funny symbols instead of the "real <br>
thing" does this also mean that copy'n'paste won't work in general, or <br>
is this independent from what is visible?</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>chris</p>
