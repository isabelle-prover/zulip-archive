<p>From: Andrei Popescu &lt;<a href="mailto:uuomul@yahoo.com">uuomul@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br>
Hello, </p>
<p>I have a fairly large Isabelle development and I am trying to create html and <br>
latex documents based on it.  </p>
<p>However, attempting to run the session results (after running for a while) in <br>
the following error: "thread creation failed".  </p>
<p>I also attach the log file produced.  Presumably the problem is caused by the <br>
size of the development. (?)   </p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any possible advice on how to work around this.  </p>
<p>(Here is some more info: I am working with Cygwin (with the packages recommended <br>
from the Isabelle site) </p>
<p>under Windows 7, <br>
with a processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU M540 @ 2.53GHz<br>
and RAM 4GB (2.43 GB usable).</p>
<p>I have tried with both Isabelle-2009-1 and Isabelle-2009-2.  Occasionally<br>
I also get this error when working interactively in Isabelle in emacs (just in <br>
the middle of some theory, when </p>
<p>moving to a new definition or lemma), but interactively I am usually able to run <br>
all the scripts.)</p>
<p>Best regards, <br>
   Andrei<br>

<p>Yes, this is just a typical out-of-memory problem.  You can try something <br>
like this:</p>
<p>* Enlarge Cygwin heap size according to<br>
<a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-maxmem.html">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-maxmem.html</a> -- 1.0 .. 1.5 GB<br>
     usually works, but I have hardly ever got beyond that on Windows.</p>
<p>* Compactify the Poly/ML while running, i.e. via invoking<br>
     share_common_data() in your ROOT.ML after loading some of the<br>
     theories, and then continue with more of them.</p>

<p>This looks like fairly nice hardware for Linux / x86_64.  Unlike Windows, <br>
64bit mode really works for Linux -- you will be able to use all of your <br>
physical memory.  Nonetheless, the Poly/ML binaries should be those for <br>
x86 for best memory utilization in this scenario.</p>

Thank you very much, I'll try these.</p>
<p>Actually, what would clearly solve my problem in an almost platform-independent <br>
way would be the ability </p>
<p>to remove completely (i.e., just delete from everywhere, including all the <br>
databases, etc.) some </p>
<p>of the theorems, <em>even if remaining theorems are based on them</em>.  E.g., all of <br>
the theorems </p>
<p>from a certain intermediate theory.  Note that such an operation would be <br>
acceptable from a foundational / certification point of </p>
<p>view, just as acceptable as not storing proof terms, and would be IMO highly <br>
appreciated by users who write </p>
<p>their Isabelle development employing several layers, where each layer offers an <br>
interface independent  from previous layers.  </p>
<p>(I'll stop here from making this case though, since maybe such a feature is <br>
already there and I don't know if it.)</p>
<p>Best regards, <br>
   Andrei </p>

<p>One more thing: you can disable multi-threaded processing, which is on by <br>
default.  So something like -M1 in usedir options should conserve some <br>
memory.</p>

<p>Such workarounds to save memory remind of of the ancient days of 8bit or <br>
16bit machines.  At some point MS was very prood to present NT as "32 bit" <br>
operating system.  Now that technology is already a bottle neck again, and <br>
the move to full 64 bit address happening right now.</p>
<p>One problem we face here is that Cygwin is for 32 bit only, and will stay <br>
so for quite some time (like most other things on the Windows platform).</p>
