<p>From: Brian Huffman &lt;<a href="mailto:brianh@cs.pdx.edu">brianh@cs.pdx.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Why can't I define two constants with the same base-name (but<br>
different qualifiers) in the same local theory? The following code,<br>
which tries to define "<a href="http://one.foo">one.foo</a> == True" and "<a href="http://two.foo">two.foo</a> == False", gives<br>
a "Duplicate fixed variable(s)" error message. It works just fine if I<br>
split it into two separate local_setup commands, however.</p>
<p>local_setup {*<br>
fn lthy =&gt;<br>
  let<br>
    val qual = Binding.qualify true<br>
    val ((t1, (s1, thm1)), lthy) = lthy |&gt;<br>
      Local_Theory.define<br>
        ((qual "one" @{binding foo}, NoSyn),<br>
         ((qual "one" @{binding foo_def}, []), @{term "True"}))<br>
    val ((t2, (s2, thm2)), lthy) = lthy |&gt;<br>
      Local_Theory.define<br>
        ((qual "two" @{binding foo}, NoSyn),<br>
         ((qual "two" @{binding foo_def}, []), @{term "False"}))<br>
  in<br>
    lthy<br>
  end<br>
*}</p>
<p>I should explain why I want to do this: The reason is that I (along<br>
with a few other people) am working on a tool for importing Haskell<br>
datatype definitions into Isabelle. We are using a form of "soft<br>
typing", so type constructors are defined as Isabelle constants, along<br>
with the data constructors. The problem is that in Haskell, type names<br>
and constructor names are in separate name spaces, and it is quite<br>
common for a Haskell type and its data constructor to have the same<br>
name, e.g.</p>
<p>data MyBool = MyBool Bool</p>
<p>I want to add qualifiers to distinguish these in Isabelle, something<br>
like "type.MyBool" and "term.MyBool". However, since the<br>
implementation of the tool uses local theories (which as I understand<br>
is the recommended programming practice), it runs into the "Duplicate<br>
fixed variable" error I mentioned above.</p>
<p>Will local theories in a later version of Isabelle be able to use<br>
qualifiers to distinguish names?</p>
<p>While I am still using Isabelle2011, is there a workaround that will<br>
let me avoid the error, while still generating the top-level qualified<br>
constant names that I want? Or will I have to "un-localize" the tool<br>
so that it uses top-level theories directly instead of local theories?</p>

<p>This is according to the specifications.  The auxiliary context of the <br>
local theory target presents newly defined terms as fixed variables, but <br>
these cannot be qualified.  (There are no kernel checks for that for <br>
performance reasons, but the overall system will make problems when the <br>
principle "consts: qualified, fixes: unqualified" is violated.)</p>
<p>The restriction holds only as long as the aux. context is active, i.e. you <br>
can introduce artificial boundaries as workaround, using <br>
Local_Theory.init/exit or reinit operations in a way that I cannot tell on <br>
the spot, without some study of the current state of the sources.</p>

<p>It is probably easier to avoid this clash by using the conventional <br>
Isabelle naming scheme in such situations: terms are called "foo", types <br>
are called "foo_type".  A suffix will always be orthogonal to name spaces <br>
prefixes and qualifiers.</p>
<p>If you do not want to present it like that to the end user, you can <br>
additionally augment the global const name space afterwards using <br>
Sign.const_alias etc. -- this looks to be the least intrusive workaround <br>
at the moment.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Depends if I manage to localize HOL/datatype and record without it. <br>
Records have their own small qualifiers with potential duplication of base <br>
names, but it is possible that one can somehow avoid getting into the same <br>
trouble as above.  If not, I not to devise some tricks to overcome the <br>
limitation somehow.</p>

<p>This is also possible, see Inductive.add_inductive_global, for example. <br>
(Operations called "global" are generally considered a bit fashioned, <br>
potentially being discontinued when localization has advanced further.)</p>

<p>From: Brian Huffman &lt;<a href="mailto:brianh@cs.pdx.edu">brianh@cs.pdx.edu</a>&gt;<br>
Thanks for the suggestion; I will have a closer look at the alias<br>
operations on name spaces. My original plan was to maintain separate<br>
name_space values for my embedded types and terms, with syntax rules<br>
that would select the appropriate one based on context (similar to the<br>
system currently used for parsing/printing Isabelle type expressions).<br>
However, I was under the (mistaken) impression that<br>
Name_Space.intern/extern were only able to fill in/hide qualifiers; I<br>
didn't know about the support for aliases. It looks like I should be<br>
able to use aliases with name suffixes to get everything to work with<br>
local theories.</p>
