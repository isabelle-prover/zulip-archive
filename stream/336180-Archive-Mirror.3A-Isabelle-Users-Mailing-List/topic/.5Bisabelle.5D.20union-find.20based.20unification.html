<p>is anybody aware of an Isabelle/HOL (or even better Imperative_HOL) <br>

Hi Christian,</p>
<p>I have an efficient first-order unification algorithm in Imperative HOL <br>
in my shelf (from back in 2009).<br>
I was mainly interested in using Imperative HOL and what the problems in <br>
larger developments are with the Imperative HOL framework.<br>
Also, we used that as case study for the partial function prototype in 2010.</p>
<p>However, I never found time to polish the proofs and make that work <br>
publicly available.<br>
If you are interested, we can discuss if the unpolished development is <br>
of any use for you.</p>
<p>Lukas</p>

whether this is possible at all, i.e., for some pure function "f", prove <br>
that an Imperative HOL function "g" is a faithful implementation... if I <br>
understand correctly, "g" will always have its result type wrapped in <br>
"Heap" and thus we cannot prove a code equation between "f" and "g"... <br>

<p>The union-find structures are in the examples folder in<br>
Examples/Union_Find.thy.</p>
<p>However, someone seems to have messed up ROOT.ML when porting to<br>
Isabelle2013, such that this file is not compiled any more!</p>
<p>I'll check whether Union_Find still compiles under 2013, and send a<br>

<p>Best, and thanks for pointing to the problem,<br>

<p>I will send you the sources. If you have time to polish it, we can <br>
submit it to the AFP.<br>
(If possible, I would like to improve the generated code for IsaFoR, <br>

<p>I believe that the functional implementation of unification based on a <br>
efficient functional Map implementation is only a minor constant factor <br>

Then you would not even have to consider the Imperative HOL setting.</p>

<p>I was always hoping that the newly developed Lifting package could <br>

<p>From: Peter Lammich &lt;<a href="mailto:lammich@in.tum.de">lammich@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>
If you want to invest some manual work in the algorithm refinement, you<br>
can see examples how to do that in the Separation_Logic_Imperative_HOL<br>
entry. For example, the Union_Find data structures are first formalized<br>
and proved correct on functional lists, and then refined to<br>
Imperative/HOL.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm working on a more automatic way to refine (monadic, using<br>
the refinement monad) programs to Imperative/HOL, but there is nothing<br>
to show yet.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
That is a very interesting observation.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, I've attended a talk by a Coq person who made substantial <br>
investments to include monadic imperative programming to the Coq code <br>
extraction mechanism.  He had exactly the same example, so there is <br>
probably just that one :-)  I was also wondering how much you get in <br>
return for adding such impurity Coq.  (The approach was also somehow <br>
biased towards sequential execution, which is a bit anachronistic for code <br>
optimization.)</p>
<p>So maybe I should point him to this mail thread, to join the discussion.</p>
