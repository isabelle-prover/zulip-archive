Dear Sophie,</p>
<p>I required both well-founded partial orders and the possibility to<br>
obtain minimal elements in the past.</p>
<p>Which is why there are at least two further places you could consult:</p>
<p>(1) Well-founded Partial Orders<br>
===============================</p>
<p>I formalized predicates "po_on" (for partial orders) and "wfp_on" (for<br>
well-founded relations) in</p>
<p><a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Open_Induction/Restricted_Predicates.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Open_Induction/Restricted_Predicates.html</a></p>
<p>where the "p" in "wfp_on" refers to the fact that I am using the<br>
"predicate" version of relations, namely:</p>
<p>'a =&gt; 'a =&gt; bool</p>
<p>instead of</p>
<p>('a * 'a) set</p>
<p>and "_on" refers to the fact that there is a specific carrier set.</p>
<p>(2) Minimal Elements<br>
=====================</p>
<p>There is the locale "minimal_element" in</p>
<p><a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Well_Quasi_Orders/Minimal_Elements.html">https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Well_Quasi_Orders/Minimal_Elements.html</a></p>
<p>which captures well-founded partial orders and provides a constant<br>
"min_elt B" that yields some minimal element from a given set "B"<br>
together with some facts about it.</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>chris</p>

<p>From: Sophie Tourret &lt;<a href="mailto:stourret@mpi-inf.mpg.de">stourret@mpi-inf.mpg.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>I would like to know if there exist a generic well-founded strict <br>
partial ordering available somewhere in Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>In more details:</p>
<p>I need to use a well-founded strict partial ordering in some <br>
isabelle/HOL proof I am currently working on. I found the wellorder <br>
class and could use it to some extend but it is build on a total <br>
ordering and I really need the ordering to be partial (and strict and <br>
well-founded). In particular, I need to be able to obtain minimal <br>
elements verifying some properties and reason on them.</p>
<p>I have taken a look around and my current plan is to extend the preorder <br>
class with well-foundedness (and prove the existence of minimal elements <br>
and needed properties by myself).</p>
<p>This looks like a lot of work (at least for someone relatively new to <br>
Isabelle like me), thus before I start I would like to know if I have <br>
missed something that does what I need (and suggestions of better plans <br>
are also welcome). Here is where I looked and why I think it is not <br>
exactly what I need.</p>
<p>Anything about lattices is out because I want no supremum at all and no <br>
unique infimum.</p>
<p>[Main] HOL.Orderings.thy - where the classes wellorder and preorder are, <br>
I didn't find a partial strict well-founded order there.<br>
[Main] HOL.Wellfounded.thy - deals with binary relations, not with <br>
orderings. Maybe I could use it but is looks trickier than my plan.</p>
<p>[IsaFOR] Quasi_Order.thy - maybe the class wf_order does what I want but <br>
I am not sure and I don't see how I can use it to get a minimal element. <br>
Again, it doesn't look better than my plan to me.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
   Sophie<br>
