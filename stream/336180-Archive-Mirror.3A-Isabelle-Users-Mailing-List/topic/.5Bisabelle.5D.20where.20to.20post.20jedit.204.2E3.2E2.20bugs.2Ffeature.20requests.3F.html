<p>From: Nils Jähnig &lt;<a href="mailto:jaehnig@mi.fu-berlin.de">jaehnig@mi.fu-berlin.de</a>&gt;<br>
Hello,</p>
<p>i hope this is also the right list for jedit stuff.</p>
<p>I disabled the Auto-parsing in Isabelle. as it was the only way, to<br>
disable the Isabelle-parsing. just to read some files.<br>
Now i wanted to reactivate the parsing, so i ticked the option,<br>
restartet jedit and got the following error:</p>
<p>the following plug-in could not be loaded:<br>
/home/nils/Isabelle2011/contrib/jedit-4.3.2_Isabelle-6d736d983d5c/jars/Isabelle-jEdit.jar:<br>
Cannot start: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException<br>
Try updating to a newer version of the plug-in.</p>
<p>Workaround: delete the properties file in<br>
.isabelle/Isabelle2011/jedit. jedit will create a new working one.<br>
if you are lucky, you can also copy one of the properties files from<br>
the backup directory in the same location and rename it.</p>
<p>the pre-2011 version of jedit ran much butter on my machine. the new<br>
one has problems clearing the ram, when i load and afterwards close<br>
multiple theory files in a row. for me the auto-trace is not really<br>
useful, as I usually have one or two theories to work on, and some<br>
more, wherein i just want to lookup things. So like it was before, to<br>
enable parsing for every buffer on it's own was better for me.</p>
<p>to mention something positive: i really like the sidekick showing some<br>
sort of outline of the theory.</p>
<p>best regards<br>
Nils</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
In the old Proof General model, the user "schedules" everything by hand -- <br>
individual commands and theory buffers.  This is convenient for experts <br>
who want to control every aspect of the system themselves, but it is also <br>
a bit inefficient.  A modern operating system also does the scheduling for <br>
the user, not the user for the operating system.</p>
<p>Session management above means dependency management and scheduling of <br>
checking.  For Isabelle/Scala/jEdit in Isabelle2011 I've successfully <br>
removed the old stuff (which was also a lot of work), but managed to <br>
implement only little of the new world order when the release deadline was <br>
approaching. This is why it is still a bit awkward to work with files in <br>
Isabelle/jEdit right now, but you can expect it to get better again next <br>
time.</p>

so i'm looking forward to the next version, and in the meantime try to<br>
get some RAM.<br>
thanks for your decision-explanation<br>

<p>Yes, isabelle-users is for everything that is part of official Isabelle <br>
release.  In contrast, when you start compiling things on your own from <br>
some repository version you should discuss things on the isabelle-dev <br>
mailing list (and reveal your version via "isabelle version -i").</p>

<p>Proper session management is still largely missing, so disabling and <br>

<p>Resource management is as absent in the 2011 version as in the ones <br>
before, but their might be more content produced.  How much RAM do you <br>
have anyway.  I think you can work several hours on 2 GB.</p>

<p>What is auto-trace?</p>
<p>The continous checking that is always enabled is a corollary of the <br>
absence of session manament.  I hope to have that in better shape for the <br>
next Isabelle release -- it also affects the way traditional <br>
batch-processing works, so it all takes a bit longer than anticipated.</p>

<p>I have 2 GB of RAM at work. but usually some other programs running<br>
(even without other programs running it freezes sometimes).<br>
It is when I'm looking through other theory-files (which get parsed),<br>
when the RAM gets full.<br>
At home, where I use jedit via Cygwin on Windows, I have 4 GB of RAM,<br>
where it's running smoother. But it actually uses more than 2GB of RAM<br>
(together with Winows).</p>

<p>I'm not sure, if I got you right (maybe due to me writing<br>
"auto-trace"). my idea was to get back to the not-enabled checking,<br>
without any options. pressing three keys to activate the parsing is no<br>
big deal. on the other hand I don't see a big advantage in having all<br>
theories parsed without pressing a button (please correct me, if I'm<br>
wrong). how does the absence of session management intefere here?</p>
