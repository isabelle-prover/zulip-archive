I've learned a few more fine points about that in the past few days, so <br>
the heuristics will approximate an actual solution eventually.  That is <br>
all for the next release though, and it is a bit early to speculate how it <br>
will be there.  (There are still many Java/Swing issues on various <br>
platforms, some of them hard drop-outs due to Oracle.)</p>

Minor bug report (not sure if this is Isabelle's fault or jEdit's, but here goes)...</p>
<p>The word wrapping in the Output window of Isabelle/jEdit is a little bit off. That is, each line of text breaks about 1cm beyond the right-hand edge of the Output window (and that's independent of how I resize the window). Of course it's only a minor quibble because I can always scroll horizontally a little bit to see the rest of the output. It doesn't help to turn on/off the gutter.</p>

<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href="mailto:makarius@sketis.net">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>
I think you mean the breaking of pretty-printed formal output. <br>
(Word-wrap in the source is a different issue: there is also a snag here, <br>
because Isabelle tokenization for {* ... *} is in conflict with jEdit <br>
tokenization for words.)</p>
<p>The font metrics and window size parameters for pretty printed output are <br>
only precise once the inner GUI component geometry is known.  It does not <br>
quite work with extra decoration (scrollbars, window borders): before the <br>
window is mapped these sizes are unknown, or I did not know how to get <br>
them in Java/AWT/Swing.</p>
<p>So Isabelle2013 has some funny heuristics here that work for the most <br>
common platforms, GUI look-and-feels, fonts, and font-sizes.  What do you <br>
have in this respect?</p>

<p>Yes, that's what I mean.</p>

<p>I'm on Mac OS 10.7.5, with "Swing look &amp; feel" set to "Metal", font "IsabelleText 14 Plain". I've tried fiddling with each of these settings (well, except the OS) and the break points remain consistently about 1cm off the right edge of the window.</p>

<p>I found that "getPainter.getWidth" gave a better indication of a window<br>
size as opposed to getting the control's width and attempting to<br>
subtract off the size of scrollbars, etc.</p>
<p>Another snag I hit is that "metrics.stringWidth" doesn't take into<br>
account anti-aliasing, which after 80 characters of rendering really<br>
starts to add up.</p>
<p>Attached is a patch that may be a starting point to address some of the<br>
problems, but is by no means complete. I still get overflows when<br>
Isabelle renders many wide characters on a line.</p>
<p>I suspect a "proper" solution is to give the line-breaking algorithm<br>
a better understanding of how wide each character is, but I haven't had<br>
a chance to sit down and work out how hard this would be to implement.</p>

<p>I decided to sit down and actually see if I could come up with a better<br>
solution for this problem. Attached is what I came up with (replacing<br>
my previously posted patch completely).</p>
<p>In particular, "Pretty" internally uses "number of spaces" as its<br>
measuring units. This patch attempts modifies "PrettyTextArea" to more<br>
accurately measure strings and feed these widths into "Pretty" in the<br>
correct units.</p>
<p>This seems to give good results on Linux, with all combinations of<br>
hinted/non-hinted aliased/anti-aliased fixed-width/non-fixed-width fonts<br>
I tried.</p>
<p>A one-space margin remains on the right-hand-side because non-hinted</p>
<ul>
<li>anti-aliased fonts still sometimes overflows by a few pixels, and<br>
I couldn't determine why.</li>
</ul>
<p>The patch doesn't attempt to fix SideKick or tool-tips; if the Isabelle<br>
maintainers are happy with the approach in this patch, I would be happy<br>
to extend it.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
David</p>
