Ideally, I'd like to be able to provide an “expected” domain to some tactic, and then be required to prove that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>recursive calls stay within that expected domain <strong>and</strong></li>\n<li>show that some provided measure decreases on each recursive call, as with the <code>relation</code> method.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Background info: The function in my use case is a tail-recursive variant of <code>Tree.subtrees</code> that returns a <code>'a tree list</code>, and which has been compiled (for lack of a better word) to use <code>nat</code> as an argument &amp; return type. The termination of the non-encoded version can't be shown by <code>fun</code>, but there's a somewhat simple measure that works with <code>relation</code>. Because of this, my gut feeling is that I should use <code>relation</code> to prove termination of the encoded variant. However, when arguments that don't represent valid <code>'a tree</code> or <code>'a tree list</code> values under the encoding are passed in, the function might not actually terminate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"spoiler-block\"><div class=\"spoiler-header\">\n<p>Isabelle examples of what I'm looking for</p>\n</div><div class=\"spoiler-content\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<p>As an example, here's a simple partial function:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Isabelle\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">function</span> <span class=\"n\">even_to_zero</span> <span class=\"o\">::</span> <span class=\"s\">\"nat ⇒ nat\"</span> <span class=\"kp\">where</span>\n  <span class=\"s\">\"even_to_zero 0 = 0\"</span>\n<span class=\"o\">|</span> <span class=\"s\">\"even_to_zero (Suc n) = (case n of (Suc n') ⇒ even_to_zero n' | 0 ⇒ even_to_zero (Suc 0))\"</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">using</span> <span class=\"n\">not0_implies_Suc</span> <span class=\"kp\">apply</span> <span class=\"n\">blast</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">by</span> <span class=\"n\">simp_all</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This proof doesn't (and shouldn't) go through—just pasting it in to show the goals <code>relation</code> would generate:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Isabelle\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">lemma</span> <span class=\"n\">even_to_zero_all_dom</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"All even_to_zero_dom\"</span>\n  <span class=\"kp\">apply</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">relation</span> <span class=\"s\">\"(λx. x) &lt;*mlex*&gt; {}\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">proof</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">show</span> <span class=\"s\">\"wf ((λx. x) &lt;*mlex*&gt; {})\"</span> <span class=\"k\">by</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">simp</span> <span class=\"n\">add</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">wf_mlex</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">next</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">show</span> <span class=\"s\">\"⋀n. n = 0 ⟹ (Suc 0, Suc n) ∈ (λx. x) &lt;*mlex*&gt; {}\"</span> <span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n<span class=\"k\">next</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">show</span> <span class=\"s\">\"⋀n n'. n = Suc n' ⟹ (n', Suc n) ∈ (λx. x) &lt;*mlex*&gt; {}\"</span> <span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n<span class=\"k\">qed</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>It seems to me that a tactic _should_ exist that lets me prove the following lemma:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Isabelle\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">inductive_set</span> <span class=\"n\">even</span> <span class=\"o\">::</span> <span class=\"s\">\"nat set\"</span> <span class=\"kp\">where</span>\n  <span class=\"s\">\"0 ∈ even\"</span>\n<span class=\"o\">|</span> <span class=\"s\">\"n ∈ even ⟹ Suc (Suc n) ∈ even\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">lemma</span> <span class=\"n\">even_to_zero_even_dom</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"x ∈ even ⟹ even_to_zero_dom x\"</span>\n  <span class=\"kp\">apply</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">relation</span> <span class=\"s\">\"(λx. x) &lt;*mlex*&gt; {}\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>  <span class=\"c\">(* changeme *)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">proof</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">show</span> <span class=\"s\">\"wf ((λx. x) &lt;*mlex*&gt; {})\"</span> <span class=\"k\">by</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">simp</span> <span class=\"n\">add</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">wf_mlex</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">next</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">show</span> <span class=\"s\">\"⋀n.

I'm not super excited about having to deal with weirder (or more!) simp rules, but it might be manageable. Regardless, I tried out Mohammad's suggestion first since I'm trying to avoid changing the generated code :)</p>\n<p><code>partial_function</code>'s induction scheme certainly doesn't look fun. However, I managed to avoid it completely for a correctness lemma for the generated function, using the original (non-partial and non-encoded) function's induction scheme instead. I had to add an additional conclusion, namely that the generated function's result is a valid encoding—this is needed as an IH.</p>\n<p>If I understand this correctly, then, is proving an equation like <code>subtreest' abc = encode (subtreest (decode (abc)))</code> (simplified for sake the of this question) sufficient to convince isabelle that <code>subtreest'</code> terminates on input <code>abc</code>? I'm not sure how much that HOL equality actually means—<code>undefined</code> still makes me nervous :) I did find Manuel's post on stackoverflow <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/59821993\">here</a> as an explanation of <code>undefined</code> in general, but this still feels wrong as an approach to proving function termination.</p>",
