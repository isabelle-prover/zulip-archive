But checking Church's original paper I see that he already uses what he calls a selection operator i_beta(o beta), that is, in modern notation, (beta -&gt; bool) -&gt; beta. So my question is: why Gordon did find the axiom of choice particularly useful for practical verification tasks? If you answer, please give me a reference.</p>",

HOL is quite convenient but saying that Gordon found the axiom of choice particularly useful is quite the claim. If you want to understand the history of HOL, have a look at \"From LCF to HOL: A Short History\" by Gordon.</p>",
