All levels welcome. <br>\nUndergraduate students are particularly encouraged to actively participate.</p>\n<p>You can find the schedule (in progress) and relevant information at the link below </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/164015\">http://www.talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/164015</a></p>\n<p>Please feel free to invite your students and any colleagues who may be interested.</p>\n<p>Hope to see many of you!</p>",
