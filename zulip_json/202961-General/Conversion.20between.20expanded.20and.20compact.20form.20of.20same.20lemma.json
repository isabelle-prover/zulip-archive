The issue is that I cannot seem to turn one lemma into the other.</p>\n<p>The giant lemma with a large number of assumptions looks likeÂ this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Isabelle\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">lemma</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">giant1</span><span class=\"o\">:</span>\n<span class=\"kp\">assumes</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">i0</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"fact 0 about T\"</span>\n<span class=\"kp\">and</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">i1....</span>\n<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"ow\">....</span>\n<span class=\"kp\">and</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">i300</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"ow\">...</span>\n<span class=\"kp\">shows</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"P T' \"</span>\n<span class=\"k\">proof</span>\n<span class=\"ow\">...</span>\n<span class=\"k\">qed</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The definition of P is the conjunction of most of the assumption facts:<br>\n<code>definition P = i2 /\\ ... /\\ i300</code><br>\nThe more compact lemma looks like this\"</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Isabelle\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">lemma</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">smaller1</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kp\">shows</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"[| P T; fact 0; fact 1 |] ==&gt; P T'\"</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I cannot seem to find a sledgehammer proof from giant1 to smaller1 (timeout, even if more time given the one-liner would be unusable). Is there an exact way to manipulate the proof states so that proof of smaller1 can be derived from giant1?</p>\n<p>See line 217, 1758 of the ILExp.thy file for the giant1 and smaller1 lemmas in the concrete problem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ravHEcwBbtm4CUeya7v75lzx/ILExp.thy\">ILExp.thy</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/TAlEnzeDluoBK1zBl9W-0GfY/BasicInvariants.thy\">BasicInvariants.thy</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/0WM4L1yy_8zmfTESRY2Y3o3W/BuggyRules.thy\">BuggyRules.thy</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/lzoTMg67bkyYFmyWqX0gyW6q/CoherenceProperties.thy\">CoherenceProperties.thy</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/toS2pBrbnnBnh0ZCKQmoONpj/Transposed.thy\">Transposed.thy</a></p>\n<p>Thansk a lot!</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nChengsong</p>",
