CI built it and it showed up online on the corresponding web page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devel.isa-afp.org/entries/Implicational_Logic.html\">https://devel.isa-afp.org/entries/Implicational_Logic.html</a></p>\n<p>Then the CI build broke for a while and now the new theory is no longer there. The website above doesn't correspond to the state of the repo:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://foss.heptapod.net/isa-afp/afp-devel/-/tree/branch/default/thys/Implicational_Logic?ref_type=heads\">https://foss.heptapod.net/isa-afp/afp-devel/-/tree/branch/default/thys/Implicational_Logic?ref_type=heads</a></p>\n<p>It looks like new builds are not presenting this theory agai. I'm inclined to just make a small change to it, to force an update, but I guess there's a cache issue somewhere in the pipeline? Or maybe this is expected for devel? I think some of the other commits around that time are also not reflected online.</p>\n<p>Best, <br>\nAsta</p>",
