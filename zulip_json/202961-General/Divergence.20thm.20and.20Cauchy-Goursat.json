I'm aware of the <a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Formath/Greens-theorem.pdf\">formalization</a> of the Green's theorem, including the case of non-rectangular domains, in Isabelle. Could you please tell me what are the other relevant projects? Thank you!</p>",

Not sure how much more of that there is, other than Green. There are a lot of AFP entries and some things in the standard library that make extensive use of integrals, but don't actually have them in the final result. But that is perhaps too far away to still be related.</p>",
