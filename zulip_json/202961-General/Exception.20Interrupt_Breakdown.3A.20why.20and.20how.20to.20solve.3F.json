This seems like some exception that is raised when some resources have been exhausted or some function timed out. Any ideas why this exception and how to get over this?</p>\n<p>To reproduce the exception, use the following files:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/zIpZ0yIS_WeyuW9GeUQH1cFQ/Interrupt_Breakdown_example.zip\">Interrupt_Breakdown_example.zip</a><br>\nOpen the file linux_I_SIA_conjunct.thy and scroll to the lines containing \"super_sketch3\" to activate the command causing the exception.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nChengsong</p>",
