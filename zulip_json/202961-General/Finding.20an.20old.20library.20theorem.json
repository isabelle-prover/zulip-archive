It relies on the <code>UNION_up_iterate_is_fp</code> lemma from <a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2009-2/dist/library/HOL/Library/Continuity.html\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2009-2/dist/library/HOL/Library/Continuity.html</a>. But this lemma doesn't seem to be in the Library any more (!?), and I don't know how to find an equivalent one.
