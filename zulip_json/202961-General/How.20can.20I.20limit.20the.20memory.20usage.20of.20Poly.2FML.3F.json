However, I had to find out that the solution proposed there by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"392255\">@Jan van Brügge</span> doesn’t work for me, as it relies on a newer version of <code>cgroup</code> (older versions apply limits only to the process directly started, not the processes started by that process). That said, isn’t it possible to pass some option to Poly/ML to have it using a smaller heap or whatever? Not sure whether Poly/ML is the offender, but I would think so.</p>",
