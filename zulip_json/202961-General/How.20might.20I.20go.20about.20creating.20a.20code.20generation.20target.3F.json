Sadly, the last Isabelle version I am sure it works with is Isabelle 2016 (maybe 2017). Re-activating it, is on my eternal to-do-list :-(.  Overall, the changes required to the Ocaml  target is rather small. It might even be possible to  support both Ocaml and F# essentially with the same code-generator \"back-end\" (it should, though, still be a separate language to allow customization, such as target mappings, that differ between Ocaml and F#).   With a lot of luck, I have time over the summer to re-activate the project and also discuss, what is necessary to get a F# target into the Isabelle main distribution. I definitely would not like to continue to maintain it outside of Isabelle itself ...</p>",

While I do not believe that the core part of Ocaml and F# deviated a lot in the last couple of years, it is something to check as well. As far as I remember, I mostly needed to ensure whitespaces/indentations for F#, as F# block structure is purely based on indentation (as Haskell's is), while Ocaml  somewhat more flexible. Otherwise a few constants and library functions had different names, but overall, it was not too difficult. My motivation to develop it in the first place was to have access to the whole Microsoft environment  via F#/dotnet (similar as Scala provides access to the whole Java environment).</p>",
