I tried to disable that and already found the “Suggest: Show Words” option. However, deactivating this only got me rid of the suggestions of words I have typed myself elsewhere. I still get the popups that tell me that instead of “what” I could write “who” and that ask me whether I want to exclude the word I’m typing, perhaps permanently. It seems these suggestions are linked to some (English) dictionary. I’ve already searched the web back and forth regarding how to disable these but to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>",
