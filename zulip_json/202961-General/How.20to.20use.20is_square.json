Maybe check the import is working properly (i.e. can you click on that file and find is_square yourself in it). Otherwise maybe something else in your theory is messing it up? Try moving the theorem statement to the top of the file and see if it becomes defined maybe, otherwise I don't know what's going on sorry!</p>\n<p>Edit, just double checking you're talking about it saying that when you hover over it in your own file? Worth noting just in case, wherever the abbreviation is defined in the Nth_Powers theory it will also say that when you hover over it , but at that point you should be looking at the right side of the definition (i.e. see it uses is_nth_power, so try applying unfolding is_nth_power instead in your own proof). If it's not defined in your own file though, above still applies!</p>",

Once you've found where something is defined, looking at what is on the right side of the equality (which I hinted at above) should give you an idea of what definition you need to unfold.</p>",
