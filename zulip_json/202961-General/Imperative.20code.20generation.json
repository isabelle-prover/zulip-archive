        "content": "<p>Thanks for the answer! That was my intuition. And, it i clear, that the mapping is not direct. The Isabelle While is a function with a return value.  One could informally describe the while combinator as a function that receives the termination condition and the loop body as parameters, receives an initial value and returns the result of the computation in the body. I understand, that the mapping is not trivial, especially when it must be verified. Anyway, I thought I'd ask to see if anybody had already done it.</p>",
