I have made several Isabelle/ML utility functions that extract things like current proof state and my current mode of invoking these functions is by inserting <code>ML_val</code> snippets directly into the proof document.</p>\n<p>I know there is support for invoking Isabelle/Scala functions from Isabelle/ML via antiquotations. Is the way I am invoking Isabelle/ML from Isabelle/Scala the best way or is there some other way I can do it without incurring the overhead of sending the edits for these function calls?</p>",
