Since I use try0 quite often as my default option for \"obvious\" goals and rarely specify any of the non-interactive methods by hand, now my proofs end up with a lot more \"by metis\" instead of \"by fastforce\"/\"by blast\", or even \"by simp\". Of course this is fine, but I was a bit surprised — although I also have no good reason for wanting to avoid metis except habit ..</p>",

For me <code>blast</code> is also documentation that the goal was rather \"simple\", and I do prefer to have that compared to a <code>metis</code>, but I also don't have a good enough understanding of the various proof methods to know whether that's really justified.</p>",
