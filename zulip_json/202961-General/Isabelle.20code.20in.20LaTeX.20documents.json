So far, I haven't seen any drawback with her method.</p>",

Indeed, during the writing of an article you may be led to think harder and improve your formalization.<br>\nHowever there is an easy workaround. Just comment for your memory the code in your LaTeX file where you want to place the screenshots:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>%\\begin{figure}[H]\n%   \\centering\n%   \\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{}\n%\\end{figure}\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>and add your screenshots at the last moment only when your article is completely done and your code stable. <br>\nBut thanks for your arguments, now I think anyone can make an informed choice.</p>",
