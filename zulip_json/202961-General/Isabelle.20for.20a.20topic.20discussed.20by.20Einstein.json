I dream of proving my conjecture by being quoted. “Artificial intelligence discovers the winning strategy of Hex on an arbitrary-sized board after working out the winning strategies on boards of several sizes.” If you have not got powerful enough hardware to demonstrate the conjecture do you at least use high-performance computing to completely walk through the game tree part (simple theory of games concept) related to a cell on the board with the 4 sides 9 hexagons long depicted at <a href=\"http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/hex/\">http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/hex/</a>?<br>\nWill you have Isabelle include my conjecture in the Langlands program, citing me?<br>\nI must be informed of any costs.</p>",
