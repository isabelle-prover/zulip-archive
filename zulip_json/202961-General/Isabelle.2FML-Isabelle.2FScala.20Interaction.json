The way I currently understand Isabelle's inner workings is that there is a \"thread\" managing the messages from both systems. I am interested in the functions (from both sides) that send and receive the messages to/from this \"thread\". If this is not the correct model, an explanation with pointers to the code would be desirable. Written in another way, I am interested in the functions corresponding to the \"internal protocol\" part in slide 5 of <a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/nominal/activities/tphols09/IDW/MW-slides4.pdf\">these slides</a>.

I would like to build a heap, postulate a theorem from Python from that point, receive a filtered list of possible methods and proven theorems from this heap, choose the proof method and its arguments from Python, ask Isabelle/ML to send back the new Proof.state after using that method, and repeat. After looking at Isabelle's scala files, it seems to me that doing it via Isabelle/scala would alleviate the need of building my own YXML parsers, document model, thread management, and all the engineering already there.</p>",

I am now also trying to come up with some automated tools utilizing Isabelle/Scala.<br>\nI was wondering if you have any \"hello world\" snippets you can share? For instance what code in Isabelle/Scala did you write to cause an edit to happen without actually editing in jedit? Or how do you intercept the messages returned by the prover IDE and print them to stdout instead?</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for any help in advance!</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nChengsong</p>",

Basically, I used the <a href=\"https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/source/isabelle/\">develop version of Isabelle with its Mercurial version control</a> and modified the code in a personal \"branch\" in <code>session.scala</code> so that the <code>manager</code> and the <code>dispatcher</code> printed to the standard output some messages that they send and receive. However, after reading them and the <code>protocol.scala</code> I felt that the messages that they send are very specific for the PIDE. Right now I am using <a href=\"https://dominique-unruh.github.io/scala-isabelle/\">Dominique Unruh's scala-isabelle</a> which seems to work for my purposes. If you wish, we can discuss more privately about each other's objectives and maybe we can align them.</p>",
