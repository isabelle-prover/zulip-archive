Hence, proofs in Isabelle are somewhat close to textbook-like mathematical proofs.<br>\nSo, make use of Isar full capabilities and your proofs will look nice. In particular, you should be able to reflect something of the mathematical structure of a proof in a textbook or an article. Ultimately, this leads to <strong>easy-to-maintain code</strong>.<br>\nThat's why the structured style is the preferred style in Isabelle. The alternative <code>apply</code> style is fine when there is not much of a structure to reflect, for instance to perform computations.</p>",
