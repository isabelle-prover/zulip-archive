I rephrased these proofs in Isar but I had to use only the <code>rule</code> method. Did this happen because in a forward Isar proof that's natural? Is there any place for <code>erule</code> or <code>drule</code> in an Isar proof?</p>",

They operate on hypotheses, and you normally don't have those in Isar (only chained facts). Unless you do an apply script or build a more complex proof method to solve an Isar goal, of course. For those purposes I have very rarely used <code>erule</code> in Isar.</p>",
