That definitely is a workaround, however the <code>List</code> theory already includes a <code>count_list</code> function which avoids the overhead of creating a temporary multiset out of a list. There are some basic lemmas about <code>count_list</code> already, but surprisingly there is no lemma relating <code>count_list</code> and <code>@</code> in the style of <code>Multiset.count_union</code>. That's why I think adding a <code>count_append</code> lemma as above is a good idea.</p>",
