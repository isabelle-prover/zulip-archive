In the meantime... my experience has been that once you have development access on the AFP (so can change submission Y), that change becomes available in the development version (also online here: <a href=\"https://devel.isa-afp.org/\">https://devel.isa-afp.org/</a>). Then from memory, I think your new submission relying on the change in Y can target the development version, so it'll only be available there until the next Isabelle release when both will become available on the main archive.</p>",
