My guess is it has not worked since I started using Arch Linux (the (several) installations were copied from my previous distro and now auto_nitpick does not work in any version). Note that writing nitpick after a theorem does work so it is not an installation problem.  I wonder if it has to do with ulimit, processes, threads, etc. How would I go about debugging this?</p>",
