        "content": "<p>I have made lots of progress in proving the Bruck Ryser Chowla theorem in Isabelle. I learned about it in college in 1991 and was fascinated with one part of the proof that was peculiar. Back then I couldn’t put my finger on why it was peculiar but now I think I can explain it - consider proposition P(x). If variable y is independent of x, then the truth of P(x) is independent of the value of y. This is obvious. </p>\n<p>The proof as I understand it of the BRC theorem in Stinson’s book uses this principle: it proves that S(x,y) implies P(x) as follows - it assumes S(x,y) and y=c and then proves P(x). But what about if y is not c? Since P(x) is independent of y, the fact that P(x) is true when y=c and S(x,y) is true implies that P(x) is always true, regardless of the value of y as long as S(x,y) is true for some y.</p>\n<p>So I ask you can Isabelle handle this peculiar principle?</p>",
