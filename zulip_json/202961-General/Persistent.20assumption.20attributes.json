The theorem should then be stored together with a map from its assumptions to tags as indicated by the user. Basically, given something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Isabelle\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">lemma</span> <span class=\"n\">test</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">my_attribute</span><span class=\"o\">]:</span>\n  <span class=\"kp\">assumes</span> <span class=\"s\">\"A\"</span>\n  <span class=\"kp\">and</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">my_asm</span> <span class=\"s\">\"some text\"</span><span class=\"o\">]:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"B\"</span>\n  <span class=\"kp\">shows</span> <span class=\"s\">\"A ∧ B\"</span>\n  <span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>It should store <code>?A ⟹ ?B ⟹ ?A ∧ ?B</code> together with the map <code>{2 -&gt; \"some text\"}</code>.</p>\n<p>Is this even possible? It seems impossible to me since, as far as I can tell, the context passed when running the lemma's attribute (<code>my_attribute</code> above) won't contain whatever data is stored in the context by the assumption's attribute (<code>my_asm</code> above).</p>\n<p>The alternative, of course, would be to include a list of tags for each assumption next to <code>my_attribute</code> but I find that not so nice from an UI perspective</p>",
