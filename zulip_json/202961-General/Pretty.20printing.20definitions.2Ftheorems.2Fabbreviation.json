For this, I can use the <code>lemmas</code> command and just put <code>lemmas foo_def bar_def</code>, but if <code>foo</code> has syntax it would be nice to see the text <code>foo_def</code> next to the equation like with <code>find_theorems</code>.</p>\n<p>I suppose I could just write a custom ML command for this, but it seems like something that Isabelle already does.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
