This means you can now submit your solutions in both Isabelle and Coq. The contest is open starting now until 9 August 2019.</p>\n<p>This also serves as a warmup for the <a href=\"https://www21.in.tum.de/~wimmers/proofground/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www21.in.tum.de/~wimmers/proofground/\">\"Proof Ground\" workshop</a>, which will take place in September alongside the ITP conference in Portland. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers from the ITP community, to discuss and compete in a \"proving contest\", and it will use the Proving for Fun platform. If you happen to have ideas for interesting tasks, please consider submitting them following our \"Call for Problems\".</p>\n<p>We believe our problems should be stimulating as a fun summer activity! We also encourage you to participate and give us feedback on the prototype system.</p>\n<p>Happy proving!</p>",
