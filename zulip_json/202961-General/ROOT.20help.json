I cannot find anything relevant and the system manual tells me to look at the code :o(</p>\n<p>I have a formalisation and want to now add a separate theory for a paper. I want to generate a heapfile for the formalisation, such that whenever I make changes to the paper, I do not get the whole formalisation re-checked (since I did not make changes there). I understand this can be made work with a dedicated session for the formalisation in ROOT and another session that builds on top of this for the paper. Do you happen to have a skeleton ROOT file for setting up something like this?</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot!!!<br>\nChristian</p>",
