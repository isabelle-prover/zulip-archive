To prove the premise, I need to rewrite it slightly (remove the set image): <code>(⋀x b. x ∈ A ⟹ b ∈ B ⟹ ?g (f x) b = ?h (f x) b) ⟹ P2  ⟹ P3 ⟹ Q</code>.  A lemma that takes the original premise and produces the new one is easy to write and can be proven by blast, but I can't apply it because <code>OF</code> tries unify the <code>Q</code> only and not replace the whole higher order premise</p>",
