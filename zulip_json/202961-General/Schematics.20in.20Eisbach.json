I'm using Eisbach's <code>match</code> to perform a top-level pattern matching on a conclusion and pass part of the match result to a lower level tactic which _also_ performs pattern matching to identify suitable simplification operations. The initial conclusion has schematic variables, but they  seem to have been lost by the time the low-level tactic is invoked. Does <code>match</code> remove schematics?</p>",
