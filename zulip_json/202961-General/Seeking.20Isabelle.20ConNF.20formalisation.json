Some of you may know me as one of the authors behind the \"nominal\" in \"Nominal Isabelle\". </p>\n<p>I have a claimed proof of the consistency of Quine's NF.

Its distinguishing feature is that it admits a universal set Omega --- thus Omega is an element of Omega.</p>\n<p>I'd like to offer an opportunity for you work with me on formalising theis proof.  You'd learn some unique stuff about foundations, plus a number of useful proof techniques, and (optionally) about Nominal Isabelle.  And you'd play a role and be seen to have played a role in establishing original proof of a historically important result.</p>\n<p>I hope the above is completely clear and I welcome questions, comments, and DMs.</p>",

Thanks for your message.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>I suppose you know that some people considered formalising Holme's proof in Lean</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, thank you.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Do you think your proof is more amenable to formalisation than Holme's?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Good question.  Yes, I expect my claimed proof to be much more amenable to formalisation.  </p>\n<p>Structurally, the argument requires a simple soundness argument, some cut-elimination, saturating a consistent set to a maximal consistent set, and then building another model from that maximally consistent set.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Are you planning to use Isabelle/Nominal(2)? </li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'd be very pleased to use Nominal Isabelle if this would  be convenient, of course, but how we represent NF syntax and derivation is orthogonal to the proof-method so this would be a pragmatic call.</p>",
