Unfortunately, this tactic does not use the simplifier but only uses the given rules. It would be conceivable to extend <code>rewrite</code> to use the simplifier, though. Another trick is to state the assumptions as a logical conjunction, say <code>A</code>, and write down <code>A = xxx</code> where xxx does appear nowhere in the context and then apply <code>auto</code> to see what auto rewrites <code>A</code> to.</p>",
