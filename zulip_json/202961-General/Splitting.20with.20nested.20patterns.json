Apparently, <code>case</code> expressions with one constructor per pattern are internally represented as full applications of <code>case_⟨type-of-scrutinee⟩</code> and <code>case</code> expressions with multiple constructors per pattern, like the above one, are internally represented as nested applications of such eliminator functions, for example <code>case_option … (case_bool … …) x</code>. This, in turn, should mean that also such more complex <code>case</code> expressions work with the default split rules.</p>\n<p>Maybe I have to search for other reasons why simplification of my goals doesn’t work.
