I noticed that plain <code>string</code> are exported as <code>Char b0 b1 ...</code>, and that there is a String.literal that exports to Haskell <code>[Char]</code>. I've seen we have <code>implode</code> and <code>explode</code> to convert from one to the other, but is there a way for me to define a <code>code_unfold</code> or similar so that every instance of <code>string</code> is replaced by <code>String.literal</code>?</p>",
