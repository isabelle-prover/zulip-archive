The theorem involves <code>conjE</code> which means that I use <code>Thm.assume</code> to construct thms with open assumptions that are closed when using <code>conjE</code>. Unfortunately, this apparently violates Isabelle conventions (see <a href=\"https://mailmanbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/pipermail/isabelle-dev/2016-August/015534.html\">https://mailmanbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/pipermail/isabelle-dev/2016-August/015534.html</a>), because I get an <code>undeclared hyps</code> when writing <code>done</code> after resolving with the theorem. From the mailing list thread alone, I don't really see what I should do instead. Does anybody know what the canonical way is to construct such a proof?</p>",
