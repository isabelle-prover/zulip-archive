Are they using some standard undergraduate textbook for the categorisation?</p>\n<p>I think we should have a fair amount of undergraduate logic, real and complex analysis, ODEs, number theory, analytic number theory, measure theory, probability theory. Algebra is a bit lacking (e.g. we don't have any Galois theory and not much ring theory, although advanced ring theory is perhaps not undergraduate material anyway).</p>\n<p>We don't have a lot of geometry. Geometry in a theorem prover is always a bit annoying, except for the very rigorous and formal kind (like what you do in finite geometry). The typical ‘high school geometry’ problems tend to get pretty annoying though.</p>\n<p>I don't think we have any algebraic geometry. It could be done, but I think our multivariate polynomial library would need a big overhaul. Whenever I use it, I keep running into missing basic material, and the material we do have is spread over like half a dozen AFP entries (which is in part also my fault).</p>\n<p>Other areas where we don't have much (or nothing at all) are game theory, PDEs, statistics, optimisation.</p>\n<p>Two areas where we have quite a bit but it could be better and more systematic are topology and combinatorics.</p>",
