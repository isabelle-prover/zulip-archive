However, there is also the proof method <code>coinduction</code>. Compared to <code>coinduct</code>, <code>coinduction</code> seems to be superior; in particular, it can derive the bisimulation relation to use from the goal, something that <code>coinduct</code> apparently can’t do. I cannot remember having seen <code>coinduction</code> documented anywhere; I only encountered it in some AFP proof. Is there a documentation of <code>coinduction</code> somewhere?</p>",
