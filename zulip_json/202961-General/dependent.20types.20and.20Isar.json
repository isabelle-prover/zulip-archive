If I understand correctly Coq/Lean tend to handle partial functions like division, nat subtraction or cardinality of a potentially infinite set like we do - with default values and careful thinking - even though they have the alternative of having the functions take a proof of the arguments' correctness.</p>\n<p>The latter approach has the downside of essentially having to prove that your terms are valid before considering a proposition, which isn't ideal. However, I feel like it could help with some automation sore spots that I often observe in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>I would like to ask you about any previous work in this area - are there any systems that take full advantage of dependent types? Do they have any interesting syntax or mechanisms for handling the proof arguments of functions?</p>",
