Isabelle/ML just used about 3 GB mem while my PC had 8GB spare mem and 19G spare swap (totally it has 16 GB mem and 20GB swap). The GC is frequent and starts to affect my working efficiency. Sometimes I have to reopen Isabelle to stop endless GC procedure. I wanna know, is this an issue or just some misconfiguration of mine?</p>",

Also any custom Isabelle options you may have set in <code>~/.isabelle/etc</code>.</p>",
