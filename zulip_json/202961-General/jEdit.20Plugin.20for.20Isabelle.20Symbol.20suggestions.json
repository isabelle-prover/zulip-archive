It works quite well except for the fact that Isabelle abbrevations are not expanded anymore when pressing \"Tab\". For example typing \"\\sub\" and then Tab will not expand the suggested unicode.</p>\n<p>Does anyone by chance happens to know which plugin enables these abbreviation previews and handles the expanding? Maybe I can write a workaround for this issue. I assume it is some part of the Isabelle Plugin for jEdit but did not find the responsible Code/Module...</p>",
