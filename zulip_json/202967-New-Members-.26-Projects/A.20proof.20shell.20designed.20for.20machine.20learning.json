However, I hear many complaints from machine-learning colleagues about the difficulties in connecting Isabelle to machine-learning systems. This interface problem seems to become the major issue why people turn to other proof assistants like Lean.</p>\n<p>To address this, I'm proposing <em>Isa Proof Shell</em>: a Unix-pipeline-based interface to Isabelle/HOL specially designed for machine learning integration. It provides a minimal yet powerful abstraction layer that eliminates human-oriented complexities while preserving Isabelle's existing automation power like Sledgehammer. Concurrency and state rollback are also supported.</p>\n<p>The proposal can be found from <a href=\"https://github.com/xqyww123/Isa-Proof-Shell\">its GitHub repository</a>. Any comments, suggestions, and concerns are highly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I have also made <a href=\"https://github.com/xqyww123/Isa-REPL\">a REPL server for Isabelle</a>, also see its <a href=\"#narrow/channel/214136-Announcements/topic/REPL\">zulip thread</a>. I hope machine learning users may find it useful :)</p>",
