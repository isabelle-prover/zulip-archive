To draw the AI community's attention to our practical needs, we propose a benchmark specifically for verification conditions.</p>\n<p>Preliminary experiments on this benchmark show that Isabelle's infrastructure (Sledgehammer) and its LLM-based approach (Minilang) outperform all other models in our study, including those based on Lean and Rocq. <br>\nWe hope this work can serve as a stepping stone toward establishing Isabelle's leading position in the field of AI-assisted automated theorem proving for program verification.</p>\n<p>Cheers, and here's to an even brighter future for Isabelle!<br>\nQiyuan</p>",
