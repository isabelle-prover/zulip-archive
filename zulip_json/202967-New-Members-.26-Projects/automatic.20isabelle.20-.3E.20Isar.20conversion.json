Mainly, because I was curious to see if the procedure would teach me anything to do something similar for Coq (to generate IsarCoq lol but that's besides the point, I am genuinly curious about how generate nice Isar like scripts in general and apply it somewhere later). Ideally, it would be nice with a little machine learning if possible. If it does require machine learning then perhaps ideally not deep learning at first (to do such conversions).  </p>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/isabelle/comments/rh0mh7/is_there_an_automatic_way_to_generate_isar/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/isabelle/comments/rh0mh7/is_there_an_automatic_way_to_generate_isar/</a> and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70352908/is-there-an-automatic-way-to-generate-isar-scripts-given-a-correct-isabelle-tact\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70352908/is-there-an-automatic-way-to-generate-isar-scripts-given-a-correct-isabelle-tact</a></p>",
