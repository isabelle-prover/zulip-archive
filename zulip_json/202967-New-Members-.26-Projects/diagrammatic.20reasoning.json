However, none of the general-purpose proof assistants has these diagrammatic capabilities. Of course, no one wants to work with 4 or more proof assistants depending on the kind of work at hand. So, there is a need for a general-purpose proof assistant with diagrammatic support. Isabelle could be an ideal candidate for this work (with its simple, yet powerful, type theory).<br>\nAs I said previously, there is a variety of possible diagrammatic supports, categorical diagrams for mathematics, neural networks for machine learning, quantum circuits for quantum computing ... Such diagrammatic support on top of isabelle/HOL would be terrific, but it may be very complicated . However, to have at least a framework, inside the generic Isabelle platform, dedicated to a specific topic like machine learning for instance and supporting neural networks as inputs to reason formally on them would be a very nice achievement.</p>\n<p>ps: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"232901\">@Mateja Jamnik</span>'s Diamond was the first diagrammatic prover.</p>",
