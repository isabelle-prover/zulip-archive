Second, to foster collaboration in the Isabelle community by serendipity.<br>\n<span aria-label=\"megaphone\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f4e3\" role=\"img\" title=\"megaphone\">:megaphone:</span> For your own <strong>specific</strong> project <strong>directly</strong> related to the Isabelle theorem prover, feel free to create your own stream. Please use an appropriate name. <strong>Names for streams and subsequent topics should be short, clear and to the point</strong>.<br>\nIf you simply have a question about Isabelle or want to discuss one of the theory libraries in the Isabelle generic framework , then you should use <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"202961\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/202961-general\">#general</a>. In this case, please use one of the previous topics or create an appropriate one if none is a good fit.<br>\nFeel free to use <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"202967\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/202967-new-projects\">#new projects</a>  to propose ideas of collaborations. It's ok if  you have only rough ideas, but if you embark on a project and open a new stream, then as requested above it should be specific enough to avoid the proliferation of inactive streams that lead nowhere. So, before opening a new stream you may want to have a critical number of potential collaborators depending on the length and difficulty of your project.</p>\n<p>cheers</p>",
