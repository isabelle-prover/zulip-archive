An idea for a collaborative project would be to extend it and turn <a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2019/doc/prog-prove.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2019/doc/prog-prove.pdf\">prog-prove</a> into a set of such problems. <br>\nBeginners can then work on those problems one by one and get motivated by seeing their progress in the system. After submitting a correct solution, users could be allowed to see (and up-vote) solutions of others in order to learn good proving style and discover different approaches.</p>",
