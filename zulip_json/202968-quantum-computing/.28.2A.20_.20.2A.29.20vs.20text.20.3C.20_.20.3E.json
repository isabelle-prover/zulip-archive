Indeed, we will eventually submit to the AFP or/and to a journal, so we will have a .bib file anyway. Moreover, for the biblio please use BibTeX entries.<br>\nOf course comments <code>text &lt; _ &gt;</code> within the body of a theory are fine, but don't lose too much time on them right now, we can still work on them later during the documentation preparation. However, if you have collaborators, or even for yourself, use enough source comments. <br>\nI updated the theory files accordingly in my master branch. <br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"228787\">@Hanna Lachnitt</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"228785\">@Yijun He</span></p>",
