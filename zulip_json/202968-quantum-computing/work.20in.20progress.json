In particular, I want to show that if the kth position in the binary representation is 0, then the result of the division I of this number by 2^(m-k) is even where m is the total number of bits. (Intuitively this is clear, if we cut off the bit after k digits and the last one is 0 then the resulting number is even)</p>",
