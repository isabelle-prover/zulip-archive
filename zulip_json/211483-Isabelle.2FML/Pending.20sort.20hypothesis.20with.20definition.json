After reading about that I removed all unnecessary forall-bound variables and the goal is proven as expected.<br>\nHowever if I add a definition for part of the body of the goal using <code>Local_Theory.define_internal</code> and try to prove that, i get 'pending sort hypothesis' again, even though the goal has no foralls at all.<br>\nDoes anyone know why this is happening?</p>",
