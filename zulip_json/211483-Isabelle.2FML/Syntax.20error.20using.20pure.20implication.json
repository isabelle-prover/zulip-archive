As far as I know, it exists to suppress the implicit insertion of judgments (like <code>Trueprop</code> in Isabelle/HOL). Those judgments (which embed object logic propositions into <code>prop</code>) are added implicitly because, in most cases, people work in an object logic, not in Pure directly. It would be annoying to add judgments around statements, assumptions, etc. manually all the time, so Isabelle adds them implicitly for you.
