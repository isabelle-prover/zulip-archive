The documentation <code>implementation</code> describes that type as however <code>bool -&gt; cterm list -&gt; thm -&gt; thm</code> (page 121 for version Isabelle2021), which loses the explanation about the second argument, the export map of type <code>term -&gt; term</code>.  I guess it is used for exporting some term shape, but what term it is, the term of proposition of the theorem or the term variables (fixed variables)? However, both the standard exports, the <code>assume_export</code> and <code>presume_export</code> set that term export as just <code>fn x  =&gt; x</code>, seeming that the term export just useless, which makes me confused more. While that term export, I found, does be used somewhere in the Isabelle system,  can I naively set it also as <code>fn x =&gt; x</code>?</p>",
