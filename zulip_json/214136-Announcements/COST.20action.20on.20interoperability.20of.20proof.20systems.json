There are currently 6 working groups (WG):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>WG1: Proof systems interoperability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>WG2: Automated theorem provers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>WG3: Program verification.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>WG4: Libraries of formal proofs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>WG5: Machine learning in proofs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>WG6: Type theory.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will find all the details on the objectives of EuroProofNet in <a href=\"https://e-services.cost.eu/files/domain_files/CA/Action_CA20111/mou/CA20111-e.pdf\">https://e-services.cost.eu/files/domain_files/CA/Action_CA20111/mou/CA20111-e.pdf</a> .</p>\n<p>A COST action can fund visits to other labs, and participation to summer schools, workshops and conferences. Anyone willing to contribute to the goals of the action is eligible. If you are interested, you just need to register on <a href=\"https://e-services.cost.eu/action/CA20111/working-groups/apply\">https://e-services.cost.eu/action/CA20111/working-groups/apply</a> .</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>Frédéric Blanqui, chair of EuroProofNet.</p>",
