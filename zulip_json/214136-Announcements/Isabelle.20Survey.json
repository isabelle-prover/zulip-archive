The package manager is envisioned to complement the AFP and streamline Isabelle-based development lifecycles. As part of their methodology, they would like to survey the Isabelle community to gather requirements and preferences for the development.</p>\n<p>We'd be very grateful if you can therefore fill out the following survey: <a href=\"https://york.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eUKMk2amXlWBsmq\">https://york.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eUKMk2amXlWBsmq</a>. May we please ask you to only reply via the survey link, rather than by email. Thank you for your help with this.</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>Christian Pardillo Laursen</p>",
