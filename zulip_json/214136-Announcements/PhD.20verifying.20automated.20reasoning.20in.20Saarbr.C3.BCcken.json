The project is about using Isabelle/HOL to formalize logical calculi. Today, much of the research done in automated reasoning is carried out with pen and paper, but we believe proof assistants can help researchers write better proofs and ultimately design better automatic theorem provers.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.cs.vu.nl/~jbe248/sb_job.html\">the job ad</a> for more information.</p>",
