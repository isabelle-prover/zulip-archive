The competition itself will be run via the contest system, while the workshop will provide a platform for discussion among the participants.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www21.in.tum.de/~wimmers/proofground2019/\">first edition</a> of the workshop has been held at <a href=\"https://itp19.cecs.pdx.edu/\">ITP 2019</a>.
