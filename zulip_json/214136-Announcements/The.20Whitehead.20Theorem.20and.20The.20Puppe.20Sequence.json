This bulletin is for everyone interested in computerized mathematics and categories, such as the mathematics in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/\">Mathlib 4</a>.</p>\n<p>The linearlibrary team is interested in enlisting the help of students and mathematicians interested in homotopy and simplicial sets to prove twenty-four important results in homotopy theory and stable homotopy theory inside the Lean 4 computer proof assistant. Powerful yet convenient, these results will largely be established for Mathlib 4's pre-existing objects, such as those involving <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/AlgebraicTopology/SimplicialSet.html\">simplicial sets</a>.</p>\n<p>Later plans will extend these features to Isabelle, perhaps helping to bridge the conceptual divide between proof assistants based in types vs. higher order logic.</p>\n<p>Are you interested in the twelve theorems outlined in the document <a href=\"https://github.com/linlib/ThreeWhiteheadTheoremsandThreePuppeSequences/blob/main/ThreeWhiteheadTheoremsandThreePuppeSequences.pdf\">here</a>? Reach out to ``edeany@nyu.edu\" with the subject \"Whitehead Theorem and Puppe Sequence for Lean 4\" for more information, or if you would like to participate.</p>",
