While I take basic measures to accurately represent the work and avoid harmful or incorrect connotations, Japanese is my only native language. If you notice any problematic expressions, I would greatly appreciate your constructive feedback.</p>\n<p>At the moment, Iâ€™m introducing papers that I co-authored as the lead author. If you have a peer-reviewed academic paper on theorem proving, and (AI, programming languages, computer architecture, or CPU design) that you would like included in the series, feel free to let me know.</p>\n<p>Wishing you a happy New Year! <span aria-label=\"bamboo\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f38d\" role=\"img\" title=\"bamboo\">:bamboo:</span><br>\nYutaka</p>",
