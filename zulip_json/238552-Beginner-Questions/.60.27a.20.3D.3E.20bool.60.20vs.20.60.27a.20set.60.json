In HOL4, 'a set is just by definition the same as 'a =&gt; bool, whereas I have discovered that in Isabelle there exists s file called Set.thy. I saw the declaration of the type 'a set there, means they are different. The practical difference which means something for me is that for P :: 'a -&gt; bool, the expression `a \\&lt;in&gt; P' (btw, how to type \\&lt;in&gt; in Tulip?) does not type check anymore. </p>\n<p>So may I please ask what do people conventionally use to jump between 'a -&gt; bool and 'a set? Is there any theorem of form \"P a &lt;-&gt; a in Collect P \"?</p>\n<p>I tried to type</p>\n<p>find_theorems \"(s a) ↔ (a ∈ Collect s)\"</p>\n<p>Isabelle complains \"Inner lexical error Failed to parse term\".</p>",
