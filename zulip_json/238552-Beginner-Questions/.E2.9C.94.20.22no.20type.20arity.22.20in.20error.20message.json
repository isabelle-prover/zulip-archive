If you open a theory file in Isabelle/jEdit that is part of the current heap image, there you cannot <code>Ctrl+click</code> around in it. One workaround is to start with the <code>Pure</code> image instead of the <code>HOL</code> image, e.g. by running <code>isabelle jedit -l Pure</code>, but then you have to wait for the entire HOL library to build inside Isabelle/jEdit first, which will take a few minutes (or more, depending on your hardware).</p>",
