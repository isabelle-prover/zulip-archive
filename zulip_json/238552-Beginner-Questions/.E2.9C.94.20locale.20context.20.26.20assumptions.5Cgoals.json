For your example, this means that you don’t have to prove <code>a &gt; 1 ⟹ a &gt; 1</code> (after all, the lemma states just <code>a &gt; 1</code>), but you have to prove <code>a &gt; 1</code> and in doing so you can refer to the locale assumption by its name <code>p</code>. Thus you could write the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>lemma &quot;a &gt; 1&quot;\n   using p .\n</code></pre></div>",

Thus your goal is <code>a &gt; 1</code>, which you can prove using the fact <code>p: a &gt; 1</code>, and after you have proved this goal, Isabelle will give you the fact <code>a &gt; 1</code> in the locale context and the fact<code>a &gt; 1 ⟹ a &gt; 1</code> in the global context.</p>",
