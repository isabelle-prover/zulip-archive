        "content": "<p>This is a question about the long term future of isabelle and whether it would be possible to implement (classical, extensional) dependent type theory on top of HOL in isabelle.<br>\nJacobs has proved that there is a (surface) embedding of dependent type theory into HOL, and they implemented a prototype.<br>\nIt is well known that Martin-Lof type theory with extensional equality has undecidable type checking.<br>\nHowever there may be heuristics that are good enough, especially if the user is considering dependent types A -&gt; Type where A is a simple type without much interesting structure. The Lean theorem prover (which is based on intensional dependent type theory) implements a definitional equality which is known to be undecidable, but its heuristics for type judgements appear to be effective in most cases.<br>\nIn addition, automated theorem provers have gotten better over the years and it may be possible to use them in some cases to resolve the validity of typing judgements.<br>\nThe research group at KWARC has implemented a dependent type theory in their logical framework, called MMT, where typing judgements are dispatched to the HOL-based theorem prover Leo-III.</p>\n<p>So in conclusion what I am asking is: would isabelle developers ever consider implementing a dependently typed layer over HOL together with a translation from dependent type theory into HOL? Is it possible for Isabelle users to write such an interface using the logical framework features of isabelle? It would be nice to take advantage of the strong automation of Sledgehammer while also having the more expressive/concise code of dependent type theory. In my opinion the additional verbosity of HOL makes it easier to introduce mistakes into a definition of a complex concept.</p>",

This is super cool. My question is motivated by desires for good/strong automation in dependent type theory leveraging stuff like Sledgehammer in the HOL ecosystem. I think design of dependent type theory is a broad spectrum and homotopy type theory is pretty far away from the design choices that would enable us to take advantage of sledgehammer. The difference between a deep embedding and shallow embedding is kind of a spectrum too, but I doubt it's possible to give an embedding of HoTT in HOL that would be \"shallow\", so realistically this project is unlikely to be able to draw on HOL's powerful automation.</p>",

I don't know what heuristics are used but the thesis does discuss the distinction between the \"ideal\" definitional equality (which is undecidable) and the actual definitional equality which is is implemented in practice in the type checking algorithm. This is probably a good point of departure.</p>",

I also may have partially contributed this by mentioning lean, a proof assistant based on intensional type theory.<br>\nHowever, this thread is not about homotopy type theory, the univalence axiom, and so on. The type theory I am asking about is extensional, classical dependent type theory, which is inconsistent with  the univalence axiom. I consider homotopy type theory and extensional dtt to be very different logical systems! Their models look nothing alike. Extensional  dependent type theory admits a fairly naive translation into set theory. The Univalence axiom requires a sophisticated interpretation using Kan complexes. I fully agree with you that implementation of homotopy type theory in Isabelle/HOL would be a \"deep\" embedding but I have explicitly cited in my OP researchers who have constructed shallow embeddings of extensional dependent type theory in HOL.<br>\nNot to over simplify the point but HOL users already use mock dependent types in the form of maps <code>'a =&gt;' b set</code> and in my opinion what i am asking for is closer to syntactic sugar on top of this which attempts to filter out nonsense in the formalization, rather than a full blown embedding of infinity groupoids in HOL.</p>",
