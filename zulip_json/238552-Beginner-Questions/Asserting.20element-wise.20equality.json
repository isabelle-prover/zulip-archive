The method of proof I came up with is showing that there's a bijection between the list on the LHS and the set on the RHS, and then showing that the fold(+) (with identity 0) and Sum functions are equivalent. How do I do this, or how else can I approach the problem?</p>",

The summation on the right is also these elements. In particular, I thought the j &lt;= k notation meant summing from 0 to k. </p>\n<p>I don't think induction works (neatly) because the only equality I'm familiar with for going from (n choose m) to (n + 1 choose m) is ((n + 1) choose m) = n choose m + n choose (m - 1). I think it's possible to prove it this way, but I thought there would be a much simpler way because the terms on each side are all equal.</p>",
