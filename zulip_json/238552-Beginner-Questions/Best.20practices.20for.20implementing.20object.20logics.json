(I know that we can prove results concerning the implementation, but just \"quick example usage\" type tests are helpful.)</li>\n<li>Are there expected metatheorems to prove various properties of the object logic?</li>\n<li>Are there idiomatic judgments to implement? Is there some expected \"skeleton\" which object logics should resemble?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(I <a href=\"https://proofassistants.stackexchange.com/q/2727/14\">asked this</a> on the proof assistants stackexchange site, but that site seems to increasingly defunct...)</p>",
