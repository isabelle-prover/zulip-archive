FYI, I am using 15' 2016 MacBook Pro with 4 cores and 16GB RAM, and still feels that the memory is not enough when editing large theories. A trick here is to start from the HOL-Analysis heap image (rather than HOL) to reduce the memory usage. The instruction is to select <code>HOL-Analysis</code> in the <code>theory</code> tab on the right-most part of the jEdit interface: <a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/fHNWkoIfu0mtXzh1d-i2_-5N/image.png\">image.png</a>, and then restart Isabelle.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/fHNWkoIfu0mtXzh1d-i2_-5N/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/fHNWkoIfu0mtXzh1d-i2_-5N/image.png\"></a></div>",
