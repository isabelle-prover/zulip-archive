As a junior user, I think maybe there will still be some obvious \"wrong\" way of using Isar stuff, or some folklore among Isar users that I do not know. Here is a proof file that I wrote for formalizing the tree-like model property of modal model theory in Isabelle. It is less than 1000 lines long and this single file is self-contained. I would really appreciate it if some mature users could take a look at it and tell me if there is anything that should be better changed.</p>\n<p>I am not asking for a detailed review (I am very aware of the fact that you experts are very busy). I would just like to know if there is something obvious to be improved, even without the knowledge of the proof that I am formalizing. And no emergency at all! <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/wXG9yUj17evu9NJibCyTFBTL/Tree_Like_Property.thy\">Tree_Like_Property.thy</a></p>",
