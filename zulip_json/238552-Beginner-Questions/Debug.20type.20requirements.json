        "content": "<p>The type class <code>enum</code> requires a finitely enumerable type. Since <code>nat</code> is not finite, there cannot be an instance <code>nat :: enum</code>. Some of your definitions that quickcheck tries to evaluate require an enumerable type. Only then they are executable, e.g. try <code>value {x :: nat. x &lt; 3}</code>. You may be able to prove code equations to resolve this issue, e.g. <code>value {..&lt;3::nat}</code> works and produces the desired result. However, I would need more information about your definitions to really help you with that.</p>",
