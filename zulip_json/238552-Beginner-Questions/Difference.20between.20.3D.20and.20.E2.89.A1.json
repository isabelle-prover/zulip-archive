But this is somewhat refuted by the fact that the following works (for a suitable definition of lists etc):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>lemma &quot;append_list xs [] ≡ xs&quot;\n  apply (induction xs)\n  apply (auto)\n  done\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>where the ≡ is used within a HOL statement (if I understand correctly). Here, interestingly, after the induction the subgoals are stated using = instead of ≡:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>goal (2 subgoals):\n 1. append_list [] [] = []\n 2. ⋀x1 xs. append_list xs [] = xs ⟹ append_list (x1 # xs) [] = x1 # xs\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I would be grateful for any pointers to an explanation of = and ≡.</p>",

There is no real reason to use it as an Isabelle ‘user’, much less than using e.g. <code>⟹</code> (which does have its uses). This is probably explained somewhere in the Isabelle/Isar reference manual (isar-ref), but as I said, it's not really something you have to know about as a user.</p>\n<p>I think the only case in which is might crop up is that the <code>abbreviation</code> command insists on a specification with <code>≡</code>, not <code>=</code> (and will complain otherwise).</p>",

The quotes distinguish outer syntax from inner syntax. The inner syntax is what you use to specify terms and types. The outer syntax is what you use to interact with the system.</p>\n<p>If you take a look at Isabelle/Pure (<code>~~/src/Pure/Pure.thy</code>), you will see lots if Isabelle/Pure statements inside quotes as well. In Isabelle/Pure, you have a type <code>prop</code> of propositions and some built-in connectives like <code>⟹</code>, <code>⋀</code>, and <code>≡</code>.</p>\n<p>HOL then axiomatises a <code>bool</code> type that can be converted to <code>prop</code> using the function <code>Trueprop :: bool ⇒ prop</code>. Whenever you write down a proposition in HOL (i.e. <code>bool</code>-valued), Isabelle implicitly wraps a <code>Trueprop</code> around it and hides it from you. HOL also has object-level equivalents to all the meta-level equivalents from Pure, and you can convert between the two in both directions as long as the thing you're looking at is of HOL (i.e. not <code>prop</code>. You can only reason about <code>prop</code> directly in Isabelle/Pure).</p>",
