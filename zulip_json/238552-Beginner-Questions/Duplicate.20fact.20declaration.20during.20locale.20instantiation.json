Those theorems are just technical and not really used in the big locale, but they do cause an error during the instantiation, telling that 'Duplicate fact declaration is not allowed'.<br>\nSo, is there any easy way to forget some lemmas in a locale or maybe suppress the declaration or maybe rename the confliction automatically?</p>\n<p>Thank you, dear Isabelle's friends.</p>",
