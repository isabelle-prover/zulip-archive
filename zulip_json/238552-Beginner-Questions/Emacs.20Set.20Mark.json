It went well in most cases, but the command <code>Emacs Set Mark</code> does not work. When I invoke the command, the message \"Input/output complete\" appears in the minibuffer, and nothing happens in the editing area.<br>\nDoes anyone have an idea to fix it? I tried the various shortcut keys but all fail.<br>\nI use macOS Big Sur (version 11.5.1), Isabelle2021. (The keyboard is Japanese style.)</p>",
