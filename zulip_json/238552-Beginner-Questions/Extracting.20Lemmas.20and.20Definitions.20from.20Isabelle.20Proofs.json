For example in the following lemma:</p>\n<p>lemma step_suc_sem: \\&lt;open&gt;step (n,\\&lt;sigma&gt;) = (suc n \\&lt;sigma&gt;, sem n \\&lt;sigma&gt;)\\&lt;close&gt; unfolding suc_def sem_def by auto</p>\n<p>Since suc/sem are in my list of identifiers, I can see they appear in the proof. Moreover, when something ends in _def I can check to see which identifier appears before it. However when I encounter a term like \"linorder_neqE_nat\" even though linorder is in my list of identifiers it's not clear which options can appear at the end of linorder from the definition I find associated to it. Maybe this doesn't come from the definition of linorder at all and is just the name of a lemma, but when I checked the Nat.thy file I didn't recognize the syntax with which the term appeared - my understanding is lemmas show up in the form \"lemma &lt;name&gt; : &lt;statement&gt;\". </p>\n<p>In any case, I want to know if there's a list of ways a definition or lemma can make an appearance in a proof, syntactically speaking. I couldn't tell from checking the Isabelle manual. Thanks.</p>",
