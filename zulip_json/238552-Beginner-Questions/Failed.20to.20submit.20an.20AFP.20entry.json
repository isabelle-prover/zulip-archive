To quickly debug such errors, it might be easier to do your local build instead of going through the AFP submission process. Local build can be done via command like <code>isabelle2022 build -o document=pdf -o document_output=\"output\" -c -D Polygonal_Number_Theorem</code>, where <code>isabelle2022</code> should be an Isabelle binary -- on my Mac it is <code>/Applications/Isabelle2022.app/bin/Isabelle</code>.</p>",
