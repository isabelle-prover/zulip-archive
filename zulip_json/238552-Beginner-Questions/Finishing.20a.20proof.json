Usually, it's quite obvious why that is the case, although there are some cases where one has to look very closely (e.g. when types of polymorphic functions don't match up). In this case, it is simply because you forgot to add a <code>next</code> after you concluded the <code>True</code> case. Without a <code>next</code>, all the fixed variables and assumptions from the <code>True</code> case are still around.</p>",

I very much doubt that your Isar proof for it actually does anything because that variable <code>m</code> that you use in it is not fixed anywhere (that's why it is with an orange background). So I'm pretty sure Isabelle will basically ignore that statement in the final step and just prove the goal directly.</p>",
