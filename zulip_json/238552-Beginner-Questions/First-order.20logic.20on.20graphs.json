I started reading \"Concrete Semantics\" by Nipkow and Klein followed by \"Certifying Machine Code Safety: Shallow versus Deep Embedding\"  by Wildmoser and Nipkow and recently found a techn. report by Volker \"A Deep Embedding of ZC in Isabelle/HOL\" (<a href=\"http://repository.essex.ac.uk/14449/\">http://repository.essex.ac.uk/14449/</a>) in which De Bruijn terms are used. Based on my limited understanding, this approach makes much sense to represent my logic, so-far . Any thoughts\\guidance\\comments  would be highly appreciated.</p>",
