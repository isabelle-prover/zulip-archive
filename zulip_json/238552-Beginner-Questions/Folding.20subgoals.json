I'm doing a large proof where it seems difficult to avoid a temporary case split, but where, ultimately, I end up with subgoals of a shape close to <code>A0 =&gt; A1 =&gt; ... =&gt; An =&gt; X_i =&gt; GOAL</code>, which I would like to 'fold' into a single goal <code>A0 =&gt; A1 =&gt; ... =&gt; An =&gt; (X0 \\/ X1 \\/ ... ) =&gt; GOAL</code> since the subsequent reasoning will be the same for all of them. The proof is largely automatic and the exact shape of assumptions and goals somewhat fluent, so it's difficult to state the desired <code>A0 =&gt; A1 =&gt; ... =&gt; An =&gt; (X0 \\/ X1 \\/ ... ) =&gt; GOAL</code> upfront.</p>",
