        "content": "<p>Hi, in my project I have introduced a lot of locales, which are generalizations of oneanother. Specifically i have the hierarchy:<br>\nstochastic_process <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊇</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\supseteq</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7719em;vertical-align:-0.136em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">⊇</span></span></span></span> adapted_process <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊇</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\supseteq</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7719em;vertical-align:-0.136em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">⊇</span></span></span></span> progressive_process <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊇</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\supseteq</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7719em;vertical-align:-0.136em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">⊇</span></span></span></span> predictable_process</p>\n<p>For each of these locales, I have two additional \"instantiations\":<br>\nnat_stochastic_process = stochastic_process ........<br>\nnat_adapted_process = adapted_process ........<br>\n.....<br>\nand</p>\n<p>real_stochastic_process = stochastic_process ........<br>\nreal_adapted_process = adapted_process ........</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I have two other conditions, one: the underlying filtrations can be sigma finite, two: the codomain of the processes can be ordered banach spaces. Therefore currently I have introduced all possible combinations of locales, ranging from \"stochastic_process_order\" to \"real_sigma_finite_predictable_process_order\".</p>\n<p>In total, I have around 40-50 locales and 10-20 sublocale relations covering all possible combinations. </p>\n<p>Today, I noticed that I also need to consider the case where the measure space is finite, so I need to add at least 40 other locales to cover all possible combinations and also prove all sublocale relations (something like nat_adapted_process <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊆</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\subseteq</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7719em;vertical-align:-0.136em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">⊆</span></span></span></span> nat_stochastic_process is not generated automatically). </p>\n<p>From a style perspective, would it make more sense to include all possibilities, or should I only introduce the locales that I will actually use, and leave the rest to others (or me in the future) who will (hopefully) use my formalization for their purposes. I only really need sigma_finite_adapted_process, nat_sigma_finite_predictable_process and a couple more for example.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR; Should I introduce locales for all combinations of type classes, or should I only introduce the locales that I will actually use?</strong></p>",
