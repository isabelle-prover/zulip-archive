Thanks a bunch.</p>\n<p>If you don't mind a follow-up question: this just happened to be included somehow with my isabelle installation. By ctrl+clicking on the import statement I could look into the source and hence the (inline comment) docs. On the internet I also found a nicely formatted PDF. Do you know if this PDF does also happen to be in my isabelle installation? I have the prog-prove.pdf, locales.pdf, etc. in the jedit documentation pane, but there seems to be no PDF on HOL-Library/Pattern_Aliases. I also browsed around my isabelle folder and indeed the number of pdfs seems limited. Is there some extra pdf documentation package I can download? Or can I maybe render these PDFs myself locally?</p>",
