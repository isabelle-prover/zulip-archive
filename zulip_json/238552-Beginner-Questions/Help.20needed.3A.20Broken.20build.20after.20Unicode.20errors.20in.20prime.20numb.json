However, after trying to fix two minor errors (which looked like <strong>Unicode errors</strong>), everything broke. Now, I cannot even run a 15-second compilation without everything failing. My attempts to fix it myself have only made the situation worse.</p>\n<p>I have uploaded my code here:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/tnPiPXjQ-n747OhJehx8UiYD/geometrie_spectre_premier-2.zip\">geometrie_spectre_premier (2).zip</a><br>\nIf someone could spare some time to look at my code and tell me what is wrong, I would be very grateful. Please don't expect too much from me regarding Isabelle basics, as I am still very much learning the fundamentals.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance for your kindness and help!</p>\n<p>Best regards, Philippe\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi Philippe,</p>\n<p>before attempting to generate a LaTeX PDF, I would first try to fix the proofs: several of your <code>by simp</code> proof attempts either don't terminate or do not prove the goal (I am using Isabelle 2025-2). Also, in the definition of <code>spectral_list</code> you should replace <code>\\leftrightarrow</code> with <code>\\longleftrightarrow</code>.</p>\n<p>Maxi</p>",
