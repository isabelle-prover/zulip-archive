While this usually not something people apparently look for in Isabelle, I want something akin to Rocq's <code>Show Proof</code>. I tried switching my environment to HOL-Proofs, to no avail, following this SO thread as reference: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30688177/how-to-see-step-by-step-reasoning-of-isabelle-proofs\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30688177/how-to-see-step-by-step-reasoning-of-isabelle-proofs</a>. </p>\n<p>Again, I do understand why this is usually not of interest, but I would find it quite helpful.</p>",
