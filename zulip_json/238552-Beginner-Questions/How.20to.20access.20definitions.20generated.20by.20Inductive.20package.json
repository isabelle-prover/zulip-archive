        "content": "<p>Hi, I am working in Isabelle/ZF but my guess is that the question is also relevant for Isabelle/HOL. <br>\nWhen I make a datatype, there are definitions and lemmas generated by ML code.  From the examples, I can see that they have names like list.defs and  list.bnd_mono etc. How can I get a list of them (for a particular datatype) and how can I access their definition. There is a similar question in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65556815/how-to-show-the-defintion-of-functions-in-isabelle\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65556815/how-to-show-the-defintion-of-functions-in-isabelle</a> and  there they indicate  a way to print definitions by accessing the ML level. If this is the way to do it, can someone help me how to do it in jedit,  by showing me the exact command (and in what window) for the example of lists defined in List.thy. <br>\nThanks<br>\nDan</p>",
