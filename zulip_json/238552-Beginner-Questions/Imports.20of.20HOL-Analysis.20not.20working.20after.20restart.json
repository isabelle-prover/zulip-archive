Previously, I was able to import theories like <code>\"HOL-Analysis.Analysis\"</code>, <code>\"HOL-Analysis.Interval_Integral\"</code>, <code>\"HOL-Probability.Distributions\"</code>, and <code>\"HOL-Probability.Distribution_Functions\"</code> in my <code>.thy</code> files without any issues. My code hasn't changed at all.</p>\n<p>But after restarting Isabelle, suddenly all these imports fail (showing <strong>Bad Theory</strong> errors). Sometimes the error messages even disappear after a while, but the imports are still not working.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know what could cause this?<br>\nWhy would these standard theories become unavailable after a restart, even though it worked before?</p>\n<p>Any tips on how to debug or fix this would be much appreciated!</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/CIi6j-guAkekah6GMM18Agi_/Screenshot-2025-08-03-at-23.13.17.png\">Screenshot 2025-08-03 at 23.13.17.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/CIi6j-guAkekah6GMM18Agi_/Screenshot-2025-08-03-at-23.13.17.png\" title=\"Screenshot 2025-08-03 at 23.13.17.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"790x210\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/14278/CIi6j-guAkekah6GMM18Agi_/Screenshot-2025-08-03-at-23.13.17.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
