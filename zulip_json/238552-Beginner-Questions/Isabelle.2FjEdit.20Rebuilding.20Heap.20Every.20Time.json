I’d really appreciate any insights.</p>\n<p>I ran <code>isabelle build -D .</code> to build some sessions in batch mode, and everything worked as expected. However, now when I start Isabelle/jEdit, it starts rebuilding the heap every time, which takes a long time. This never happened before. This happens <strong>every single time</strong> I start Isabelle/jEdit now. The output on the console says \"Build started for Isabelle/HOL..<br>\nBuilding Pure..<br>\nBuilding HOL..<br>\n.....\"</p>\n<p>Did I accidentally break my Isabelle installation, or is there something I need to configure to prevent this unnecessary recompilation?</p>",
