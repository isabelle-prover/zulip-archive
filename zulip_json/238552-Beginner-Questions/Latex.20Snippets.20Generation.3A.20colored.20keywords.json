I noticed that it is possible to do this in a rather automatic way as introduced in this <a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2022/doc/sugar.pdf\">sugar</a> file. </p>\n<p>Are colored keywords also supported in this approach? I searched for color in the <code>isabelle.sty</code> and <code>isabellesymb.sty</code> files, but found none. If it is not supported, does anyone have any suggestions for realizing this functionality?</p>",
