In a way I'm trying to declare a type parameter.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately Isabelle gives an error saying, at declaration of Inner, there is a free type variable on the right hand side. Instead, I would like it to use the <code>'element_type</code> type parameter from the locale. I want this because then the subsequent datatypes don't need an extra type parameter, and this makes all function types a bit shorter.</p>\n<p>I could add this type parameter everywhere to avoid using a locale. But I feel like it would be more readable like this. Am I doing something wrong or is there maybe some different construct I can use to emulate this?</p>",
