Makarius created Isabelle/jEdit and decided at some point that maintaining both was too hard so only Isabelle/jEdit remained.</p>\n<p>Then at some point he got money from someone (I don't remember), but developed an LSP server for Isabelle and the VSCode plugin to connect to the LSP server.</p>\n<p>This LSP server is the only alternative today to Isabelle/jEdit. There are three editors supporting it: VScode and Emacs and vim. For practical reasons (some missing feature in LSP I wanted to have), I have a slightly changed Isabelle (meaning only in  the LSP server). Not much has changed, so I assume that the vim plugin is still working. Emacs is still working. But I did not have time to port that to Isabelle2025-RC2</p>\n<p>There was a bachelor thesis at TUM that re-developped some of the features I had and put them into Isabelle, but this is also on my todo list.</p>",
