        "content": "<p>Hey, I want to formalize a particular logic in Isabelle, and to study it I need to be able to adjust the power of its formulas. One thing I need is expressing that a logical formula (in a standard language with <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, etc.) contains no universal quantifiers. I.e. it is of the form Exists a . Exists b . phi(a, b)... Or to express that a formula may or may not have a free variable. I really don't want to deal with name binding on my own - do you think I could use Isabelle's machinery somehow to reason about the logical formulas themselves? I attach a screenshot of the definition of what I'm actually going after, this is definition 4.14 from <a href=\"https://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/cook-nguyen.pdf\">https://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/cook-nguyen.pdf</a> <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/oZ5MAty5oz4NmIYNlEN1JYOg/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/oZ5MAty5oz4NmIYNlEN1JYOg/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1032x565\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/14278/oZ5MAty5oz4NmIYNlEN1JYOg/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
