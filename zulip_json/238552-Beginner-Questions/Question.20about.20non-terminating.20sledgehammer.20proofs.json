However, I have noticed that sometimes proofs which sledgehammer indicates as timing out actually do appear terminate when they are used (I say \"appears\" to mean that the syntax highlighting which indicates the non-termination of a tactic goes awayâ€”is there another indication of termination besides syntax highlighting?). I am wondering if a sledgehammer proof is safe to use if it appears to terminate within the Isabelle theory, even if sledgehammer itself says that it timed out.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
