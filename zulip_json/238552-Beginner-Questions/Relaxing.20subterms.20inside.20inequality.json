I guess for inequalities it should be something like rewriting modulo closed set of relations, in this case {≥, ≤}, which are swapped at subtraction and division. Whether the relations are equivalence relations (like congruence) or not (like inequalities) shouldn't matter very much for this notion of rewriting.</p>",
