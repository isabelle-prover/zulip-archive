In the course of these proofs, many assumptions build up and tend to slow down proofs significantly. However many assumptions are not really required at that point of the proof, so I would like to discard them for further steps. Is there a canonical way (proof pattern, proof method) for this? Or does anyone have a suggestion on how to build such a method?</p>",
