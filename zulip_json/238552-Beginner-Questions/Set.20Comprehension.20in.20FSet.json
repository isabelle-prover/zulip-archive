I’ve browsed through the FSet source code but couldn’t find anything that directly provides this functionality.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know if such a feature exists in Isabelle’s standard library? </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Isabelle\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">fun</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">fset_less_than</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">::</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"nat ⇒ nat fset\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kp\">where</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"s\">\"fset_less_than n = undefined\"</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

More generally (noting I have not used the FSet library myself), keep in mind set comprehensions in Isabelle is pretty syntax for filters. A quick search showed there was also a definitition for filter in the FSet library too (just perhaps not the same nice notation!).</p>",

        "content": "<p>Set comprehension like <code>{x. x&lt;n}</code> uses not filter of another set, but <code>Collect</code>, which essentially converts an <strong>arbitrary</strong> predicate, <code>\\x. x&lt;n</code> in this case, into a set. But in general, it's impossible to convert arbitrary predicate on an infinitely large type like <code>nat</code> into a finite set, which I suppose is unfortunately what the original question is all about. So in short, no, I don't think it's possible to reasonably (i.e. not using <code>Abs_fset</code>) define such a set with any sort of set comprehension.</p>\n<p>The trick with list comprehension is based on the intrinsic finiteness of list.</p>",

        "content": "<p>That's definitely correct, apologies I rushed my first answer! Filters on sets are defined as a special case of collect when it's working from a predefined set (i.e. <code>{x \\in A. P x} </code>). I would say that if the original question was more asking about set comprehensions generally instead of just that specific example, the filter function on FSets could still be useful if your comprehension looks more like the above <strong>and</strong> if A is already defined as a finite set.</p>",
