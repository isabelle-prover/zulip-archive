Is there a way to force Isabelle to carry out strong induction (in the <code>Suc x</code> case, the induction hypothesis is that the predicate holds for all <code>n &lt; Suc x</code>)? Thanks</p>",

That will not give you <code>0</code> and <code>Suc</code> as cases though, but only a single induction case <code>less</code> where you get as an induction hypothesis that the property holds for all <code>k &lt; n</code>. If you want to distinguish between e.g: zero and non-zero, you have to do an additional case split (or prove a custom induction rule that does this, e.g. with <code>induction_schema</code>).</p>",
