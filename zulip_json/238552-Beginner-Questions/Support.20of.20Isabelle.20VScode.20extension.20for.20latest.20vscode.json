Updating this is difficult due to build issues on Windows IIRC.</li>\n<li>The VSCode extension is built as a component to run on Isabelle/VSCode by the <code>Component_VSCode_Extension</code> module. What you see in <code>src/Tools/VSCode/extension</code> are sources for that module, not a standalone extension. This is why you will find things like <code> \"ISABELLE_OPTIONS\": {},</code> that are replaced in the build process.</li>\n</ul>",
