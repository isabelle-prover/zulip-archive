Now, I need to build a topology on the total type, \"'a x (('a =&gt; real) =&gt; real)\", that induces the given topology on my set. I believe there is no way to build this topology constructively, but there might be a way to prove there exists a topology satisfying my property by making use of indirect methods. Can I then put a topological_space instance on \"'a x (('a =&gt; real) =&gt; real)\" using SOME? Would this be problematic?</p>",
