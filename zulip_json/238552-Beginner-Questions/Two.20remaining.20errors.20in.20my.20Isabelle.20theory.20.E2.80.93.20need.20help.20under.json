I would be grateful for any help or suggestions.</p>\n<p>The first issue appears in the following lemma:</p>\n<p>lemma infinitely_many_half_ratios: \"(n. philippot_term (Suc n) / philippot_term n = (1 / 2 :: rat))\" using philippot_ratio_half by simp</p>\n<p>In VS Code, the part \"by simp\" is marked in red, even though the lemma looks correct. I suspect there may be an invisible character or some subtle syntax problem, but I cannot find it.</p>\n<p>The second issue concerns the definition of spectral_sum. I want it to be written in a simple and standard way, without any special symbols. Here is the version I am currently using:</p>\n<p>definition spectral_sum :: \"nat list =&gt; rat\" where \"spectral_sum L = (SUM n &lt;- L. of_nat n)\"</p>\n<p>I am not sure if this is the correct or idiomatic form.</p>\n<p>I have attached a zip file containing my updated theory.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your time and help.<br>\nPhil<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/Cin2PnocRkes9cFsw7ey58z2/geometrie_spectre_premier_savard.zip\">geometrie_spectre_premier_savard.zip</a></p>",
