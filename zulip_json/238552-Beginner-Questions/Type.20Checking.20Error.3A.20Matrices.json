        "content": "<p>The error is because indices of <code>A</code> are of type 3 and the bounded variables <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are of type 4, and Isabelle does not know how to automatically convert from this one type to another. We can perhaps do this conversion manually, but it is not immediately to me how to do it.  </p>\n<p>Nevertheless, given the inflexibility of the HOL type system, my personal choice would be to avoid encoding matrix dimension into types. In particular, the two-dimensional matrix type <code>'a mat</code> from the AFP entry <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/theories/jordan_normal_form/#Matrix.html#Matrix.mat|type\">Jordan_Normal_Form</a> is much easier to work with than the <code>vec</code> encoded matrices, e.g., <code>((real, 'b) vec, 'c) vec</code>.</p>",
