On the one hand, I used Isabelle with jedit and fed .thy files into Aider <a href=\"https://aider.chat/docs/install.html\">https://aider.chat/docs/install.html</a> ... having forgotten all of Isabelle syntax this worked better than not having an AI. But it  is certainly not (yet?) as groundbreaking as using Aider for ordinary programming languages. Summary: mildly positive effect of AI, helpful for beginners, useless for experts.  I wanted to compare this with using Github Copilot which integrates well with vscode. But now it seems that I cannot use the Github Copilot extension at the same time as the Isabelle Vscode extension. Tell me if I am wrong, but afaics, the <code>isabelle vscode</code> is completely separated from 'ordinary' vscode.</p>",
