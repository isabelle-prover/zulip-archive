I can't find any guidance.</p>\n<p>The AFP download page only shows the current version as a downloadable - which seems to change frequently, which <em>suggests</em> to there being a range of acceptable afp versions for the current Isabelle. But I suppose that today's version isn't expected to work with older Isabelle versions?</p>\n<p>That download page has a link to older versions in Sourceforge, but those are for 2020 and earlier. </p>\n<p>There is also a link to the Hg repo afp-devel, which has year tags. But e.g. there's no tag for 2025. So, what is the latest repo that I can use with Isabelle2024? Should I play it safe and just use the 2024 tag?</p>\n<p>I also found that the Heptapod isa-afp group has projects named after each year, like afp-2024. This <em>looks</em> like the latest afp version that should work with Isabelle2024 - but having something official would be great. And, why is it a separate repo?</p>\n<p>Relatedly, looking at the afp-devel repo, looks like it uses branches with the name of each version, like afp-2025 (see e.g. <a href=\"https://foss.heptapod.net/isa-afp/afp-devel/-/commit/5d7573bb1dc0e943e9e5054c0e2f289355f301d9\">this commit</a> merging it). This makes perfect sense, but could we please have those branches visible? If they were I could go and check out the branch I need for my Isabelle version (e.g. afp-2021), see where it stopped being updated, and generally make sense of everything by myself.</p>\n<p>Am I missing some documentation? If not, it'd be great to have all of this explained somewhere. As an Isabelle beginner, it's already difficult enough to make sense of things without wondering if things are breaking because I'm using a \"bad\" AFP.</p>",
