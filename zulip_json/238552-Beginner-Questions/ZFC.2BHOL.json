If I want to do category theory in ZFC using this development i am curious what HOL buys you. Both in practical and theoretical terms, in expressiveness and convenience, what  would be the difference between doing math in ZFC in FOL vs doing math in HOL where all the mathematical objects are terms of V? what are some ways that isabelle's rich type system could improve your quality of life here?</p>",
