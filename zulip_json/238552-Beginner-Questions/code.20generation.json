Down the track (probably in a year or so), its likely I'll want to use this formalisation to generate code for a few different algorithms, something I have not done in Isabelle before. Does anyone have any general tips for things I should be keeping in mind now as I'm setting up all the definitions, that would make code generation easier in the future?</p>",

I am at a point where I just need Isabelle to use a specific (opam) switch that I manually installed and not the one generated with <code>isabelle ocaml_setup</code>. If anyone has any input on which Isabelle-shell-variables to modify so that this works, please feel free to answer, comment, or provide suggestions on this topic.</p>",
