It gives examples like <code>lattice_hom</code> which is great and looks general, so I naturally think there should be locales like plus_homomoprhism and group_homomoprhism in the standard library, but I didn't find them. Did I find at wrong places? Or, is there any particular reason to not include such locales in the standard library?</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/KGj82ZjhIiXZTO1y5F00jKy2/2022-03-31-12-22-24-的屏幕截图.png\">lattice_hom</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/KGj82ZjhIiXZTO1y5F00jKy2/2022-03-31-12-22-24-的屏幕截图.png\" title=\"lattice_hom\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/KGj82ZjhIiXZTO1y5F00jKy2/2022-03-31-12-22-24-的屏幕截图.png\"></a></div>",
