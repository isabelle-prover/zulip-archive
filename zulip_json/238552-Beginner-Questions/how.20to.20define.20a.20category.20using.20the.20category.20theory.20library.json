Do I define a locale like \"locale cat = Category + \"(which also throws an error saying Category isn't defined, I only imported Main, maybe I need to iport something else, I triied Category2 and  Category3 but failed), should I write a definition using \"MakeCat \" or \"('o,'m,'a) Category_scheme \", if so, how? Or should I do something entirely different? If there are resources I can use to mimic the style of such a constructipon, I'd highly appreciate it! Sorry for the dumb question lol.</p>",
