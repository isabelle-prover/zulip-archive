Since I use CTRL to navigate through definitions, inspect the type etc. it gets tiring very quickly. I don't remember this being a thing with my setup a few months ago when I was still on Isabelle2021. I looked into the settings to see if there is anything related, but to no avail. Is there anything I can do to disable this notification bell?</p>",
