I am new to Isabelle, and am currently<br>\n familiarising myself with the basics of proving things.<br>\nOne of the annoying things I found in using Isabelle is editing: it is a pain<br>\nfor me to navigate in the jEdit editing interface, especially <br>\ndoing things like adding parenthesis around expressions <br>\nto make sure there are no operator priority issues etc.<br>\nAre there any plugins that allow you to edit<br>\nin your familiar editor(vim/ emacs etc.) within the console?</p>\n<p>Any info on this is appreciated.
