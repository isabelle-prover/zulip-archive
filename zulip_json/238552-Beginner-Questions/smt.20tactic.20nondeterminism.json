On Windows, I run into the following scenario: I open theory files via the Isabelle GUI (jEdit) and then some <code>smt</code> tactics fail sometimes (not always the same ones). If I then rerun the tactic (e.g., by removing and adding the same <code>smt</code> tactic again), then the tactic usually succeeds. Whenever, I run the session via the Isabelle command line on Linux (Windows Subsystem), then I never get any errors. Has anyone run into this issue or knows how to resolve it?</p>",

When I use <code>declare [[smt_trace=true]]</code> I seem to get a standard error message showing the SMT query that veriT uses (I have attached the error message). Is such a standard error message consistent with the view that the cause is thread contention? Could it be that the SMT solver is being invoked with different settings on different runs (for example, different random seeds)?<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/Ophk3WgMc6TiyU5yWwbJvbST/20230712_smt_tactic_failure_trace.txt\">20230712_smt_tactic_failure_trace.txt</a></p>",
