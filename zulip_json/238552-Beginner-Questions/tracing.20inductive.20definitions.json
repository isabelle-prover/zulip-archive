It is just a copy of <code>Ind_Syntax.trace</code> in <code>~~/src/ZF/ind_syntax.ML</code>, introduced in the same commit. <code>indrule.ML</code> was deleted in <code>8a1059aa01f0</code> but <code>ind_syntax.ML</code> still remains to this day, so you could probably use that one. You can set it on the ML level, using for example <code>ML‹Ind_Syntax.trace := true›</code>.  I have no idea about Isabelle/ZF so take all of this with a grain of salt.</p>",
