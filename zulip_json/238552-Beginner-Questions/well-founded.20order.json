I have no experience with orders in Isabelle and the source files are confusing me a little bit. Could you help me to state \"r is a well-founded partial order on B * B\" in Isabelle the right way?</p>\n<p>Also, to induct on (B, r) I think I will need the wf_induct rule, but I could not find any good examples of how to use it correctly. It would be great if you could point me to some theories which make use of wf_induct, so that I can get an idea by looking at examples.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot.</p>",
