But yeah, without the \"unlocking\" that you suggest, we would just need to make much harder problems. Which would obviously be a possibility though.</p>",

Might have been different if I had focused on one... I also missed somehow that task 2 was the much easier task in problem 1, because I started with task 1 and then ran out of time. <br>\nSo I would have preferred if the afternoon session was the same time if the morning session, which would have made it a bit easier to at least finish one problem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you prefer offline/online/or rolling competitions (e.g. like Project Euler)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I liked the online competition. It might be an option to have a rolling competition with the same problems and a community voting, where the goal is to find the shortest or most beautiful proof. That would have a different focus and could also be used to show differences between the different tools.</p>",
