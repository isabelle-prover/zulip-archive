The point of this is to have a record of what was published — e.g. it’s already impossible to recreate the website from 2005 with the tools from back then, but it’s very easy to just check it out. Using something like hugo now makes this even more important.</p>\n<p>I don’t see that this has anything to do with the error that was reported, though. The devel website script is supposed to overwrite the contents of what is in the repository, the content in web/ is only important for the release version where it is checked that it is in sync.</p>\n<p>So if there are links to the release left over in devel, the problem is in the script and it doesn’t matter if we check it in or not.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",
