We also solicit<br>\nextended abstracts describing work-in-progress, as well as presentations<br>\ncovering previously published results, extended abstracts of doctoral<br>\ntheses, and overviews of research projects that are of interest to the<br>\nworkshop.</p>\n<p>At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop to<br>\npresent the contribution.</p>\n<p>CHC Competition:</p>\n<p>HCVS 2024 is planning to host the 7th competition on constraint Horn<br>\nclauses (CHC-COMP <a href=\"https://chc-comp.github.io/\">https://chc-comp.github.io/</a>), which will compare<br>\nstate-of-the-art tools for CHC solving for performance and effectiveness<br>\non a set of publicly available benchmarks.</p>\n<p>Program Chairs:</p>\n<p>Julie Cailler,Â  University of Regensburg, Germany<br>\nDaniel Neider, Technical University of Dortmund, Germany</p>\n<p>Submissions:</p>\n<p>Submission must be done in one of the following formats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Extended abstracts (from half to 3 pages in EPTCS format), which describe<br>\nwork in progress or aim to initiate discussions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Presentation-only papers, i.e., papers already submitted or presented<br>\nat a conference or another workshop. Such papers can be submitted in any<br>\nformat, and will not be included in the workshop post-proceedings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Regular papers (up to 12 pages plus bibliography in EPTCS<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.eptcs.org/\">http://www.eptcs.org/</a>) format), which should present previously<br>\nunpublished work (completed or in progress), including descriptions of<br>\nresearch, tools, and applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tool papers (up to 4 pages in EPTCS format), including the papers<br>\nwritten by the CHC-COMP participants, which can outline the theoretical<br>\nframework, the architecture, the usage, and experiments of the tool.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All submitted papers will be refereed by the program committee and will<br>\nbe selected for inclusion in accordance with the referee reports.</p>\n<p>If enough regular papers are accepted, both regular papers and extended<br>\nabstracts will be published electronically. The publication of a paper<br>\nis not intended to preclude later publication. Full versions of extended<br>\nabstracts, or substantial revisions, may later be published elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Papers must be submitted through the EasyChair system using the web page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hcvs2024\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hcvs2024</a></p>",
