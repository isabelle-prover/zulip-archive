I was not aware, that it can be used to do what <br>\nI was looking for: consume an assumption which is already in the goal <br>\nstate, by extracting all assumptions and inputting them to the cases method.</p>\n<p>I had already tried the goal_cases method, but that adds all assumptions <br>\npresent in the split goals to the cases, not only those stemming from <br>\nthe elimination rule (i.e., not only the hyps but also the prems, using <br>\nthe names given by the induct method). Moreover, I did not succeed to <br>\napply it specifically to the goals created by applying the elimination rule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the form<br>\n   apply(erule r) apply(goal_cases)<br>\nit creates (of course) cases for all existing goals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the form<br>\n   apply(erule r; goal_cases)<br>\nit seems to create a case only for the first goal, even if application <br>\nof r creates more than one goal (?)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regards</p>\n<p>Gunnar Teege</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/pPZiAMXUfHPcsS_o1ZRuBZzM/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
