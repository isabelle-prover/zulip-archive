Additionally, this conference seeks to facilitate the <br>\ntransfer of experience, adaptation of methods, and where possible, <br>\nfoster collaboration among different groups. The topics of interest <br>\ncover all aspects of formal methods, especially those related to <br>\nadvancing the application of formal methods in the software industry and <br>\npromoting their integration with practical engineering techniques. <br>\nFollowing the success of the previous FSEN editions, the next edition of <br>\nthe FSEN conference will take place in Tehran, Iran, May 3-5, 2023.</p>\n<p>-- Important Dates --</p>\n<p>Abstract Submission: October 7, 2022 (AoE)<br>\nPaper Submission: October 14, 2022 (AoE)<br>\nNotification: December 2, 2022<br>\nFinal pre-Conference Version: January 20, 2023 (AoE)<br>\nConference: May 3-5, 2023</p>\n<p>-- Keynote Speakers (confirmed) --</p>\n<p>Wolfgang Ahrendt, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden<br>\nDines Bjørner, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark<br>\nMohammad Reza Mousavi, King's College London, UK<br>\nHeike Wehrheim, University of Oldenburg, Germany</p>\n<p>-- Topics of Interest --</p>\n<p>The topics of this conference include, but are not restricted to, the <br>\nfollowing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Models of programs and software systems</li>\n<li>Software specification, validation, and verification</li>\n<li>Software testing</li>\n<li>Software architectures and their description languages</li>\n<li>Object, actor and multi-agent systems</li>\n<li>Coordination, feature interaction and software product lines</li>\n<li>Integration of formal and informal methods</li>\n<li>Integration of different formal methods</li>\n<li>Component-based and service-oriented software systems</li>\n<li>Collective, self-adaptive and cyber-physical software systems</li>\n<li>Model checking and theorem proving</li>\n<li>Quantitative formal methods</li>\n<li>Software and hardware verification</li>\n<li>CASE tools and tool integration</li>\n<li>Industrial applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-- Paper Submission --</p>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit full papers (up to 15 pages including <br>\nreferences) describing original research, applications and tools; or <br>\nshort papers (up to 6 pages including references) describing ongoing <br>\nresearch or new ideas that have not yet been fully validated. Both <br>\ncategories of papers must be submitted electronically in PDF using the <br>\nonline submission process via the Easychair conference system at the <br>\nfollowing link: <a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fsen2023\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fsen2023</a>.</p>\n<p>Contributions must be written in English, should be formatted according <br>\nto the Springer LNCS style (LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates) that can be <br>\nfound at the following link <br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>) <br>\nand not exceed the page limit for the category (including figures and <br>\nreferences).</p>\n<p>Each submission will be thoroughly reviewed by at least three reviewers <br>\nconsidering scientific originality, significance, relevance to the FSEN <br>\nconference, technical soundness, clarity, self-containedness and <br>\ndiscussion of appropriate related work.</p>\n<p>The reviewers will be asked to rate the submissions and evaluate whether <br>\nthey can be accepted as:<br>\n1) Full paper for the LNCS post-proceedings and conference pre-proceedings<br>\n2) Short paper for the LNCS post-proceedings and conference pre-proceedings<br>\n3) Poster included only in the pre-proceedings<br>\nPapers accepted in the first 2 categories will be invited for <br>\npresentation at the conference. Posters will be illustrated by the <br>\nauthors in separate poster sessions.</p>\n<p>Submissions are required to report on original, unpublished work and <br>\nshould not be submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere (cf. <br>\nIFIP's Author Code of Conduct, see <a href=\"http://www.ifip.org/\">http://www.ifip.org/</a> under <br>\nPublications/Links).</p>\n<p>-- Proceedings and Special Issue --</p>\n<p>The post-proceedings of FSEN'23 will be published by Springer in the <br>\nLNCS series. Pre-proceedings, printed locally by IPM, will be available <br>\nat the conference. Following the tradition of FSEN, we plan to have a <br>\nspecial issue of the Science of Computer Programming journal devoted to <br>\nFSEN'23. After the conference a selection of papers will be invited for <br>\nthis special issue. The invited papers should be revised and extended <br>\nand will undergo a new round of review by an international program <br>\ncommittee. Please see the websites of previous editions of FSEN for more <br>\ninformation on post-proceedings and special issues related to those <br>\neditions.</p>\n<p>-- General Chairs --</p>\n<p>Farhad Arbab - CWI, the Netherlands; Leiden University, the Netherlands<br>\nPejman Lotfi-Kamran - IPM, Iran</p>\n<p>-- Program Chairs --</p>\n<p>Hossein Hojjat - Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies, Iran<br>\nErika Abraham - RWTH Aachen University, Germany</p>\n<p>-- Publicity Chair --</p>\n<p>Maurice ter Beek - CNR-ISTI Pisa, Italy</p>\n<p>-- Steering Committee --</p>\n<p>Farhad Arbab - CWI, the Netherlands; Leiden University, the Netherlands<br>\nChristel Baier - University of Dresden, Germany<br>\nFrank de Boer - CWI, the Netherlands; Leiden University, the Netherlands<br>\nAli Movaghar - IPM, Iran; Sharif University of Technology, Iran<br>\nHamid Sarbazi-azad - IPM, Iran; Sharif University of Technology, Iran<br>\nMarjan Sirjani - Mälardalen University, Sweden; Reykjavik University, <br>\nIceland (Chair)<br>\nCarolyn Talcott - SRI International, USA<br>\nMartin Wirsing - LMU Munich, Germany</p>\n<p>-- Program Committee --</p>\n<p>SEE WEBSITE</p>",
