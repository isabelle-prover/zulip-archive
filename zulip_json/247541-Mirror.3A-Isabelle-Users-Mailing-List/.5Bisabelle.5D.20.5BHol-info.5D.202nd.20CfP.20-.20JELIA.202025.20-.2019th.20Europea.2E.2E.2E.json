While high school textbooks state that a vector has both<br>\nmagnitude and direction, they often describe the zero vector as lacking<br>\ndirection, which is contradictory. Here's a more precise explanation:</p>\n<p>Definition of a Vector: A vector is a quantity with both magnitude and<br>\ndirection.</p>\n<p>Zero Vector: The zero vector has a magnitude of zero and does not exert<br>\ninfluence in any direction, which might lead to the assertion that it lacks<br>\ndirection. However, it is more accurate to say that its direction is zero.</p>\n<p>Thus, the zero vector is a special case. Since its magnitude is zero, it<br>\ndoes not point in any specific direction, but in mathematical terms, the<br>\nexpression \"direction is zero\" can still be valid.}</p>\n<p>2024.12.30.6:15</p>\n<p>\\bigskip</p>\n<p>{\\bf For complex numbers $z$, and for $z=0$, $\\log 0= \\arg 0=0$}.</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>Here, we will consider vectors and complex numbers $z$ as two-dimensional<br>\nvectors. We state that the direction of the zero vector is zero. However,<br>\nthe precise meaning is $\\arg 0 =0$.</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>{\\it The direction of zero $z=0$ exists as in other vectors $z$.}</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>This definition, along with its natural motivation and many applications,<br>\nhas been established in prior works \\cite{mms18,saitoh}.</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>Note the simple facts:</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>In the well-known formula</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>\\log z = \\log |z| + \\arg z,</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>we have</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>\\log 1 = \\log 1 + \\arg 1,</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>\\log 0 = \\log 0 + \\arg 0.</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>Therefore, we have</p>\n<p>$$\\arg 1 = \\arg 0 =0.</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>Note, furthermore, that in the identity</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>\\arg \\overline{z} = - \\arg z,</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>if the function $\\arg z$ is extensible to the origin as an odd function,<br>\nthen the value $\\arg 0$ has to be zero.</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>In addition, note that in the formula</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>\\arg z = \\arctan \\frac{y}{x}</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>for $x=y=0$ we have, from $0/0=0$,</p>\n<p>that</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>\\arg 0=0.</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>For this Section, see \\cite{mika, saitoh} for the details.</p>\n<p>\\subsection{The direction of the general zero vector}</p>\n<p>We will be interested in some direction of the zero vector in general<br>\ndimensions.</p>\n<p>In order to state the representation precisely, we shall consider vectors<br>\nas elements of a separable Hilbert space. Then, we consider the<br>\nrepresentation of vectors ${\\bf v}$ in terms of a fixed complete<br>\northonormal system $\\{\\bf e_j\\}_j$ as in</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>{\\bf v} = \\sum_j v_j {\\bf e}_j.</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>Then, the vector ${\\bf v}$ and the coefficients $\\{v_j\\}$ correspond to one<br>\nto onto on $\\ell^2$.</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>{\\bf Statement:} {\\it</p>\n<p>We shall define the direction of ${\\bf v}$ by the coefficients $\\{v_j\\}$<br>\nthat is determined by a positive multiplication of $\\{v_j\\}$ and the zero<br>\nvector is represended by all $v_j=0$. Therefore, the direction of the zero<br>\nvector may be considered as zero in this sense.</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>Note that the concept of direction of zero vector is reasonable in the<br>\nsenses</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>{\\bf v} + {\\bf u} = \\sum_j v_j {\\bf e}_j + \\sum_j u_j {\\bf e}_j = \\sum_j<br>\n(v_j + u_j) {\\bf e}_j</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>{\\bf v} - {\\bf v} = \\sum_j (v_j - v_j) {\\bf e}_j = \\sum_j (0) {\\bf e}_j=<br>\n{\\bf 0}.</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>\\bigskip</p>\n<p>{\\bf Logical Problem:} {\\it If we do not give the definition of direction<br>\nof zero vector, in the fundametal equation</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>{\\bf v} + {\\bf 0} = {\\bf v},</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>we have the logical contradiction that by the addition of zero vector with<br>\nno direction, we have the same direction of ${\\bf v}$}.</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>Indeed, in the above identity, we can not say the direction of vectors.</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>This contradiction is similar that: The identity</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} + x= x</p>\n<p>$$</p>\n<p>is not valid at $x=0$, because they are not define at $x=0$.</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>However, we can still consider the open problem:</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>{\\bf Open problem 1:} {\\it As in two dimensions, could we find some natural<br>\nformulation that the direction of zero vector is zero, in general<br>\ndimensions.</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>Indeed, in the 2 dimensional case, zero direction was given by the pleasant<br>\nsense $ \\arg 0=0$.</p>\n<p>\\medskip</p>\n<p>&gt;<br>\n&gt;</p>",
