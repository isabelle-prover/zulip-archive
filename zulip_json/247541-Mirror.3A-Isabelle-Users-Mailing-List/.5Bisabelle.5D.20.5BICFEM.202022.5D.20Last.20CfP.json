Since 1997, ICFEM has been serving as an<br>\ninternational forum for researchers and practitioners who have been<br>\nseriously applying formal methods to practical applications. Researchers<br>\nand practitioners, from industry, academia, and government, are encouraged<br>\nto attend, present their research, and help advance the state of the art.<br>\nICFEM is interested in work that has been incorporated into real production<br>\nsystems, and in theoretical work that promises to bring practical and<br>\ntangible benefit. ICFEM has been hosted in many countries around the world.</p>\n<p>Participation</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We expect ICFEM 2022 to take place physically. However, in case any<br>\nparticipant requires to assist/present virtually we will provide support<br>\nfor attending the conference online.</p>\n<p>Topics of Interest</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit high quality technical papers describing<br>\noriginal and unpublished work in all theoretical aspects of software<br>\nengineering. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstraction, refinement and evolution</li>\n<li>Formal specification and modelling</li>\n<li>Formal verification and analysis</li>\n<li>Model checking</li>\n<li>Formal approaches to software testing and inspection</li>\n<li>Formal methods for self-adaptive systems</li>\n<li>Formal methods for object-oriented systems</li>\n<li>Formal methods for component-based systems</li>\n<li>Formal methods for concurrent and real-time systems</li>\n<li>Formal methods for cloud computing</li>\n<li>Formal methods for cyber-physical systems</li>\n<li>Formal methods for software safety and security</li>\n<li>Formal methods for software reliability and dependability</li>\n<li>Development, integration and experiments involving verified systems</li>\n<li>Formal certification of products under international standards</li>\n<li>Formal model-based development and code generation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Workshop/Tutorial Proposals: March 13, 2022 (send your proposals to<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:ariesco@ucm.es\">ariesco@ucm.es</a>)<br>\nAbstract Submission: April 10, 2022 (AOE)<br>\nPaper Submission: April 17, 2022 (AOE)<br>\nAuthor Notification: June 26, 2022<br>\nCamera-ready versions: July 10, 2022<br>\nConference: October 24-27, 2022</p>\n<p>Publication</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The proceedings of the ICFEM 2022 symposium are planned to be published in<br>\nLecture Notes in Computer Science (Springer).
