New firm <br>\n deadlines are 25 June (abstract) and 02 July (paper). However, authors are <br>\n encouraged to submit abstracts as soon as possible to ease the planning of <br>\n the reviewing process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to submit<br>\n an extended version of their papers to a special issue in the journal<br>\n Theoretical Computer Science (TCS):<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/theoretical-computer-science\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/theoretical-computer-science</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ABOUT PROTESTS IN PERU</p>\n<p>We are continuously monitoring the political situation in the host country Peru, <br>\n which faced violent protests in 2022 also affecting travelers. To the best of our <br>\n knowledge, this situation has calmed down. If protests erupt again, we will work <br>\n closely with the ICTAC Steering Committee to choose the best feasible solution.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES </p>\n<p><em>NEW</em> abstract deadline: 25 June 2023 (AoE)<br>\n<em>NEW</em> submission deadline: 02 July 2023 (AoE)<br>\n Notification: 10 September 2023 (AoE)<br>\n Camera ready: 25 September 2023 (AoE)</p>\n<p>SCOPE</p>\n<p>The ICTAC conference series aims at bringing together researchers<br>\n and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present<br>\n research and exchange ideas and experiences within theoretical aspects <br>\n of computing through methods and tools for system development. <br>\n ICTAC also aims to promote research cooperation between developing <br>\n and industrial countries.</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>The conference concerns all aspects of theoretical computer science,<br>\n including, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Languages and automata</li>\n<li>Semantics of programming languages</li>\n<li>Logic in computer science</li>\n<li>Lambda calculus, type theory, and category theory</li>\n<li>Domain-specific languages</li>\n<li>Theories of concurrency and mobility</li>\n<li>Theories of distributed computing</li>\n<li>Models of objects and components</li>\n<li>Coordination models</li>\n<li>Timed, hybrid, embedded, and cyber-physical systems</li>\n<li>Security and privacy</li>\n<li>Static analysis</li>\n<li>Software verification</li>\n<li>Software testing</li>\n<li>Program generation and transformation</li>\n<li>Model checking and theorem proving</li>\n<li>Theory and methods of trustworthy AI</li>\n<li>Applications and experiences</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>We solicit submissions, related to the topics of ICTAC, in the<br>\n following categories:</p>\n<p>A. original research contributions;<br>\n B. short papers, with original work in progress or with proposals of <br>\n    new ideas and emerging challenges; and<br>\n C. tool papers on tools that support formal techniques for software<br>\n    modeling, system design, and verification.</p>\n<p>Submissions must not exceed 16 pages (excluding bibliography of<br>\n maximum 2 pages). Short and tool papers should not exceed 8 pages.</p>\n<p>Submissions must not have been published or be under consideration for<br>\n publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis<br>\n of originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation<br>\n quality, and relevance to the conference’s topics.  </p>\n<p>All contributions to ICTAC 2023 have to be submitted electronically<br>\n in PDF format via Easy Chair</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac20230\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac20230</a></p>\n<p>Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS<br>\n papers (see <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/lncs\">http://www.springer.com/lncs</a>), without modifications of <br>\n margins and other space-saving measures. Authors should therefore consult<br>\n Springer’s authors’ instructions and use their proceedings templates, <br>\n either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. <br>\n Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers.</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION</p>\n<p>All accepted papers in categories A-C will appear in the proceedings of<br>\n the conference that will be published as a volume in Springer’s Lecture <br>\n Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.</p>\n<p>All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their authors must<br>\n be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one author of<br>\n each accepted paper must register for the conference by the early <br>\n registration date, and present the paper.</p>\n<p>We will have a special issue at the journal (TCS) Theoretical Computer <br>\n Science: <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/theoretical-computer-science\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/theoretical-computer-science</a>.<br>\n We will invite selected accepted papers from ICTAC 2023 to submit an extended <br>\n versions of their contribution to the special issue.</p>",
