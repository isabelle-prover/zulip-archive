Short and tool papers should not exceed 8 pages.</p>\n<p>Submissions must not have been published or be under consideration for<br>\n publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis<br>\n of originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation<br>\n quality, and relevance to the conference’s topics.  </p>\n<p>All contributions to ICTAC 2023 have to be submitted electronically<br>\n in PDF format via Easy Chair</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac20230\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac20230</a></p>\n<p>Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS<br>\n papers (see <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/lncs\">http://www.springer.com/lncs</a>), without modifications of <br>\n margins and other space-saving measures. Authors should therefore consult<br>\n Springer’s authors’ instructions and use their proceedings templates, <br>\n either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. <br>\n Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers.</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION</p>\n<p>All accepted papers in categories A-C will appear in the proceedings of<br>\n the conference that will be published as a volume in Springer’s Lecture <br>\n Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.</p>\n<p>All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their authors must<br>\n be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one author of<br>\n each accepted paper must register for the conference by the early <br>\n registration date, and present the paper.</p>\n<p>A special journal issue is planned for extended versions of selected papers<br>\n from ICTAC 2023.</p>",
