If I increase the timeout to 60 seconds, it stops at just under 30 seconds.<br>\nAnd I am sure that it does not abort due to the lack of a proof, as I have at least one example where sledgehammer does not find a proof with 30 seconds timeout, in which case it terminates after about 15 seconds without a proof. However, with 60 seconds timeout, a proof is found after about 20 seconds.</p>\n<p>Typically I would provide a small example of said case, but I have failed to produce one of reasonable size so far. I do get this behaviour in my own formalization.
