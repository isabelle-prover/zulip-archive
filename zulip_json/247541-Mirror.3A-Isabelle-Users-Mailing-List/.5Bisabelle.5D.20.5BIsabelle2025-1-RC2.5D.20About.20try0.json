The default schedule is the following:</p>\n<p>declare [[try0_schedule = \"<br>\n  satx metis |<br>\n  order presburger linarith algebra argo |<br>\n  simp auto blast fast fastforce force meson<br>\n\"]]</p>\n<p>See the new documentation further down. In a nutshell, you can change<br>\nthe ordering by moving the names around or use full parallel<br>\nexecution by removing the vertical bars.</p>\n<p>I changed the default timeout from 5 to 2 seconds; it can still be<br>\nincreased or decreased on a case-by-case basis with <code>using\n[[try0_default_timeout = &lt;integer&gt;]]</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My second question is: Could these changes be added to the news?<br>\nCurrently it states nothing about changes to try0 while this one is<br>\nquite large in my opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, I added the following documentation entry to NEW:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>try0:<ul>\n<li>Proof methods can now be dynamically added with the function<br>\n  Try0.register_proof_method and retrieved (e.g., to call them from<br>\n  Isabelle/ML) with the function Try0.get_proof_method.</li>\n<li>Added the option \"try0_schedule\" to control which proof methods get<br>\n  tried in which order. It accepts a list of proof method names<br>\n  separated by either a space, meaning parallel evaluation, or<br>\n  vertical lines, meaning sequential evaluation. The schedule is<br>\n  interpreted as list of groups executed in sequence; in each group,<br>\n  the proof methods are executed in parallel. INCOMPATIBILITY.</li>\n<li>Added the option \"try0_default_timeout\" to control the default<br>\n  timeout (in seconds).</li>\n<li>Changed the default timeout from 5 to 2 seconds.<br>\n  Minor INCOMPATIBILITY.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nMartin</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
