It aspires to be a lively environment for<br>\npresenting the latest research results, and other contributions.</p>\n<p>This year, TFP will take place in-person at UMass Boston,<br>\nMassachusetts in the United States.  It is co-located with the Trends<br>\nin Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE) workshop, which will<br>\ntake on the day before the main symposium.</p>\n<h2>Scope</h2>\n<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various<br>\nroutes. As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore<br>\nidentify the following five article categories. High-quality articles<br>\nare solicited in any of these categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Research Articles:<br>\n   Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Position Articles:<br>\n   On what new trends should or should not be</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Project Articles:<br>\n   Descriptions of recently started new projects</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Evaluation Articles:<br>\n   What lessons can be drawn from a finished project</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Overview Articles:<br>\n   Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for<br>\npublication to any other forum. They may consider any aspect of<br>\nfunctional programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or<br>\nexperience-oriented. Applications of functional programming techniques<br>\nto other languages are also within the scope of the symposium.</p>\n<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing</li>\n<li>Functional programming in the cloud</li>\n<li>High performance functional computing</li>\n<li>Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs</li>\n<li>Dependently typed functional programming</li>\n<li>Validation and verification of functional programs</li>\n<li>Debugging and profiling for functional languages</li>\n<li>\n<p>Functional programming in different application areas:<br>\n   security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded<br>\n   systems, global computing, grids, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interoperability with imperative programming languages</p>\n</li>\n<li>Novel memory management techniques</li>\n<li>Program analysis and transformation techniques</li>\n<li>Empirical performance studies</li>\n<li>Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages</li>\n<li>(Embedded) domain specific languages</li>\n<li>New implementation strategies</li>\n<li>Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of<br>\nTFP, please contact the TFP 2023 program chair, Stephen Chang.</p>\n<h2>Best Paper Awards</h2>\n<p>TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.</p>\n<p>First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best<br>\noverall paper accepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.</p>\n<p>Second, a prize for the best student paper is awarded each year.<br>\nTFP traditionally pays special attention to research students,<br>\nacknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new<br>\nsubject trends. A student paper is one for which the authors state<br>\nthat the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are listed<br>\nas first authors, and a student would present the paper.</p>\n<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the<br>\nbest paper happens to be a student paper, then that paper will receive<br>\nboth prizes.</p>\n<h2>Instructions to Authors</h2>\n<p>Papers must be submitted at:</p>\n<p>&lt;<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp23\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp23</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions<br>\nformally reviewed either before or after the Symposium.<br>\nFurther, pre-symposium submissions may either be full (earlier deadline)<br>\nor draft papers (later deadline).</p>\n<h2>Pre-symposium formal review</h2>\n<p>Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be<br>\nsubmitted before the early deadline and will receive their reviews and<br>\nnotification of acceptance for both presentation and publication<br>\nbefore the symposium. A paper that has been rejected for publication<br>\nbut accepted for presentation may be resubmitted for the<br>\npost-symposium formal review.</p>\n<h2>Post-symposium formal review</h2>\n<p>Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of<br>\nacceptance for presentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers<br>\nwill be invited to submit revised papers based on the feedback receive<br>\nat the symposium. A post-symposium refereeing process will then select<br>\na subset of these articles for formal publication.</p>\n<h2>Paper categories</h2>\n<p>Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as<br>\nextended abstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (20<br>\npages). The submission must clearly indicate which category it belongs<br>\nto: research, position, project, evaluation, or overview paper. It<br>\nshould also indicate which authors are research students, and whether<br>\nthe main author(s) are students. A draft paper for which all authors<br>\nare students will receive additional feedback by one of the PC members<br>\nshortly after the symposium has taken place.</p>\n<h2>Format</h2>\n<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS<br>\nstyle. For more information about formatting please consult the<br>\nSpringer LNCS web site.</p>\n<h2>Program Committee</h2>\n<p>Peter Achten,              Radboud University Nijmegen, Netherlands<br>\nNada Amin,                 Harvard University, USA<br>\nAmbrose Bonnaire-Sergeant, Untypable LLC, USA<br>\nLaura M.
