It aspires to<br>\nbe a lively environment for presenting the latest research results, and <br>\nother<br>\ncontributions.</p>\n<p>This year, TFP will take place in-person at Seton Hall University, in South<br>\nOrange, NJ in the United States. It is co-located with the Trends in <br>\nFunctional<br>\nProgramming in Education (TFPIE) workshop, which will take on the day <br>\nbefore<br>\nthe main symposium.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that TFP has several submission deadlines. The first, <br>\nNovember 4,<br>\nis for authors that wish to have their full paper reviewed prior to the <br>\nsymposium.<br>\nPapers that are accepted in this way must also be presented at the <br>\nsymposium. The<br>\nsecond, November 30, is for authors that wish to present their work or <br>\nwork-in<br>\nprogress at the symposium first without submitting to the full review <br>\nprocess for<br>\npublication. These authors can then take into account feedback received <br>\nat the<br>\nsymposium and submit a full article for review by the third deadline, <br>\nFebruary 23.</p>\n<h2>Scope</h2>\n<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various <br>\nroutes. As part<br>\nof the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the following <br>\nfive article<br>\ncategories. High-quality articles are solicited in any of these categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Research Articles:<br>\n   Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Position Articles:<br>\n   On what new trends should or should not be</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Project Articles:<br>\n   Descriptions of recently started new projects</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Evaluation Articles:<br>\n   What lessons can be drawn from a finished project</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Overview Articles:<br>\n   Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for <br>\npublication to any<br>\nother forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming: <br>\ntheoretical,<br>\nimplementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. Applications of functional<br>\nprogramming techniques to other languages are also within the scope of <br>\nthe symposium.</p>\n<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing</li>\n<li>Functional programming in the cloud</li>\n<li>High performance functional computing</li>\n<li>Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs</li>\n<li>Dependently typed functional programming</li>\n<li>Validation and verification of functional programs</li>\n<li>Debugging and profiling for functional languages</li>\n<li>\n<p>Functional programming in different application areas:<br>\n   security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded<br>\n   systems, global computing, grids, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interoperability with imperative programming languages</p>\n</li>\n<li>Novel memory management techniques</li>\n<li>Program analysis and transformation techniques</li>\n<li>Empirical performance studies</li>\n<li>Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages</li>\n<li>(Embedded) domain specific languages</li>\n<li>New implementation strategies</li>\n<li>Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of TFP, <br>\nplease contact<br>\nthe TFP 2024 program chair, Jason Hemann.</p>\n<h2>Best Paper Awards</h2>\n<p>TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.</p>\n<p>First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the <br>\nbest overall paper<br>\naccepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.</p>\n<p>Second, each year TFP also awards a prize for the best student paper. <br>\nTFP traditionally<br>\npays special attention to research students, acknowledging that students <br>\nare almost by<br>\ndefinition part of new subject trends. A student paper is one for which <br>\nthe authors<br>\nstate that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are <br>\nthe paper’s first<br>\nauthors, and a student would present the paper.</p>\n<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the <br>\nbest paper happens<br>\nto be a student paper, then that paper will receive both prizes.</p>\n<h2>Instructions to Authors</h2>\n<p>Authors must submit papers to:</p>\n<p>&lt;<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp24\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp24</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally <br>\nreviewed either<br>\nbefore or after the Symposium. Further, pre-symposium submissions may <br>\neither be full<br>\n(earlier deadline) or draft papers (later deadline).</p>\n<h2>Pre-symposium formal review</h2>\n<p>Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted <br>\nbefore the early<br>\ndeadline and will receive their reviews and notification of acceptance <br>\nfor both presentation<br>\nand publication before the symposium. A paper that has been rejected for <br>\npublication but<br>\naccepted for presentation may be resubmitted for the post-symposium <br>\nformal review.</p>\n<h2>Post-symposium formal review</h2>\n<p>Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance <br>\nfor presentation at<br>\nthe symposium. Authors of draft papers will be invited to submit revised <br>\npapers based on the<br>\nfeedback receive at the symposium. A post-symposium refereeing process <br>\nwill then select a<br>\nsubset of these articles for formal publication.</p>\n<h2>Paper categories</h2>\n<p>Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as <br>\nextended abstracts (4 to<br>\n10 pages in length) or full papers (20 pages). The submission must <br>\nclearly indicate which<br>\ncategory it belongs to: research, position, project, evaluation, or <br>\noverview paper. It should<br>\nalso indicate which authors are research students, and whether the main <br>\nauthor(s) are students.<br>\nA draft paper for which all authors are students will receive additional <br>\nfeedback by one of the<br>\nPC members shortly after the symposium has taken place.</p>\n<h2>Format</h2>\n<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style.
