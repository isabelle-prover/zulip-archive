It aspires <br>\nto be<br>\na lively environment for presenting the latest research results, and <br>\nother<br>\ncontributions.</p>\n<p>This year, TFP will take place in-person at the University of Oxford, <br>\nUK. It<br>\nis co-located with the Trends in Functional Programming in Education <br>\n(TFPIE)<br>\nworkshop, which will take on the day before the main symposium.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that TFP has several submission deadlines. The first, <br>\n13th<br>\nNovember, is for authors who wish to have their full paper reviewed <br>\nprior to<br>\nthe symposium. Papers that are accepted in this way must also be <br>\npresented at<br>\nthe symposium. The second, 11th December, is for authors who wish to <br>\npresent<br>\ntheir work or work-in-progress at the symposium first without submitting <br>\nto<br>\nthe full review process for publication. These authors can then take <br>\ninto<br>\naccount feedback received at the symposium and submit a full paper for <br>\nreview<br>\nby the third deadline, 19th February.</p>\n<h2>Scope</h2>\n<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various <br>\nroutes. As<br>\npart of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the <br>\nfollowing five<br>\npaper categories. High-quality submissions are solicited in any of these<br>\ncategories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research Papers: Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work</li>\n<li>Position Papers: On what new trends should or should not be</li>\n<li>Project Papers: Descriptions of recently started new projects</li>\n<li>Evaluation Papers: What lessons can be drawn from a finished project</li>\n<li>Overview Papers: Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted for publication <br>\nto any<br>\nother forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming: <br>\ntheoretical,<br>\nimplementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. Applications of <br>\nfunctional<br>\nprogramming techniques to other languages are also within the scope of <br>\nthe<br>\nsymposium.</p>\n<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing</li>\n<li>Functional programming in the cloud</li>\n<li>High performance functional computing</li>\n<li>Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs</li>\n<li>Dependently typed functional programming</li>\n<li>Validation and verification of functional programs</li>\n<li>Debugging and profiling for functional languages</li>\n<li>\n<p>Functional programming in different application areas:<br>\n     security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded <br>\nsystems,<br>\n     global computing, grids, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interoperability with imperative programming languages</p>\n</li>\n<li>Novel memory management techniques</li>\n<li>Program analysis and transformation techniques</li>\n<li>Empirical performance studies</li>\n<li>Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages</li>\n<li>(Embedded) domain specific languages</li>\n<li>New implementation strategies</li>\n<li>Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are in doubt on whether your paper is within the scope of TFP, <br>\nplease<br>\ncontact the programme chair, Jeremy Gibbons.</p>\n<h2>Best Paper Awards</h2>\n<p>TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.</p>\n<p>First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the <br>\nbest overall<br>\npaper accepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.</p>\n<p>Second, each year TFP also awards a prize for the best student paper. <br>\nTFP<br>\ntraditionally pays special attention to research students, acknowledging <br>\nthat<br>\nstudents are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student <br>\npaper is<br>\none for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of <br>\nstudents,<br>\nthe students are the paper's first authors, and a student would present <br>\nthe paper.</p>\n<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the <br>\nbest paper<br>\nhappens to be a student paper, then that paper will receive both prizes.</p>\n<h2>Instructions to Authors</h2>\n<p>Submission is via EquinOCS <br>\n(<a href=\"https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/tfp2025\">https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/tfp2025</a>).</p>\n<p>Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally <br>\nreviewed<br>\neither before or after the Symposium. Further, pre-symposium submissions <br>\nmay either<br>\nbe full (earlier deadline) or draft papers (later deadline).</p>\n<h2>Pre-symposium formal review</h2>\n<p>Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted <br>\nbefore the<br>\nearly deadline and will receive their reviews and notification of <br>\nacceptance for<br>\nboth presentation and publication before the symposium. A paper that has <br>\nbeen<br>\nrejected for publication but accepted for presentation may be revised <br>\nand resubmitted<br>\nfor the post-symposium formal review.</p>\n<h2>Post-symposium formal review</h2>\n<p>Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance <br>\nfor<br>\npresentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers will be invited <br>\nto submit<br>\nrevised papers based on the feedback received at the symposium. A <br>\npost-symposium<br>\nrefereeing process will then select a subset of these papers for formal <br>\npublication.</p>\n<h2>Paper categories</h2>\n<p>Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as <br>\nextended<br>\nabstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (up to 20 pages). The <br>\nsubmission<br>\nmust clearly indicate which category it belongs to: research, position, <br>\nproject,<br>\nevaluation, or overview paper. It should also indicate which authors are <br>\nresearch<br>\nstudents, and whether the main author(s) are students. A draft paper for <br>\nwhich all<br>\nauthors are students will receive additional feedback by one of the PC <br>\nmembers<br>\nshortly after the symposium has taken place.</p>\n<h2>Format</h2>\n<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style.
