It aspires <br>\nto be a<br>\nlively environment for presenting the latest research results, and other<br>\ncontributions.</p>\n<p>This year, TFP will take place in-person at the University of Southern <br>\nDenmark,<br>\nin Odense, Denmark. It is co-located with the Trends in Functional <br>\nProgramming<br>\nin Education (TFPIE) workshop, which will take on the day before the <br>\nmain<br>\nsymposium.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that TFP has several submission deadlines. The first, <br>\n13th<br>\nNovember, is for authors who wish to have their full paper reviewed <br>\nprior to the<br>\nsymposium. Papers that are accepted in this way must also be presented <br>\nat the<br>\nsymposium. The second, 11th December, is for authors who wish to present <br>\ntheir<br>\nwork or work-in-progress at the symposium first without submitting to <br>\nthe full<br>\nreview process for publication. These authors can then take into account<br>\nfeedback received at the symposium and submit a full paper for review by <br>\nthe<br>\nthird deadline, 5th March.</p>\n<h2>Scope</h2>\n<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various <br>\nroutes. As<br>\npart of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the <br>\nfollowing five<br>\npaper categories. High-quality submissions are solicited in any of these<br>\ncategories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research Papers: Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work</li>\n<li>Position Papers: On what new trends should or should not be</li>\n<li>Project Papers: Descriptions of recently started new projects</li>\n<li>Evaluation Papers: What lessons can be drawn from a finished project</li>\n<li>Overview Papers: Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted for publication <br>\nto any<br>\nother forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming:<br>\ntheoretical, implementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. <br>\nApplications of<br>\nfunctional programming techniques to other languages are also within the <br>\nscope<br>\nof the symposium.</p>\n<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing</li>\n<li>Functional programming in the cloud</li>\n<li>High performance functional computing</li>\n<li>Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs</li>\n<li>Dependently typed functional programming</li>\n<li>Validation and verification of functional programs</li>\n<li>Debugging and profiling for functional languages</li>\n<li>\n<p>Functional programming in different application areas:<br>\n     security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded <br>\nsystems,<br>\n     global computing, grids, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interoperability with imperative programming languages</p>\n</li>\n<li>Novel memory management techniques</li>\n<li>Program analysis and transformation techniques</li>\n<li>Empirical performance studies</li>\n<li>Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages</li>\n<li>(Embedded) domain specific languages</li>\n<li>New implementation strategies</li>\n<li>Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are in doubt on whether your paper is within the scope of TFP, <br>\nplease<br>\ncontact the programme chair, Casper Bach.</p>\n<h2>Best Paper Awards</h2>\n<p>TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.</p>\n<p>First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the <br>\nbest<br>\noverall paper accepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.</p>\n<p>Second, each year TFP also awards a prize for the best student paper. <br>\nTFP<br>\ntraditionally pays special attention to research students, acknowledging <br>\nthat<br>\nstudents are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student <br>\npaper is<br>\none for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of <br>\nstudents,<br>\nthe students are the paper's first authors, and a student would present <br>\nthe<br>\npaper.</p>\n<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the <br>\nbest paper<br>\nhappens to be a student paper, then that paper will receive both prizes.</p>\n<h2>Student and Early Career Scholarships</h2>\n<p>Our sponsors have generously offered to fund seven scholarships of DKK <br>\n3000<br>\n(approximately USD 460) to cover expenses in connection with traveling <br>\nto and<br>\nstaying in Denmark in connection with the conference.</p>\n<p>Information on how to apply for these scholarships will be available <br>\nsoon on<br>\n<a href=\"https://trendsfp.github.io/\">https://trendsfp.github.io/</a></p>\n<h2>Instructions to Authors</h2>\n<p>Submission is via HotCRP:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tfp26.hotcrp.com/\">https://tfp26.hotcrp.com/</a></p>\n<p>Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally<br>\nreviewed either before or after the Symposium. Further, pre-symposium<br>\nsubmissions may either be full (earlier deadline) or draft papers (later<br>\ndeadline).</p>\n<h2>Pre-symposium formal review</h2>\n<p>Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted <br>\nbefore<br>\nthe early deadline and will receive their reviews and notification of <br>\nacceptance<br>\nfor both presentation and publication before the symposium. A paper that <br>\nhas<br>\nbeen rejected for publication but accepted for presentation may be <br>\nrevised and<br>\nresubmitted for the post-symposium formal review.</p>\n<h2>Post-symposium formal review</h2>\n<p>Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance <br>\nfor<br>\npresentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers will be invited <br>\nto submit<br>\nrevised papers based on the feedback received at the symposium. A <br>\npost-symposium<br>\nrefereeing process will then select a subset of these papers for formal<br>\npublication.</p>\n<h2>Paper categories</h2>\n<p>Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as <br>\nextended<br>\nabstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (up to 20 pages). The<br>\nsubmission must clearly indicate which category it belongs to: research,<br>\nposition, project, evaluation, or overview paper. It should also <br>\nindicate which<br>\nauthors are research students, and whether the main author(s) are <br>\nstudents. A<br>\ndraft paper for which all authors are students will receive additional <br>\nfeedback<br>\nby one of the PC members shortly after the symposium has taken place.</p>\n<h2>Format</h2>\n<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style.
