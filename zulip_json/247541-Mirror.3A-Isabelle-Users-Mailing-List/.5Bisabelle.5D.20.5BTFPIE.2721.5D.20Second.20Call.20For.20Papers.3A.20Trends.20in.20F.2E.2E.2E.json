The<br>\none-day workshop will foster a spirit of open discussion by having a review<br>\nprocess for publication after the workshop.</p>\n<p>TFPIE 2021 welcomes submissions in the above mentioned areas. This year <br>\nmany<br>\nteaching programmes have had to make a rapid transition to online <br>\nteaching, and<br>\nwe explicitly solicit papers that explore this area of teaching functional<br>\nprogramming.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br>\n-  FP and beginning CS students<br>\n-  FP and Computational Thinking<br>\n-  FP and Artificial Intelligence<br>\n-  FP in Robotics<br>\n-  FP and Music<br>\n-  Advanced FP for undergraduates<br>\n-  FP in graduate education<br>\n-  Engaging students in research using FP<br>\n-  FP in Programming Languages<br>\n-  FP in the high school curriculum<br>\n-  FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics<br>\n-  FP and Philosophy<br>\n-  The pedagogy of teaching FP<br>\n-  FP and e-learning: MOOCs, automated assessment etc.<br>\n-  Best Lectures - more details below</p>\n<p>In addition to papers, we are requesting best lecture presentations. <br>\nWhat's your<br>\nbest lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a fun way to <br>\npresent FP<br>\nconcepts to novices or perhaps an especially interesting presentation of a<br>\ndifficult topic? In either case, please consider sharing it. Best <br>\nlecture topics<br>\nwill be selected for presentation based on a short abstract describing the<br>\nlecture and its interest to TFPIE attendees. The length of the presentation<br>\nshould be comparable to that of a paper.</p>",
