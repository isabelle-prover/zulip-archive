FMICS brings together scientists and engineers<br>\nwho are active in the area of formal methods and interested in exchanging their<br>\nexperiences in the industrial usage of these methods.<br>\nThe FMICS conference series also strives to promote research and development<br>\nfor the improvement of formal methods and tools for industrial applications.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>\n<p>Paper submission: 15 May 2023<br>\nAuthors’ response period: 28-30 June 2023<br>\nNotification: 14 July 2023<br>\nCamera-ready version: July 31, 2023<br>\nConference: 20-22 September 2023</p>\n<p>TOPICS:</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies and experience reports on industrial applications of formal<br>\nmethods, focusing on lessons learned or identification of new research<br>\ndirections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Methods, techniques, and tools to support automated analysis, certification,<br>\ndebugging, learning, optimization, and transformation of complex, distributed,<br>\nreal-time, embedded, mobile and autonomous systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Verification and validation methods (model checking, theorem proving, SAT/SMT<br>\nconstraint solving, abstract interpretation, etc.) that address shortcomings of<br>\nexisting methods with respect to their industrial applicability (e.g.,<br>\nscalability and usability issues, tool qualification, and certification).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Impact of the adoption of formal methods on the development process and<br>\nassociated costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application of formal methods in standardization and industrial forum.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSION:</p>\n<p>Papers must describe original research work and results. Submitted papers must<br>\nnot have previously appeared in a journal or conference with published<br>\nproceedings and must not be concurrently submitted to any other peer-reviewed<br>\nworkshop, symposium, conference, or archival journal. Any partial overlap with<br>\nany such published or concurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated.</p>\n<p>Submissions should clearly motivate relevance to industrial applications. Case<br>\nstudy papers should identify lessons learned, validate theoretical results<br>\n(such as scalability of methods) or provide specific motivation for further<br>\nresearch and development.</p>\n<p>Papers should not exceed 15 pages formatted according to the LNCS style<br>\n(Springer). All submissions will be reviewed by the Programme Committee, which<br>\nwill make a selection among the submissions based on the novelty, soundness,<br>\nand applicability of the presented ideas and results.<br>\nPapers must be written in English and should be submitted as PDF files using<br>\nthe EasyChair submission site: <a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Feasychair.org%2Fconferences%2F%3Fconf%3Dfmics2023&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cfm-announcements%40lists.nasa.gov%7C53ca130b0ada45931e8008db31fa863b%7C7005d45845be48ae8140d43da96dd17b%7C0%7C0%7C638158724292489439%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=Zt5MJ7ecKjoAecpY2OMTGWVXGie3AYlz%2F5T8JQi44es%3D&amp;reserved=0\">https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Feasychair.org%2Fconferences%2F%3Fconf%3Dfmics2023&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cfm-announcements%40lists.nasa.gov%7C53ca130b0ada45931e8008db31fa863b%7C7005d45845be48ae8140d43da96dd17b%7C0%7C0%7C638158724292489439%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=Zt5MJ7ecKjoAecpY2OMTGWVXGie3AYlz%2F5T8JQi44es%3D&amp;reserved=0</a>.</p>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS:</p>\n<p>The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series.
