It’s a very expensive machine, but its equally expensive predecessors had serious problems with the keyboard and overheating. I’m happy to report that this model appears to be pretty good as an Isabelle machine. In particular it does not seem to suffer thermal problems; one can do a lot without the fan even kicking in.</p>\n<p>I attach some benchmarks run using Isabelle 2020. I see that it's inferior to the 27 inch iMac (see my post dated 29 July 2019) but still impressive.</p>\n<p>Larry</p>\n<p>Isabelle2020.app/Isabelle: ./bin/isabelle build -g timing<br>\nRunning HOL-Cardinals ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Cardinals (0:00:04 elapsed time, 0:00:26 cpu time, factor 6.27)<br>\nRunning HOL-Data_Structures ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Data_Structures (0:01:53 elapsed time, 0:15:01 cpu time, factor 7.94)<br>\nRunning HOL-Hoare_Parallel ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Hoare_Parallel (0:00:36 elapsed time, 0:04:14 cpu time, factor 6.92)<br>\nRunning HOL-Homology ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Homology (0:06:36 elapsed time, 0:07:46 cpu time, factor 1.18)<br>\nBuilding HOL-Auth ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Auth (0:00:49 elapsed time, 0:04:09 cpu time, factor 5.02)<br>\nRunning HOL-Bali ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Bali (0:00:37 elapsed time, 0:02:24 cpu time, factor 3.90)<br>\nBuilding HOL-Algebra ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Algebra (0:01:51 elapsed time, 0:07:54 cpu time, factor 4.25)<br>\nRunning HOL-Corec_Examples ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Corec_Examples (0:01:47 elapsed time, 0:05:50 cpu time, factor 3.26)<br>\nRunning HOL-Datatype_Examples ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Datatype_Examples (0:00:54 elapsed time, 0:04:09 cpu time, factor 4.57)<br>\nRunning HOL-Decision_Procs ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Decision_Procs (0:07:34 elapsed time, 0:13:41 cpu time, factor 1.81)<br>\nRunning HOL-IMP ...<br>\nFinished HOL-IMP (0:00:35 elapsed time, 0:03:40 cpu time, factor 6.18)<br>\nRunning HOL-Imperative_HOL ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Imperative_HOL (0:00:39 elapsed time, 0:06:28 cpu time, factor 9.89)<br>\nRunning HOL-Metis_Examples ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Metis_Examples (0:00:10 elapsed time, 0:01:08 cpu time, factor 6.36)<br>\nRunning HOL-MicroJava ...<br>\nFinished HOL-MicroJava (0:00:39 elapsed time, 0:03:09 cpu time, factor 4.82)<br>\nBuilding HOL-Nominal ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Nominal (0:00:13 elapsed time, 0:00:26 cpu time, factor 1.98)<br>\nRunning HOL-Nominal-Examples ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Nominal-Examples (0:02:43 elapsed time, 0:14:01 cpu time, factor 5.14)<br>\nBuilding HOL-Nonstandard_Analysis ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Nonstandard_Analysis (0:00:14 elapsed time, 0:00:40 cpu time, factor 2.73)<br>\nRunning HOL-Nonstandard_Analysis-Examples ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Nonstandard_Analysis-Examples (0:00:02 elapsed time, 0:00:03 cpu time)<br>\nBuilding HOL-Number_Theory ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Number_Theory (0:00:48 elapsed time, 0:03:26 cpu time, factor 4.24)<br>\nRunning HOL-Predicate_Compile_Examples ...<br>\nSkipping theories \"Code_Prolog_Examples\", \"Context_Free_Grammar_Example\", \"Hotel_Example_Prolog\", \"Lambda_Example\", \"List_Examples\" (undefined ISABELLE_SWIPL)<br>\nSkipping theories \"Reg_Exp_Example\" (undefined ISABELLE_SWIPL)<br>\nFinished HOL-Predicate_Compile_Examples (0:00:37 elapsed time, 0:05:22 cpu time, factor 8.49)<br>\nBuilding HOL-Probability ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Probability (0:00:57 elapsed time, 0:05:12 cpu time, factor 5.40)<br>\nRunning HOL-Probability-ex ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Probability-ex (0:00:06 elapsed time, 0:00:19 cpu time, factor 3.29)<br>\nBuilding HOL-Proofs ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Proofs (0:04:43 elapsed time, 0:09:53 cpu time, factor 2.09)<br>\nRunning HOL-Proofs-Extraction ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Proofs-Extraction (0:01:16 elapsed time, 0:02:11 cpu time, factor 1.71)<br>\nRunning HOL-Proofs-Lambda ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Proofs-Lambda (0:01:15 elapsed time, 0:01:27 cpu time, factor 1.16)<br>\nRunning HOL-Quickcheck_Examples ...<br>\nSkipping theories \"Hotel_Example\", \"Quickcheck_Narrowing_Examples\" (undefined ISABELLE_GHC)<br>\nFinished HOL-Quickcheck_Examples (0:00:15 elapsed time, 0:01:47 cpu time, factor 6.80)<br>\nRunning HOL-Quotient_Examples ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Quotient_Examples (0:00:21 elapsed time, 0:01:29 cpu time, factor 4.17)<br>\nRunning HOL-SET_Protocol ...<br>\nFinished HOL-SET_Protocol (0:00:14 elapsed time, 0:01:15 cpu time, factor 5.32)<br>\nRunning HOL-UNITY ...<br>\nFinished HOL-UNITY (0:00:13 elapsed time, 0:01:19 cpu time, factor 5.92)<br>\nBuilding HOL-Word ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Word (0:00:14 elapsed time, 0:00:49 cpu time, factor 3.47)<br>\nRunning HOL-Word-SMT_Examples ...<br>\nFinished HOL-Word-SMT_Examples (0:00:41 elapsed time, 0:01:11 cpu time, factor 1.71)<br>\nRunning HOL-ex ...<br>\nFinished HOL-ex (0:02:52 elapsed time, 0:15:07 cpu time, factor 5.26)<br>\nBuilding HOLCF ...<br>\nFinished HOLCF (0:00:15 elapsed time, 0:00:38 cpu time, factor 2.58)<br>\nRunning IOA ...<br>\nFinished IOA (0:00:05 elapsed time, 0:00:18 cpu time, factor 3.71)<br>\nBuilding ZF-Induct ...<br>\nFinished ZF-Induct (0:00:02 elapsed time, 0:00:08 cpu time)<br>\nRunning ZF-UNITY ...<br>\nFinished ZF-UNITY (0:00:02 elapsed time, 0:00:17 cpu time)<br>\n0:43:31 elapsed time, 2:27:35 cpu time, factor 3.39</p>",
