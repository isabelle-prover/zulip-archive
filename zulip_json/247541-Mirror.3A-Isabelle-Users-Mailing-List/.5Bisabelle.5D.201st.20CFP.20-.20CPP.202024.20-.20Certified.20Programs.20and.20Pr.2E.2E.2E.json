CPP<br>\nspans areas of computer science, mathematics, logic, and education.</p>\n<p>CPP 2024 (<a href=\"https://popl24.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2024\">https://popl24.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2024</a>) will be held on 15-16<br>\nJanuary 2024 and will be co-located with POPL 2024 in London, UK. CPP 2024 is<br>\nsponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGLOG.</p>\n<p>CPP 2024 will welcome contributions from all members of the community. The CPP<br>\n2024 organizers will strive to enable both in-person and remote participation,<br>\nin cooperation with the POPL 2024 organizers.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract Submission Deadline: 12 September 2023 at 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h)</li>\n<li>Paper Submission Deadline: 19 September 2023 at 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h)</li>\n<li>Notification (tentative): 21 November 2023</li>\n<li>Camera Ready Deadline (tentative): Mid December 2023 (TBA)</li>\n<li>Conference: 15-16 January 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deadlines expire at the end of the day, anywhere on earth. Abstract and<br>\nsubmission deadlines are strict and there will be no extensions.</p>\n<p>DISTINGUISHED PAPER AWARDS</p>\n<p>Around 10% of the accepted papers at CPP 2024 will be designated as<br>\nDistinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the CPP program<br>\ncommittee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance,<br>\noriginality, significance and clarity.</p>\n<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST</p>\n<p>We welcome submissions in research areas related to formal certification of<br>\nprograms and proofs. The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics of<br>\ninterest to CPP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>certified or certifying programming, compilation, linking, OS kernels,<br>\nruntime systems, security monitors, and hardware;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>certified mathematical libraries and mathematical theorems;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>proof assistants (e.g, ACL2, Agda, Coq, Dafny, F*, HOL4, HOL Light, Idris,<br>\nIsabelle, Lean, Mizar, Nuprl, PVS, etc);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>new languages and tools for certified programming;</p>\n</li>\n<li>program analysis, program verification, and program synthesis;</li>\n<li>program logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code;</li>\n<li>logics for certifying concurrent and distributed systems;</li>\n<li>\n<p>mechanized metatheory, formalized programming language semantics, and<br>\nlogical frameworks;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>higher-order logics, dependent type theory, proof theory, logical systems,<br>\nseparation logics, and logics for security;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>verification of correctness and security properties;</p>\n</li>\n<li>formally verified blockchains and smart contracts;</li>\n<li>\n<p>certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra, polynomial<br>\nsystems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of interest;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality, first-order<br>\nlogic, and higher-order unification;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>certificates for program termination;</p>\n</li>\n<li>formal models of computation;</li>\n<li>mechanized (un)decidability and computational complexity proofs;</li>\n<li>formally certified methods for induction and coinduction;</li>\n<li>integration of interactive and automated provers;</li>\n<li>logical foundations of proof assistants;</li>\n<li>applications of AI and machine learning to formal certification;</li>\n<li>user interfaces for proof assistants and theorem provers;</li>\n<li>teaching mathematics and computer science with proof assistants.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>\n<p>Prior to the paper submission deadline, the authors should upload their<br>\nanonymized paper in PDF format through the HotCRP system at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cpp2024.hotcrp.com\">https://cpp2024.hotcrp.com</a></p>\n<p>The submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to<br>\nallow the program committee to assess the merits of the contribution. They<br>\nmust be formatted following the ACM SIGPLAN Proceedings format using the<br>\nacmart style with the sigplan option, which provides a two-column style, using<br>\n10 point font for the main text, and a header for double blind review<br>\nsubmission, i.e.,</p>\n<p>\\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,anonymous,review]{acmart}<br>\n\\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}</p>\n<p>The submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages, including tables and figures,<br>\nbut excluding bibliography and clearly marked appendices. The papers should be<br>\nself-contained without the appendices. Shorter papers are welcome and will be<br>\ngiven equal consideration. Submissions not conforming to the requirements<br>\nconcerning format and maximum length may be rejected without further<br>\nconsideration.</p>\n<p>CPP 2024 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process following<br>\nthe process from previous years. To facilitate this, the submissions must<br>\nadhere to two rules:<br>\n(1) author names and institutions must be omitted, and<br>\n(2) references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person<br>\n(e.g., not \"We build on our previous work ...\" but rather \"We build on the<br>\nwork of ...\").</p>\n<p>The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to<br>\nan initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible<br>\nfor them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done<br>\nin the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of<br>\nreviewing it more difficult. In particular, important background references<br>\nshould not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors are free to<br>\ndisseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as usual. For<br>\nexample, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on<br>\ntheir research ideas. Note that POPL 2024 itself will employ full double-blind<br>\nreviewing, which differs from the light-weight CPP process.  This FAQ from<br>\nprevious SIGPLAN conference addresses many common concerns:<br>\n<a href=\"https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ\">https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ</a></p>\n<p>We strongly encourage the authors to provide any supplementary material that<br>\nsupports the claims made in the paper, such as proof scripts or experimental<br>\ndata. This material must be uploaded at submission time, as an archive, not<br>\nvia a URL. Two forms of supplementary material may be submitted:<br>\n(1) Anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers before<br>\nthey submit their first-draft reviews.<br>\n(2) Non-anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers<br>\nafter they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have learned the<br>\nidentity of the authors.</p>\n<p>Please use anonymous supplementary material whenever possible, so that it can<br>\nbe taken into account from the beginning of the reviewing process.</p>\n<p>The submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy<br>\n(<a href=\"https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/\">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/</a>) and the ACM Policy<br>\non Plagiarism (<a href=\"https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism\">https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism</a>).<br>\nConcurrent submissions to other conferences, journals, workshops with<br>\nproceedings, or similar forums of publication are not allowed. The PC chairs<br>\nshould be informed of closely related work submitted to a conference or<br>\njournal in advance of submission. One author of each accepted paper is<br>\nexpected to present it at the (possibly virtual) conference.</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION, COPYRIGHT AND OPEN ACCESS</p>\n<p>The CPP 2024 proceedings will be published by the ACM, and authors of accepted<br>\npapers will be required to choose one of the following publication options:<br>\n(1) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive<br>\npermission-to-publish license and, optionally, licenses the work under a<br>\nCreative Commons license.<br>\n(2) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive<br>\npermission-to-publish license.<br>\n(3) Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.</p>\n<p>For authors who can afford it, we recommend option (1), which will make the<br>\npaper Gold Open Access, and also encourage such authors to license their work<br>\nunder the CC-BY license. ACM will charge you an article processing fee for<br>\nthis option (currently, US$700), which you have to pay directly with the ACM.<br>\nYou don’t need to pay this fee if the corresponding author’s affiliating<br>\ninstitution is part of ACM OPEN<br>\n(<a href=\"https://libraries.acm.org/subscriptions-access/open-participants\">https://libraries.acm.org/subscriptions-access/open-participants</a>).</p>\n<p>For everyone else, we recommend option (2), which is free and allows you to<br>\nachieve Green Open Access, by uploading a preprint of your paper to a<br>\nrepository that guarantees permanent archival such as arXiv or HAL. This is<br>\nanyway a good idea for timely dissemination even if you chose option 1.</p>\n<p>The official CPP 2024 proceedings will also be available via SIGPLAN OpenTOC<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp\">http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp</a>).</p>\n<p>For ACM’s take on this, see their Copyright Policy<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy\">http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy</a>) and Author Rights<br>\n(<a href=\"http://authors.acm.org/main.html\">http://authors.acm.org/main.html</a>).</p>\n<p>Sandrine Blazy, University of Rennes, France (co-chair)<br>\nBrigitte Pientka, McGill University, Canada (co-chair)</p>\n<p>ORGANIZERS</p>\n<p>Amin Timany, Aarhus University, Denmark (conference co-chair)<br>\nDmitriy Traytel, University of Copenhagen, Denmark (conference co-chair)<br>\nSandrine Blazy, University of Rennes (PC co-chair)<br>\nBrigitte Pientka, McGill University, Canada (PC co-chair)</p>\n<p>CONTACT</p>\n<p>For any questions please contact the two PC chairs:<br>\nSandrine Blazy  &lt;<a href=\"mailto:sandrine.blazy@irisa.fr\">sandrine.blazy@irisa.fr</a>&gt;<br>\nBrigitte Pientka &lt;<a href=\"mailto:bpientka@cs.mcgill.ca\">bpientka@cs.mcgill.ca</a>&gt;</p>",
