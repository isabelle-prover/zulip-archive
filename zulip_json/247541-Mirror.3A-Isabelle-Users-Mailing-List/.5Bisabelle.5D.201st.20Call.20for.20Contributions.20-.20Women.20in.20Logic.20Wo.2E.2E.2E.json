Its main purpose is to promote the excellent research<br>\ndone by women, with the ultimate goal of increasing their visibility and<br>\nrepresentation in the community. Our aim is to:</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>provide a platform for female researchers to share their work and<br>\n   achievements;<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>increase the feelings of community and belonging, especially among<br>\n   junior faculty, post-docs and students through positive interactions with<br>\n   peers and more established faculty;<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>establish new connections and collaborations;<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>foster a welcoming culture of mutual support and growth within the logic<br>\n   research community.</p>\n<p>We believe these aspects will benefit women working in logic and computer<br>\nscience, particularly early-career researchers.</p>\n<p>Previous versions of Women in Logic (Reykjavík 2017, Oxford 2018, Vancouver<br>\n2019, Paris 2020, Rome 2021, and Haifa 2022) were very successful in<br>\nshowcasing women's work and as catalysts for a recognition of the need for<br>\nchange in the community.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to: automata theory,<br>\nautomated deduction, categorical models and logics, concurrency and<br>\ndistributed computation, constraint programming, constructive mathematics,<br>\ndatabase theory, decision procedures, description logics, domain theory,<br>\nfinite model theory, formal aspects of program analysis, formal methods,<br>\nfoundations of computability, games and logic, higher-order logic, lambda<br>\nand combinatory calculi, linear logic, logic in artificial intelligence,<br>\nlogic programming, logical aspects of bioinformatics, logical aspects of<br>\ncomputational complexity, logical aspects of quantum computation, logical<br>\nframeworks, logics of programs, modal and temporal logics, model checking,<br>\nprobabilistic systems, process calculi, programming language semantics,<br>\nproof theory, real-time systems, reasoning about security and privacy,<br>\nrewriting, type systems and type theory, and verification.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Marie Kerjean (LIPN, Institut Galilée)<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>TBA</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Abstract submission deadline: April 23, 2023<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Notification: May 15, 2023<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Contribution for Informal Proceedings: June 25, 2023<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Workshop: July 1, 2023</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>Abstracts should be written in English (1-2 pages), and prepared using the<br>\nEasychair style (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors\">https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors</a>).</p>\n<p>The abstracts should be uploaded to the WiL 2023 Easychair page</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=wil2023\">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=wil2023</a></p>\n<p>as a PDF file before the submission deadline on April 23, 2023, anywhere on<br>\nEarth.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZING AND PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Sandra Alves (University of Porto)<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Agata Ciabattoni (Vienna University of Technology)<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Zoé Christoff  (University of Groningen)<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Amy Felty (University of Ottawa)<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Marie Fortin (IRIF)<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Sujata Ghosh (ISI Chennai)<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Sandra Kiefer (University of Oxford) – co-chair<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Cláudia Nalon (University of Brasília)<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Daniele Nantes-Sobrinho (Imperial College London) – co-chair<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Valeria de Paiva (Topos Institute)<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Catuscia Palamidessi (INRIA)<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Tephilla Prince (IIT Dharwad) – co-chair<br>\n   -</p>\n<p>Krishna S.
