IFL 2022 will be a venue for<br>\nresearchers to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in<br>\nprogress, and publication-ripe results related to the implementation<br>\nand application of functional languages and function-based<br>\nprogramming.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest to IFL include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>language concepts</li>\n<li>type systems, type checking, type inferencing</li>\n<li>compilation techniques</li>\n<li>staged compilation</li>\n<li>run-time function specialization</li>\n<li>run-time code generation</li>\n<li>partial evaluation</li>\n<li>abstract interpretation</li>\n<li>metaprogramming</li>\n<li>generic programming</li>\n<li>automatic program generation</li>\n<li>array processing</li>\n<li>concurrent/parallel programming</li>\n<li>concurrent/parallel program execution</li>\n<li>embedded systems</li>\n<li>web applications</li>\n<li>embedded domain specific languages</li>\n<li>security</li>\n<li>novel memory management techniques</li>\n<li>run-time profiling performance measurements</li>\n<li>debugging and tracing</li>\n<li>virtual/abstract machine architectures</li>\n<li>validation, verification of functional programs</li>\n<li>tools and programming techniques</li>\n<li>industrial applications<br>\n*Submissions and peer-review\n*\nFollowing IFL tradition, IFL 2022 will use a post-symposium review<br>\nprocess to produce the formal proceedings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before the symposium authors submit draft papers. These draft papers<br>\nwill be screened by the program chair to make sure that they are<br>\nwithin the scope of IFL. The draft papers will be made available to<br>\nall participants at the symposium. Each draft paper is presented by<br>\none of the authors at the symposium. Notice that it is a requirement<br>\nthat accepted draft papers are presented physically at the symposium.</p>\n<p>After the symposium, a formal review process will take place,<br>\nconducted by the program committee.  Reviewing is single blind. There<br>\nwill be at least 3 reviews per paper. The reviewers have 6 weeks to<br>\nwrite their reviews. For the camera-ready version the authors can make<br>\nminor revisions which are accepted without further reviewing.</p>\n<p>Contributions submitted for the draft paper deadline must be between<br>\ntwo and twelve pages long. For submission details, please consult the<br>\nIFL 2022 website at <a href=\"https://ifl22.github.io/\">https://ifl22.github.io/</a>.<br>\n*Where\n*\nIFL 2022 will be held physically in Copenhagen, Denmark, arranged by<br>\nDIKU at the University of Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>See the IFL 2022 website at <a href=\"https://ifl22.github.io/\">https://ifl22.github.io/</a> for more<br>\ninformation.</p>\n<p>[image: beacon]</p>",
