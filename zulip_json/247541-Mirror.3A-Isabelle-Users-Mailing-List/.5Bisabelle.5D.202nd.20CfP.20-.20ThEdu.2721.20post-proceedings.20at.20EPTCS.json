It was a very lively virtual meeting with an average<br>\n  of 18 attendees. ThEdu'21 programme comprised one invited talk, 11<br>\n  regular contributions and one demonstration, whose abstracts,<br>\n  presentations and videos are in the workshop web-page.</p>\n<p>Now post-proceedings are planned to collect the contributions<br>\n  upgraded to full papers. The contributions' topics are diverse<br>\n  according to ThEdu's scope, and this is a call open for everyone,<br>\n  also those who did not participate in the workshop. All papers will<br>\n  undergo review according to EPTCS standards.</p>\n<p>ThEdu'21 Scope:</p>\n<p>Computer Theorem Proving is becoming a paradigm as well as a<br>\n  technological base for a new generation of educational software in<br>\n  science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This volume of<br>\n  EPTCS intends to bring together experts in automated deduction with<br>\n  experts in education in order to further clarify the shape of the<br>\n  new software generation and to discuss existing systems.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission (Full Papers): 10 October 2021</li>\n<li>Notification of acceptance: 28 November 2021</li>\n<li>Revised papers due: 12 December 2021</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Topics of interest include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>methods of automated deduction applied to checking students' input;</li>\n<li>\n<p>methods of automated deduction applied to prove post-conditions<br>\n   for particular problem solutions;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>combinations of deduction and computation enabling systems to<br>\n   propose next steps;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>automated provers specific for dynamic geometry systems;</p>\n</li>\n<li>proof and proving in mathematics education.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<p>We welcome submission of full papers (12--20 pages) presenting<br>\n  original unpublished work which is not being submitted for<br>\n  publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>All contributions will be reviewed (at least three blind reviews) to<br>\n  meet the high standards of EPTCS.</p>\n<p>The authors should comply with the \"instructions for authors\", LaTeX<br>\n  style files and accept the \"Non-exclusive license to distribute\" of<br>\n  EPTCS: Instructions for authors (<a href=\"http://info.eptcs.org/\">http://info.eptcs.org/</a>) LaTeX style<br>\n  file and formatting instructions (<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org/\">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>) Copyright<br>\n  (<a href=\"http://copyright.eptcs.org/\">http://copyright.eptcs.org/</a>)</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted via EasyChair,  <br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu21\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu21</a>.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Francisco Botana, University of Vigo at Pontevedra, Spain<br>\n  David Cerna, Johannes Kepler University, Austria<br>\n  João Marcos, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil (co-chair)<br>\n  Filip Maric, University of Belgrade, Serbia<br>\n  Adolfo Neto, Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná, Brazil<br>\n  Walther Neuper, Graz University of Technology, Austria (co-chair)<br>\n  Pedro Quaresma, University of Coimbra, Portugal (co-chair)<br>\n  Philippe R.
