The<br>\nscope includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory,<br>\napplications, implementations, and teaching of declarative programming.<br>\nFLOPS specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization between theory<br>\nand practice and among different styles of declarative programming.</p>\n<p>Previous FLOPS meetings were held at Fuji Susono (1995), Shonan Village<br>\n(1996), Kyoto (1998), Tsukuba (1999), Tokyo (2001), Aizu (2002), Nara<br>\n(2004), Fuji Susono (2006), Ise (2008), Sendai (2010), Kobe (2012),<br>\nKanazawa (2014), Kochi (2016), Nagoya (2018), Akita (2020, online), <br>\nKyoto (2022, online), and Kumamoto (2024). </p>\n<p>SCOPE</p>\n<p>FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of declarative programming:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>functional, logic, functional-logic programming, rewriting systems,<br>\nformal methods and model checking, program transformations and program<br>\nrefinements</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>developing programs with the help of theorem provers or<br>\nSAT/SMT solvers, verifying properties of programs using declarative<br>\nprogramming techniques, or statistical methods including generative<br>\nAI (*);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>foundations, language design, implementation issues (compilation<br>\ntechniques, memory management, run-time systems, etc.), applications and<br>\ncase studies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of declarative<br>\nprogramming. Therefore, research papers must be written to be<br>\nunderstandable by a wide audience of declarative programmers and<br>\nresearchers. In particular, each submission should explain its<br>\ncontributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying<br>\nwhat has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its<br>\narea, and comparing it with previous work. Submission of system<br>\ndescriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged.</p>\n<p>(*) Note that FLOPS is a Programming Languages conference.<br>\nSubmissions should be accessible to a Programming Languages audience.<br>\nThe Program Committee has been selected from that audience, and it may<br>\nbe unable to gauge the quality of your submission if that requires<br>\nspecialized competencies in statistical methods and/or AI.  Special<br>\nattention should also be paid to the reproducibility of the results<br>\nfrom public sources.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<p>Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will be<br>\njudged on originality, correctness, and significance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>System descriptions: they should describe a working system and will be<br>\njudged on originality, usefulness, and design.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or theories<br>\nwith illustrative applications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked as<br>\nsuch in the title.</p>\n<p>Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>\nelsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally<br>\npublished workshops proceedings may be submitted. Authors must follow<br>\nSpringer’s Code of Conduct. See also the ACM SIGPLAN Republication<br>\nPolicy. At least one author of each accepted paper should plan to<br>\nattend the conference in person to present the work: there will be no<br>\ngeneral facility for online or pre-recorded presentation (but we will<br>\ndo our best to accommodate visa issues and similar unavoidable<br>\nobstacles).</p>\n<p>Submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages<br>\nexcluding references, though system descriptions and pearls are<br>\ntypically shorter. The formatting has to conform to Springer’s<br>\nguidelines. Regular research papers should be supported by proofs<br>\nand/or experimental results. In case of lack of space, this supporting<br>\ninformation should be made accessible otherwise (e.g., a link to a<br>\nweb page or an appendix, which does not count towards the<br>\npage limit). However, it is the responsibility of the authors to<br>\nguarantee that their paper can be understood and appreciated without<br>\nreferring to this supporting information; reviewers may simply choose<br>\nnot to look at it when writing their review.</p>\n<p>For more details, see</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://functional-logic.org/events/flops/2026/\">https://functional-logic.org/events/flops/2026/</a></p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted electronically at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://meteor.springer.com/FLOPS2026\">https://meteor.springer.com/FLOPS2026</a></p>\n<p>Reviewing will be single-blind.</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION</p>\n<p>The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series. We<br>\nexpect to invite the authors of a selection of the best papers to submit<br>\nan extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue which will<br>\nappear in the Science of Computer Programming journal.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12).</p>\n<p>Abstracts due         Dec 8, 2025<br>\nSubmission deadline   Dec 15, 2025<br>\nNotifications         Feb 2, 2026<br>\nFinal versions        March 2, 2026</p>\n<p>ORGANIZERS</p>\n<p>Ekaterina Komendantskaya (Co-chair), School of Mathematical and<br>\nComputer Sciences (MACS), Heriot-Watt University</p>\n<p>Mike Sperber (Co-chair), Active Group</p>\n<p>Ryoma Sin’ya (Co-Chair), Department of Mathematical Science and<br>\nElectrical-Electronic-Computer Engineering, Akita University</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reynald Affeldt, AIST </li>\n<li>Davide Ancona, University of Genova </li>\n<li>Lennart Augustsson, Epic Games</li>\n<li>Mutsunori Banbara, Nagoya University</li>\n<li>Alessandro  Bruni, ITU Copenhagen</li>\n<li>William Byrd, University of Alabama at Birmingham</li>\n<li>Pedro Cabalar, Corunna University</li>\n<li>Youyou Cong, Institute of Science Tokyo</li>\n<li>Matthew Daggitt, U.
