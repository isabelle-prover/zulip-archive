In recent years, cooperation of such tools in larger<br>\n   verification environments has demonstrated the potential to reduce the<br>\n   amount of manual intervention. Examples include the Sledgehammer tool<br>\n   providing an interface between Isabelle and (untrusted) automated<br>\n   provers, and collaboration of the HOL Light and Isabelle systems in<br>\n   the formal proof of the Kepler conjecture.</p>\n<p>Cooperation between reasoning systems relies on availability of<br>\n   theoretical formalisms and practical tools for exchanging problems,<br>\n   proofs, and models. The PxTP workshop strives to encourage such<br>\n   cooperation by inviting contributions on suitable integration,<br>\n   translation, and communication methods, standards, protocols, and<br>\n   programming interfaces. The workshop welcomes developers of automated<br>\n   and interactive theorem proving tools, developers of combined systems,<br>\n   developers and users of translation tools and interfaces, and<br>\n   producers of standards and protocols. We are interested both in<br>\n   success stories and descriptions of current bottlenecks and proposals<br>\n   for improvement.</p>\n<h2>Topics</h2>\n<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of<br>\n   cooperation between reasoning tools, whether automatic or interactive.<br>\n   More specifically, some suggested topics are:</p>\n<p>* applications that integrate reasoning tools (ideally with<br>\n     certification of the result);</p>\n<p>* interoperability of reasoning systems;<br>\n   * translations between logics, proof systems, models;<br>\n   * distribution of proof obligations among heterogeneous reasoning<br>\n     tools;</p>\n<p>* algorithms and tools for checking and importing (replaying,<br>\n     reconstructing) proofs;</p>\n<p>* proposed formats for expressing problems and solutions for different<br>\n     classes of logic solvers (SAT, SMT, QBF, first-order logic,<br>\n     higher-order logic, typed logic, rewriting, etc.);</p>\n<p>* meta-languages, logical frameworks, communication methods,<br>\n     standards, protocols, and APIs related to problems, proofs, and<br>\n     models;</p>\n<p>* comparison, refactoring, transformation, migration, compression and<br>\n     optimization of proofs;</p>\n<p>* data structures and algorithms for improved proof production in<br>\n     solvers (e.g., efficient proof representations);</p>\n<p>* (universal) libraries, corpora and benchmarks of proofs and<br>\n     theories;</p>\n<p>* alignment of diverse logics, concepts and theories across systems<br>\n     and libraries;</p>\n<p>* engineering aspects of proofs (e.g., granularity, flexiformality,<br>\n     persistence over time);</p>\n<p>* proof certificates;<br>\n   * proof checking;<br>\n   * mining of (mathematical) information from proofs (e.g., quantifier<br>\n     instantiations, unsat cores, interpolants, ...);</p>\n<p>* reverse engineering and understanding of formal proofs;<br>\n   * universality of proofs (i.e. interoperability of proofs between<br>\n     different proof calculi);</p>\n<p>* origins and kinds of proofs (e.g., (in)formal, automatically<br>\n     generated, interactive, ...)</p>\n<p>* Hilbert's 24th Problem (i.e. what makes a proof better than<br>\n     another?);</p>\n<p>* social aspects (e.g., community-wide initiatives related to proofs,<br>\n     cooperation between communities, the future of (formal) proofs);</p>\n<p>* applications relying on importing proofs from automatic theorem<br>\n     provers, such as certified static analysis, proof-carrying code, or<br>\n     certified compilation;</p>\n<p>* application-oriented proof theory;<br>\n   * practical experiences, case studies, feasibility studies.</p>\n<h2>Submissions</h2>\n<p>Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either<br>\n   an extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15<br>\n   pages).
