Although I received<br>\nemails from you from your address at \"<a href=\"http://in.tum.de\">in.tum.de</a>\" in the past, there was<br>\nsome genuine uncertainty in my mind about whether this address was still in<br>\nuse. In any case, I do not always receive replies and do not anticipate<br>\nthat all my emails will be answered. Also, I thought that there is a good<br>\nchance that the code is still publicly available from an 'old repository<br>\nthat everyone at TUM knows about' :-).</p>\n<p>At the time, the sources for that experimental work were not published<br>\nproperly IIRC... I can try find them in my private archive when I‘m back in<br>\n~ two weeks, and I‘m happy to share them with you... but in any case it<br>\nwill be very hard to get them to work, since they are basen on a modified<br>\nIsabelle version that was not an official release (although the changes<br>\nrelated to the recording of type class inferences did make it into some<br>\nlater release...)</p>\n<p>Given that the source code is not available publicly, of course, it is<br>\nentirely up to you whether and/or when you wish to share it. However, I<br>\nhave to admit that it is likely that I will find it very helpful even<br>\nwithout being able to run the entire study. As you may be aware, I am doing<br>\nfurther work on Types-to-Sets and other related topics ([1], [2], [3], [4],<br>\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/user9716869\">https://gitlab.com/user9716869</a>) and some of the implemented features are<br>\nclosely related to the functionality described in [5] (e.g. elimination of<br>\noverloading). I would like to ensure that there is no loss of functionality<br>\nin comparison to what has been previously implemented in [5]. Also, without<br>\nseeing the implementation, I feel that it is more likely that I might make<br>\nsome false claims in the literature review about what exactly has been<br>\nachieved from the perspective of automation in [5]: while the background<br>\ntheory and the algorithms are described in detail, there is very little<br>\nexplanation given about the implementation/UI of the framework that you<br>\ndescribe. Furthermore, I have a concern that it is not uncommon to describe<br>\nonly brief outlines of algorithms in publications, whereas the<br>\nimplementation may provide additional functionality/exception handling/etc.<br>\nI was also slightly worried that if the code was available publicly, then<br>\nsomeone else might have done further (perhaps, unpublished) work on it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[1] Kunčar O, Popescu A.
