Indeed, I meant the performance during the<br>\ninteractive development phase. I suppose I neglected the idea that the AFP<br>\nis meant to be used, primarily, for the publication of finished work,<br>\nrather than as a repository for stable releases. I have formed such a<br>\nbiased impression because I noticed that several entries are updated quite<br>\nregularly (e.g. ODE, ZFC in HOL and category3/bicategories). However, the<br>\nanswer that you have given, of course, is still applicable.</p>\n<p>My own process these days is to have multiple sessions (when the<br>\ndevelopment is large) until it has reached a maintenance phase, and then<br>\nswitch over.

In any case, I am not yet certain whether I will ever wish<br>\nto submit any of this work to the AFP: I might opt-out for a solution<br>\nsimilar to <a href=\"https://isarmathlib.org/\">https://isarmathlib.org/</a> (most of my own work is also,<br>\nprimarily, set-theory-based library material).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nMikhail Chekhov</p>\n<p>On Tue, Sep 15, 2020 at 9:47 AM Klein, Gerwin (Data61, Kensington NSW) &lt;<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:Gerwin.Klein@data61.csiro.au\">Gerwin.Klein@data61.csiro.au</a>&gt; wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On 15 Sep 2020, at 04:58, Mikhail Chekhov &lt;<a href=\"mailto:mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com\">mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>\nwrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The entry must contain a ROOT file with one session that has the name of<br>\nthe entry.
