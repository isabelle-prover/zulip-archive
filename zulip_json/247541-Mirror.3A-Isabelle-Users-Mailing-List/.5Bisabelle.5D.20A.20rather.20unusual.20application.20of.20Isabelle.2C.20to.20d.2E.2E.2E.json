Moreover, the magnitudes of these thresholds can thwart attempts to use simulation, model checking, or approximation by differential equations to formally verify the behaviors of such systems at realistic populations. We show how formal theorem provers can successfully verify some such systems at populations where other verification methods fail.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Journal version here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11047-021-09877-9\">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11047-021-09877-9</a></p>\n<p>Available for free here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05390\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05390</a></p>\n<p>Is this a mere blip or the start of a new trend?</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
