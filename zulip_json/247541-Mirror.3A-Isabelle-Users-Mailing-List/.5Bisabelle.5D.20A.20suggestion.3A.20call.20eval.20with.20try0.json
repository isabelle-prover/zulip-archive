I can imagine, a<br>\nnew user can be easily misled into a belief that all methods are<br>\nequivalently safe, unless some warnings/errors are issued (for example, the<br>\nfake proof step 'sorry' requires the quick_and_dirty_mode), especially due<br>\nto the existence of (seemingly) un(der)documented methods (e.g. argo). As<br>\nmuch as I appreciate \"Ignorantia juris non excusat\", there is little reason<br>\nnot to include gentle reminders about the breach of some of the guarantees<br>\nthat the software provides under most of the common circumstances.</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nMikhail Chekhov</p>",
