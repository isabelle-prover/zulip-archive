The confidentiality<br>\n  properties refer to the documents managed by the system, namely papers,<br>\n  reviews, discussion logs and acceptance/rejection decisions, and also to the<br>\n  assignment of reviewers to papers.

These results allow lifting<br>\n  BD Security properties from individual components specified as transition<br>\n  systems, to a composition of systems specified as communicating products of<br>\n  transition systems. The underlying ideas of these results are presented in the<br>\n  papers [1] and [2]. The latter paper also describes a major case study where<br>\n  these results have been used: on verifying the CoSMeDis distributed social<br>\n  media platform (itself formalized as an AFP entry [3] that builds on this<br>\n  entry).</p>\n<p>[0]: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.html</a><br>\n[1]: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3\">https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3</a><br>\n[2]: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2017.24\">https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2017.24</a><br>\n[3]: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CoSMeDis.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CoSMeDis.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CoCon.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CoCon.html</a></p>\n<p>CoSMed: A confidentiality-verified social media platform<br>\n========================================================<br>\nby Thomas Bauereiss and Andrei Popescu</p>\n<p>This entry contains the confidentiality verification of the (functional kernel<br>\n  of) the CoSMed  social media platform. The confidentiality properties are<br>\n  formalized as instances of BD Security [1, 2]. An innovation in the deployment<br>\n  of BD Security compared to previous work is the use of dynamic<br>\n  declassification triggers, incorporated as part of inductive bounds, for<br>\n  providing stronger guarantees that account for the repeated opening and<br>\n  closing of access windows. To further strengthen the confidentiality<br>\n  guarantees, we also prove \"traceback\" properties about the accessibility<br>\n  decisions affecting the information managed by the system.</p>\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3\">https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3</a><br>\n[2]: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CoSMed.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CoSMed.html</a></p>\n<p>CoSMeDis: A confidentiality-verified distributed social media platform<br>\n======================================================================<br>\nby Thomas Bauereiss and Andrei Popescu</p>\n<p>This entry contains the confidentiality verification of the (functional kernel<br>\n  of) the CoSMeDis  distributed social media platform presented in [1]. CoSMeDis<br>\n  is a multi-node extension the CoSMed prototype social media platform [2, 3,<br>\n  4]. The confidentiality properties are formalized as instances of BD Security<br>\n  [5, 6]. The lifting of confidentiality properties from single nodes to the<br>\n  entire CoSMeDis network is performed using compositionality and transport<br>\n  theorems for BD Security, which are described in [1] and formalized in a<br>\n  separate AFP entry [7].</p>\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2017.24\">https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2017.24</a><br>\n[2]: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-43144-4_6\">https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-43144-4_6</a><br>\n[3]: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-017-9443-3\">https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-017-9443-3</a><br>\n[4]: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CoSMed.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CoSMed.html</a><br>\n[5]: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3\">https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3</a><br>\n[6]: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.html</a><br>\n[7]: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/BD_Security_Compositional.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/BD_Security_Compositional.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CoSMedDis.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CoSMedDis.html</a></p>",
