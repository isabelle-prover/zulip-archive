Dealing with words/bitvectors in any logic seems to be a nuisance, but dealing with early versions of the word library was particularly unpleasant. There were quite a few asides in the L4.verified project that used, erm, obvious stand-ins for more inappropriate language, most of which were removed prior to it all being open-sourced. Looks like that one survived.</p>\n<p>It probably wouldn't have occured to any of us, at the time, that the sledgehammer might dredge up some of these internal names in the future. They should probably just be replaced.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\n    Thomas.</p>",
