The hope was that, avoiding any concepts like variable syntax, it is easily recognisable what is going on (which seems to have worked, despite the complaint).</p>\n<p>I don't have a Windows machine to test, but I do think it still works if you replace the path with what you need on Windows (as you have to do Linux/Mac as well), i.e. I don't really understand what is hostile to Windows users about it. Maybe all that is missing is adding <code>/cygdrive/c/afp/thys</code> as an example inside the <code>echo</code> for Windows. Having an extra example for Windows would be fine. Can someone with a Windows machine confirm if the result of that would work? Does <code>~</code> exist on Cygwin?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is also $ISABELLE_USER_HOME/etc/components to add components.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are indeed many choices, you could also add something to etc/setting and so on.

Basically, either users already know how to add components, because they have read the manual, know the concepts, and understand how to modify their setup, or they are missing one of these sources of information, and just want to use something in the AFP without further research. There is of course a whole spread of experience between those two, but the idea was to have something that needs no further knowledge.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",
