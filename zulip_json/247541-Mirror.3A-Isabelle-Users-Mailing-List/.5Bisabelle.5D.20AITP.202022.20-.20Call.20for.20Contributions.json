New combinations of<br>\nAI and reasoning methods and tools deployed over large mathematical<br>\nand scientific corpora will be instrumental to this task.  The AITP<br>\nconference is the forum for discussing how to get there as soon as<br>\npossible, and the force driving the progress towards that.</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>AI, machine learning and big-data methods in theorem proving and<br>\nmathematics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Collaboration between automated and interactive theorem proving, in<br>\n  particular their AI/ML aspects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Common-sense reasoning and reasoning in science, relations to general AI.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alignment and joint processing of formal, semi-formal, and informal<br>\n   libraries, Formal Abstracts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Methods for large-scale computer understanding of mathematics and science.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Combinations of linguistic/learning-based and semantic/reasoning methods</li>\n<li>Formal verification of AI and machine learning algorithms, explainable AI<br>\n.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SESSIONS</p>\n<p>There will be several focused sessions on AI for ATP, ITP, mathematics,<br>\nrelations to general AI, Formal Abstracts, linguistic processing of<br>\nmathematics/science, modern AI and big-data methods, and several<br>\nsessions with contributed talks. The focused sessions will be based on<br>\ninvited talks and discussion oriented.

Dominated by the \"Dent<br>\nParrachée\", one of the highest peaks of La Vanoise, Aussois is located<br>\non a sunny plateau at 1500 m altitude, offering a magnificent panorama<br>\nof the surrounding mountains and a direct access to the park of La<br>\nVanoise in summer and downhill ski slopes or cross country slopes in<br>\nwinter. The total price for accommodation, food and registration for<br>\nthe five days will be around 600 EUR.</p>\n<p>ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE<br>\nAussois is less than 2h from the airports of Lyon, Geneve, Chambery,<br>\nAnnecy, Grenoble and Turin. There are trains and buses from these<br>\nairports. Aussois is 7km from the Modane TGV station with direct<br>\ntrains from/to Paris. We will organize a bus for the participants from<br>\nthere to Aussois.
