The school is primarily geared at late undergraduate and masters students, but is open to all, including postgraduate and PhD students, postdocs, and participants from industry.</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME</p>\n<p>The school features four introductory courses in the first week, and a series of five lectures covering more advanced topics in the second week.
