ASP was found to be closely related to SAT, which led to a <br>\n new method of computing answer sets using SAT solvers and techniques adapted <br>\n from SAT. This has been a much studied relationship, and is currently extended <br>\n towards satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). The relationship of ASP to other <br>\n computing paradigms, such as constraint satisfaction, quantified Boolean <br>\n formulas (QBF), Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), first-order logic (FOL), <br>\n and FO(ID) is also the subject of active research. Consequently, new methods <br>\n of computing answer sets are being developed based on relationships to these <br>\n formalisms.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the practical applications of ASP also foster work on <br>\n multi-paradigm problem-solving, and in particular language and solver <br>\n integration. The most prominent examples in this area currently are the <br>\n integration of ASP with description logics (in the realm of the Semantic Web) <br>\n and constraint satisfaction (which recently led to the Constraint Answer Set <br>\n Programming (CASP) research direction).</p>\n<p>A large body of general results regarding ASP is available and several efficient <br>\n ASP solvers have been implemented. However, there are still significant <br>\n challenges in applying ASP to real life applications, and more interest in <br>\n relating ASP to other computing paradigms is emerging. This workshop will <br>\n provide opportunities for researchers to identify these challenges and to <br>\n exchange ideas for overcoming them.</p>\n<p>TOPICS   </p>\n<p>Topics of interests include (but are not limited to):                          </p>\n<ul>\n<li>ASP and classical logic formalisms (SAT/FOL/QBF/SMT/DL).                     </li>\n<li>ASP and constraint programming.                                              </li>\n<li>ASP and other logic programming paradigms, e.g., FO(ID).                     </li>\n<li>ASP and other nonmonotonic languages, e.g., action languages.                </li>\n<li>ASP and external means of computation.                                       </li>\n<li>ASP and probabilistic reasoning.                                             </li>\n<li>ASP and knowledge compilation.                                               </li>\n<li>ASP and machine learning.                                                    </li>\n<li>\n<p>New methods of computing answer sets using algorithms or systems of          <br>\n   other paradigms.                                                             </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Language extensions to ASP.                                                  </p>\n</li>\n<li>ASP and multi-agent systems.                                                 </li>\n<li>ASP and multi-context systems.                                               </li>\n<li>Modularity and ASP.                                                          </li>\n<li>ASP and argumentation.                                                       </li>\n<li>Multi-paradigm problem solving involving ASP.                                </li>\n<li>Evaluation and comparison of ASP to other paradigms.                         </li>\n<li>ASP and related paradigms in applications.                                   </li>\n<li>Hybridizing ASP with procedural approaches.                                  </li>\n<li>Enhanced grounding or beyond grounding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>The workshop invites two types of submissions:</p>\n<p>- original papers describing original research.<br>\n  - non-original paper already published on formal proceedings or journals.<br>\n Original papers must not exceed 13 pages (excluding references) and must be <br>\n formatted using using the 1-column CEURART style available here.</p>\n<p>Authors are requested to clearly specify whether their submission is original <br>\n or not with a footnote on the first page.<br>\n Authors are invited to submit their manuscripts in PDF via the EasyChair system <br>\n at the link: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=aspocp2022\">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=aspocp2022</a>.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>All dates are 'Anywhere on Earth', namely 23:59 UTC-12.<br>\n Abstract submission deadline:                              26 April 2022<br>\n Paper submission deadline:                                 10 May 2022 <br>\n Notification:                                              15 June 2022 <br>\n Camera-ready articles due:                                 24 June 2022 </p>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p>Authors of all accepted original contributions can opt for to publish their <br>\n work on formal proceedings. <br>\n Accepted non-original contributions will be given visibility on the <br>\n conference web site including a link to the original publication, <br>\n if already published.</p>\n<p>A selection of extended and revised versions of accepted papers will appear <br>\n in a special issue.<br>\n Extended versions of accepted non-original contributions, if not published <br>\n in a journal yet, might be included in the issue.</p>\n<p>LOCATION</p>\n<p>The FLoC organizing committee will make all possible effort to ensure everyone <br>\n is able to attend in person. <br>\n We are, however, very much aware that there might be members of the community <br>\n who cannot travel to Israel and, in cases where travel is not possible, we <br>\n will ensure people can participate remotely.</p>\n<p>WORKSHOP CO-CHAIRS</p>\n<p>Jessica Zangari<br>\n Markus Hecher<br>\n<a href=\"http://aspocp2022_AT_easychair.org\">aspocp2022_AT_easychair.org</a></p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>\n Antti Hyvärinen<br>\n Carmine Dodaro<br>\n Cristina Feier<br>\n Daniela Inclezan<br>\n Esra Erdem<br>\n Francesco Cauteruccio<br>\n Giovambattista Ianni<br>\n Javier Romero<br>\n Jia-Huai You<br>\n Joao Leite<br>\n Johannes K.
