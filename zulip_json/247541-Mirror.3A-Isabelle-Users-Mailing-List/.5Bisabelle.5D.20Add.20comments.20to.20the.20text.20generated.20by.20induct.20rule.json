Essentially, the same message was also posted on Stackoverflow. </p>\n<p>PS 2. Peter Zeller and Javier Diaz have kindly suggested that we can generate comments <br>\nby changing the name of the cases through case_namesor goal_cases. </p>\n<p>But I was thinking that having the actual text of the goal to prove was <br>\nmore meaningful in order to read the proof afterwards. <br>\nThese texts are in fact already present before the proof outline.<br>\nI would like that they appear together with the concerned case (as comments) <br>\nin order to see what is actually proved and not just the label.</p>",
