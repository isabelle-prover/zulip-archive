Here is an example:</p>\n<p>term*‹@{thm ‹HOL.refl›}›</p>\n<p>I'd like to be able to add a markup to have the possibility to be redirected<br>\nto the HOL.refl definition when I click on it.</p>\n<p>It seems that I need to find a method to compute positions<br>\ninside a ML string depicting a term parsed by the parse_term function,<br>\nwhich is called by the read_term function.</p>\n<p>Do you have any idea how I can do it?</p>\n<p>Or maybe you have another approach to suggest?</p>\n<p>Best regards.</p>\n<p>Nicolas Méric</p>",
