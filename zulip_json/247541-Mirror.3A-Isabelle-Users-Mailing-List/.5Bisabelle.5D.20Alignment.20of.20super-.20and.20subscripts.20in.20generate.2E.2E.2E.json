Is there a way to get superscripts and subscripts to align vertically above each other in the generated PDF document?

In my specific case, the ordering is relevant, although only one ordering results in a well-formed expression (and the correct ordering is also ensured via notation priorities). Still, having them vertically aligned would make the generated PDF much more readable.</p>\n<p>Thankful for any suggestions.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nTassilo Lemke</p>",
