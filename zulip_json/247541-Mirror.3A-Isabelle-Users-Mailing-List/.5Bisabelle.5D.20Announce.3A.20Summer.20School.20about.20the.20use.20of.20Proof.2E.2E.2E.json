It aims to bring together researchers, teachers, students, and and stakeholders interested in the use of proof assistant for teaching. PAT seeks to offer a broad spectrum of current research in the field of didactic of proof, the impact of the use of proof assistants in education, formalization of mathematics and user interfaces for theorem proving. The objective is to gather three audiences:</p>\n<p>• researchers in didactics of mathematics or informatics who would like to learn how and why use proof assistants in class<br>\n    • mathematicians who would like to learn how to use proof assistants for their research and teaching<br>\n    • specialists of proof assistants, who want to learn more about the didactic of proof and proving in mathematics.</p>\n<p>The summer school will take place in les Vosges, in France.<br>\nDates: 18-23 June 2023.</p>\n<p>More information can be found here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://pat2023.icube.unistra.fr/\">https://pat2023.icube.unistra.fr/</a></p>\n<p>Deadline for registration : April 17, 2023.</p>\n<p>Julien Narboux</p>",
