Generally speaking,<br>\nDOF-generated meta information can be used for document generation,<br>\nsemantic queries,   and tool interaction.</p>\n<p>We use DOF to write our papers and technical documentation systematically; <br>\nthe ZENODO page <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/15274072\">https://zenodo.org/records/15274072</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/15274072\">https://zenodo.org/records/15274072</a>&gt; gives examples and<br>\nthe DOF related publication bibliography.</p>\n<p>DOF comes in two parts, both of which were best used if registrated as <br>\nIsabelle component.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The “Core” which is available as AFP component. <br>\n  it suffices to be included if sessions use DOF. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Add-On Package, which provides examples, more non-standard<br>\n  ontologies and, last but not least, an incremental document generator<br>\n  (granularity: thy-files).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More details, installation hints nd the reference manual can be received from <br>\nthe ZENODO page.</p>\n<p>Have fun !</p>\n<p>Achim Brucker and Burkhart Wolff</p>",
