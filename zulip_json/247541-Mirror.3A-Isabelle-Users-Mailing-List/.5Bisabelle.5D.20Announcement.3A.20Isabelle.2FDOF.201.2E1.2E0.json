The installation <br>\nshould work under Isabelle 2021 and TeX Live 2021 out of the box.</p>\n<p>Homepage: <a href=\"https://git.logicalhacking.com/Isabelle_DOF/Isabelle_DOF\">https://git.logicalhacking.com/Isabelle_DOF/Isabelle_DOF</a><br>\nLong-term Archive: <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/4625176\">https://zenodo.org/record/4625176</a> </p>\n<p>Best,<br>\n    Achim &amp; Burkhart</p>\n<p>MISSION<br>\n=======<br>\nDOF permits to annotate theory-elements and terms <br>\nwith structured, typed meta-data, which were used in<br>\nautomatically generated antiquotations.  DOF applications <br>\nare currently mostly geared (but not restricted) to document<br>\ngeneration processes, so mostly technical reports, <br>\ntheory-documentations, and scientific papers.<br>\nThe meta-data can be specified in a HOL-like syntax<br>\nvia Ontologies, that were associated to appropriate <br>\nLaTeX style files. IDE Support in Isabelle/PIDE allows for <br>\na smooth, ontology-conform editing process of texts that<br>\ncontain both formal and informal content as well as <br>\nmachine-checked links between them.</p>\n<p>KEY FEATURES<br>\n=============</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>constructs to define text elements as INSTANCES of ontological <br>\n  classes (e.g., a \"requirement\")</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ways to annotate them with informal and formal content (e.g., a <br>\n  type-checked term or a thm)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>generated antiquotations referring to instances via their reference<br>\n  (e.g., @{requirement &lt;xyz&gt;} where xyz must Indeed a defined reference <br>\n  to an instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>temporal and data constraints similar to class invariants  on <br>\n  meta-data</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>navigation support via PIDE in documents and ontologies</p>\n</li>\n<li>some libraries containing common document ontologies as well as <br>\n  corresponding example papers.</li>\n</ul>",
