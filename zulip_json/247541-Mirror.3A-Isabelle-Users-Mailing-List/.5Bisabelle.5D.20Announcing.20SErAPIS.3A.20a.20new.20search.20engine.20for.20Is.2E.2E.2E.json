For tips on how to construct effective <br>\nqueries, please see Section 3 of the user guide.</p>\n<p>SErAPIS is also a platform for conducting research in novel methods to <br>\nsearch Isabelle collections and machine learning in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>We kindly ask that you help us with our research by providing us with <br>\nfeedback on the relevance of SErAPIS search results to your searches.<br>\nGiving us feedback is optional but very easy to do (see Section 4 of the <br>\nuser guide).</p>\n<p>Your feedback will help us:</p>\n<p>(i)   build data-sets for Isabelle search and machine learning,<br>\n(ii)  develop new search algorithms for Isabelle collections and;<br>\n(iii) develop machine learning methods for aiding the construction of <br>\nproofs in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>All data collected is anonymised.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>Yiannos Stathopoulos and Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki.</p>",

If one method (default is method 2) is not producing <br>\ngood results in response to the concepts you input, another method <br>\nmight!</p>",
