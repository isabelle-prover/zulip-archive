The idea seems to be enjoying success, although it is<br>\nrather strange. Since a hypothesis is a unit of knowledge of a developing<br>\ntheory. Each of the hypotheses placed in this repo will be duplicated by<br>\nthose who build the theory itself. And the simplest crawler could collect<br>\nunproven theorems from all theories.<br>\nThanks for the link.</p>\n<p>вт, 8 июл. 2025 г. в 12:54, Harry Butterworth &lt;<a href=\"mailto:heb1001@gmail.com\">heb1001@gmail.com</a>&gt;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google have set this up now:</p>\n<p>Activity · google-deepmind/formal-conjectures · GitHub<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/activity\">https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/activity</a></p>\n<p>On Fri, 23 Aug 2024 at 09:12, Alex Shkotin &lt;<a href=\"mailto:alex.shkotin@gmail.com\">alex.shkotin@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Harry,</p>\n<p>Let me add that IMHO the structure of theory storage should be changed to<br>\nmore granulated than file.</p>\n<p>Please have a look at some initial proposals [1] where undirected graph<br>\ntheory was taken as an example to formalize using knowledge unit ideas: the<br>\ntheory (including proofs), the structure (ugraph), the task and task's<br>\nsolution.</p>\n<p>To say it simply it should be DB or KB to keep theory, structures (for<br>\ntheory is about), and tasks (problems) properly for world wide access.</p>\n<p>Alex</p>\n<p>[1]<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374265191_Theory_framework_-_knowledge_hub_message_1\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374265191_Theory_framework_-_knowledge_hub_message_1</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380576198_Specific_tasks_of_Ugraphia_on_a_particular_structure_formulations_solutions_placement_in_the_framework\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380576198_Specific_tasks_of_Ugraphia_on_a_particular_structure_formulations_solutions_placement_in_the_framework</a></p>\n<p>чт, 22 авг. 2024 г. в 15:13, Harry Butterworth &lt;<a href=\"mailto:heb1001@gmail.com\">heb1001@gmail.com</a>&gt;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I expect this has been obvious to many of you for some time but it<br>\noccurred to me today when thinking about systems like AlphaProof [1] that,<br>\nwith advances in AI, it might soon become the case that the limiting factor<br>\nin solving new mathematical problems could be the availability of unsolved<br>\nbut peer-reviewed and generally accepted formal problem statements.</p>\n<p>I thought it might be worth pointing out that a collection of such<br>\nstatements would be a valuable thing and each one might eventually<br>\nconstitute the major part of the human effort of actually solving the<br>\nproblem so ought to earn some recognition in the event it is successfully<br>\ncompleted.</p>\n<p>An advantage of having a whole collection of problems is that it’s<br>\nunlikely to be obvious which problems a new AI is going to be able to<br>\nsolve, so a larger set would increase the chance of getting lucky with a<br>\nmathematical breakthrough.</p>\n<p>Is there an existing archive of formally specified unsolved<br>\nproblems?
