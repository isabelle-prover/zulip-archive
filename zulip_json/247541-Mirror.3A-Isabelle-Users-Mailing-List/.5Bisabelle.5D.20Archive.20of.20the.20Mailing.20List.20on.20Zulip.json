To help in this matter, I have mirrored the archive <br>\nof the Isabelle users mailing list to a Zulip stream [1] which is <br>\nweb-public so it can be searched without having an account. The archive <br>\ncontains the history from 2005 up until July 2020. Since August 2020, <br>\nthe mailing list has been mirrored to another stream [2]. This was <br>\npossible thanks to Larry who provided me with a dump of the mailing list.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Lukas</p>\n<p>[1] <br>\n<a href=\"#narrow/stream/336180-Archive-Mirror.3A-Isabelle-Users-Mailing-List\">https://isabelle.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/336180-Archive-Mirror.3A-Isabelle-Users-Mailing-List</a></p>\n<p>[2] <br>\n<a href=\"#narrow/stream/247541-Mirror.3A-Isabelle-Users-Mailing-List\">https://isabelle.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/247541-Mirror.3A-Isabelle-Users-Mailing-List</a></p>",
