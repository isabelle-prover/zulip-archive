And sometimes I<br>\nhave nice syntax, but the plain function is easier to type.</p>\n<p>Is there a tool that I can run over my .thy files that replaces prefix<br>\nfunction syntax with the corresponding pretty syntax, for certain<br>\nfunctions? Or maybe a tool that pretty-prints every term the way<br>\nIsabelle would show it to me (e.g. in the goal state), and replace it<br>\nwith that in the .thy file?</p>\n<p>Thanks!<br>\nJoachim</p>",
