AutoCorrode's core is language-agnostic, but as a driving example we are releasing AutoCorrode with a frontend for a Rust dialect which we call ÂµRust. Functional specifications in AutoCorrode are written in separation logic, and we provide highly-configurable and scalable tactics for discharging weakest precondition proofs. AutoCorrode also includes representation-agnostic interfaces for reasoning about mutable state, as well efficiently executable implementations thereof and a \"meta frame rule\" to combine them.</p>\n<p>AutoCorrode is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/autocorrode\">https://github.com/awslabs/autocorrode</a>. See the README for brief descriptions of its sessions, and Micro_Rust_Examples/Showcase.thy for introductory examples.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nThe AutoCorrode Team</p>\n<p>(Hanno Becker<br>\nNathan Chong,<br>\nRobert Dockins,<br>\nJim Grundy,<br>\nJason Z.
