I played a part myself, but it was mainly to be chief kibitzer.</p>\n<p>Larry</p>\n<p>Over three years, lots of hard work, and 260,000 lines of Isabelle/HOL code later, the Nitro Isolation Engine (NIE) is finally announced alongside Graviton5. </p>\n<p>Working with our colleagues in EC2, Annapurna, and AWS AppSec, we have been working to rearchitect the Nitro system for Graviton5+ instances around a small, trusted separation kernel. Written from scratch in Rust, we have additionally specified the behaviour of a core subset of the Nitro Isolation Engine kernel, verified that the implementation meets this specification, and additionally proved deep security properties—confidentiality and integrity—of the implementation.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to all ARG team members and our colleagues in EC2, Annapurna, and AWS AppSec.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-graviton-5-cpu-amazon-ec2\">https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-graviton-5-cpu-amazon-ec2</a></p>",
