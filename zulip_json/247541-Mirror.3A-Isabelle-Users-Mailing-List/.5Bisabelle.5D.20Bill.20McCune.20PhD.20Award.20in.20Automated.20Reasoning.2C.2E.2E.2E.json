The justification by the supervisor and the nominating <br>\nadditional independent researcher report will play an important role in <br>\nthe evaluation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The final decision is made by the Expert Committee at least one month <br>\nbefore CADE/IJCAR being held.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The award consists of a certificate announcing the winner to have <br>\nreceived the Bill McCune PhD Award in Automated Reasoning. The award <br>\nwill be announced at the respective year's CADE/IJCAR. The nominators of <br>\nthe winner will also receive a copy of this certificate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The decision of the Expert Committee is final and binding, and not <br>\nsubject to discussion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expert Committee *</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Expert Committee is formed by the board of CADE Trustees with the <br>\naim to reflect the broad diversity in the area of Automated Reasoning.  <br>\nIt is announced with the call for nominations, and thus formed before <br>\nthe call for nominations.  The Committee for the Bill McCune PhD Award <br>\n2019 and 2020 consists of the following people:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nikolaj Bjorner, Microsoft</li>\n<li>Pascal Fontaine, University of Liege</li>\n<li>Carsten Fuhs, Birkbeck, University of London</li>\n<li>Cezary Kaliszyk, University of Innsbruck</li>\n<li>Claudia Nalon, University of Brasilia</li>\n<li>Giles Reger, The University of Manchester</li>\n<li>Giselle Reis, CMU-Qatar</li>\n<li>Andy Reynolds, The University of Iowa</li>\n<li>Uwe Waldmann, MPI for Informatics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Expert Committee can seek additional expertise, even after the <br>\nsubmission deadline for nominations.</p>",
