High-quality submissions on the general topic of <br>\nautomated<br>\ndeduction, including logical foundations, theory and principles, <br>\napplications<br>\nin and beyond STEM, implementations, and the use/contribution of automated<br>\ndeduction in AI, are solicited. CADE-28 aims to present research that <br>\nreflects<br>\nthe broad range of interesting and relevant topics in automated deduction.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract deadline:        15 February 2021</li>\n<li>Submission deadline:      22 February 2021</li>\n<li>Rebuttal phase:            2 April    2021</li>\n<li>Notification:             19 April    2021</li>\n<li>Final version:            31 May      2021</li>\n<li>Conference:            12-15 July     2021</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions can be made in two categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Regular papers. Up to 15 pages in LNCS style. Proofs of theoretical <br>\nresults<br>\n   that do not fit in the page limit may be provided in an appendix. <br>\nReviewers<br>\n   may consider additional material in appendices, but submissions must <br>\nbe self-<br>\n   contained within the page limit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short papers (including system descriptions, user experiences, domain <br>\nmodels,<br>\n   etc.) Up to 10 pages in LNCS style.<br>\nSubmissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere.<br>\nThey will be judged on relevance, originality, significance, <br>\ncorrectness, and<br>\nreadability. If software or data is relevant to a paper, a link that <br>\nprovides<br>\naccess to the software/data must be provided to enable reproduction of <br>\nresults.<br>\nThe review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors <br>\nwill<br>\nhave the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may solicit<br>\nfurther reviews after the rebuttal period.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer <br>\nLNCS/LNAI<br>\nseries. Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files can be obtained at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a><br>\nPapers must be submitted to the CADE-28 track via<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cade28\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cade28</a></p>\n<p>CALL FOR WORKSHOPS<br>\n==================<br>\nWorkshop proposals for CADE-28 are solicited. The workshops will take place<br>\nbefore (11th July) and after (16th July) the conference. Both <br>\nwell-established<br>\nworkshops and newer ones are encouraged. Similarly, proposals for workshops<br>\nwith a tight focus on a core automated reasoning specialization, as well as<br>\nthose with a broader, more applied focus, are welcome. Please provide the<br>\nfollowing information in your application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workshop title.</li>\n<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proposed workshop duration (from half a day to two days) and preferred <br>\nday(s).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Brief description of the goals and the scope of the workshop. Why is the<br>\n   workshop relevant to CADE?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is the workshop new or has it met previously? In the latter case <br>\ninformation<br>\n   on previous meetings should be given (e.g., links to the program, <br>\nnumber of<br>\n   submissions, number of participants).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What are the plans for publication?</p>\n</li>\n<li>Short statement regarding plans in case of an online conference.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CALL FOR TUTORIALS<br>\n==================<br>\nTutorial proposals for CADE-28 are solicited. The tutorials will take place<br>\nbefore (11th July) and after (16th July) the conference. Tutorials are <br>\nexpected<br>\nto be either half-day or full-day events, with a theoretical or applied <br>\nfocus,<br>\non a topic of interest to CADE-28. Please provide the following <br>\ninformation in<br>\nyour application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tutorial title.</li>\n<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>\n<li>Proposed tutorial duration (from half to one day) and the preferred day.</li>\n<li>Brief description of the tutorial's goals and topics to be covered.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Whether or not a version of the tutorial has been given previously, and<br>\n   if/how the intended presentation differs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short statement regarding plans in case of an online conference.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Within reason, CADE will take care of printing and distributing notes for<br>\ntutorials that would like this service.</p>\n<p>CALL FOR COMPETITIONS<br>\n=====================<br>\nThe CADE ATP System Competition (CASC), which evaluates automated theorem<br>\nproving systems for classical logics, has become an integral part of the <br>\nCADE<br>\nconferences. Further competition proposals are solicited. The goal is to <br>\nfoster<br>\nthe development of automated reasoning systems and applications, in all <br>\nareas<br>\nrelevant to automated deduction in a broad sense. Please provide the <br>\nfollowing<br>\ninformation in your application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Competition title.</li>\n<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>\n<li>Duration and schedule of the competition.</li>\n<li>Room/space requirements.</li>\n<li>Description of the competition task and the evaluation procedure.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is the competition new or has it been organized before? In the latter case<br>\n   information on previous competitions should be given.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What computing resources are required and how will they be provided?</p>\n</li>\n<li>Short statement regarding plans in case of an online conference.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Dates for Workshop/Tutorials/Competitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission deadline:           16 November 2020</li>\n<li>Notification:                  11 December 2020</li>\n<li>Workshops and tutorials:  11 &amp; 16 July     2021</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Proposals for workshops, tutorials, and competitions must be submitted <br>\nto the<br>\nCADE-28-WTC track via<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cade28\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cade28</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/1S_B7Ci2VXYFJjAEgKVBdv1r/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
