From data types to development techniques and specification<br>\nformalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from<br>\nthe large body of research proposed and implemented since the<br>\npioneering works of the 1960s.</p>\n<p>CALCO aims to bring together researchers with interests in both<br>\nfoundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in<br>\ncomputer science, traditional as well as emerging ones.</p>\n<p>CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the<br>\nforces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on<br>\nCoalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on<br>\nAlgebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place<br>\nin Salzburg (Austria, 2021), London (UK, 2019), Ljubljana<br>\n(Slovenia,2017), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015), Warsaw (Poland,<br>\n2013), Winchester (UK, 2011), Udine (Italy, 2009), Bergen (Norway,<br>\n2007), Swansea (Wales, 2005).</p>\n<p>The 10th edition will be held in Bloomington, Indiana, co-located with<br>\nMFPS XXXIX. It is planned as a physical, in-person event, with<br>\nsupport for remote presence, both for speakers and for other<br>\nparticipants who are unable or unwilling to travel.</p>\n<p>Submission Categories</p>\n<hr>\n<p>CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and<br>\ncoalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four<br>\ncategories of submissions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Regular papers that report</p>\n<p>* results on theoretical foundations<br>\n  * novel methods and techniques for software development<br>\n  * experiences with technology transfer to industry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Co)Algebraic Pearls papers that</p>\n<p>* present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Early ideas abstracts that lead to</p>\n<p>* presentations of work in progress<br>\n  * proposals for original venues of research.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tool presentation papers that</p>\n<p>* report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Topics of Interests</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All topics relating to algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications<br>\nare of interest for CALCO, and among them</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Models and logics<br>\n    - Automata and languages<br>\n    - Graph transformations and term rewriting<br>\n    - Modal logics<br>\n    - Proof systems<br>\n    - Relational systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics<br>\n    - Abstract data types<br>\n    - Re-engineering techniques (program transformations)<br>\n    - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques<br>\n    - Semantics of programming languages</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Methodologies in software and systems engineering<br>\n    - Development processes<br>\n    - Method integration<br>\n    - Usage guidelines</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specialised models and calculi<br>\n    - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems<br>\n    - Concurrent, distributed, mobile, cyber-physical,<br>\n      and context-aware computational paradigms</p>\n<p>- Systems theory and computational models (chemical, biological, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>System specification and verification<br>\n    - Formal testing and quality assurance<br>\n    - Generative programming and model-driven development<br>\n    - Integration of formal specification techniques<br>\n    - Model-driven development<br>\n    - Specification languages, methods, and environments</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tools supporting algebraic and coalgebraic methods for<br>\n    - Advances in automated verification<br>\n    - Model checking<br>\n    - Theorem proving<br>\n    - Testing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>String diagrams and network theory<br>\n    - Theory of PROPs and operads<br>\n    - Rewriting problems and higher-dimensional approaches<br>\n    - Automated reasoning with string diagrams<br>\n    - Applications of string diagrams</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Quantum computing<br>\n    - Categorical semantics for quantum computing<br>\n    - Quantum calculi and programming languages<br>\n    - Foundational structures for quantum computing<br>\n    - Applications of quantum algebra</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions Guidelines</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All submissions will be handled via EasyChair:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2023\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2023</a></p>\n<p>The format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs. Please use the<br>\nlatest version of the style:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/\">http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/</a></p>\n<p>It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length.<br>\nSubmissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately.</p>\n<p>Regular papers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English<br>\npresenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and<br>\nnot submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be<br>\nmaximum 15 pages long, excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space<br>\nlimitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix.</p>\n<p>Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz<br>\nInternational Proceedings in Informatics series.</p>\n<p>A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer<br>\nScience (<a href=\"http://www.lmcs-online.org\">http://www.lmcs-online.org</a>), containing extended versions of<br>\nselected papers, is planned.</p>\n<p>(Co)algebraic pearls</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This is a recent submission category. Explaining a known idea in a new<br>\nway may make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We<br>\nencourage the submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an<br>\nidea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing<br>\nan application. Pearls are typically short and concise and so should<br>\nnot be longer than regular papers in the format specified by<br>\nLIPIcs. Authors who feel they need a bit more space should consult<br>\nwith the PC co-chairs. The accepted papers will be included in the<br>\nfinal proceedings of the conference.</p>\n<p>Early ideas abstracts</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs.<br>\nThe volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on<br>\nthe CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged<br>\nto disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Tool papers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs.<br>\nThe accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of<br>\nthe conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the<br>\ntime of submission for download and evaluation.</p>\n<p>Best Paper and Best Presentation Awards</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose<br>\nrecipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a<br>\nBest Presentation Award, elected by the participants.</p>\n<p>Programme Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Carlos Gustavo Lopez Pombo (University of Buenos Aires)</li>\n<li>Andreas Abel (Gothenburg University)</li>\n<li>Vincenzo Ciancia (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Pisa)</li>\n<li>Patricia Johann (Appalachian State University)</li>\n<li>Ionut Tutu (Simion Stoilow Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy)</li>\n<li>Martin Escardo (University of Birmingham)</li>\n<li>Tarmo Uustalu (Reykjavik University)</li>\n<li>Giorgio Bacci (Aalborg University)</li>\n<li>Thorsten Wißmann (FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg)</li>\n<li>Fabio Gadducci (University of Pisa)</li>\n<li>Shin-Ya Katsumata (National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo)</li>\n<li>Holger Giese (Hasso Plattner Institute at the University of Potsdam)</li>\n<li>Peter Ölveczky (University of Oslo)</li>\n<li>Michael Johnson (Macquarie University)</li>\n<li>Nicolas Behr (CNRS Université Paris Cité)</li>\n<li>Henning Urbat (FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg)</li>\n<li>Valentina Castiglioni (Reykjavik University)</li>\n<li>Fernando Orejas (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya)</li>\n<li>Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh (University College London)</li>\n<li>Georgiana Caltais (University of Twente)</li>\n<li>Sławomir Lasota (University of Warsaw)</li>\n<li>Aleks Kissinger (University of Oxford)</li>\n<li>Thomas Colcombet (CNRS, IRIF, Université de Paris)</li>\n<li>Sandra Kiefer (Max Planck Institute for Software Systems)</li>\n<li>Peter Selinger (Dalhousie University)</li>\n<li>Natasha Alechina (Utrecht University)</li>\n<li>Sara Kalvala (University of Warwick)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chairs</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Paolo Baldan (University of Padua)<br>\nValeria de Paiva (Topos Institute, Berkeley)</p>\n<p>Organiser</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Larry Moss (local) (Indiana University)</li>\n</ul>",
