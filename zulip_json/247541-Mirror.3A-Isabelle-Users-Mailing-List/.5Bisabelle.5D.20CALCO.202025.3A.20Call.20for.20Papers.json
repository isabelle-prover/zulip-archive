From data types to development techniques and specification<br>\nformalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the<br>\nlarge body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering<br>\nworks of the 1960s. CALCO aims to bring together researchers and<br>\npractitioners with interests in both foundational and applicative uses<br>\nof algebra and coalgebra in computer science, traditional as well as<br>\nemerging ones. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by<br>\njoining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop<br>\non Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on<br>\nAlgebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in<br>\nBloomington, Indiana (US, 2023), Salzburg (Austria, 2021), London (UK,<br>\n2019), Ljubljana (Slovenia,2017), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015),<br>\nWarsaw (Poland, 2013), Winchester (UK, 2011), Udine (Italy, 2009),<br>\nBergen (Norway, 2007), Swansea (Wales, 2005).</p>\n<p>The 11th edition will be held in Glasgow, UK, co-located with MFPS XLI.<br>\nIt is planned as a physical, in-person event.</p>\n<p>Submission Categories</p>\n<hr>\n<p>CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and<br>\ncoalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four<br>\ncategories of submissions.</p>\n<p>Regular papers that report</p>\n<ul>\n<li>results on theoretical foundations,</li>\n<li>novel methods and techniques for software development,</li>\n<li>experiences with technology transfer to industry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Co)Algebraic Pearls papers that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Early ideas abstracts that lead to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>presentations of work in progress,</li>\n<li>proposals for original venues of research.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tool presentation papers that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Topics of Interest</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All topics relating to algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications<br>\nare of interest for CALCO, and among them</p>\n<p>* Models and logics<br>\n    - Automata and languages<br>\n    - Graph transformations and term rewriting<br>\n    - Modal logics<br>\n    - Proof systems<br>\n    - Relational systems<br>\n    - Behavioural metrics<br>\n  * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics<br>\n    - Abstract data types<br>\n    - Re-engineering techniques (program transformations)<br>\n    - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques<br>\n    - Semantics of programming languages<br>\n  * Methodologies in software and systems engineering<br>\n    - Development processes<br>\n    - Method integration<br>\n    - Usage guidelines<br>\n  * Specialised models and calculi<br>\n    - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems<br>\n    - Concurrent, distributed, mobile, cyber-physical, and context-aware computational paradigms<br>\n    - Systems theory and computational models (chemical, biological, etc.)<br>\n  * System specification and verification<br>\n    - Formal testing and quality assurance<br>\n    - Generative programming and model-driven development<br>\n    - Integration of formal specification techniques<br>\n    - Model-driven development<br>\n    - Specification languages, methods, and environments<br>\n  * Tools supporting algebraic and coalgebraic methods for<br>\n    - Advances in automated verification<br>\n    - Model checking<br>\n    - Theorem proving<br>\n    - Testing<br>\n  * String diagrams and network theory<br>\n    - Theory of PROPs and operads<br>\n    - Rewriting problems and higher-dimensional approaches<br>\n    - Automated reasoning with string diagrams<br>\n    - Applications of string diagrams<br>\n  * Quantum computing<br>\n    - Categorical semantics for quantum computing<br>\n    - Quantum calculi and programming languages<br>\n    - Foundational structures for quantum computing<br>\n    - Applications of quantum algebra</p>\n<p>Submission Guidelines</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All submissions will be handled via EasyChair:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25</a></p>\n<p>The format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs. Please use the<br>\nlatest version of the style:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/\">http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/</a></p>\n<p>It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length.<br>\nSubmissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately.<br>\nProceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz<br>\nInternational Proceedings in Informatics series.</p>\n<p>A special issue of the open access journal  Logical Methods in Computer<br>\nScience (<a href=\"http://www.lmcs-online.org\">http://www.lmcs-online.org</a>), containing extended versions of<br>\nselected papers, is planned.</p>\n<h3>Regular papers</h3>\n<p>Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English<br>\npresenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and<br>\nnot submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be<br>\nmaximum 15 pages long, excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space<br>\nlimitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix.</p>\n<h3>(Co)algebraic pearls</h3>\n<p>This is a recent submission category. Explaining a known idea in a new<br>\nway may make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We<br>\nencourage the submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an<br>\nidea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing an<br>\napplication. Pearls are typically short and concise and so should not be<br>\nlonger than regular papers in the format specified by LIPIcs. Authors<br>\nwho feel they need a bit more space should consult the PC co-chairs. The<br>\naccepted papers will be included in the final proceedings of the<br>\nconference.</p>\n<h3>Early ideas abstracts</h3>\n<p>Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs.<br>\nThe volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on<br>\nthe CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged<br>\nto disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere.</p>\n<h3>Tool papers</h3>\n<p>Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs.<br>\nThe accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of<br>\nthe conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the<br>\ntime of submission for download and evaluation.</p>\n<p>Best Paper and Best Presentation Awards</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose<br>\nrecipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a Best<br>\nPresentation Award, elected by the participants.</p>",
