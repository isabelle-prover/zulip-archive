IFL 2022 will be a venue for<br>\nresearchers to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in<br>\nprogress, and publication-ripe results related to the implementation and<br>\napplication of functional languages and function-based programming.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest to IFL include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>language concepts</li>\n<li>type systems, type checking, type inferencing</li>\n<li>compilation techniques</li>\n<li>staged compilation</li>\n<li>run-time function specialization</li>\n<li>run-time code generation</li>\n<li>partial evaluation</li>\n<li>abstract interpretation</li>\n<li>metaprogramming</li>\n<li>generic programming</li>\n<li>automatic program generation</li>\n<li>array processing</li>\n<li>concurrent/parallel programming</li>\n<li>concurrent/parallel program execution</li>\n<li>embedded systems</li>\n<li>web applications</li>\n<li>embedded domain specific languages</li>\n<li>security</li>\n<li>novel memory management techniques</li>\n<li>run-time profiling performance measurements</li>\n<li>debugging and tracing</li>\n<li>virtual/abstract machine architectures</li>\n<li>validation, verification of functional programs</li>\n<li>tools and programming techniques</li>\n<li>industrial applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Submissions and peer-review</em><br>\nFollowing IFL tradition, IFL 2022 will use a post-symposium review process<br>\nto produce the formal proceedings.</p>\n<p>Before the symposium authors submit draft papers. These draft papers will<br>\nbe screened by the program chair to make sure that they are within the<br>\nscope of IFL. The draft papers will be made available to all participants<br>\nat the symposium. Each draft paper is presented by one of the authors at<br>\nthe symposium.</p>\n<p>After the symposium, a formal review process will take place, conducted by<br>\nthe program committee.  Reviewing is single blind. There will be at least 3<br>\nreviews per paper. The reviewers have 6 weeks to write their reviews. For<br>\nthe camera-ready version the authors can make minor revisions which are<br>\naccepted without further reviewing.</p>\n<p><em>Where</em><br>\nIFL 2022 will be held physically in Copenhagen, Denmark, arranged by DIKU<br>\nat the University of Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>See the IFL 2022 website at <a href=\"https://ifl22.github.io/\">https://ifl22.github.io/</a> for more information.<br>\n[image: beacon]</p>",
