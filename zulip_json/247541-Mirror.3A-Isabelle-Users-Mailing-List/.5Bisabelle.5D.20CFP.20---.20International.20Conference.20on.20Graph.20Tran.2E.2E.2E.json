Graph-based formalisms are central to diverse domains including: software architectures, model driven engineering, network topologies, cyber-physical systems, quantum computing, exploring molecular structures, and graph databases.</p>\n<p><em>We aim to broaden participation</em></p>\n<p>ICGT is not only a theory conference, and we also welcome applications, tools, and case studies.</p>\n<p>If your work uses graph rewriting technologies (e.g., graph databases, quantum compilers, AI/ML), ICGT is for you.</p>\n<p><em>Topics Include</em></p>\n<p>Theory: e.g. Models, verification, concurrency, logical aspects<br>\nApplications: e.g. Software engineering, quantum computing, AI/GNNs, graph databases, business processes<br>\nTools: e.g. Languages, environments, tool support</p>\n<p><em>Important Dates (AoE)</em></p>\n<p>Abstracts: 16 Feb 2026<br>\nPapers: 23 Feb 2026<br>\nNotification: 6 Apr 2026<br>\nCamera-ready: 27 Apr 2026</p>\n<p><em>Submission Categories</em></p>\n<p>Accepted papers will appear in LNCS proceedings.</p>\n<p>Regular Research Papers (16 pp LNCS)<br>\nTool Presentations (8 pp LNCS)<br>\nVision Papers / Open Challenges (8 pp LNCS)<br>\nJournal-First Extended Abstracts (2 pp LNCS)</p>\n<p>Full call details: <a href=\"https://conf.researchr.org/track/icgt-2026/icgt-2026-icgt-research-papers\">https://conf.researchr.org/track/icgt-2026/icgt-2026-icgt-research-papers</a></p>\n<p>See you in Rennes!</p>\n<p>Blair Archibald and Oszkar Semerath (ICGT Chairs)</p>",
