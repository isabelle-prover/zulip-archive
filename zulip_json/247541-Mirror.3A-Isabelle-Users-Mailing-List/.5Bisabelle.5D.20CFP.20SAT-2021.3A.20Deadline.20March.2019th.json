Domains include<br>\nMaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints, Quantified Boolean Formulae<br>\n(QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), as well as Constraint<br>\nSatisfaction Problems (CSP). Topics include, but are not restricted to:</p>\n<p>Theoretical advances;<br>\n    Practical search algorithms;<br>\n    Knowledge compilation;<br>\n    Implementation-level details of SAT solving tools and SAT-based systems;<br>\n    Problem encodings and reformulations;<br>\n    Applications;<br>\n    Case studies and reports on insightful findings based on rigorous<br>\nexperimentation.</p>\n<p><strong>* Important Dates </strong>*</p>\n<p>Abstract submission: March 15th<br>\n    Paper submission: March 19th<br>\n    Author response period: April 26-27th<br>\n    Author notification: May 5th<br>\n    Camera-ready: May 15th<br>\n    Conference: July 5-9th</p>\n<p><strong>* Submission and Publication </strong>*</p>\n<p>Submissions to SAT 2021 are solicited in three paper categories, describing<br>\noriginal contributions.</p>\n<p>Long papers (9 to 15 pages, excluding references)<br>\n    Short papers (up to 8 pages, excluding references)<br>\n    Tool papers (up to 8 pages, excluding references)</p>\n<p>All papers submissions are done exclusively via EasyChair in Springer’s<br>\nLaTeX llncs2e style.</p>\n<p>Long and short papers should contain original research, with sufficient<br>\ndetail to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. For papers<br>\nreporting experimental results, authors are strongly encouraged to make<br>\ntheir data and implementations available with their submission. Submissions<br>\nreporting on case studies are also encouraged, and should describe details,<br>\nweaknesses, and strengths in sufficient depth. Long and short papers will<br>\nbe evaluated with the same quality standards, and are expected to contain a<br>\nsimilar contribution per page ratio.</p>\n<p>Tool papers must obey to a specific content criteria. A tool paper should<br>\ndescribe the implemented tool and its novel features. Here “tools” are<br>\ninterpreted in a broad sense, including descriptions of implemented<br>\nsolvers, preprocessors, etc., as well as systems that exploit SAT solvers<br>\nor their extensions for use in interesting problem domains. A demonstration<br>\nis expected to accompany a tool presentation. Papers describing tools that<br>\nhave already been presented previously are expected to contain significant<br>\nand clear enhancements to the tool.</p>\n<p>All accepted papers are expected to be published in the proceedings of the<br>\nconference, which will be published within the Springer LNCS series.</p>\n<p><strong>* Best Paper Awards </strong>*</p>\n<p>Long and short papers may be considered for a Best Paper Award. If the main<br>\nauthor is a student, both in terms of work and writing, the paper may be<br>\nconsidered for a Best Student Paper Award.</p>\n<p><strong>* Student Grants </strong>*</p>\n<p>SAT 2021 will provide free registration to all the PhD students with an<br>\naccepted paper.</p>\n<p>Further details may be found in the website of SAT-2021:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.iiia.csic.es/sat2021\">https://www.iiia.csic.es/sat2021</a></p>",
