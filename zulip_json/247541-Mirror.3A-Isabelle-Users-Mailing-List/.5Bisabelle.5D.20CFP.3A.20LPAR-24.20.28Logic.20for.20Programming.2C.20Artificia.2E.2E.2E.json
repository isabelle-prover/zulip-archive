LPAR is an \"A\" ranked conference in the CORE ranking system;<br>\npapers from previous proceedings are listed in DBLP. LPAR-24 will be held in<br>\nManizales, Colombia, at the National University of Colombia, 4-9th June<br>\n2023.<br>\nSee the conference web site for all the details. The proceedings of LPAR-24<br>\nwill be published by EasyChair, in the EPiC Series in Computing.</p>\n<p>*** Submission Guidelines</p>\n<p>All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another<br>\njournal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Regular papers describing solid new research results. They can be up to<br>\n  15 pages long in EasyChair style, including figures but excluding<br>\nreferences<br>\n  and appendices (that reviewers are not required to read). Where<br>\napplicable,<br>\n  regular papers  are supported by experimental validation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experimental and tool papers describing implementations of systems, report<br>\n  experiments with implemented systems, or compare implemented systems.<br>\n  Experimental and tool papers should be supported by a link to the<br>\nartifact/<br>\n  experimental evaluation available to the reviewers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The length of regular papers is limited to 15 pages in the EasyChair style<br>\n(excluding the blibliography and appendices). The length of experimental and<br>\ntool papers is limited to 8 pages in the EasyChair style (excluding the<br>\nbibliography and appendices). Both types of papers must be electronically<br>\nsubmitted in PDF via EasyChair:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar2023\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar2023</a></p>\n<p>Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of them<br>\nwill be present at the conference.</p>\n<p>*** List of Topics</p>\n<p>New results in the fields of computational logic and applications are<br>\nwelcome.<br>\nAlso welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open<br>\nquestions and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories and<br>\npractices.
