CE fields, the<br>\n   program committees of a number of premier conferences have their<br>\n   2022 events held at one venue (same location and dates). Thus,<br>\n   this year, The Congress is composed of a number of tracks (joint-<br>\n   conferences, sessions, workshops, poster and panel discussions);<br>\n   all will be held simultaneously, same location and dates:<br>\n   July 25-28, 2022. For the complete list of joint conferences, refer to:<br>\n<a href=\"https://american-cse.org/csce2022/conferences\">https://american-cse.org/csce2022/conferences</a> </p>\n<p>This year's Congress will be a hybrid event that combines a \"live\"<br>\n   in-person event with a \"virtual\" online component. We anticipate that<br>\n   most speakers will physically be attending (ie, most talks are expected<br>\n   to be face-to-face).</p>\n<p>We anticipate having between 1,000 and 2,000 participants in the<br>\n   Congress. The congress includes 20 major tracks, composed of: 122<br>\n   technical, research, and panel sessions as well as a number of<br>\n   keynote lectures. Last year, the Congress had attracted speakers,<br>\n   authors and participants affiliated with over 158 different<br>\n   universities (including many from the top 50 ranked institutions),<br>\n   major IT corporations (including: Microsoft, Google, Apple, SAP,<br>\n   Facebook, Oracle, Amazon, Yahoo, Samsung, IBM, Ebay, GE, Siemens,<br>\n   Philips, Ericsson, BAE Systems, Hitachi, NTT, Twitter, Uber<br>\n   Technologies, ...), major corporations (including: Exxon Mobil,<br>\n   Johnson &amp; Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, PetroChina, GlaxoSmithKline, HSBC,<br>\n   Airbus, Boeing, Hyundai, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, ...), government<br>\n   research agencies (NSF, NIH, DoE, US Air Force, NSA National Security<br>\n   Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, ...), US national laboratories<br>\n   (including, NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ANL<br>\n   Argonne National Lab, Sandia National Lab, ORNL Oak Ridge National Lab,<br>\n   Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Lawrence Livermore National Lab,<br>\n   Los Alamos National Lab, Pacific Northwest National Lab, ...), and a<br>\n   number of Venture Capitalists as well as distinguished speakers<br>\n   discussing Intellectual Property issues. Last year, 54% of attendees<br>\n   were from academia, 25% from industry; 20% from government and funding<br>\n   agencies; and 1% unknown. About half of the attendees were from<br>\n   outside USA; from 69 nations.</p>\n<p>See the web links below for a small subset of publications based on<br>\n   papers a<br>\n[message truncated]</p>",
