The scope of<br>\nthis collection includes, but is not limited to, the formal<br>\nverification of networks particularly in the context of<br>\nsafety-critical systems. We also seek innovative methods and<br>\ntechniques that leverage neural networks and machine learning to<br>\noptimize and accelerate the formal verification process. Hybrid<br>\napproaches that combine symbolic methods, model checking, and neural<br>\nnetwork-based strategies are of particular interest.</p>\n<p>Scope and Topics</p>\n<p>This collection welcomes original research and review articles in the<br>\nfollowing areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Formal Verification of Networks: Computer networks, network<br>\nprotocols, software-defined networks (SDNs), and neural networks in<br>\nsafety-critical systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Safety-Critical Applications: Cyber-physical systems, IoT networks,<br>\nand mission-critical infrastructures requiring high assurance of<br>\ncorrectness and security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Neural Network-Based Optimization for Verification: Machine<br>\nlearning-driven acceleration of formal verification techniques.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hybrid Approaches: Combining symbolic methods, model checking, and<br>\nAI-based strategies for efficient verification.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the evolving nature of this field, we also encourage short<br>\n(in-progress) papers showcasing promising preliminary results and<br>\nnovel directions.</p>\n<p>Why Submit?</p>\n<p>Engage with a growing community of experts in formal verification and<br>\nnetworked systems.<br>\nGain visibility in a rapidly emerging research area with high impact.<br>\nContribute to the development of robust, safety-assured networked systems.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>Submission Deadline: June 30, 2025<br>\nFirst-Round review decisions: September 15, 2025<br>\nDeadline for revision Submission: October 15,2025<br>\nNotification of final decisions: December 1, 2025</p>\n<p>Submission Information</p>\n<p>Manuscripts should follow the journal's formatting guidelines and be<br>\nsubmitted through the designated online portal.
