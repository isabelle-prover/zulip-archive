Please consider to submit a paper.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"http://mathai-iclr.github.io/\">http://mathai-iclr.github.io/</a> &lt;<a href=\"http://mathai-iclr.github.io/\">http://mathai-iclr.github.io/</a>&gt;<br>\nCall for Papers:</p>\n<p>The Math-AI workshop is intended to provide a forum for discussing missing elements and major bottlenecks towards demonstrating mathematical reasoning ability in AI systems. We hope that the outcome of the workshop will lead us in meaningful directions towards a generic approach to mathematical reasoning, and shed light on general reasoning mechanisms for artificial intelligence. In particular, we are interested but not limited to the following areas of questions:<br>\nMathematical reasoning vs. general intelligence?</p>\n<p>What is a potential path from mathematical reasoning to general artificial intelligence?<br>\nWhat is special about mathematical reasoning compared to other reasoning tasks?<br>\nWhat are the pros and cons of studying mathematical reasoning?<br>\nCan the lessons learned from mathematical reasoning generalize to other reasoning tasks?<br>\nWhat machine learning techniques are we missing in the quest for machines that perform mathematical reasoning?</p>\n<p>How to deal with large action space – hopeless exploration in mathematical reasoning?<br>\nHow to design methods that allow flexible planning and jumpy reasoning?<br>\nHow to collect large scale datasets for mathematical reasoning?<br>\nCan one augment the dataset by designing good synthetic datasets?<br>\nHow do we utilize informal mathematical datasets?<br>\nHuman-like theorem proving vs formal theorem proving using ITPs (interactive theorem provers), trade-offs?<br>\nDo we need a special theorem proving assistant for machine learning?</p>\n<p>We are also interested in works on other reasoning problems that share similar structures, and can bring great insights to mathematical reasoning, such as</p>\n<p>Program synthesis<br>\nCode verification<br>\nRetrosynthesis problem<br>\nText games</p>\n<p>Important Dates:<br>\nPaper submission opens:  Jan 26, 11:59PM PST <br>\nDeadline for paper submission: Feb 26, 11:59PM PST<br>\nReview decisions released: March 26, 11:59PM PST<br>\nDeadline for camera ready: April 26, 11:59PM PST<br>\nWorkshop: May 8, 2019</p>\n<p>Speakers &amp; Panelists:<br>\nYoshua Bengio, MILA.<br>\nTimothy Gowers, Collège de France.<br>\nMateja Jamnik, University of Cambridge<br>\nJay McClelland, Stanford University<br>\nAlison Pease, University of Dundee<br>\nStanislas Polu, OpenAI<br>\nMarkus Rabe, Google<br>\nChristian Szegedy, Google<br>\nJosef Urban, CIIRC</p>\n<p>Organizers:<br>\nKshitij Bansal, Google<br>\nJohn Harrison, Amazon<br>\nWenda Li, University of Cambridge<br>\nDavid McAllester, TTI Chicago<br>\nMelanie Mitchell, Santa Fe Institute<br>\nYuhuai (Tony) Wu, University of Toronto</p>",
