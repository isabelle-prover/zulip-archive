As the workshop series strives to<br>\nmaintain breadth in its scope, areas of interest include neighbouring<br>\nfields as well.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest are the theory and applications of coalgebra and<br>\ncoinductive reasoning in all research areas of Computer Science,<br>\nincluding (but not limited to) the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>set-theoretic and categorical foundations of coalgebra;</li>\n<li>algebra &amp; coalgebra, (co)monads, and distributive laws;</li>\n<li>(modal) logic;</li>\n<li>automata theory and formal languages;</li>\n<li>coinductive definitions and proof principles (including \"up-to\" techniques)</li>\n<li>\n<p>semantic models of computation (for programming languages, dynamical<br>\n  systems, term rewriting, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>functional, objected-oriented, concurrent, and constraint programming;</p>\n</li>\n<li>type theory (notably behavioural typing);</li>\n<li>formal verification and specification;</li>\n<li>control theory (notably discrete events and hybrid systems);</li>\n<li>quantum computing;</li>\n<li>game theory;</li>\n<li>implementation, tools, and proof assistants</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Venue and event</p>\n<hr>\n<p>CMCS'22 will be held in Munich, Germany, co-located with ETAPS 2022 on<br>\n2-3 April 2022.</p>\n<p>Important dates (tentative)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Abstract regular papers          24 January 2022<br>\nSubmission regular papers        27 January 2022<br>\nNotification regular papers      28 February 2022<br>\nCamera-ready copy                14 March 2022<br>\nSubmission short contributions    2 March 2022<br>\nNotification short contributions  8 March 2022</p>\n<p>Programme committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Adriana Balan, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania<br>\nHenning Basold, Leiden University, The Netherlands<br>\nMarta Bilkova, Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic<br>\nFredrik Dahlqvist, Queen Mary University London, United Kingdom<br>\nFredrik Nordvall Forsberg, University of Strathclyde, United Kingdom<br>\nRichard Garner, Macquarie University, Australia<br>\nJeremy Gibbons, University of Oxford, United Kingdom<br>\nHelle Hvid Hansen (co-chair), University of Groningen, The Netherlands<br>\nIchiro Hasuo, National Institute of Informatics, Japan<br>\nTobias Kappé, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands<br>\nDexter Kozen, Cornell University, USA<br>\nClemens Kupke, University of Strathclyde, United Kingdom<br>\nAlexander Kurz, Chapman University, USA<br>\nBarbara König, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany<br>\nMarina Lenisa, University of Udine, Italy<br>\nDavide Sangiorgi, University of Bologna, Italy<br>\nLutz Schröder, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany<br>\nDavid Spivak, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA<br>\nTarmo Uustalu, Reykjavik University, Iceland<br>\nThorsten Wißmann, Radboud University, The Netherlands <br>\nFabio Zanasi (co-chair), University College London, United Kingdom<br>\nMaaike Zwart, ITU Copenhagen, Denmark</p>\n<p>PC co-chairs</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Helle Hvid Hansen, University of Groningen, The Netherlands<br>\nFabio Zanasi, University College London, United Kingdom</p>\n<p>Publicity chair</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thorsten Wißmann, Radboud University, The Netherlands</p>\n<p>Steering committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Filippo Bonchi, University of Pisa, Italy<br>\nMarcello Bonsangue, Leiden University, The Netherlands<br>\nCorina Cirstea, University of Southampton, United Kingdom<br>\nIchiro Hasuo, National Institute of Informatics, Japan<br>\nBart Jacobs, Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands<br>\nBartek Klin, University of Oxford, United Kingdom<br>\nAlexander Kurz, University of Leicester, United Kingdom<br>\nMarina Lenisa, University of Udine, Italy<br>\nStefan Milius (chair), University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany<br>\nLawrence Moss, Indiana University, USA<br>\nDaniela Petrisan, University Paris Diderot, France<br>\nJurriaan Rot, Radboud University, The Netherlands<br>\nDirk Pattinson, Australian National University, Australia<br>\nLutz Schröder, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany<br>\nAlexandra Silva, Cornell University, USA</p>\n<p>Submission guidelines</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We solicit two types of contributions: regular papers and short<br>\ncontributions. Regular papers must be original, unpublished, and not<br>\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be max 18<br>\npages long in Springer LNCS style, excluding references and an appendix<br>\nof up to 5 pages. Note that reviewers are not obliged to read the<br>\nappendix, and the merits of the paper should be clear from the main<br>\ntext. Short contributions may describe work in progress, or summarise<br>\nwork submitted to a conference or workshop elsewhere. They should be no<br>\nmore than two pages including references. Regular papers and short<br>\ncontributions should be submitted electronically as a PDF file via the<br>\nEasychair system at</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmcs2022\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmcs2022</a></p>\n<p>The proceedings of CMCS 2022 will include all accepted regular papers<br>\nand will be published post-conference as a Springer volume in the<br>\nIFIP-LNCS series (pending approval). Accepted short contributions will<br>\nbe bundled in a technical report.</p>",
