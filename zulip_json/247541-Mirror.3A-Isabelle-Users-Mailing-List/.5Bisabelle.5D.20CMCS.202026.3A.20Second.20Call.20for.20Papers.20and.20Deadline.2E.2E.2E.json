As the workshop series strives to maintain breadth in its scope, areas of interest include neighbouring fields as well.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest are the theory and applications of coalgebra and coinductive reasoning in all research areas of Computer Science, including (but not limited to) the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>set-theoretic and categorical foundations of coalgebra;</li>\n<li>algebra &amp; coalgebra, (co)monads, and distributive laws;</li>\n<li>(modal) logic;</li>\n<li>automata theory and formal languages;</li>\n<li>coinductive definitions and proof principles (including \"up-to\" techniques)</li>\n<li>semantic models of computation (for programming languages, dynamical systems, term rewriting, etc.)</li>\n<li>functional, objected-oriented, concurrent, and constraint programming;</li>\n<li>type theory (notably behavioural typing);</li>\n<li>formal verification and specification;</li>\n<li>control theory (notably discrete events and hybrid systems);</li>\n<li>quantum computing;</li>\n<li>game theory;</li>\n<li>implementation, tools, and proof assistants</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Venue and event</h1>\n<p>CMCS '26 will be held in Turin, Italy, co-located with ETAPS 2026 on 11-12 April 2026.</p>\n<h1>Invited Speakers</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Keynote: Barbara König</li>\n<li>Invited talks: Bahareh Afshari and Sergey Goncharov</li>\n<li>Tutorial: Benjamin Bisping</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Important dates (Anywhere On Earth)</h1>\n<p>Abstract of regular papers: 02 February 2026 (Extended)<br>\nSubmission of regular papers: 05 February 2026 (Extended)<br>\nNotification of regular papers: 04 March 2026<br>\nSubmission short contributions: 05 March 2026<br>\nNotification short contributions: 10 March 2022<br>\nFinal camera-ready version: 27 March 2026</p>\n<h1>Committees and chairs</h1>\n<h2>Programme committee</h2>\n<p>Stelios Tsampas (University of Southern Denmark)<br>\n    Jorge A.

Regular papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be at most 18 pages long in Springer LNCS style, excluding references. A clearly marked appendix containing technical proofs can be added, but this will not be published in the proceedings. Note that the reviewers are not obliged to read the appendix, and the merits of the paper should be clear from the main text.</p>\n<p>Short contributions may describe work in progress, or summarise work submitted to a conference or workshop elsewhere. They should be no more than two pages including references.</p>\n<p>Regular papers and short contributions must be submitted electronically as a PDF file via the Easychair system at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmcs2026\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmcs2026</a></p>\n<p>The proceedings of CMCS 2026 will include all accepted regular papers and will be published post-conference as a Springer volume in the IFIP-LNCS series. Accepted short contributions will be bundled in a technical report.</p>",
