It is planned as an on-site event, with support for remote presence for those participants who are unable to come for pandemic reasons. In case of a deteriorating pandemic situation, we may decide to organize the conference as an online-only event. The final decision about this will be made in November 2022.</p>\n<p>Keynote speakers:</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Claudia Faggian (Université de Paris, France)</li>\n<li>Nina Gierasimczuk (Danish Technical University, Denmark)</li>\n<li>Dale Miller (Inria Saclay, France)</li>\n<li>Michał Pilipczuk (University of Warsaw, Poland)</li>\n<li>Davide Sangiorgi (University of Bologna, Italy)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission guidelines:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submitted papers must be in English and must provide sufficient detail to allow the Programme Committee to assess the merits of the paper. Full proofs may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which will be read at the reviewers' discretion. Authors are strongly encouraged to include a well written introduction which is directed at all members of the PC.</p>\n<p>The paper should be submitted via Easychair: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=csl2023\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=csl2023</a></p>\n<p>The CSL 2023 conference proceedings will be published in Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs), see <a href=\"https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors\">https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors</a>. </p>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit contributed papers of no more than 15 pages in LIPIcs style (not including appendices or references), presenting unpublished work fitting the scope of the conference. Papers may not be submitted concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work submitted to a conference or a journal.</p>\n<p>Papers authored or co-authored by members of the PC are not allowed.</p>\n<p>At least one of the authors of each accepted paper is expected to register for the conference in order to present their papers.</p>\n<p>Important dates:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Abstract submission: July 9, 2022 (AoE),<br>\nPaper submission: July 16, 2022 (AoE),<br>\nNotification: September 30, 2022,<br>\nFinal version: October 30, 2022,<br>\nConference: February 13-16, 2023</p>\n<p>List of topics:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The following list is not exhaustive but indicates the scope of interest for CSL'23:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>automated deduction and interactive theorem proving</li>\n<li>constructive mathematics and type theory</li>\n<li>equational logic and term rewriting</li>\n<li>automata and games, game semantics</li>\n<li>modal and temporal logic</li>\n<li>model checking</li>\n<li>decision procedures</li>\n<li>logical aspects of computational complexity</li>\n<li>finite model theory</li>\n<li>computability</li>\n<li>computational proof theory</li>\n<li>logic programming and constraints</li>\n<li>lambda calculus and combinatory logic</li>\n<li>domain theory</li>\n<li>categorical logic and topological semantics</li>\n<li>database theory</li>\n<li>specification, extraction and transformation of programs</li>\n<li>logical aspects of quantum computing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Programme Committee:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Matteo Acclavio (University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg)<br>\nPatricia Bouyer-Decitre (LSV, CNRS &amp; ENS Paris-Saclay, France)<br>\nAgata Ciabattoni (TU Wien, Austria)<br>\nDiana Costa (University of Lisbon, Portugal)<br>\nMartín Escardó (University of Birmingham, UK)<br>\nRajeev Goré (The Australian National University, Australia)<br>\nGiulio Guerrieri (Huawei Edinburgh Research Centre, UK)<br>\nShin-ya Katsumata (National Institute of Informatics, Japan)<br>\nDelia Kesner (Université de Paris, France)<br>\nSandra Kiefer (RWTH Aachen University, Germany)<br>\nBartek Klin (University of Oxford, UK, co-chair)<br>\nNaoki Kobayashi (The University of Tokyo, Japan)<br>\nStepan Kuznetsov (Steklov Mathematical Institute of RAS, Russia)<br>\nMartin Lück (Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany)<br>\nMeena Mahajan (The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, HBNI, India)<br>\nFilip Murlak (University of Warsaw, Poland)<br>\nDaniele Nantes (University of Brasília, Brazil)<br>\nElaine Pimentel (UCL, UK, co-chair)<br>\nPaolo Pistone (University of Bologna, Italy)<br>\nAna Sokolova (University of Salzburg, Austria)<br>\nLutz Straßburger (Inria Saclay – Île-de-France, France)<br>\nPascal Schweitzer (TU Darmstadt, Germany)<br>\nMartin Zimmermann (Aalborg University, Denmark)<br>\nYoni Zohar (Bar Ilan University, Israel)</p>\n<p>Organisation committee:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Lorenzo Clemente (chair)<br>\nWojciech Czerwiński<br>\nRadosław Piórkowski</p>",
