Authors of  system and dataset descriptions and<br>\nsystem entries are strongly encouraged to take up this opportunity and<br>\ngive interested colleagues an in depth impression of their work.</p>\n<p><strong>* Doctoral Programme </strong>*</p>\n<p>PhD students  are invited  to participate  in the  doctoral programme,<br>\nwhich provides them with a forum  to present early results and receive<br>\nconstructive  feedback and  mentoring.  To attend,  submit a  two-page<br>\nabstract  of the  thesis describing  the research  questions, research<br>\nplans,  completed   and  remaining  research,  evaluation   plans  and<br>\npublication plans; a two-page  CV that includes background information<br>\n(name, university, supervisor),  education (degree sought, year/status<br>\nof   degree,  previous   degrees),   employments,  relevant   research<br>\nexperience  (publications,  presentations,   attended  conferences  or<br>\nworkshops, etc).</p>\n<p><strong>* Participation / Hybrid Event </strong>*</p>\n<p>CICM 2023 will  be held as an hybrid event,  participation is possible<br>\nonline or  on-site. Authors of  accepted papers can choose  to present<br>\nonline or on-site,  but at least one author needs  to register for the<br>\nconference.</p>\n<p><strong>* Important Dates </strong>*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract deadline:          27 March     2023</li>\n<li>Full paper deadline:         3 April     2023</li>\n<li>Reviews sent to authors:     2 May       2023</li>\n<li>Rebuttals due:               6 May       2023</li>\n<li>Notification of acceptance: 13 May       2023</li>\n<li>Camera-ready copies due:     5 June      2023 </li>\n<li>Conference:                4–8 September 2023</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions to the doctoral programme</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission deadline:        30 June      2023 </li>\n<li>Notification of acceptance: 14 July      2023</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All submissions should be made via EasyChair at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2023\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2023</a></p>\n<p>CICM 2023  will have proceedings in  form of a volume  in the Springer<br>\nLNAI series, using the LNCS style.</p>\n<p>For the LNCS style files, see:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a></p>",
