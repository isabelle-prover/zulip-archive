Now, TAP is joining the 27th International<br>\nSymposium on Formal Methods (FM 2026) as a new special track. This<br>\nintegration places the ground-breaking work of the Test and Proofs<br>\ncommunity at the heart of the world's premier conference on formal<br>\nmethods.</p>\n<p>This new track provides a dedicated forum for researchers,<br>\npractitioners, and tool developers to present and discuss the latest<br>\nadvances in the synergistic combination of traditionally distinct areas<br>\nof dynamic analysis, e.g., testing, and static analysis, e.g., proving.<br>\nBy joining FM, the TAP track offers authors a wider, more diverse<br>\naudience and the prestige of publication in the main, open-access FM<br>\n2026 proceedings, published by Springer in the LNCS series. We invite<br>\nyou to be part of this exciting new chapter for the tests and proofs<br>\ncommunity!</p>\n<p><strong>Track Highlight: FM 2026 Keynote by Professor Cristian Cadar</strong></p>\n<p>We are thrilled to announce that TAP Track at FM 2026 will feature a<br>\nkeynote address by <strong>Professor Cristian Cadar</strong> of Imperial College<br>\nLondon. Professor Cadar is a world-renowned authority on software<br>\nreliability, security, and verification, and is particularly celebrated<br>\nfor his pioneering contributions to symbolic and dynamic execution<br>\n(e.g., KLEE). His selection as a main symposium keynote speaker is a<br>\npowerful testament to the increasing importance of the core topics of<br>\nthe TAP track to the broader computer science community.</p>\n<h3><strong>Scope and Topics of Interest</strong></h3>\n<p>The TAP track solicits high-quality, original research on the interplay<br>\nbetween dynamic techniques such as testing, runtime verification<br>\netc.testing and formal verification such as proving, model checking,<br>\nabstract interpretation, etc. . The track aims to foster new<br>\ncollaborations and advance the state of the art in creating reliable and<br>\nsecure software and systems.
