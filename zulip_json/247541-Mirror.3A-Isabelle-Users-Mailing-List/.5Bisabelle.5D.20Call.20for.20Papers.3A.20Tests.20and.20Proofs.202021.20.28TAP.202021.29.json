Formal techniques for counter-example generation<br>\nbased on, for example, symbolic execution, SAT/SMT-solving or model<br>\nchecking, furnish evidence for the potential of a combination of test<br>\nand proof. The combination of predicate abstraction with testing-like<br>\ntechniques based on exhaustive enumeration opens the perspective for<br>\nnovel techniques of proving correctness. On the practical side,<br>\ntesting offers cost-effective debugging techniques of specifications<br>\nor crucial parts of program proofs (such as invariants).  Last but not<br>\nleast, testing is indispensable when it comes to the validation of the<br>\nunderlying assumptions of complex system models involving hardware<br>\nand/or system environments. Over the years, there is growing<br>\nacceptance in research communities that testing and proving are<br>\ncomplementary rather than mutually exclusive techniques.</p>\n<p>The TAP conference aims to promote research in the intersection of<br>\ntesting and proving by bringing together researchers and practitioners<br>\nfrom both areas of verification.</p>\n<p>Topics of Interest</p>\n<hr>\n<p>TAP's scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology,<br>\nincluding foundational work, tool development, and empirical<br>\nresearch. Its topics of interest center around the connection between<br>\nproofs (and other static techniques) and testing (and other dynamic<br>\ntechniques). Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the<br>\nfollowing topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verification and analysis techniques combining proofs and tests</li>\n<li>Program proving with the aid of testing techniques</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deductive techniques supporting the automated generation of test vectors<br>\n   and oracles (theorem proving, model checking, symbolic execution, SAT/SMT<br>\n   solving, constraint logic programming, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deductive techniques supporting novel definitions of coverage criteria,</p>\n</li>\n<li>Program analysis techniques combining static and dynamic analysis</li>\n<li>Specification inference by deductive and dynamic methods</li>\n<li>Testing and runtime analysis of formal specifications</li>\n<li>Search-based technics for proving and testing</li>\n<li>Verification of verification tools and environments</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of test and proof techniques in new domains,<br>\n   such as security, configuration management, learning</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combined approaches of test and proof in the context of formal<br>\n   certifications (Common Criteria, CENELEC, …)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies, tool and framework descriptions, and experience<br>\n   reports about combining tests and proofs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission Instructions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>TAP 2021 accepts papers of four kinds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Regular research papers: full submissions describing original<br>\n   research, of up to 16 pages (excluding references).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tool demonstration papers: submissions describing the design and<br>\n   implementation of an analysis/verification tool or framework, of up<br>\n   to 8 pages (excluding references). The tool/framework described in a<br>\n   tool demonstration paper should be available for public use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short papers: submissions describing preliminary findings, proofs of<br>\n   concepts, and exploratory studies, of up to 6 pages (excluding<br>\n   references).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Journal-first extended abstracts, of up to 4 pages, summarizing<br>\n   recently published articles in high-quality journals. The aim of<br>\n   journal-first papers is to further enrich the program of TAP, as<br>\n   well as to provide an more flexible path to dissemination of results<br>\n   in the field. The summarized journal article should have been<br>\n   published (or accepted) by 1 July 2020 or later, and report new<br>\n   results (as opposed as simply extending prior conference work with<br>\n   'appendix' material, or minor enhancements). Journal-first<br>\n   submissions must be marked as such in the submission’s title, and<br>\n   must explicitly include full bibliographic details (including a DOI)<br>\n   of the journal publication they are based on.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accepted submissions will be published in Springer's LNCS<br>\nseries. Papers have to adhere to Springer's LNCS format and must be<br>\nsubmitted in PDF format at the EasyChair submission site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tap2021\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tap2021</a></p>\n<p>Committees</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Information about all committees can be found under<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/events/TAP2021\">https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/events/TAP2021</a></p>\n<p>Program Chairs :<br>\nFrederic Loulergue (University of Orleans, France)<br>\nFranz Wotawa (Graz University of Technology, Austria)</p>\n<p>Contact</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:tap2021@easychair.org\">tap2021@easychair.org</a></p>",
