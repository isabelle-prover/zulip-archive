Their<br>\ndesign, implementation and their use in reasoning tasks, ranging from<br>\nthe correctness of software to the properties of formal systems,<br>\nhave been the focus of considerable research over the last two decades.<br>\nThis workshop will bring together designers, implementors and<br>\npractitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and<br>\nutility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable<br>\nbinding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the<br>\nexpressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning process.</p>\n<p>LFMTP 2023 will provide researchers a forum to present state-of-the-art<br>\ntechniques and discuss progress in areas such as the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming languages,<br>\n  logical systems and related formally specified systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable<br>\n  binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning about,<br>\n  datatypes defined from binding signatures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and<br>\n  associated reasoning techniques, including inductive types of higher<br>\n  dimension in homotopy type theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Graphical languages for building proofs, applications in geometry,<br>\n  equational reasoning and category theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New theory contributions: canonical and substructural frameworks,<br>\n  contextual frameworks, proof-theoretic foundations supporting<br>\n  binders, functional programming over logical frameworks,<br>\n  homotopy and cubical type theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of logical frameworks: proof-carrying architectures,<br>\n  proof exchange and transformation, program refactoring, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Techniques for programming with binders in functional programming<br>\n  languages such as Haskell, OCaml or Agda, and logic programming<br>\n  languages such as lambda Prolog or Alpha-Prolog.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Invited Speakers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Niki Vazou (IMDEA Software Institute Madrid, Spain)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: shared session with LSFA'23 (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/ufg.br/lsfa2023\">https://sites.google.com/ufg.br/lsfa2023</a><br>\n).</p>\n<h2>Registration</h2>\n<p>Online registration fee available!<br>\n<a href=\"https://easyconferences.eu/fscd2023/registration1/\">https://easyconferences.eu/fscd2023/registration1/</a></p>",
