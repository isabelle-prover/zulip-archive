The symposium specifically focuses on concurrent software but does not exclude the analysis of sequential software. Submissions are solicited on theoretical results, novel algorithms (classical and quantum), tool development, including for modern hardware (parallel and distributed), and empirical evaluation.</p>\n<p>Registration</p>\n<p>Registration is FREE.
