What can one learn from their example? <br>\nWhat do successful research paths look like? Are the important factors <br>\njust as expected, or are there surprising aspects which make the <br>\ndifference? What is important to think about at your stage?</p>\n<p>We welcome PhD students, and Master students with research ambitions, to <br>\njoin the Mentoring Workshop at ETAPS 2022! During this workshop, well <br>\nknown computer science researchers, of different seniority, will give <br>\ninspirational talks about the path they took, what was important on the <br>\nway, and insights they want to pass on to early career researchers. <br>\nThere will be plenty of opportunity for discussions and interaction, <br>\nduring the workshop and in the social programme around it.</p>\n<p>We are proud that we could secure the following speakers:<br>\nErika Ábrahám, RWTH Aachen<br>\nEva Darulova, Uppsala University<br>\nLaura Kovács, Vienna University of Technology<br>\nPeter Müller, ETH Zurich<br>\nMartin Schäf, Amazon AWS<br>\nMartin Wirsing, LMU Munich</p>\n<p>You register for the Mentoring Workshop by registering for “Satellite <br>\n(Workshops) Sunday” at the ETAPS registration page. (You may also want <br>\nto register for the main conference. But note that these registrations <br>\ndo not overlap.) The early registration deadline is very soon (20 Feb), <br>\nbut the normal registration is open until 10 March. (After that, the <br>\nlate registration fee applies.)</p>\n<p>ETAPS provides some student scholarships, see link below.<br>\nImportant links:<br>\nETAPS Mentoring Workshop: <br>\n<a href=\"https://etaps.org/user-profile/archive/53-etaps-2022/486-mentoring-workshop-2022\">https://etaps.org/user-profile/archive/53-etaps-2022/486-mentoring-workshop-2022</a><br>\nETAPS 2022 in Munich: <a href=\"https://etaps.org/\">https://etaps.org/</a><br>\nETAPS 2022 registration: <a href=\"https://etaps.org/2022/registration\">https://etaps.org/2022/registration</a><br>\nETAPS student scholarships (application deadline 1 March): <br>\n<a href=\"https://etaps.org/2022/student-scholarships\">https://etaps.org/2022/student-scholarships</a></p>\n<p>In case of questions, please contact the organizers:<br>\nWolfgang Ahrendt, Chalmers University of Technology<br>\nGidon Ernst, LMU Munich<br>\nCaterina Urban, Inria &amp; École Normale Supérieure | PSL University</p>",
