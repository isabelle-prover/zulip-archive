Memcached is the backbone for fast response times in distributed <br>\nweb-application. The goal is not only to provide an investigation on the <br>\nserver alone, but also take the client-side and the protocol into <br>\nconsideration. The challenge covers a wide range of requirements and is <br>\ntherefore suited for different approaches and verification tools, such <br>\nas model-checking, static analysis, and deductive techniques. We welcome <br>\nall kinds of contributions from high-level specifications down to models <br>\ndown code-level analysis.</p>\n<p>Please announce your participation on the Mailing List: <br>\n<a href=\"mailto:verifythis-ltc@lists.kit.edu\">verifythis-ltc@lists.kit.edu</a> We encourage you to actively reach out for <br>\ncollaboration!</p>\n<p><strong>Next Event: </strong><br>\nWe are pleased to announce that a  full session at iFM 2023 will be <br>\ndedicated to a public discussion of the challenge. In this session, we <br>\nwill give a short overview of the Long-Term Challenge, complemented by <br>\nlightning talks to stimulate an interactive discussion to foster further <br>\nactivities. Therefore, we invite all interested researchers to join the <br>\nsession - no additional registration is necessary.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact the organizers.</p>\n<p>Gidon Ernst<br>\nAlexander Weigl</p>",
