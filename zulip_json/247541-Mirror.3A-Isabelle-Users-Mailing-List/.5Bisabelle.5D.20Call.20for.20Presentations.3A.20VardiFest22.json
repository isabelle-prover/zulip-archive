Vardi and is <br>\nintended to celebrate Vardi's pioneering contributions that have <br>\nenhanced logic's centrality in computer science.</p>\n<p>The workshop will be organized in a Highlights conference style: i.e., <br>\ncomposed of short talks and invited talks.</p>\n<p>This is a call for short talks (expected to be ~12 minutes). The <br>\nproposal should be at most one page PDF in Easychair class style <br>\n(<a href=\"https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors\">https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors</a>).</p>\n<p>Given the depth and breadth of Vardi's contributions that span across <br>\nmultiple fields of computer science and society at large, there is no <br>\ndefinite list of topics of interest. We encourage you to present a <br>\nproposal for a talk that would be of interest to Vardi be it published <br>\nor not, technical or non-technical, retrospective or crystal-ball gazing.</p>\n<p>While we may allow some remote presentations, strong preference will be <br>\ngiven to in-person presentations.</p>\n<p>====================<br>\nDATES:<br>\n====================<br>\nDeadline for Submission: May 15, 2022 AoE</p>\n<p>Notification of Acceptance: May 19, 2022 AoE</p>\n<p>Submission Site: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vardifest22\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vardifest22</a></p>\n<p>====================<br>\nORGANIZERS:<br>\n====================<br>\nGiuseppe De Giacomo (Sapienza Univ.
