EuroProofNet aims at boosting the <br>\ninteroperability and usability of proof systems. EuroProofNet is a COST <br>\naction started on November 2021 gathering more than 220 researchers from <br>\n30 different countries.</p>\n<p>The aim of working group 2 (WG 2) is to promote the output of detailed, <br>\ncheckable proofs from automated theorem provers. Work is under way for <br>\nFOL/HOL theorem provers and SMT solvers, but the expressivity of their <br>\ninput languages renders the task significantly more complicated than <br>\ne.g., in the propositional SAT world, with a higher need of coordination.</p>\n<p>A Short-Term Scientific Mission (STSM) is a research visit of an <br>\nindividual researcher from a country participating in the Action in a <br>\ndifferent country also participating in the Action. We encourage STSMs <br>\nas they are an effective way of starting and maintaining collaborations.</p>\n<p>The beneficiary of an STSM will be reimbursed only of his/her travel <br>\nexpenses plus a daily allowance depending on the host country for each <br>\nday of his/her stay, see conditions and details at <br>\n<a href=\"https://europroofnet.github.io/grants/\">https://europroofnet.github.io/grants/</a>.</p>\n<p>Deadline for applications: May 8, 2023</p>",
