It offers a<br>\nvenue for discussing problems and solutions in each of these areas and their<br>\nintegration.</p>\n<p>CICM 2024 invites submissions in all topics relating to intelligent computer<br>\nmathematics, in particular but not limited to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>theorem proving and computer algebra</li>\n<li>mathematical knowledge management</li>\n<li>digital mathematical libraries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The doctoral programme provides PhD students a forum to present early results to<br>\nreceive constructive feedback and mentoring. To attend, submissions of two-page<br>\nabstracts are expected in which the focus and research questions of the expected<br>\nPhD theses are described; details on completed research tasks and remaining<br>\nresearch plans should be given. In addition to these abstract, a two-pages CV of<br>\nthe applicant should also be submitted, detailing background information (name,<br>\nuniversity, supervisor), education (sought degree, previous degrees),<br>\nemployments and relevant research experience (publications, attended<br>\nconferences/workshops).</p>\n<p>Submission<br>\n==========<br>\nAll submissions should be made via EasyChair at<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cicm24\">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cicm24</a></p>\n<p>Important Dates<br>\n===============<br>\nSubmission deadline:           June 13, 2024<br>\nNotification of acceptance:    June 28, 2024<br>\nDoctoral Program:              August 5-9, 2024</p>\n<p>Doctoral Program Chair<br>\n======================<br>\nAdnan Rashid, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada</p>",
