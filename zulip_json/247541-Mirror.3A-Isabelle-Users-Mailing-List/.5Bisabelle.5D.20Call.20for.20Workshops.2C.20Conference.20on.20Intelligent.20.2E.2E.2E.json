CICM  brings  together the  many  separate<br>\ncommunities  that  have  developed   theoretical  and  practical  solutions  for<br>\nmathematical applications such as  computation, deduction, knowledge management,<br>\nand user interfaces. It offers a  venue for discussing problems and solutions in<br>\neach of these areas and their integration.</p>\n<p>We  are inviting  formal  submissions  of workshops  and  tutorials relating  to<br>\nintelligent computer mathematics, in particular, but not limited to</p>\n<p>* theorem proving and computer algebra<br>\n  * mathematical knowledge management<br>\n  * digital mathematical libraries<br>\nA comprehensive but  not exhausting list of  topics of interest can  be found on<br>\nthe conference website:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cicm-conference.org/2025/cicm.php?event=&amp;menu=topics\">https://cicm-conference.org/2025/cicm.php?event=&amp;menu=topics</a></p>\n<p>Workshops typically feature presentations of  ongoing research that is not ready<br>\nyet for formal publication, and tutorials present extended demos of a particular<br>\nsoftware.</p>\n<p>However, the CICM organizers strongly  encourage a broad interpretation of these<br>\nconcepts and  welcome proposals  for any  kind of event  that benefits  the CICM<br>\ncommunity.</p>\n<p>A proposal should include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>title of the event</li>\n<li>names and affiliations of the organizers</li>\n<li>brief description of the event (e.g., 1-2 paragraphs)</li>\n<li>proposed workshop duration (typically half a day up to two days)</li>\n<li>previous instances of the event (if any)</li>\n<li>preferred or excluded dates within the CICM dates (if any)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Dates<br>\n===============</p>\n<p>Proposal submission:    March 31, 2025<br>\nNotification:           April 11, 2025<br>\nConference:             October 6-11, 2025</p>\n<p>Earlier submissions are encouraged.<br>\nAll proposals should be submitted via email to <a href=\"mailto:thaynaradelima@ufg.br\">thaynaradelima@ufg.br</a><br>\nMore details on the conference are available at<br>\n<a href=\"https://cicm-conference.org/2025\">https://cicm-conference.org/2025</a></p>",
