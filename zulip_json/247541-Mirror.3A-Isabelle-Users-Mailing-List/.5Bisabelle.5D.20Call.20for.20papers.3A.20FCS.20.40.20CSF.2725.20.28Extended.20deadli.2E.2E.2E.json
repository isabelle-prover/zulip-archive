FCS is a friendly, in-person</p>\n<p>1-day workshop that brings together researchers interested in laying the</p>\n<p>foundations of secure systems.</p>\n<p>FCS welcomes papers on all topics related to the formal underpinnings of</p>\n<p>security and privacy, and their applications. The workshop has no formal</p>\n<p>proceedings: you are welcome to advertise work that appeared in other venues or</p>\n<p>submit your work-in-progress. We are seeking submissions for full-length talks</p>\n<p>and short talks.  Submissions may conform to any 2-column format accepted by</p>\n<p>IEEE, ACM, or USENIX conferences. FCS uses a light form of double-blind</p>\n<p>reviewing similar to CSF.</p>\n<p>Paper submission: April 6, 2025 (AoE).</p>\n<p>Author notification: May 1, 2025</p>\n<p>Submission website: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=fcs25\">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=fcs25</a></p>\n<p>For more information, please visit our website: <a href=\"https://fcs-workshop.github.io/fcs2025/\">https://fcs-workshop.github.io/fcs2025/</a></p>",
