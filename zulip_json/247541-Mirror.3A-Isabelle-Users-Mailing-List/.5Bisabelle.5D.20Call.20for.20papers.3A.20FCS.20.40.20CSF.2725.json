FCS is a friendly, in-person<br>\n1-day workshop that brings together researchers interested in laying the<br>\nfoundations of secure systems.</p>\n<p>FCS welcomes papers on all topics related to the formal underpinnings of<br>\nsecurity and privacy, and their applications. The workshop has no formal<br>\nproceedings: you are welcome to advertise work that appeared in other venues or<br>\nsubmit your work-in-progress. We are seeking submissions for full-length talks<br>\nand short talks.  Submissions may conform to any 2-column format accepted by<br>\nIEEE, ACM, or USENIX conferences.
