We welcome submissions on any topic<br>\nrelated to Artificial Intelligence.</p>\n<p>Workshops typically provide a forum for presenting ongoing research that is<br>\nnot yet ready for formal publication, while tutorials may, for example,<br>\noffer in-depth introductions to specific topics or extended demonstrations<br>\nof software tools.</p>\n<p>We are especially interested in workshops that explore the intersection of<br>\nstatistical and symbolic AI—a rapidly growing area of research that seeks<br>\nto combine the strengths of data-driven machine learning approaches with<br>\nthe rigor, structure, and interpretability of logic-based reasoning. We<br>\nparticularly encourage proposals that aim to bridge communities and foster<br>\ndialogue between researchers working in machine learning, knowledge<br>\nrepresentation, logic, and cognitive systems, in line with JELIA’s<br>\nlongstanding mission to promote foundational and applied research in<br>\nlogical aspects of AI.</p>\n<p>If you are considering organizing a workshop or tutorial, please feel free<br>\nto reach out to me by email (<a href=\"mailto:bdundua@gmail.com\">bdundua@gmail.com</a>) as soon as possible.</p>",
