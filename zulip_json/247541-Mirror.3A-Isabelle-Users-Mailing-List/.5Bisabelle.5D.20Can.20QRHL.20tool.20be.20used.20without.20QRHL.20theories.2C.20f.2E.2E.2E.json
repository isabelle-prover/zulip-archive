After some trial-and-error efforts I have came up with the followint ROOT content:</p>\n<p>chapter Algo</p>\n<p>session QRHL = Pure +<br>\n  description \"<br>\n    Classical Higher-order Logic.<br>\n  \"<br>\n  document_files<br>\n    \"Max_Of_Two_Integers_Real\"</p>\n<p>So, there are no references to QRH (especially - not for Extra theories).</p>\n<p>Is it OK that QRHL tool asks me to provide theories for those QRHL extra theories? Is the integration to QRHL so tight? I have error messages:</p>\n<p>*** Building Isabelle (may take a while, especially the first time, e.g., 20-60min)...<br>\nException in thread \"main\" qrhl.UserException: (in Isabelle) No such file: \"/cygdrive/c/Workspace-IntelliJ/qrhl-tool/Conjugate.thy\"<br>\nThe error(s) above occurred for theory \"Jordan_Normal_Form.Conjugate\" (line 3 of \"/cygdrive/c/Workspace-IntelliJ/qrhl-tool/Extra_Infinite_Set_Sum.thy\")<br>\n(required by \"QRHL.QRHL_Operations\" via \"QRHL.QRHL_Core\" via \"QRHL.BOLegacy\" via \"Tensor_Product.Tensor_Product_Code\" via \"Tensor_Product.Tensor_Product\" via \"Bounded_Operators.Complex_L2\" via \"Bounded_Operators-Extra.Extra_Infinite_Set_Sum\")<br>\nat qrhl.UserException$.apply(State.scala:50)</p>\n<p>And another thing. My qrhl-tool.conf file is:</p>\n<h1>isabelle-home = /opt/Isabelle2021</h1>\n<p>isabelle-home = C:\\Homes\\Isabelle2020\\Isabelle2020</p>\n<p>My project directory for the qrhl-tool is:<br>\nC:\\Workspace-IntelliJ\\qrhl-tool</p>\n<p>And - as one can see from the error message - Isabelle is seeking theories in the C:\\Workspace-IntelliJ\\qrhl-tool directory and not in its own source directories (C:\\Homes\\Isabelle2020\\Isabelle2020\\src). Temporary solution is to copy thy files manually when some file is required by the build error message, but when QRHL specific theories are involved then this copying is too much.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!<br>\nAlex</p>",
