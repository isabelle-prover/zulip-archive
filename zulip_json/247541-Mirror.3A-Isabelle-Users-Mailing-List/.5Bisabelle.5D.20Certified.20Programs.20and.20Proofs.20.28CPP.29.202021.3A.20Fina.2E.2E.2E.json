CPP spans areas of computer science, mathematics, logic, and<br>\neducation.</p>\n<p>CPP 2021 (<a href=\"https://popl21.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2021\">https://popl21.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2021</a>) will be held on<br>\n18-19 January 2021 and will be co-located with POPL 2021. CPP 2021 is<br>\nsponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGLOG.</p>\n<p>NEWS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CPP 2021 will feature Distinguished Paper Awards.</li>\n<li>\n<p>CPP 2021 will take place on January 18-19, 2021 as a virtual or<br>\nhybrid physical-virtual meeting. This means that the authors will be<br>\nable to present their papers online. The POPL and CPP organizers are<br>\nmonitoring the COVID-19 situation, and in September/October they will<br>\nmake an announcement on whether there will also be a physical meeting<br>\nin Copenhagen; but irrespective of that decision, the online paper<br>\npresentation option will be guaranteed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The submission deadline is one month earlier than usual.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract Deadline: 16 September 2020 at 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h)</li>\n<li>Paper Submission Deadline: 22 September 2020 at 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h)</li>\n<li>Notification: 24 November 2020</li>\n<li>Camera Ready Deadline: 15 December 2020</li>\n<li>Conference: 18-19 January 2021</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deadlines expire at the end of the day, anywhere on earth. Abstract<br>\nand submission deadlines are strict and there will be no extensions.</p>\n<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST</p>\n<p>We welcome submissions in research areas related to formal<br>\ncertification of programs and proofs. The following is a<br>\nnon-exhaustive list of topics of interest to CPP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>certified or certifying programming, compilation, linking, OS<br>\nkernels, runtime systems, security monitors, and hardware;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>certified mathematical libraries and mathematical theorems;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>proof assistants (e.g, ACL2, Agda, Coq, Dafny, F*, HOL4, HOL Light,<br>\nIdris, Isabelle, Lean, Mizar, Nuprl, PVS, etc);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>new languages and tools for certified programming;</p>\n</li>\n<li>program analysis, program verification, and program synthesis;</li>\n<li>program logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code;</li>\n<li>logics for certifying concurrent and distributed systems;</li>\n<li>\n<p>mechanized metatheory, formalized programming language semantics,<br>\nand logical frameworks;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>higher-order logics, dependent type theory, proof theory, logical<br>\nsystems, separation logics, and logics for security;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>verification of correctness and security properties;</p>\n</li>\n<li>formally verified blockchains and smart contracts;</li>\n<li>\n<p>certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra,<br>\npolynomial systems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of interest;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality,<br>\nfirst-order logic, and higher-order unification;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>certificates for program termination;</p>\n</li>\n<li>formal models of computation;</li>\n<li>mechanized (un)decidability and computational complexity proofs;</li>\n<li>formally certified methods for induction and coinduction;</li>\n<li>integration of interactive and automated provers;</li>\n<li>logical foundations of proof assistants;</li>\n<li>applications of AI and machine learning to formal certification;</li>\n<li>user interfaces for proof assistants and theorem provers;</li>\n<li>teaching mathematics and computer science with proof assistants.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DISTINGUISHED PAPER AWARDS</p>\n<p>Around 10% of the accepted papers at CPP 2021 will be designated as<br>\nDistinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the CPP<br>\nprogram committee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to<br>\ntheir relevance, originality, significance and clarity.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>\n<p>Prior to the paper submission deadline, the authors should upload<br>\ntheir anonymized paper in PDF format through the HotCRP system at<br>\n<a href=\"https://cpp2021.hotcrp.com\">https://cpp2021.hotcrp.com</a></p>\n<p>The submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient<br>\ndetail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the<br>\ncontribution. They must be formatted following the ACM SIGPLAN<br>\nProceedings format (<a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/\">http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/</a>) using<br>\nthe acmart style with the sigplan option, which provides a two-column<br>\nstyle, using 10 point font for the main text, and a header for double<br>\nblind review submission, i.e.,</p>\n<p>\\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,anonymous,review]{acmart}\\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}</p>\n<p>The submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages, including tables and<br>\nfigures, but excluding bibliography and clearly marked appendices. The<br>\npapers should be self-contained without the appendices. Shorter papers<br>\nare welcome and will be given equal consideration. Submissions not<br>\nconforming to the requirements concerning format and maximum length<br>\nmay be rejected without further consideration.</p>\n<p>CPP 2021 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. To<br>\nfacilitate this, the submissions must adhere to two rules:<br>\n(1) author names and institutions must be omitted, and<br>\n(2) references to authors' own related work should be in the third<br>\nperson (e.g., not \"We build on our previous work ...\" but rather â€œWe<br>\nbuild on the work of ...\").</p>\n<p>The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers<br>\ncome to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make<br>\nit impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try.<br>\nNothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the<br>\nsubmission or makes the job of reviewing it more difficult. In<br>\nparticular, important background references should not be omitted or<br>\nanonymized. In addition, authors are free to disseminate their ideas<br>\nor draft versions of their papers as usual. For example, authors may<br>\npost drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research<br>\nideas. POPL has answers to frequently asked questions addressing many<br>\ncommon concerns:<br>\n<a href=\"https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ\">https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ</a></p>\n<p>We encourage the authors to provide any supplementary material that is<br>\nrequired to support the claims made in the paper, such as proof<br>\nscripts or experimental data. This material must be uploaded at<br>\nsubmission time, as an archive, not via a URL. Two forms of<br>\nsupplementary material may be submitted:<br>\n(1) Anonymous supplementary material is made available to the<br>\nreviewers before they submit their first-draft reviews.<br>\n(2) Non-anonymous supplementary material is made available to the<br>\nreviewers after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have<br>\nlearned the identity of the authors.</p>\n<p>Please use anonymous supplementary material whenever possible, so that<br>\nit can be taken into account from the beginning of the reviewing<br>\nprocess.</p>\n<p>The submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy<br>\n(<a href=\"https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/\">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/</a>) and the<br>\nACM Policy on Plagiarism<br>\n(<a href=\"https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism\">https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism</a>). Concurrent<br>\nsubmissions to other conferences, journals, workshops with<br>\nproceedings, or similar forums of publication are not allowed. The PC<br>\nchairs should be informed of closely related work submitted to a<br>\nconference or journal in advance of submission.</p>\n<p>One author of each accepted paper is expected to present it at the<br>\n(totally or partly virtual) conference.</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION, COPYRIGHT AND OPEN ACCESS</p>\n<p>The limit for the camera-ready version is 14 pages, excluding the<br>\nbibliography (so 2 pages extra compared with the submission).</p>\n<p>The CPP proceedings will be published by the ACM, and authors of<br>\naccepted papers will be required to choose one of the following<br>\npublication options:<br>\n(1) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a<br>\nnon-exclusive permission-to-publish license and, optionally, licenses<br>\nthe work under a Creative Commons license.<br>\n(2) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive<br>\npermission-to-publish license.<br>\n(3) Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.</p>\n<p>For authors who can afford it, we recommend option 1, which will make<br>\nthe paper Gold Open Access, and also encourage such authors to license<br>\ntheir work under the CC-BY license. ACM will charge you an article<br>\nprocessing fee for this option (currently, US$700), which you have to<br>\npay directly with the ACM.</p>\n<p>For everyone else, we recommend option (2), which is free and allows<br>\nyou to achieve Green Open Access, by uploading a preprint of your<br>\npaper to a repository that guarantees permanent archival such as arXiv<br>\n(<a href=\"https://arxiv.org\">https://arxiv.org</a>) or HAL (<a href=\"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\">https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr</a>). This is<br>\nanyway a good idea for timely dissemination even if you chose option<br>\n(1). Ensuring timely dissemination is particularly important for this<br>\nedition, since, because of the very tight schedule, the official<br>\nproceedings might not be available in time for CPP.</p>\n<p>The official CPP 2021 proceedings will also be available via SIGPLAN<br>\nOpenTOC (<a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp\">http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp</a>).</p>\n<p>For ACM's take on this, see their Copyright Policy<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy\">http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy</a>) and Author<br>\nRights (<a href=\"http://authors.acm.org/main.html\">http://authors.acm.org/main.html</a>).</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>CÄƒtÄƒlin HriÅ£cu, MPI-SP, Germany (co-chair)<br>\nAndrei Popescu, University of Sheffield, UK (co-chair)<br>\nReynald Affeldt, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and<br>\nTechnology (AIST), Japan<br>\nJune Andronick, CSIRO's Data61 and UNSW, Australia<br>\nArthur Azevedo de Amorim, Carnegie Mellon University, USA<br>\nJoachim Breitner, DFINITY Foundation, Germany<br>\nJesper Cockx, TU Delft, Netherlands<br>\nCyril Cohen, UniversitÃ© CÃ´te dâ€™Azur, Inria, France<br>\nNils Anders Danielsson, University of Gothenburg / Chalmers University<br>\nof Technology, Sweden<br>\nBrijesh Dongol, University of Surrey, UK<br>\nFloris van Doorn, University of Pittsburgh, USA<br>\nYannick Forster, Saarland University, Germany<br>\nShilpi Goel, Centaur Technology, Inc., USA<br>\nChung-Kil Hur, Seoul National University, South Korea<br>\nMoa Johansson, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden<br>\nEkaterina Komendantskaya, Heriot-Watt University, UK<br>\nAngeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki, University of Cambridge, UK<br>\nRobert Y.
