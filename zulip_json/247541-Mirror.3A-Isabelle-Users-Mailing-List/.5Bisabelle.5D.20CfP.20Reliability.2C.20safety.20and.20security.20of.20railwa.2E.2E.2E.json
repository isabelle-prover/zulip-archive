Railway systems are<br>\nnow being integrated into larger multi-transport networks. Such systems require<br>\nan even higher degree of automation at all levels of operation. These trends<br>\ndramatically increase the complexity of railway applications and pose new<br>\nchallenges in developing novel methods of modelling, analysis, verification<br>\nand validation to ensure their reliability, safety and security, as well as in<br>\nsupporting novel mechanisms and procedures to help make the case that<br>\ndevelopment processes meet the mandated standards.</p>\n<p>This conference will bring together researchers and developers working on railway<br>\nsystem reliability, security and safety to discuss how all of these requirements<br>\ncan be met in an integrated way. It is also vital to ensure that advances in<br>\nresearch (in both academia and industry) are driven by the real industrial needs.<br>\nThis will help ensure that such advances are followed by effective industrial<br>\ndeployment. Another particularly important objective is to integrate advances<br>\nin research into the current development processes, and make them usable and<br>\nscalable. Finally, a key goal is to develop advanced methods and tools that<br>\ncan ensure that the systems meet the requirements imposed by the regulatory<br>\nstandards and help in building the supportive arguments. This will be a<br>\nworking conference in which research challenges and progress will be<br>\ndiscussed and evaluated by both researchers and engineers, focusing on<br>\ntheir potential to be deployed in industrial settings.</p>\n<p>Topics of particular interest include:<br>\n• Safety in development processes and safety management<br>\n• Combined approaches to safety and security<br>\n• System and software safety analysis<br>\n• Formal modelling and verification techniques<br>\n• System reliability<br>\n• Validation according to the standards<br>\n• Safety and security argumentation<br>\n• Fault and intrusion modelling and analysis<br>\n• Evaluation of system capacity, energy consumption, cost and their interplay<br>\n• Tool and model integration, tool chain<br>\n• Domain-specific languages and modelling frameworks<br>\n• Model reuse for reliability, safety and security<br>\n• Modelling for maintenance strategy engineering.</p>\n<p>The conference offers different options for presenting research:<br>\n• Regular conference papers of 16 pages<br>\n• Industrial conference papers of 10 pages, providing real-life feedback<br>\n• Student conference papers of 10 pages, showcasing novel ideas and<br>\n        early research results<br>\n• Poster presentation, not to be accompanied by a full paper, however<br>\n        the abstract will be published on the website<br>\n• Tutorials to be offered in the first day (in total 4 tutorials a 90 minute in<br>\n        two parallel sessions).</p>\n<p>The important dates:<br>\n• April 28, 2023: abstract submission for all papers; abstract submission for tutorials<br>\n• May 5, 2023: full paper submission<br>\n• June 16, 2023: Notification<br>\n• July 14, 2023 camera-ready papers submitted<br>\n• July 14, 2023 abstract submission for posters</p>\n<p>The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series.<br>\nThe conference submission will be via<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.tu.berlin/bbi/rssr2023\">https://www.tu.berlin/bbi/rssr2023</a><br>\nSubmissions must be formatted in the Springer LNCS format<br>\n[details see <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0&lt;http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0\">www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0&lt;http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0</a>&gt; ].</p>\n<p>Conference Chairs:<br>\n• Simon Collart-Dutilleul, Université Gustave Eiffel, France<br>\n• Thierry Lecomte, CLEARSY, France<br>\n• Birgit Milius, TU Berlin, Germany</p>\n<p>PC members (to be confirmed):<br>\n• Abderrahim Ait Wakrime, University Mohammed V, FSR, Morocco<br>\n• Alessandro Fantechi, University of Florence, Italy<br>\n• Alexander Romanovsky, Newcastle University, UK<br>\n• Alexei Iliasov, The Formal Route, UK<br>\n• Aryldo Russo, CERTIFER, France<br>\n• Barbara Gallina, Mälardalen University, Sweden<br>\n• Bas Luttik, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands<br>\n• Carlo Becheri, Alstom, Italy<br>\n• Christophe Ponsard, Cetic , Belgium<br>\n• David Bonvoisin, RATP, France<br>\n• Elena Troubitsyna, univ Stokholm, Sweden<br>\n• Etienne Prun, ClearSy, France<br>\n• Fabien Belmonte, Alstom, France<br>\n• Peter Popov, City University, UK<br>\n• Sana Debbech, IRT Railenium, France<br>\n• Stefano Tonetta, FBK-irst, Italy<br>\n• Fares Chucri, SNCF, France<br>\n• Francesco Flammini, Linnaeus Univ., Sweden<br>\n• Frank Golatowski, Univ. of Rostock, Germany<br>\n• Hironobu Kuruma, Hitachi, Japan<br>\n• Jan Peleska, Verified Systems Int., Germany<br>\n• Jens Braband, Siemens, Germany<br>\n• Anne Haxthausen (Technical University of Denmark)<br>\n• Kenji Taguchi, CAV Technologies, Japan<br>\n• Klaus Reichl, Thales, Austria<br>\n• Laurent Voisin, Systerel, France<br>\n• Mariëlle Stoelinga, Univ. of Twente, Netherlands<br>\n• Mario Gleirscher, University of Bremen, Germany<br>\n• Maurice ter Beek, ISTI, CNR, Pisa, Italy<br>\n• Michael Leuschel, Univ. of Düsseldorf, Germany<br>\n• Nadia Chouchani, IRT Railenium, France</p>",
