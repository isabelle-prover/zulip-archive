The forum<br>\nrepresents an opportunity to interact with different communities sharing<br>\nan interest in applied computing.</p>\n<p>SAC 2023 is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied<br>\nComputing (SIGAPP), and will take place on March 27-31, 2023 in<br>\nTallinn, Estonia.</p>\n<p>==== Software Verification and Testing Track (SVT) ====</p>\n<p>The Software Verification and Testing track aims at contributing to the<br>\nchallenge of improving the usability of formal methods in software<br>\nengineering. The track covers areas such as formal methods for<br>\nverification and testing, based on theorem proving, model checking,<br>\nstatic analysis, and run-time verification. We invite authors to submit<br>\nnew results in formal verification and testing, as well as development<br>\nof technologies to improve the usability of formal methods in software<br>\nengineering. Also are welcome detailed descriptions of applications of<br>\nmechanical verification to large scale software.</p>\n<p>==== Topics ====</p>\n<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>model checking</li>\n<li>theorem proving</li>\n<li>correct by construction development</li>\n<li>model-based testing</li>\n<li>software testing</li>\n<li>symbolic execution</li>\n<li>static and dynamic analysis</li>\n<li>abstract interpretation</li>\n<li>analysis methods for dependable systems</li>\n<li>software certification and proof carrying code</li>\n<li>fault diagnosis and debugging</li>\n<li>verification and validation of large scale software systems</li>\n<li>\n<p>real world applications and case studies applying software testing<br>\n  and verification</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>benchmarks and data sets for software testing and verification</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>==== Submission Guidelines ====</p>\n<p>Paper submissions must report on original, unpublished work. Submitted<br>\npapers will undergo a double-blind review process.  Author(s) name(s)<br>\nand address(es) must not appear in the body of the paper, and self-<br>\nreference should be avoided and made in the third person. We welcome<br>\nresearch papers and posters. Research papers should have at most 8<br>\ntwo-column pages in ACM format (further two pages, to a total of 10<br>\npages, may be available at a charge). The length of a poster is limited<br>\nto three pages (one extra page may be available at a charge). Please<br>\ncomply to this page limitation already at submission time.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in the context of the Student Research Competition (SRC)<br>\nProgram to provide graduate students the opportunity to meet and<br>\nexchange ideas with researchers and practitioners in their areas of<br>\ninterest, graduate students are invited to submit research abstracts<br>\n(maximum of 4 pages in ACM camera-ready format) following the<br>\ninstructions published at the SAC 2023 website at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2023/authorkit/ACM_SigConf-SRC2023.pdf\">https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2023/authorkit/ACM_SigConf-SRC2023.pdf</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2023/authorkit/ACM_SigConf-SRC2023.pdf\">https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2023/authorkit/ACM_SigConf-SRC2023.pdf</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed.</p>\n<p>Accepted papers will be published in the ACM SAC 2023 proceedings in the<br>\nACM digital library. Paper registration is required, allowing the<br>\ninclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author<br>\nor a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement<br>\nfor the paper/poster to be included in the ACM digital library. No-show<br>\nof registered papers and posters will result in excluding them from the<br>\nACM digital library.</p>\n<p>Detailed submission instructions are available on the SAC 2023<br>\nwebsite. </p>\n<p>==== Track Chairs ====</p>\n<p>Georgiana Caltais, University of Twente, The Netherlands<br>\nPascale Le Gall, CentraleSupélec, Université Paris-Saclay, France</p>\n<p>For  further information we refer to the SAC-SVT 2023 website:<br>\n<a href=\"http://logimics.mics.centralesupelec.fr/en/SAC-SVT-2023\">http://logimics.mics.centralesupelec.fr/en/SAC-SVT-2023</a> &lt;<a href=\"http://logimics.mics.centralesupelec.fr/en/SAC-SVT-2023\">http://logimics.mics.centralesupelec.fr/en/SAC-SVT-2023</a>&gt;</p>",
