In particular, newer standards, such as DO-178C<br>\n(avionics), ISO 26262 (automotive systems), IEC 62304 (medical<br>\ndevices), and CENELEC EN 50128 (railway systems), emphasize the need<br>\nfor formal methods and model-based development, thereby speeding up<br>\nthe adaptation of such methods in industry.</p>\n<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and engineers<br>\nwho are interested in the application of formal and semi-formal methods<br>\nto improve the quality of safety-critical computer systems. FTSCS<br>\nstrives to promote research and development of formal methods and<br>\ntools for industrial applications, and is particularly interested in<br>\nindustrial applications of formal methods. </p>\n<p>Specific topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>case studies and experience reports on the use of formal methods for<br>\n  analyzing safety-critical systems, including avionics, automotive,<br>\n  medical, railway, and other kinds of safety-critical and<br>\n  QoS-critical systems </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>methods, techniques and tools to support automated analysis,<br>\n  certification, debugging, etc., of safety/QoS-critical systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>analysis methods that address the limitations of formal methods in<br>\n  industry (usability, scalability, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>formal analysis support for modeling languages used in industry,<br>\n  such as AADL, Ptolemy, SysML, SCADE, Modelica, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>code generation from validated models.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The workshop will provide a platform for discussions and the exchange of<br>\ninnovative ideas, so submissions on work in progress are encouraged.</p>\n<p>Submission:</p>\n<p>We solicit submissions reporting on:</p>\n<p>A- original research contributions (10 pages max, ACM format);<br>\nB- applications and experiences (10 pages max, ACM format);<br>\nC- surveys, comparisons, and state-of-the-art reports (10 pages max, ACM);<br>\nD- tool papers (5 pages max, ACM format);<br>\nE- position papers and work in progress (5 pages max, ACM format)</p>\n<p>related to the topics mentioned above.<br>\n(The page limits do not include the references.)</p>\n<p>All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted<br>\nconcurrently for publication elsewhere.
