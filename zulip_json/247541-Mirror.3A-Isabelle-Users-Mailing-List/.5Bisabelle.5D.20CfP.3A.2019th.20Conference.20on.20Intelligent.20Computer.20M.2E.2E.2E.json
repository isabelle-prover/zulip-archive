CICM brings together the<br>\nmany separate communities that have developed theoretical and practical <br>\nsolutions for mathematical applications such as computation, deduction,<br>\nknowledge management, and user interfaces. It offers a venue for<br>\ndiscussing problems and solutions in each of these areas and their<br>\nintegration.</p>\n<p>CICM covers a broad range of areas of interest including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formal mathematics</li>\n<li>Interactive theorem proving</li>\n<li>Automated theorem proving</li>\n<li>Proof systems</li>\n<li>Logical and mathematical languages for mathematical assistant systems</li>\n<li>Mathematical foundations for computer mathematics</li>\n<li>Type theory and homotopy type theory</li>\n<li>AI and LLMs in mathematics</li>\n<li>Formalization of mathematical theories</li>\n<li>Computer algebra systems</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of proof assistants, theorem provers, machine learning systems, <br>\n  computer algebra systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intelligent computer mathematics in teaching</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>as well as the traditional track topics previously associated with MKM <br>\n(Mathematical Knowledge Management), CALCULEMUS, and DML (Digital<br>\nMathematical Libraries).</p>\n<p>In all of the above areas and beyond the CICM conference welcomes <br>\ndescriptions of non-trivial relevant undertakings including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementations, new components or features of existing tools</li>\n<li>Exchanges of knowledge and collaborations across communities</li>\n<li>Integrations of existing solutions</li>\n<li>Case studies, evaluations and benchmarks</li>\n<li>Open challenges and unsolved practical problems</li>\n<li>Experience reports regarding large or particularly difficult results</li>\n<li>Surveys and comparisons</li>\n<li>Historic overviews, current trends, and future challenges</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The program committee is chaired by </p>\n<p>Adam Naumowicz (University of Bialystok, Poland) and <br>\nMartina Seidl (JKU Linz, Austria)</p>\n<p><strong>* Formal Paper Submissions </strong>*</p>\n<p>Formal submissions in one of the following categories will be <br>\nreviewed rigorously and accepted papers will be published in a <br>\nvolume of Springer LNAI (confirmed):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>regular papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography) <br>\n  present novel research results</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>project and survey papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography) <br>\n  summarize/evaluate/compare existing results from the literature<br>\n  or summarize the overall findings from completed research projects</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>system and dataset descriptions (4 to 5 pages + bibliography)<br>\n  present digital artifacts</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, we invite work-in-progress (presentation-only) papers describing<br>\nongoing research (2 pages plus bibliography). These submissions will undergo<br>\na light-weight review process and will not appear in the Springer proceedings,<br>\nalthough they may be published jointly with the workshop proceedings. PhD <br>\nstudents are particularly encouraged to present early-stage work in order <br>\nto receive constructive feedback and mentoring. Accepted presentation-only <br>\npapers will be showcased in a dedicated presentation session as well as a <br>\nposter session.</p>\n<p><strong>* Important Dates </strong>*</p>\n<p>Formal submissions</p>\n<p>- Abstract deadline:          March 25, 2026 <br>\n  - Full paper deadline:        April 1, 2026<br>\n  - Reviews sent to authors:    May 22, 2026  <br>\n  - Rebuttals due:              May 27, 2026<br>\n  - Notification of acceptance: June 10, 2026<br>\n  - Camera-ready copies due:    July 1, 2026<br>\n  - Conference:                 Sept 21 - Sept 25, 2026</p>\n<p>Presentation-only Papers</p>\n<p>- Submission deadline:                June 15, 2026</p>\n<p><strong>* Submissions </strong>*   </p>\n<p>All formal submissions should be made via EasyChair at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2026https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2026\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2026https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2026</a></p>\n<p>using the Springer LNCS style files<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelineshttps://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelineshttps://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a></p>\n<p>If software or data is relevant to the paper, a link that provides access <br>\nto the software/data must be provided to enable reproduction of results.</p>\n<p><strong>* Best Papers </strong>*</p>\n<p>CICM 2026 honors the best paper, selected through reviewer assessment <br>\nand program committee discussions, with an award.</p>",
