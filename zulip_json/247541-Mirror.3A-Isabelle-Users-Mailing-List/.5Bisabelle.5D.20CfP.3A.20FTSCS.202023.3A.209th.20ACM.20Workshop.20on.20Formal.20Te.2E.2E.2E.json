In particular, newer standards, such as DO-178C<br>\n(avionics), ISO 26262 (automotive systems), IEC 62304 (medical<br>\ndevices), and CENELEC EN 50128 (railway systems), emphasize the need<br>\nfor formal methods and model-based development, thereby speeding up<br>\nthe adaptation of such methods in industry.</p>\n<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and engineers<br>\nwho are interested in the application of formal and semi-formal methods<br>\nto improve the quality of safety-critical computer systems. FTSCS<br>\nstrives to promote research and development of formal methods and<br>\ntools for industrial applications, and is particularly interested in<br>\nindustrial applications of formal methods. </p>\n<p>Specific topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>case studies and experience reports on the use of formal methods for<br>\n  analyzing safety-critical systems, including avionics, automotive,<br>\n  medical, railway, and other kinds of safety-critical and<br>\n  QoS-critical systems </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>methods, techniques and tools to support automated analysis,<br>\n  certification, debugging, etc., of safety/QoS-critical systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>analysis methods that address the limitations of formal methods in<br>\n  industry (usability, scalability, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>formal analysis support for modeling languages used in industry,<br>\n  such as AADL, Ptolemy, SysML, SCADE, Modelica, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>code generation from validated models.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The workshop will provide a platform for discussions and the exchange of<br>\ninnovative ideas, so submissions on work in progress are encouraged.</p>\n<p>Submission:</p>\n<p>We solicit submissions reporting on:</p>\n<p>A- original research contributions (10 pages max, ACM format);<br>\nB- applications and experiences (10 pages max, ACM format);<br>\nC- surveys, comparisons, and state-of-the-art reports (10 pages max, ACM);<br>\nD- tool papers (5 pages max, ACM format);<br>\nE- position papers and work in progress (5 pages max, ACM format)</p>\n<p>related to the topics mentioned above.<br>\n(The page limits do not include the references.) KTH currently does<br>\nnot allow collaboration with Russia or Belarus. We therefore cannot<br>\naccept papers with affiliation in Russia or Belarus. </p>\n<p>All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted<br>\nconcurrently for publication elsewhere. Paper submission is done<br>\nvia HotCRP at <a href=\"https://ftscs23.hotcrp.com/\">https://ftscs23.hotcrp.com/</a>.<br>\nSubmissions should be prepared in LaTeX, adhering to<br>\nthe ACM format available at<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template\">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a> using the<br>\n\"sigplan\" option. </p>\n<p>Publication:</p>\n<p>All accepted papers will appear in the pre-proceedings of FTSCS 2023.<br>\nAccepted papers in the categories A-D above will appear in the<br>\nworkshop proceedings that will be published as a volume in<br>\nthe ACM Digital Library.</p>\n<p>As usual, we plan to invite authors of selected accepted papers to<br>\nsubmit extended versions of their papers to a special issue of the<br>\nScience of Computer Programming journal (to be confirmed).</p>\n<p>Important dates:</p>\n<p>Submission deadline: July 12, 2023<br>\nNotification of acceptance: August 27, 2023<br>\nCamera ready paper due: September 10, 2023 <br>\nWorkshop: October 22, 2023</p>\n<p>Venue:</p>\n<p>Cascais, Portugal</p>\n<p>Program chairs:</p>\n<p>Cyrille Artho        KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden<br>\nPeter Olveczky       University of Oslo, Norway</p>\n<p>Program committee:</p>\n<p>Etienne Andre        University Sorbonne Paris Nord, France<br>\nCyrille Artho        KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden<br>\nKyungmin Bae         Pohang University of Science and Technology, Korea<br>\nArmin Biere          Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Germany<br>\nPatricia Derler      Zoox, USA<br>\nAlessandro Fantechi  University of Florence, Italy<br>\nMarie Farrell        University of Manchester, UK<br>\nOsman Hasan          National University of Sciences &amp; Technology, Pakistan<br>\nEduard Kamburjan     University of Oslo, Norway<br>\nAlexander Knapp      University of Augsburg, Germany<br>\nYi Li                Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>\nFrederic Mallet      University of Cote d'Azur, France<br>\nLina Marsso          University of Toronto, Canada<br>\nThomas Noll          RWTH Aachen University, Germany<br>\nKazuhiro Ogata       Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Japan<br>\nCarlos Olarte        University Sorbonne Paris Nord, France<br>\nPeter Olveczky       University of Oslo, Norway<br>\nLaure Petrucci       University Sorbonne Paris Nord, France<br>\nJose Proenca         CISTER Research Centre, Portugal<br>\nCristina Seceleanu   Malardalen University, Sweden<br>\nSofiene Tahar        Concordia University, Canada<br>\nCarolyn Talcott      SRI International, USA<br>\nHuibiao Zhu          East China Normal University, China</p>",
