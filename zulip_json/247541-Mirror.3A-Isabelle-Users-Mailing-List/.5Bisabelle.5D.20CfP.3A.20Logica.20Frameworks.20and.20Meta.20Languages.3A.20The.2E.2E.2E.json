Their<br>\ndesign, implementation and their use in reasoning tasks, ranging from<br>\nthe correctness of software to the properties of formal systems,<br>\nhave been the focus of considerable research over the last two decades.<br>\nThis workshop will bring together designers, implementors and<br>\npractitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and<br>\nutility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable<br>\nbinding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the<br>\nexpressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning process.</p>\n<p>LFMTP 2024 will provide researchers a forum to present state-of-the-art<br>\ntechniques and discuss progress in areas such as the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Design, Analysis, Implementation, Evaluation, and Application of<br>\nlogical frameworks like LF, Abella, Beluga, ELPI, Hybrid, lambdaPi, or<br>\nMMT</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encoding and reasoning about the theory of programming languages,<br>\n  logical systems, type theories, and similar formal systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable<br>\n  binding such as higher-order abstract syntax, nominal logic, explicit<br>\nsubstituations, or binding signatures</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Representation and reasoning about features of logics and languages<br>\nlike equality, inductive and co-inductive definitions, inductive types<br>\nof higher dimension, universes, as well as associated reasoning<br>\ntechniques</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Frontiers of logical frameworks such as canonical and substructural<br>\nframeworks, contextual frameworks, functional programming over logical<br>\nframeworks, or homotopy and cubical type theory</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logical framework-based tools and services such as theorem proving,<br>\nsearch tools, or IDEs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two-level languages to program and reason over logics like tactic<br>\nlanguages, reflection, or meta-programming in interactive provers such<br>\nas LTac, ELPI, MetaCoq, Isabelle, and Lean's meta-programming),<br>\nincluding implementation and use cases</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Graphical languages for building proofs, applications in geometry,<br>\nequational reasoning and category theory.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Important Dates</h2>\n<p>Abstract submission deadline: April 29<br>\nPaper submission deadline:    May    6<br>\nNotification to authors:      June   3<br>\nFinal version due:            June  13<br>\nWorkshop:                     July   8</p>\n<h2>Submission and Proceedings</h2>\n<p>We solicit regular papers of up to 15 pages (including references).<br>\nThese must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another<br>\nvenue.
