SCML-2026 provides ample<br>\nspace to exchange ideas and discuss recent approaches in this newly<br>\nemerging research field. It presents, in particular, plenty of<br>\nopportunities to discuss new research projects, form project consortia,<br>\nand identify funding programs in this area.</p>\n<p>SCML-2026 is a \"presentation-oriented\" conference that solicits<br>\nsubmissions in the form of extended abstracts (1-2 pages) which are only<br>\nbriefly reviewed with respect to their relevance to the topics of the<br>\nconference. The abstracts of accepted presentations are collectively<br>\npublished as a \"conference booklet\" in the frame of the SCML publication<br>\nforum. At least one author of an accepted abstract is required to<br>\nregister as a presenter at the conference.</p>\n<p>CALL FOR FULL PAPERS</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we explicitly encourage the SCML-2026 authors to also<br>\nsubmit full papers related to their presentations to the</p>\n<p>SCML Publishing Forum<br>\n<a href=\"https://scml.risc.jku.at/\">https://scml.risc.jku.at/</a></p>\n<p>where they are refereed according to the rules of the forum and, if<br>\naccepted, published there. According to the \"continuous call for papers\"<br>\nof the SCML publishing forum, papers can be submitted at any time before<br>\nor after the conference (without deadline). However, the acceptance of a<br>\npresentation at the SCML-2026 conference does not depend on the<br>\nacceptance of a paper at the SCML publishing forum. On the other hand,<br>\nif a paper accepted for the SCML publication forum is already presented<br>\nat the SCML-2026 conference, we waive its presentation at a later SCML<br>\nvirtual workshop.</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>Examples of topics in the scope of SCML-2026 are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Applying ML to computer mathematics, algebra, geometry;<br>\n   integrating ML into mathematical software systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying ML to automated reasoning, theorem proving, satisfiability<br>\n   solving; integrating ML into interactive and automated provers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying ML to the synthesis of programs (\"vibe coding\") and their<br>\n   verification; integrating ML into program verification systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying SC to analyzing ML models (\"explainable AI\"), deriving error<br>\n   bounds, ensuring robustness, interpreting answers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying SC to verifying ML models (\"verified AI\"), preventing errors<br>\n   and hallucinations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying SC to synthesizing ML models with guaranteed error bounds,<br>\n   robustness, correctness properties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integrating SC capabilities (such as computer algebra and automated<br>\n   reasoning) into ML models.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying LLMs to the automatic formalization of<br>\n   mathematical/logical texts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying LLMs as natural language interfaces to SC systems,<br>\n   integrating co-pilots into SC systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combining linguistic reasoning (LLMs) and formal reasoning<br>\n   (theorem provers).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combining LLMs and SC systems for education.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Teaching (for example, in mathematics) using a combination of<br>\n   SC and ML systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Software and system descriptions, datasets, benchmarks, and<br>\n   metrics related to the interplay of SC and ML.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All in all, we consider submissions that explore the interaction between<br>\nthe two fields of SC and ML - not standalone works on either SC or ML.</p>\n<p>DATES</p>\n<p>December 15, 2025: Opening of submissions<br>\nMarch 2, 2025:     Opening of registrations<br>\nApril 27, 2026:    DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF EXTENDED ABSTRACTS<br>\nMay 11, 2026:      Last notifications of acceptance<br>\nMay 25, 2026:      Deadline for registrations of presenters<br>\nJune 15, 2026:     Deadline for registration of non-presenters<br>\nJuly 6, 2026:      Start of conference</p>\n<p>After the submission of an extended abstract, the notification of<br>\nacceptance is sent out WITHIN TWO WEEKS.</p>\n<p>CONTACT</p>\n<p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:scml@risc.jku.at\">scml@risc.jku.at</a><br>\nWeb:   <a href=\"https://scml.risc.jku.at/conference-2026/\">https://scml.risc.jku.at/conference-2026/</a></p>\n<p>Please consider subscribing to the SCML Mailing List</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scml.risc.jku.at/conference-2026/mailinglist/\">https://scml.risc.jku.at/conference-2026/mailinglist/</a></p>\n<p>in order to stay informed about the SCML-2026 conference.<br>\n=======================================================================</p>",
