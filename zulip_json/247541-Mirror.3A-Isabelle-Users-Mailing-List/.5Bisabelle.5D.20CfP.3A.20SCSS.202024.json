It aims to promote research<br>\n  on theoretical and practical aspects of symbolic computation in<br>\n  software science, combined with modern artificial intelligence<br>\n  techniques.</p>\n<p>Symbolic computation is the science of computing with symbolic<br>\n  objects (terms, formulae, programs, representations of algebraic<br>\n  objects, etc.) Powerful algorithms have been developed during<br>\n  the past decades for the significant subareas of symbolic<br>\n  computation: computer algebra and computational logic. These<br>\n  algorithms and methods are successfully applied in various fields,<br>\n  including software science, which covers a broad range of<br>\n  software construction and analysis.</p>\n<p>For more information, see<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.scss-conference.org/2024\">www.scss-conference.org/2024</a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Scope</em></strong></p>\n<p>The topics of the symposium include, but are not limited to,<br>\n  the following</p>\n<p>- methods for large-scale computer understanding of mathematics and <br>\nscience</p>\n<p>- program synthesis, transformation, and verification by AI methods<br>\n  - automated reasoning and knowledge management<br>\n  - theorem proving methods and techniques<br>\n  - formal verification of AI and machine learning algorithms<br>\n  - formal methods for the analysis of security<br>\n  - symbolic methods for computational geometry and image processing<br>\n  - symbolic methods for semantic web and cloud computing<br>\n  - query languages for symbolic data</p>\n<p><strong><em>Call for Papers</em></strong></p>\n<p>Original submissions are invited in two categories: regular research<br>\n  papers and work-in-progress papers. Regular research papers must not<br>\n  exceed 15 pages in LNCS format, including references and appendices.<br>\n  It is planned for the accepted papers to be published in proceedings<br>\n  in the Springer LNAI series. Shorter papers on tools may be considered<br>\n  in this category and should include a URL from which the tool can be<br>\n  downloaded or accessed online.</p>\n<p>Work-in-progress papers need not be original. Concurrent submission to<br>\n  another conference or a journal is allowed. Papers in this category are<br>\n  limited in length to 4 pages in the EPTCS format. The accepted ones<br>\n  will be presented at the symposium and will be included in the<br>\n  Computing Research Repository (CoRR).</p>\n<p>Papers and abstracts are submitted via the EasyChair submission page:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scss2024\">www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scss2024</a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Important Dates</em></strong></p>\n<p>2024-02-23: regular paper title and abstract submission<br>\n  2024-03-01: regular paper full submission<br>\n  2024-05-01: regular paper decision notification<br>\n  2024-06-15: regular paper camera-ready submission<br>\n  2024-06-07: work-in-progress papers submission<br>\n  2024-06-21: work-in-progress papers notification<br>\n  2024-08-28: conference begins</p>\n<p><strong><em>Invited Speakers</em></strong></p>\n<p>Wenshin Lee University of Stirling, UK<br>\n  Adrian Tate NAG Ltd, UK<br>\n  Stephen Wolfram Wolfram Research, USA<br>\n  Kazuhiro Yokoyama Rikkyo University, Japan</p>",
