CiE is a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested in new developments in computability and their underlying significance for the real world. Previous meetings have taken place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006), Siena (2007), Athens (2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponta Delgada (2010), Sofia (2011), Cambridge (2012), Milan (2013), Budapest (2014), Bucharest (2015), Paris (2016), Turku (2017), Kiel (2018), Durham (2019), Salerno (2020, virtually), Ghent (2021, virtually), Swansea (2022), Batumi (2023), and Amsterdam (2024).</p>\n<p>TUTORIAL SPEAKERS<br>\nMaria Paola Bonacina (University of Verona)<br>\nIgor Carboni Oliveira (University of Warwick)</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>\nUgo Dal Lago (University of Bologna)<br>\nDaniel Graça (University of Algarve)<br>\nEkaterina Komendantskaya (University of Southampton)<br>\nNg Keng Meng (Nanyang Technological University)<br>\nPaulo Oliva (Queen Mary University of London)<br>\nAna Sokolova (University of Salzburg)</p>\n<p>SPECIAL SESSIONS<br>\nThere will be 6 special sessions, details will be announced soon.</p>\n<p>CONFERENCE TOPICS<br>\nThe CiE conferences serve as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of computability, foundations of computer science, logic, and theoretical computer science, as well as the interplay of these areas with practical issues in computer science and with other disciplines such as biology, mathematics, philosophy, or physics.</p>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSION<br>\nTHE PROGRAM COMMITTEE cordially invites all researchers, European and non-European, to submit their papers in all areas related to the above for presentation at the conference and inclusion in the proceedings of CiE 2025 at <a href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cie2025\">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cie2025</a>.</p>\n<p>CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS<br>\nPapers submitted to the conference proceedings should represent original work, not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with formal proceedings. The Program Committee will rigorously review and select submitted papers. Accepted papers will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series from Springer-Verlag. Papers to be considered in the conferences proceedings must be submitted in PDF format, using the LNCS style (available at <a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>) and must have a maximum of 15 pages, including references but excluding a possible appendix in which one can include proofs and other additional material. Papers building bridges between different parts of the research community are particularly welcome.</p>\n<p>INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS<br>\nContinuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. A proposal for an informal presentation must be submitted via our submission link: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cie2025\">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cie2025</a>, using the LNCS style file (available at <a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>), and be 1 page long; a brief description of the results suffices and an abstract is not required. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2025 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>\nContributed papers will be selected from submissions received by the PROGRAM COMMITTEE consisting of:<br>\nArnold Beckmann (Swansea University) – co-chair<br>\nLaurent Bienvenu (University of Bordeaux)<br>\nChristel Baier (Technische Universität Dresden)<br>\nGiuseppa Castiglione (Università degli Studi di Palermo)<br>\nBenjamin Doerr (École Polytechnique)<br>\nFernando Ferreira (University of Lisbon)<br>\nGilda Ferreira (Universidade Aberta)<br>\nEkaterina Fokina (Vienna University of Technology)<br>\nLorenzo Galeotti (Amsterdam University College)<br>\nJun Le Goh (National University of Singapore)<br>\nAngeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki (Royal Holloway, University of London and University of Cambridge)<br>\nLudovic Levy Patey (Mathematics Institute of Jussieu–Paris Rive Gauche)<br>\nZsuzsanna Lipták (University of Verona)<br>\nFlorin Manea (University of Göttingen)<br>\nSimone Martini (University of Bologna)<br>\nRussell Miller (Queens College-CUNY)<br>\nGeorg Moser (University of Innsbruck)<br>\nIsabel Oitavem (Universidade Nova de Lisboa) – co-chair<br>\nRomain Péchoux (University of Lorraine)<br>\nPaolo Pistone (Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1)<br>\nDino Rossegger (Vienna University of Technology)<br>\nStefan Vatev (Sofia University)<br>\nDamien Woods (Maynooth University)</p>\n<p>WOMEN IN COMPUTABILITY<br>\nWe intend to run the Women in Computability program as in previous CiEs, details will be announced in due course.</p>\n<p>HOSTED BY<br>\nThe event will be held in the Faculdade de Ciências buildings located at University of Lisbon.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZING COMMITTEE<br>\nBruno Dinis (University of Évora / CIMA)<br>\nJosé Espírito Santo (University of Minho / CMAT)<br>\nGilda Ferreira (Universidade Aberta / CMAFcIO) - chair<br>\nManuel Martins (University of Aveiro / CIDMA)<br>\nIsabel Oitavem (NOVA University of Lisbon / NOVAMath)<br>\nPedro Quaresma (University of Coimbra / CISUC)<br>\nJoão Rasga (University of Lisbon / Instituto de Telecomunicações)<br>\nAlexandra Rodrigues (NOVA University of Lisbon)<br>\nPaulo Guilherme Santos (Instituto Politécnico de Lisboa / CMAFcIO)<br>\nAndré Souto (University of Lisbon / LASIGE)<br>\nMaria Manuel Torres (University of Lisbon / CMAFcIO)</p>",
