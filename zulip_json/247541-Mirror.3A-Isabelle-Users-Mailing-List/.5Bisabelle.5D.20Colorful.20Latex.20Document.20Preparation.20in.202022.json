Adding<br>\nsome colors and some typesetting which helps to better distinguish<br>\ndefinition names from definition arguments would be nice. Some style<br>\nsimilar to the browser info would be awesome. Does anyone have examples for<br>\nsome nicer-looking setups?</p>\n<p>Thanks!<br>\n  Cornelius</p>",
