Using<br>\n\"isabelle build\" to build a theory containing one of these commands doesn't<br>\nwork, however. It's possible that I'm doing something wrong, but it seems<br>\nlike a theory is invalid if it contains one of these commands. Is this true</p>\n<ul>\n<li>are they only for interaction purposes, not to count as results of the<br>\ntheory?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This would make sense, since the goal is a checked proof after all. Still,<br>\nit is convenient to see these counterexamples sometimes, and seeing them<br>\nfrom the command line would be nice.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any useful information regarding this? Thanks.</p>",
