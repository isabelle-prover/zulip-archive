        "content": "<p>From: Dmitriy Traytel &lt;<a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>\nHi all,</p>\n<p>Sorry, I have been delaying the response to this thread due to being occupied otherwise.</p>\n<p>First, thanks to Larry and John for sharing the HOL Light benchmark. It inspired me to make my own measurements (not to compare to HOL Light but to get some understanding of whether there might be a problem). I paste the Isabelle snippet below. It produces the following results:</p>\n<p>No plugins:</p>\n<p>#Constructors 2: 83 ms</p>\n<p>#Constructors 4: 113 ms</p>\n<p>#Constructors 8: 164 ms</p>\n<p>#Constructors 16: 373 ms</p>\n<p>#Constructors 32: 1568 ms</p>\n<p>#Constructors 64: 11088 ms</p>\n<p>#Constructors 128: 109744 ms</p>\n<p>All standard plugins:</p>\n<p>#Constructors 2: 260 ms</p>\n<p>#Constructors 4: 345 ms</p>\n<p>#Constructors 8: 729 ms</p>\n<p>#Constructors 16: 1154 ms</p>\n<p>#Constructors 32: 5061 ms</p>\n<p>#Constructors 64: 41187 ms</p>\n<p>#Constructors 128: 692897 ms</p>\n<p>Some notes about these numbers:</p>\n<p>1) I consider myself primarily responsible for the runtime of datatypes with all plugins disabled. (Even there, frankly speaking, this is a shared responsibility between me and Jasmin, but at least in the past, we were both happy to look into each other's code.)</p>\n<p>2) The standard plugins add about a factor 4â6 to the runtime. I donât know how this breaks down between the different plugins precisely, and need to investigate this further. Some of the plugins are somewhat essential for proper (i.e., recursive) datatypes, such as the size plugin that defines the size function; others are relevant for all datatypes, such as the code generation plugin that e.g., instantiates the equal type class (another quadratic theorem BTW). Others again are more exotic, such as the lifting and transfer plugins. Ultimately, it depends on the application whether one needs a particular plugin. The default in Isabelle is to have all plugins enabled. Perhaps we can discuss if this should be reconsidered.</p>\n<p>3) The measurements are taken with parallelism turned off. This is not representative of the average user experience. With parallelism, it is hard to get precise timings. For example, the no-plugins 128 constructors test reports 13107 ms (instead of 109774 ms), and the processing of the commands below that declaration proceeds after that time. However, the internal datatype proofs are forked, and PolyML is working hard on them in the background so that the systemâs responsiveness is lowered for about a minute.</p>\n<p>4) The examples of the form T1 = A1 | â¦ | A128 are very artificial. Here, I agree with Makarius that we lack real-world evidence of specific Isabelle examples that are too slow. Iâll reply to some of the pointers in the other thread. The original issue with the claset in the other thread has to my knowledge been resolved by adding a T.distinct[iff del] declaration for the offending type T.</p>\n<p>5) While it would be nice to bring the numbers (or even better the growth factor) down, I donât think we are in a state that prohibits us from using large datatypes.</p>\n<p>Coming back to Hannoâs question: The plugins are already in usersâ hands. So yes, you can add attributes like [simp del] or [iff del] to any theorem associated with (co)datatypes, e.g., if they have more than 100 constructors. However, not generating the properties in the first place is more difficult: distinctness is part of the standard interface of (co)datatypes and is already used by other tools for their internal work (I know of primcorec as one example, but there may be others too).</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Dmitriy</p>\n<p>ML â¹Multithreading.parallel_proofs := 0âº</p>\n<p>local_setup â¹ fn lthy =&gt;</p>\n<p>let</p>\n<p>open BNF_FP_Def_Sugar;</p>\n<p>open BNF_FP_Util;</p>\n<p>open BNF_LFP;</p>\n<p>open BNF_Util;</p>\n<p>open BNF_Def;</p>\n<p>val time = time (Config.put bnf_timing true lthy);</p>\n<p>fun test filter b n lthy =</p>\n<p>let</p>\n<p>val timer = time (Timer.startRealTimer ());</p>\n<p>val ctr_specs = map (fn i =&gt;</p>\n<p>(((Binding.empty, Binding.suffix_name (string_of_int i) @{binding A}), []), NoSyn)) (0 upto Integer.pow n 2);</p>\n<p>val spec = ((((([], Binding.suffix_name (string_of_int n) b), NoSyn), ctr_specs),</p>\n<p>(Binding.empty, Binding.empty, Binding.empty)), []);</p>\n<p>val lthy = co_datatypes Least_FP construct_lfp ((filter, false), [spec]) lthy</p>\n<p>val timer = time (timer (\"#Constructors \" ^ string_of_int (Integer.pow n 2)));</p>\n<p>in</p>\n<p>lthy</p>\n<p>end;</p>\n<p>in</p>\n<p>lthy</p>\n<p>|&gt; (fn lthy =&gt; K lthy (warning \"No plugins:\"))</p>\n<p>|&gt; fold (test (Plugin_Name.make_filter lthy (K (K false))) @{binding T}) (1 upto 7)</p>\n<p>|&gt; (fn lthy =&gt; K lthy (warning \"All standard plugins:\"))</p>\n<p>|&gt; fold (test Plugin_Name.default_filter @{binding U}) (1 upto 7)</p>\n<p>end</p>\n<p>âº</p>\n<p>On 9 Jul 2025, at 12.56, Makarius &lt;<a href=\"mailto:makarius@sketis.net\">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p>\n<p>On 09/07/2025 11:51, Becker, Hanno wrote:<br>\nIn addition to potential claset efficiency improvements: Can the datatype package be adjusted to allow the user to choose between the auto-generation of (in)equality lemmas (unmodified default) and alternative means such as a simproc?
