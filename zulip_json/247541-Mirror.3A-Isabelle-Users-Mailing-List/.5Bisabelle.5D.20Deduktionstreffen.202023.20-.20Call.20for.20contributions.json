Another goal of the meeting is to <br>\nstimulate networking effects and to foster collaborative research projects.</p>\n<p>Organization</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Deduktionstreffen 2023 is affiliated with the German KI 2023, which <br>\nbrings together academic and industrial researchers from all areas of <br>\nAI, providing an ideal place for exchanging news and research results of <br>\nintelligent system technology.</p>\n<p>We welcome contributions on all theoretical, experimental and <br>\napplication aspects of deduction. Accepted abstracts are first presented <br>\nin an approx. 15 minute teaser talk and then discussed next to a poster <br>\n(maximal size: A0 portrait). The exact maximal time per talk (at least <br>\n15min) will be adjusted on short notice depending on the overall number <br>\nof submissions.</p>\n<p>Submission Guidelines</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission is open to everybody interested in deduction systems.<br>\nPlease submit an extended abstract (max. two pages) of your contribution <br>\nvia EasyChair: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dt2023\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dt2023</a>.</p>\n<p>Submission deadline:<br>\n     Early bird submission: July 1 (Notification: July 13)<br>\n     Standard submission: August 1 (Notification: August 13)</p>\n<p>Early bird submission is meant to allow planning reliability to <br>\ninterested students and researchers, e.g. if they would like to apply <br>\nfor travel grants. In particular, there is travel support funded by the <br>\nAI chapter of the German Gesellschaft für Informatik (for members, see <br>\n<a href=\"https://fb-ki.gi.de/reisestipendien/\">https://fb-ki.gi.de/reisestipendien/</a>). Membership to the GI and FG <br>\nDedSys is free of charge for students!</p>\n<p>There will be no formal publication of the accepted submissions. The <br>\norganizers, however, leave open the possibility to organize <br>\npost-proceedings, possibly as joint workshop proceedings with other <br>\nworkshops at the KI 2023.</p>\n<p>Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>automated reasoning in propositional, first-order, higher-order, and<br>\n   non-classical logics;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>implementation of provers (SAT, SMT, resolution, superposition, tableau,<br>\n    instantiation-based, rewriting, logical frameworks, etc.);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>automated reasoning tools for all kinds of practical problems and<br>\n   applications;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>practical experiences, usability aspects, feasibility studies;</p>\n</li>\n<li>evaluation of implementation techniques and automated reasoning tools;</li>\n<li>\n<p>performance aspects, benchmarking approaches; non-standard approaches to<br>\n   automated reasoning, non-standard forms of automated reasoning, new<br>\n   applications;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>implementation techniques, optimisation techniques, machine learning,<br>\n   strategies and heuristics, fairness;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>tools or methods that support prover development;</p>\n</li>\n<li>system descriptions and demos.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Programme Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Franz Baader (TU Dresden)</li>\n<li>Jasmin Blanchette (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, München)</li>\n<li>Jürgen Giesl (RWTH Aachen)</li>\n<li>Cezary Kaliszyk (University of Innsbruck)</li>\n<li>Jens Otten (University of Oslo)</li>\n<li>Florian Rabe (University of Erlangen-Nuremberg)</li>\n<li>Claudia Schon (Universität Koblenz-Landau, co-chair)</li>\n<li>Viorica Sofronie-Stokkermans (Universität Koblenz-Landau)</li>\n<li>Alexander Steen (University of Greifswald, co-chair)</li>\n<li>Frieder Stolzenburg (Hochschule Harz)</li>\n<li>Uwe Waldmann (MPI Saarbrücken)<br>\nPC members list to be completed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Venue</p>\n<hr>\n<p>KI 2023 in Berlin, Germany</p>\n<p>Important dates</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Paper Submission deadline:<br>\n     Early bird submission: July 1 (Notification: July 13)<br>\n     Standard submission: August 1 (Notification: August 13)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Workshop: September 26, 2023</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organizers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Florian Rabe and Claudia Schon</p>",
