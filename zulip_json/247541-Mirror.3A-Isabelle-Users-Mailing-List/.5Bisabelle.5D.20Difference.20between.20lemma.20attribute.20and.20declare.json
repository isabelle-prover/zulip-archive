Say we have an attribute test. If we use lemma t[test], then <br>\nthe function that implements the attribute is called four times. If we <br>\nuse declare t[test], the function is called five times.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I am working on some existing code that uses the name hint <br>\nof theorems (i.e. Thm.get_name_hint). I suspect that the code relies on <br>\nthem in an undisciplined way but I don't want to change the whole thing <br>\nright now. Now, if we use lemma t[test], the name hint always exists. <br>\nFor declare t[test], on the other hand, the theorem that is passed to <br>\nthe attribute function only has a name hint 2/5 times.</p>\n<p>My questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the reason that the attribute function is called multiple times?</li>\n<li>What is the reason that the name hint does not always exist when using <br>\ndeclare and is there a workaround?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Lukas</p>\n<p>P.S: See the attached theory file for an example.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/VoOvUA54v08sWvfUh7EmGVgi/Scratch.thy\">Scratch.thy</a></p>",
