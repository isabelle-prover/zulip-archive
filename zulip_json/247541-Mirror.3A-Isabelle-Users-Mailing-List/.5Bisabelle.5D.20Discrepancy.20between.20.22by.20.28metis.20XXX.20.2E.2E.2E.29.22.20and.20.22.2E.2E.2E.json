It seems, at least, that Sledgehammer is failing here due<br>\nto the difference between these two cases.</p>\n<p>It is always difficult to extract an example of a failure like this from a large theory text,<br>\nbut for the above example, I might be able to do it if that would be helpful to someone.</p>\n<p>On a related note, I have encountered some other situations in which Sledgehammer suggests<br>\n\"by (metis XXX ...)\", which does not work, but \"by (metis (no_types) XXX ...)\" does work.<br>\nHere I would not expect these commands to be equivalent, but this kind of discrepancy seems<br>\nto be a common failure mode of the suggestions made by Sledgehammer.  I don't currently<br>\nhave any examples of this that I can extract, though.</p>",
