(I.e., <br>\nit renders as /See lemma ?x=?x/. I want to see /See lemma refl./)</p>\n<p>Of course, I can just write the lemma name verbatim (e.g., text ‹See <br>\nlemma ‹refl››) but that will not check whether the lemma exists etc.</p>\n<p>(And as a related side-remark: It would be cool if in a future Isabelle <br>\nrelease, the document generation would add labels next to lemmas etc. So <br>\nthat something like \\ref{lemma:my_lemma_name} could jump to the lemma <br>\ndeclaration via hyperref.)</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",
