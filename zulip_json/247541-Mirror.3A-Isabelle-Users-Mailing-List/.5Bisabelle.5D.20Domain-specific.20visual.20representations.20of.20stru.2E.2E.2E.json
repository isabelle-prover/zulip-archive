By visual<br>\nrepresentations I mean representations like those seen in this blog post:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.daniellitt.com/blog/2020/12/26/the-geometry-of-the-sylow-theorems\">https://www.daniellitt.com/blog/2020/12/26/the-geometry-of-the-sylow-theorems</a></p>\n<p>I'm really curious if people have other domain-specific visualizations of<br>\nstructures they reason about in proofs, especially if coupled with formal<br>\nproof developments! I'm extra curious when you use the visualization to<br>\nreason about the proofs by hand, but encode them formally in a proof<br>\nassistant. I'm extra extra curious if the visual representation is of a<br>\nstructure used inside of a program, and not \"just\" a mathematical proof,<br>\nbut I'm very open to both.</p>\n<p>If you do, I'd love examples!!! This idea is like a couple of hours old,<br>\nbut I want to write it up with some examples so I can get a sense of how<br>\ntractable it is, and probably propose it to some students next year.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>Talia</p>",
