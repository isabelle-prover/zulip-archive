His <br>\nresearch spans the full range from innovative foundational theory to the <br>\ndesign and implementation of state-of-the-art working systems.</p>\n<p>Mirek Truszczynski (University of Kentucky, USA) has done pioneering and <br>\nagenda-setting research in logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, <br>\nanswer-set programming, and preference in computational choice, where <br>\nhis seminal contributions are widely recognized. His research has <br>\nsuccesfully run the gamut from mathematical foundations to industrial <br>\napplications.</p>\n<p>The Dov Gabbay Prize was instituted in 2022 by the Initiative for Logic <br>\nand Foundations on the occasion of Dov Gabbay's 77th birthday. Its <br>\nintent is to recognize outstanding inspirational contributions in logic <br>\nand foundations across the interdisciplinary range of activities in <br>\nGabbayâ€™s work over the years.</p>\n<p>In response to a first call, the Jury has received a wide and diverse <br>\nrange of strong nominations of high-profile excellent candidates, which <br>\nresulted in extensive discussions. It was decided to focus in this first <br>\nround on research in Computational Logic that reflects primary interests <br>\nof Dov Gabbay.</p>\n<p>With the awards to follow in the years to come, the profile of the <br>\nGabbay Prize will be built up further: in particular, Philosophical <br>\nLogic and Mathematical Logic will be in focus in succeeding years. <br>\nFurther information on these and other matters regarding the Prize will <br>\nbe found in the next calls for proposals.</p>\n<p>Johan van Benthem, Christoph Benzmueller, Agata Ciabattoni, Laura <br>\nGiordano, Hannes Leitgeb, Philip Welch (chair)</p>\n<p>Further details on <a href=\"https://iloaf.org/dgp.html\">https://iloaf.org/dgp.html</a></p>",
