In addition to Research Papers, ESOP 2024 solicits two new forms of<br>\ncontributions: Experience Reports and Fresh Perspectives</p>\n<p>NEW! Papers submitted in the Research Papers category may use any<br>\nformatting and have no fixed page limit.</p>\n<p>Important Dates AoE (UTC-12)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Paper submission: October 12, 2023</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rebuttal: Tuesday 5 December - Thursday 7 December, 2023</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paper notification: December 21, 2023</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Artifact submission: January 4, 2024</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paper final version: January 23, 2024</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Artifact notification: February 8, 2024</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Scope<br>\nESOP is an annual conference devoted to fundamental issues in the<br>\nspecification, design, analysis, and implementation of programming<br>\nlanguages and systems. ESOP seeks contributions on all aspects of<br>\nprogramming language research including, but not limited to, the following<br>\nareas: programming paradigms and styles, methods and tools to specify and<br>\nreason about programs and languages, programming language foundations,<br>\nmethods and tools for implementation, concurrency and distribution,<br>\napplications and emerging topics.</p>\n<p>Contributions bridging the gap between theory and practice are particularly<br>\nwelcome.</p>\n<p>Submission Categories</p>\n<p>Research Papers are articles that advance the state-of-the-art on the<br>\ntheory and practice of programming languages and systems.</p>\n<p>For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in<br>\nSpringer’s LNCS, ACM's PACMPL, or ACM's TOPLAS format. There is no page<br>\nlimit for submissions, but authors should be aware that reviewers are<br>\nlikely to balance the review time for all papers and that camera-ready<br>\npapers may not exceed 25 pages (excluding bibliography) and must be<br>\nformatted in Springer’s LNCS.</p>\n<p>Experience Reports are articles reporting on systems and techniques<br>\ndeveloped in practice, such as artifacts, tools, mechanized proofs, and<br>\neducational systems, both in academic and industrial settings. These<br>\narticles must include a critical evaluation of the experience reported.</p>\n<p>Submitted and camera-ready experience report papers must be formatted in<br>\nSpringer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography).</p>\n<p>Fresh Perspectives are articles that promote new insights on programming<br>\nlanguages and systems in a particularly elegant way. These papers may offer<br>\nnew tutorial perspectives of known concepts or they may introduce fresh new<br>\ninsights and ideas that could lead to relevant future developments.</p>\n<p>Submitted and camera-ready fresh perspective papers must be formatted in<br>\nSpringer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography).</p>\n<p>Springer's formatting style files and other information can be found on the<br>\nSpringer website:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a></p>\n<p>Review Process<br>\nThe review process is double-blind with a rebuttal phase. In submitted<br>\npapers, authors should omit names and institutions; refer to prior work in<br>\nthe third person; and should not include acknowledgements that might reveal<br>\ntheir identity.<br>\nDuring the evaluation period authors are free to speak publicly about their<br>\nwork and distribute preprints of their submitted papers. However, authors<br>\nshould avoid actions that would reveal their identities, such as directly<br>\ncontacting PC members.</p>\n<p>Submission link: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esop2024\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esop2024</a><br>\nAccepted papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer<br>\nScience series.</p>\n<p>Artifact Evaluation<br>\nESOP 2024 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation.<br>\nAuthors will be encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper<br>\nnotification. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision. Note:<br>\nArtifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5 page experience<br>\nreport (including 1 page bibliography), that will appear in the conference<br>\nproceedings.</p>\n<p>Journal-After Submissions</p>\n<p>Revised and expanded versions of accepted ESOP research papers are eligible<br>\nfor the ESOP Journal-After TOPLAS channel. A call will open in January at a<br>\npredefined date after the ESOP notification, and to which all accepted<br>\npapers may apply. A first light review round will be performed by the ESOP<br>\nPC, to reach Reject or Revise decisions. Papers with Revise decisions will<br>\nproceed to a second thorough review round, in which additional reviews will<br>\nbe coordinated with TOPLAS, towards a final Reject or Accept decision.</p>\n<p>Program Chair</p>\n<p>Stephanie Weirich (University of Pennsylvania)</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Ana Bove, Chalmers, Sweden</p>\n<p>Loris D'Antoni, U Wisconsin-Madison, USA</p>\n<p>Ugo Dal Lago, Bologna, Italy</p>\n<p>Ornela Dardha, Glasgow, UK</p>\n<p>Mike Dodds, Galois, USA</p>\n<p>Sophia Drossopoulou, Imperial, UK</p>\n<p>Robert Findler, Northwestern, USA</p>\n<p>Amir Goharshady, HKUST, Hong Kong</p>\n<p>Andrew Gordon, Microsoft, UK</p>\n<p>Alexey Gotsman, IMDEA Software Institute, Spain</p>\n<p>Limin Jia, Carnegie Mellon University, USA</p>\n<p>Josh Ko, Academia Sinica, Taiwan</p>\n<p>András Kovács, Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary</p>\n<p>Kazutaka Matsuda, Tohoku University, Japan</p>\n<p>Anders Miltner, Simon Fraser, Canada</p>\n<p>Santosh Nagarakatte, Rutgers University, USA</p>\n<p>Dominic Orchard, University Kent and Cambridge, UK</p>\n<p>Frank Pfenning, Carnegie Mellon University, USA</p>\n<p>Clément Pit-Claudel, EPFL, Switzerland</p>\n<p>François Pottier, INRIA Paris, France</p>\n<p>Matija Pretnar, U Ljubljana, Slovenia</p>\n<p>Azalea Raad, Imperial College London, UK</p>\n<p>James Riely, DePaul, USA</p>\n<p>Tom Schrijvers, KU Leuven, Belgium</p>\n<p>Peter Sewell, Cambridge, UK</p>\n<p>Takeshi Tsukada, Chiba University, Japan</p>\n<p>Benoît Valiron, Centrale Supélec and Paris Saclay, France</p>\n<p>Dimitrios Vytiniotis, DeepMind, UK</p>\n<p>Elena Zucca, DIBRIS - University of Genova, Italy</p>\n<p>Steering Committee</p>\n<p>Luis Caires (Universidade Nova de Lisboa)</p>\n<p>Brigitte Pientka (McGill University)</p>\n<p>Ilya Sergey (National University of Singapore)</p>\n<p>Stephanie Weirich (University of Pennsylvania)</p>\n<p>Thomas Wies (New York University)</p>\n<p>Nobuko Yoshida (Imperial College London)</p>",
