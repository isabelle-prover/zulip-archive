Two years <br>\nago, I used to have an account (which you need to edit) but my log-in <br>\ndoesn't work anymore. After searching a bit, I found the publicly <br>\navailable users list <br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community/Special:ListUsers\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community/Special:ListUsers</a>&gt;, which <br>\nunfortunately only lists one default and one admin account.</p>\n<p>Who is in charge of the wiki, and would it be possible to re-gain <br>\nediting rights? Maybe one should even consider making edits much easier <br>\nfor people (even publicly accessible?) so that pages like the above <br>\nCheat Sheet or the \"Tips and Tricks\" page can continue to grow. I'm <br>\nconvinced (as we also published previously) that this is one of the key <br>\ntools, together with a database of questions on StackOverflow (rather <br>\nthan on this mailing list, maybe – although that's a different <br>\ndiscussion), to make Isabelle accessible to newcomers, be it students or <br>\nresearchers of mathematics or computer science or yet other disciplines.</p>\n<p>Or, should the wiki be no longer maintained for good, is there an <br>\nalternative where such content can be / will be statically hosted? <br>\nThanks in advance!</p>\n<p>All the best,</p>\n<p>Marco</p>",

I see more and more<br>\nsuch servers for high-end projects. But this is not for free: it requires<br>\nserious efforts to maintain the content and the community. (Like we do already<br>\non this old-fashioned Mailman list.)</p>\n<p>For example, see the combined Forum + Wiki of the extraordinary Caddy<br>\nWebserver project, which is a potential successor of both Apache and Nginx:<br>\n<a href=\"https://caddy.community\">https://caddy.community</a></p>\n<p>Or see the more conventional Nextcloud project <a href=\"https://help.nextcloud.com\">https://help.nextcloud.com</a> with<br>\nrubriques like \"News\", \"How to\", \"Support\".</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
