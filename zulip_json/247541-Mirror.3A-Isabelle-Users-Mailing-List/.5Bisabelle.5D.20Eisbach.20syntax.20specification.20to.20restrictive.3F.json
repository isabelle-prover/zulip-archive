However, the<br>\nexample right after the railroad diagrams has multiple patterns for a<br>\nsingle case, which are separated by <code>and</code>. Does the railroad diagram<br>\nneed updating?</p>\n<p>Also I understand that fact names and the <code>multi</code> argument are probably<br>\nnot allowed when matching a term, as this term might not denote a fact<br>\nand it is only a single term, not a list. Is this understanding correct?</p>\n<p>All the best,<br>\nWolfgang</p>",
