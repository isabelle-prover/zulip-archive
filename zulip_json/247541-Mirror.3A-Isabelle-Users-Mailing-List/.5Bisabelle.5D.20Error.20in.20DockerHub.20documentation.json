But when using the command from it, docker fails to pull any image:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>docker pull makarius/isabelle<br>\nUsing default tag: latest<br>\nError response from daemon: manifest for makarius/isabelle:latest not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess that the reason is the absence of 'latest' tag (the default one). The following command work perfectly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>docker pull makarius/isabelle:Isabelle2021</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nBoris</p>",

I mean, you can run Isabelle server in a container (or on a remote physical server) and communicate with it from any other container/machine, which doesn't have anything except telnet or netcast.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, now it seems to be impossible because Isabelle server doesn't have an IP starting argument. It's always 127.0.0.1, and not accessible from remote hosts. Am I right?</p>",
