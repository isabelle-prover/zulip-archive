Any standard comes with an assessment process, which<br>\n  requires a complete documentation of the application to ease the<br>\n  justification of design choices and the review of code and proofs.</p>\n<p>Ideally, an F-IDE dedicated to such developments should comply with<br>\n  several requirements. The first one is to associate a logical theory<br>\n  with a programming language, in a way that facilitates the tightly<br>\n  coupled handling of specification properties and program constructs.<br>\n  The second is to offer a language and/or an environment simple enough<br>\n  to be usable by most developers, even if they are not fully acquainted<br>\n  with higher-order logics or set theory, in particular by making<br>\n  development of proofs as easy as possible. The third is to offer<br>\n  automated management of application documentation. It may also be<br>\n  expected that developments done with such an F-IDE are reusable and<br>\n  modular. Tools for testing and static analysis may be embedded within<br>\n  F-IDEs to support the assessment process.</p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<p>The workshop is open to contributions on all aspects of a system<br>\n  development process, including specification, design, implementation,<br>\n  analysis, and documentation. It welcomes the presentation of tools,<br>\n  methods, techniques, and experiments. Topics of interest include, but<br>\n  are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p>* F-IDE building: design and integration of languages, development of<br>\n    user-friendly front-ends</p>\n<p>* How to make high-level logical and programming concepts palatable to<br>\n    industrial developers</p>\n<p>* Integration of object-oriented and modularity features<br>\n  * Integration of static analyzers<br>\n  * Integration of automated proof tools, theorem provers, and testing tools<br>\n  * Documentation tools<br>\n  * Impact of tools on certification<br>\n  * Experience reports on developing F-IDEs<br>\n  * Experience reports on using F-IDEs<br>\n  * Experience reports on formal methods-based assessments in industrial<br>\n    applications</p>\n<p>Submission Guidelines</p>\n<p>We accept both long (15 pages) and short (6 pages) paper submissions.<br>\n  The page limit does not include the bibliography. Submitted papers<br>\n  must present original contributions whose main results and conclusions<br>\n  have not been published or submitted elsewhere. Each submission will<br>\n  be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. We<br>\n  expect that one author of every accepted paper will present their work<br>\n  at the workshop.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers must be written in English and follow the EPTCS LaTeX<br>\n  format (<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org\">http://style.eptcs.org</a>). Authors are invited to submit the<br>\n  following types of contributions:</p>\n<p>* Research papers providing new concepts and results<br>\n  * Experience reports<br>\n  * Position papers and research perspectives<br>\n  * Tool presentations</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted via EasyChair at F-IDE 2021's workshop page:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=f-ide2021\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=f-ide2021</a>. Preliminary<br>\n  proceedings will be made available in electronic form at the workshop.<br>\n  Post-proceedings will be published in the Electronic Proceedings in<br>\n  Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>* Andrew Reynolds, University of Iowa, USA<br>\n  * Damien Doligez, Inria, France   * Bernhard Rumpe, RWTH Aachen University,<br>\nGermany</p>\n<p>* Carlo A.
