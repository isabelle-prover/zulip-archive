The FM symposia have been<br>\nsuccessful in bringing together researchers and industrial users<br>\naround a program of original papers on research and industrial<br>\nexperience, workshops, tutorials, reports on tools, projects, and<br>\nongoing doctoral research. FM 2026 will be both an occasion to<br>\ncelebrate and a platform for enthusiastic researchers and<br>\npractitioners from a diversity of backgrounds to exchange their ideas<br>\nand share their experiences. See<br>\n<a href=\"https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026\">https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026</a></p>\n<p>The FM 2026 proceedings will appear as part of the LNCS FM subline,<br>\nwith gold open access.</p>\n<h2>Important Dates:</h2>\n<p>Abstract Submission     November 25, 2025<br>\nFull Paper Submission   December 2, 2025<br>\nPaper Notification      January 30, 2026<br>\nFinal Version           February 23, 2026<br>\nMain Conference         May 20--22, 2026</p>\n<h2>Topics of Interest</h2>\n<p>FM 2026 will highlight the development and application of formal<br>\nmethods in a wide range of domains including trustworthy AI,<br>\ncomputer-based systems, systems-of-systems, cyber-physical systems,<br>\nsecurity, human-computer interaction, manufacturing, sustainability,<br>\nenergy, transport, smart cities, smart contracts in blockchain,<br>\nhealthcare and biology. We particularly welcome papers on techniques,<br>\ntools, and experiences in interdisciplinary settings. We also welcome<br>\npapers on experiences of applying formal methods in industrial<br>\nsettings, and on the design and validation of formal method tools.</p>\n<h2>Track: Tests &amp; Proofs</h2>\n<p>FM 2026 features a special track on Tests and Proofs (TAP) as a part<br>\nof the conference.</p>\n<p>TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets<br>\nthe interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the<br>\nultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.</p>\n<p>Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous<br>\ntechniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of<br>\ndynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic<br>\ntechniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are<br>\ncomplementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that<br>\nprovide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and<br>\ndynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic<br>\nexecution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or<br>\nthe combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive<br>\nenumeration. The verification of systems based on machine learning<br>\nspurs novel combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g.,<br>\nproperty verification of surrogate models that are generated through<br>\ntesting.</p>\n<p>TAP's scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology,<br>\nincluding foundational work, tool development, and empirical research.<br>\nTopics of interest center around the combination of static techniques<br>\nsuch as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.</p>\n<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>\n<p>We solicit various categories of papers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular Papers (max 15 pages)</li>\n<li>Regular Papers, submitted to the TAP track (max 15 pages)</li>\n<li>Long tool papers (max 15 pages)</li>\n<li>Case study papers (max 15 pages)</li>\n<li>Short papers (max 6 pages), including tool demonstration papers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All page limits do not include references and appendices.</p>\n<p>Papers should be original work, not published or submitted elsewhere,<br>\nin Springer LNCS format, and written in English.</p>\n<p>Each paper will be evaluated by at least three members of the Program<br>\nCommittee. Authors of papers reporting experimental work are strongly<br>\nencouraged to make their experimental results available for use by the<br>\nreviewers.</p>\n<p>Papers submitted to the TAP track will undergo the same review process<br>\nas other papers, by PC members with expertise in tests and proofs.</p>\n<p>Case study papers should describe significant case studies, and the<br>\ncomplete development should be made available at the time of<br>\nreview. The usual criteria for novelty, reproducibility, correctness<br>\nand the ability for others to build upon the described work apply.</p>\n<p>Tool papers and tool demonstration papers should explain enhancements<br>\nmade compared to previously published work. A tool demonstration paper<br>\nneed not present the theory behind the tool, but can focus on the<br>\ntool's features, how it is used, its evaluation and examples and<br>\nscreenshots illustrating the tool's use. Authors of tool and tool<br>\ndemonstration papers should make their tools available for use by the<br>\nreviewers and are highly encouraged to participate in the artifact<br>\nevaluation once their paper is accepted.</p>\n<p>Reviewing is single-blind.</p>\n<p>For all papers, an appendix can provide additional material such as<br>\ndetails on proofs or experiments. The appendix is not part of the page<br>\ncount and will only be read at the discretion of the reviewers. Thus,<br>\nit should not contain information necessary for the understanding and<br>\nevaluation of the presented work.</p>\n<p>Papers will be accepted or rejected in the category in which they were<br>\nsubmitted and will not be moved between categories. At least one<br>\nauthor of an accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the<br>\nconference as a registered participant.</p>\n<h3>Proceedings</h3>\n<p>The conference proceedings will be published open access by Springer<br>\nin the LNCS series, as part of the FM subline, with gold open access.</p>\n<h3>Submissions</h3>\n<p>Submission link: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2026\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2026</a></p>\n<p>Authors of all accepted papers are invited to submit an artifact for<br>\nevaluation by theÂ FM 2026 Artifact Evaluation Committee after the<br>\npaper notification. For long tool papers and tool demonstration<br>\npapers, submission of an artifact is strongly encouraged.</p>\n<h3>Best Paper Award</h3>\n<p>At the conference, the PC Chairs will present an award to the authors<br>\nof the submission selected as the FM 2026 Best Paper.</p>\n<h3>Special Issue</h3>\n<p>Extended versions of selected papers will be invited for publication<br>\nin a special issue of a journal to be announced soon.</p>\n<h2>Program Committee Chairs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Augusto Sampaio, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil</li>\n<li>Marielle Stoelinga, University of Twente, the Netherlands</li>\n</ul>",
