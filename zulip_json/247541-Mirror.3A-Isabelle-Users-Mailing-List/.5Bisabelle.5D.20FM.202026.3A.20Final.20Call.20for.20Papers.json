The FM symposia have been successful in bringing together<br>\nresearchers and industrial users around a program of original papers on<br>\nresearch and industrial experience, workshops, tutorials, reports on tools,<br>\nprojects, and ongoing doctoral research. FM 2026 will be both an occasion to<br>\ncelebrate and a platform for enthusiastic researchers and practitioners from a<br>\ndiversity of backgrounds to exchange their ideas and share their experiences.<br>\nSee <a href=\"https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026\">https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026</a> for further details.</p>\n<p>The FM 2026 proceedings will appear as part of the LNCS FM subline, with gold<br>\nopen access.</p>\n<h2>Important Dates:</h2>\n<p>Abstract Submission     November 25, 2025 23:59 AoE<br>\nFull Paper Submission   December 2, 2025 23:59 AoE<br>\nPaper Notification      January 30, 2026 23:59 AoE<br>\nFinal Version           February 23, 2026 23:59 AoE<br>\nMain Conference         May 20--22, 2026</p>\n<h2>Topics of Interest</h2>\n<p>FM 2026 will highlight the development and application of formal methods in a<br>\nwide range of domains including trustworthy AI, computer-based systems,<br>\nsystems-of-systems, cyber-physical systems, security, human-computer<br>\ninteraction, manufacturing, sustainability, energy, transport, smart cities,<br>\nsmart contracts in blockchain, healthcare and biology. We particularly welcome<br>\npapers on techniques, tools, and experiences in interdisciplinary settings. We<br>\nalso welcome papers on experiences of applying formal methods in industrial<br>\nsettings, and on the design and validation of formal method tools.</p>\n<p>The topics of interest for FM 2026 include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Interdisciplinary formal methods: Techniques, tools, and experiences<br>\ndemonstrating the use of formal methods in interdisciplinary settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal methods in practice: industrial applications of formal methods,<br>\nexperience with formal methods in industry, tool usage reports, experiments<br>\nwith challenge problems. The authors are encouraged to explain how formal<br>\nmethods overcame problems, led to improved designs, or provided new insights.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tools for formal methods: Advances in automated verification, model<br>\nchecking, and testing with formal methods, tools integration, environments for<br>\nformal methods, and experimental validation of tools. The authors are<br>\nencouraged to demonstrate empirically that the new tool or environment<br>\nadvances the state of the art.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal methods in software and systems engineering: Development processes<br>\nwith formal methods, usage guidelines for formal methods, and method<br>\nintegration. The authors are encouraged to evaluate process innovations with<br>\nrespect to qualitative or quantitative improvements. Empirical studies and<br>\nevaluations are also solicited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical foundations of formal methods: All aspects of theory related to<br>\nspecification, verification, refinement, and static and dynamic analysis. The<br>\nauthors are encouraged to explain how their results contribute to the solution<br>\nof practical problems with formal methods or tools.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are particularly interested in submissions that apply formal methods on<br>\nautonomous systems, including AI - and non-AI-based perception, decision, and<br>\ncontrol algorithms, compilers, middleware, operating systems, virtual<br>\nmachines, communication protocols, and hardware. Example application domains<br>\nare increasingly automated vehicles, robots, and drones.</p>\n<p>FM 2026 features two special tracks: one on Tests and Proofs (TAP) and another<br>\non Tutorials. Further, a doctoral symposium and an industry day will be held<br>\n(see below)</p>\n<h3>Track: Tests &amp; Proofs (TAP)</h3>\n<p>TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the<br>\ninterplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate goal of<br>\nimproving software and system dependability.<br>\nResearch in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous techniques and<br>\na synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of dynamic and static<br>\nanalysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic techniques such as testing<br>\nand static techniques such as proving are complementary rather than mutually<br>\nexclusive. Notable examples that provide evidence for the potential of a<br>\ncombination of static and dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based<br>\non symbolic execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking,<br>\nor the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration. The<br>\nverification of systems based on machine learning spurs novel combinations of<br>\ndynamic and static analyses, e.g., property verification of surrogate models<br>\nthat are generated through testing.<br>\nTAP's scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology, including<br>\nfoundational work, tool development, and empirical research.<br>\nSee <a href=\"https://conf.researchr.org/track/fm-2026/fm-2026-tap\">https://conf.researchr.org/track/fm-2026/fm-2026-tap</a> for further details.</p>\n<h3>Track: Tutorials</h3>\n<p>The primary goal of these tutorials is to convey ideas with a focus on<br>\npedagogy over technical innovation. They offer a valuable platform for<br>\nparticipants to discuss technical challenges, exchange research concepts,<br>\nexplore educational strategies, and demonstrate or investigate practical<br>\napplications. Tutorials should be designed to be broadly accessible and<br>\npedagogically oriented, clarifying key concepts, building intuition, and<br>\nensuring ease of understanding. They aim to attract new researchers, serve as<br>\nbridges to practitioners, and disseminate useful ideas widely. These may be<br>\ndriven by fundamental academic interests, or by needs from specific<br>\napplication domains.<br>\nSee <a href=\"https://conf.researchr.org/track/fm-2026/fm-2026-tutorials\">https://conf.researchr.org/track/fm-2026/fm-2026-tutorials</a> for further<br>\ndetails.</p>\n<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>\n<p>We solicit various categories of papers. Except for tutorials, which has a<br>\ndedicated track, papers in all categories can be submitted to either the<br>\nResearch or the TAP track.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular Papers (max 15 pages)</li>\n<li>Long tool papers (max 15 pages)</li>\n<li>Case study papers (max 15 pages)</li>\n<li>Short papers (max 6 pages), including tool demonstration papers</li>\n<li>Tutorial papers submitted to the Tutorial track (max 25 pages)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All page limits do not include references and appendices.</p>\n<p>Papers should be original work, not published or submitted elsewhere, in<br>\nSpringer LNCS format, and written in English.</p>\n<p>Each paper will be evaluated by at least three members of the Program<br>\nCommittee. Authors of papers reporting experimental work are strongly<br>\nencouraged to make their experimental results available for use by the<br>\nreviewers.</p>\n<p>Papers submitted to the TAP track will undergo the same review process as<br>\nother papers, by PC members with expertise in tests and proofs.</p>\n<p>Case study papers should describe significant case studies, and the complete<br>\ndevelopment should be made available at the time of review. The usual criteria<br>\nfor novelty, reproducibility, correctness and the ability for others to build<br>\nupon the described work apply.</p>\n<p>Tool papers and tool demonstration papers should explain enhancements made<br>\ncompared to previously published work. A tool demonstration paper need not<br>\npresent the theory behind the tool, but can focus on the tool's features, how<br>\nit is used, its evaluation and examples and screenshots illustrating the<br>\ntool's use. Authors of tool and tool demonstration papers should make their<br>\ntools available for use by the reviewers and are highly encouraged to<br>\nparticipate in the artifact evaluation once their paper is accepted.</p>\n<p>Reviewing is single-blind.</p>\n<p>For all papers, an appendix can provide additional material such as details on<br>\nproofs or experiments. The appendix is not part of the page count and will<br>\nonly be read at the discretion of the reviewers. Thus, it should not contain<br>\ninformation necessary for the understanding and evaluation of the presented<br>\nwork.</p>\n<p>Papers will be accepted or rejected in the category in which they were<br>\nsubmitted and will not be moved between categories. At least one author of an<br>\naccepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference as a<br>\nregistered participant.</p>\n<h3>Proceedings</h3>\n<p>The conference proceedings will be published open access by Springer in the<br>\nLNCS series, as part of the FM subline, with gold open access.</p>\n<h3>Submissions</h3>\n<p>Submission link: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2026\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2026</a></p>\n<h3>Artifact evaluation</h3>\n<p>Authors of all accepted papers are invited to submit an artifact for<br>\nevaluation by the FM 2026 Artifact Evaluation Committee after the paper<br>\nnotification.
