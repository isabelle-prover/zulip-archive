Although the technology was originally invented to enable cryptocurrencies, it quickly found applications in several other domains.</p>\n<p>Blockchains may also provide support for Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are scripts of an ad-hoc programming language that are stored in the blockchain and that run on the network. They can interact with the ledger's data and update its state. These scripts can express the logic of possibly complex contracts between users of the blockchain. Thus, Smart Contracts can facilitate the economic activity of blockchain participants.</p>\n<p>Since blockchains are often used to store financial transactions, bugs may result in huge economic losses and thus it is now of utmost importance to have strong guarantees of the behaviour of blockchain software. These guarantees can be brought by using Formal Methods. Indeed, Blockchain software encompasses many topics of computer science where using Formal Methods techniques and tools is relevant: consensus algorithms to ensure the liveness and the security of the data on the chain, programming languages specifically designed to write smart contracts, cryptographic protocols, such as zero-knowledge proofs, used to ensure privacy, etc.</p>\n<p>This workshop is a forum to identify theoretical and practical approaches of formal methods for blockchain technology. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formal models of blockchain applications or concepts</li>\n<li>Formal methods for consensus protocols</li>\n<li>Formal methods for blockchain-specific cryptographic primitives or protocols</li>\n<li>Formal languages for Smart Contracts</li>\n<li>Verification of Smart Contracts</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>PC CO-CHAIRS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bruno Bernardo (Nomadic Labs, France) (<a href=\"mailto:bruno@nomadic-labs.com\">bruno@nomadic-labs.com</a>)</li>\n<li>Diego Marmsoler (University of Exeter, UK) (<a href=\"mailto:D.Marmsoler@exeter.ac.uk\">D.Marmsoler@exeter.ac.uk</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PC MEMBERS (TBA)</p>",
