Smart Contracts<br>\nare scripts of an ad-hoc programming language that are stored in the<br>\nblockchain and that run on the network. They can interact with the ledgerâ€™s<br>\ndata and update its state. These scripts can express the logic of possibly<br>\ncomplex contracts between users of the blockchain. Thus, Smart Contracts<br>\ncan facilitate the economic activity of blockchain participants.</p>\n<p>Since blockchains are often used to store financial transactions, bugs may<br>\nresult in huge economic losses and thus it is now of utmost importance to<br>\nhave strong guarantees of the behaviour of blockchain software. These<br>\nguarantees can be brought by using Formal Methods. Indeed, Blockchain software<br>\nencompasses many topics of computer science where using Formal Methods<br>\ntechniques and tools is relevant: consensus algorithms to ensure the liveness<br>\nand the security of the data on the chain, programming languages specifically<br>\ndesigned to write smart contracts, cryptographic protocols, such as<br>\nzero-knowledge proofs, used to ensure privacy, etc.</p>\n<p>This workshop is a forum to identify theoretical and practical approaches of<br>\nformal methods for Blockchain technology. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formal models of Blockchain applications or concepts</li>\n<li>Formal methods for consensus protocols</li>\n<li>Formal methods for Blockchain-specific cryptographic primitives or protocols</li>\n<li>Design and implementation of Smart Contract languages</li>\n<li>Verification of Smart Contracts</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submit original manuscripts (not published or considered elsewhere)<br>\nwith a page limit of 12 pages for full papers and 6 pages for short papers<br>\n(excluding bibliography and short appendix of up to 5 additional pages).</p>\n<p>Alternatively you may also submit an extended abstract of up to 2<br>\npages (excluding bibliography) summarizing your ongoing work in the area<br>\nof formal methods and blockchain. Authors of selected extended-abstracts<br>\nare invited to give a short lightning talk.</p>\n<p>Submission link: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmbc2024\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmbc2024</a></p>\n<p>Authors are encouraged to use LaTeX and prepare their submissions according<br>\nto the instructions and styling guides for OASIcs provided by Dagstuhl.</p>\n<p>Instructions for authors:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors#oasics\">https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors#oasics</a></p>\n<p>At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the<br>\npaper at the workshop as a registered participant.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the<br>\nprogram committee for quality and relevance.
