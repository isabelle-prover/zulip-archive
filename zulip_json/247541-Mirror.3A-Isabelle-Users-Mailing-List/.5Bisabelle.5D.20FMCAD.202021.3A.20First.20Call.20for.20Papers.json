FMCAD<br>\nprovides a leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for<br>\npresenting and discussing groundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical<br>\nresults, and tools for reasoning formally about computing systems. FMCAD<br>\ncovers formal aspects of computer-aided system design including<br>\nverification, specification, synthesis, and testing.<br>\nFMCAD employs a rigorous peer-review process. Accepted papers are published<br>\nby TU Wien Academic Press under a Creative Commons license (the authors<br>\nretain the copyright) and distributed through the IEEE XPlore digital<br>\nlibrary. There are no publication fees. At least one of the authors is<br>\nrequired to register for the conference and present the accepted paper. A<br>\nsmall number of outstanding FMCAD submissions will be considered for<br>\ninclusion in a Special Issue of the journal on Formal Methods in System<br>\nDesign (FMSD).</p>\n<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST</p>\n<p>FMCAD welcomes submission of papers reporting original research on advances<br>\nin all aspects of formal methods and their applications to computer- aided<br>\ndesign. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):* Model<br>\nchecking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and reduction,<br>\ncompositional methods, decision procedures at the bit- and word-level,<br>\nprobabilistic methods, combinations of deductive methods and decision<br>\nprocedures.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Synthesis and compilation for computer system descriptions, modeling,<br>\nspecification, and implementation languages, formal semantics of languages<br>\nand their subsets, model-based design, design derivation and<br>\ntransformation, correct-by-construction methods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application of formal and semi-formal methods to functional and<br>\nnon-functional specification and validation of hardware and software,<br>\nincluding timing and power modeling, verification of computing systems on<br>\nall levels of abstraction, system-level design and verification for<br>\nembedded systems, cyber-physical systems, automotive systems and other<br>\nsafety-critical systems, hardware-software co-design and verification, and<br>\ntransaction-level verification.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experience with the application of formal and semi-formal methods to<br>\nindustrial-scale designs; tools that represent formal verification<br>\nenablement, new features, or a substantial improvement in the automation of<br>\nformal methods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application of formal methods to verifying safety, connectivity and<br>\nsecurity properties of networks, distributed systems, smart contracts,<br>\nblock chains, and IoT devices.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference/?conf=fmcad21Two\">https://easychair.org/my/conference/?conf=fmcad21Two</a> categories of papers<br>\nare invited: Regular papers, and Tool &amp; Case Study papers. Regular papers<br>\nare expected to offer novel foundational ideas, theoretical results, or<br>\nalgorithmic improvements to existing methods, along with experimental<br>\nimpact validation where applicable. Tool &amp; Case Study papers are expected<br>\nto report on the design, implementation or use of verification (or related)<br>\ntechnology in a practically relevant context (which need not be<br>\nindustrial), and its impact on design processes.</p>\n<p>Both Regular and Tool &amp; Case study papers must use the IEEE Transactions<br>\nformat on letter-size paper with a 10-point font size. Papers in both<br>\ncategories can be either 8 pages (long) or 4 pages (short) in length not<br>\nincluding references. Short papers that describe emerging results,<br>\npractical experiences, or original ideas that can be described succinctly<br>\nare encouraged. Authors will be required to select an appropriate paper<br>\ncategory at abstract submission time. Submissions may contain an optional<br>\nappendix, which will not appear in the final version of the paper. The<br>\nreviewers should be able to assess the quality and the relevance of the<br>\nresults in the paper without reading the appendix.</p>\n<p>Submissions in both categories must contain original research that has not<br>\nbeen previously published, nor is concurrently submitted for publication.<br>\nAny partial overlap with published or concurrently submitted papers must be<br>\nclearly indicated. If experimental results are reported, authors are<br>\nstrongly encouraged to provide the reviewers access to their data at<br>\nsubmission time, so that results can be independently verified. The review<br>\nprocess is single blind.</p>\n<p>Authors of accepted contributions will be required to sign the FMCAD<br>\ncopyright transfer form found here: <a href=\"https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf\">https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf</a>.</p>\n<p>STUDENT FORUM</p>\n<p>Continuing the tradition of the previous years, FMCAD 2021 is hosting a<br>\nStudent Forum that provides a platform for graduate students at any career<br>\nstage to introduce their research to the wider Formal Methods community,<br>\nand solicit feedback.Submissions for the event must be short reports<br>\ndescribing research ideas or ongoing work that the student is currently<br>\npursuing, and must be within the scope of FMCAD. Work, part of which has<br>\nbeen previously published, will be considered; the novel aspect to be<br>\naddressed in future work must be clearly described in such cases. All<br>\nsubmissions will be reviewed by a select group of FMCAD program committee<br>\nmembers.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM CHAIRS:</p>\n<p>Ruzica Piskac, Yale University<br>\nMichael Whalen, Amazon, Inc. and the University of Minnesota</p>\n<p>PC:</p>\n<p>Erika Abraham, RWTH Aachen University<br>\nJade Alglave, University College London<br>\nPranav Ashar, Real Intent<br>\nPer Bjesse, Synopsys Inc.<br>\nRoderick Bloem, Graz University of Technology<br>\nIvana Cerna, Masaryk University<br>\nSupratik Chakraborty, IIT Bombay<br>\nSylvain Conchon, Universite Paris-Sud<br>\nLeonardo de Moura, Microsoft<br>\nRayna Dimitrova, CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security<br>\nGrigory Fedyukovich, Florida State University<br>\nArie Gurfinkel, University of Waterloo<br>\nLiana Hadarean, Amazon Web Services, Inc.<br>\nZiyad Hanna, Cadence Design Systems<br>\nFei He, Tsinghua University<br>\nMarijn Heule, Carnegie Mellon University<br>\nWarren Hunt, The University of Texas at Austin<br>\nAlexander Ivrii, IBM<br>\nDejan Jovanović, SRI International<br>\nAlan Jovic, University of Zagreb<br>\nLaura Kovacs, Vienna University of Technology<br>\nTon Chanh Le, Stevens Institute of Technology<br>\nRebekah Leslie-Hurd, Intel<br>\nKuldeep Meel, National University of Singapore<br>\nElizabeth Polgreen, University of California, Berkeley<br>\nAndrew Reynolds, University of Iowa<br>\nCristoph Scholl, University of Freiburg<br>\nNatasha Sharygina, Università della Svizzera italiana (USI Lugano,<br>\nSwitzerland)<br>\nAnna Slobodova, Centaur Technology<br>\nChristoph Sticksel, The Mathworks<br>\nMurali Talupur, Amazon Web Services, Inc.<br>\nJean-Baptiste Tristram, Boston College<br>\nYakir Vizel, Technion<br>\nThomas Wahl, Northeastern University<br>\nGeorg Weissenbacher, Vienna University of Technology<br>\nThomas Wies, New York University<br>\nValentin Wüstholz, ConsenSys<br>\nLenore Zuck, University of Illinois in Chicago</p>\n<p>STUDENT FORUM CHAIR: Mark Santolucito, Barnard College<br>\nPUBLICATION CHAIR: Georg Weissenbacher, TU Wien<br>\nSPONSORSHIP CHAIR: Daniel Schoepe, Amazon Web Services, Inc.</p>\n<p>FMCAD STEERING COMMITTEE:</p>\n<p>Clark Barrett, Stanford University, CA, USA<br>\nArmin Biere, Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria<br>\nGeorg Weissenbacher, TU Vienna, Austria<br>\nAnna Slobodova, Centaur Technology, TX, USA</p>",
