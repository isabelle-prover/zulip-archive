The <br>\nconference<br>\nencompasses a wide range of topics related to formal aspects of <br>\ncomputer-aided system<br>\ndesign, including verification, specification, synthesis, and testing <br>\nand provides<br>\na leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for presenting <br>\nand discussing<br>\ngroundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical results, and tools for <br>\nreasoning<br>\nformally about computing systems.</p>\n<h2>General Information</h2>\n<p>Conference Website: <a href=\"https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/\">https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/</a><br>\nConference Location: SRI Headquarters, Menlo Park, California, US<br>\nConference Dates: October 6 - October 10, 2025<br>\nFMCAD 2025 includes the FMCAD Student Forum <br>\n(<a href=\"https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/student_forum/\">https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/student_forum/</a>)<br>\nand is co-located with VSTTE 2025.</p>\n<h2>Topics of Interest</h2>\n<p>FMCAD welcomes submission of papers reporting original research on <br>\nadvances in all<br>\naspects of formal methods and their applications to computer-aided design.<br>\nTopics of interest include (but are not limited to):<br>\n*Model checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and <br>\nreduction,<br>\ncompositional methods, decision procedures at the bit- and word-level, <br>\nprobabilistic<br>\nmethods, combinations of deductive methods and decision procedures.<br>\n*Synthesis and compilation for computer system descriptions, modeling, <br>\nspecification,<br>\nand implementation languages, formal semantics of languages and their <br>\nsubsets, model-based<br>\ndesign, design derivation and transformation, correct-by-construction <br>\nmethods.<br>\n*Application of formal and semi-formal methods to functional and <br>\nnon-functional<br>\nspecification and validation of hardware and software, including timing <br>\nand power<br>\nmodeling, verification of computing systems on all levels of <br>\nabstraction, system-level<br>\ndesign and verification for embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, <br>\nautomotive<br>\nsystems and other safety-critical systems, hardware-software co-design <br>\nand verification,<br>\nand transaction-level verification.<br>\n*Experience with the application of formal and semi-formal methods to <br>\nindustrial-scale<br>\ndesigns; tools that represent formal verification enablement, introduce <br>\nnew features,<br>\nor substantially improve the automation of formal methods.<br>\n*Application of formal methods to verifying safety, connectivity and <br>\nsecurity properties<br>\nof networks, distributed systems, smart contracts, block chains, and IoT <br>\ndevices.<br>\n*Application of formal methods to the analysis of machine learning <br>\nsystems, and<br>\napplications of machine learning to enhance formal methods techniques.</p>\n<h2>Important Dates</h2>\n<p>*Abstract Submission Deadline: April 28, 2025 (extended from April 20, 2025)<br>\n*Paper Submission Deadline: May 5, 2025 (extended from April 27, 2025)<br>\n*Author Response: June 17 - June 19, 2025<br>\n*Author Notification: July 1, 2025<br>\nAll deadlines are 11:59 pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth)</p>\n<h3>FMCAD/VSTTE Program Outline</h3>\n<p>*Main VSTTE Day: October 6, 2025<br>\n*Joint FMCAD/VSTTE Tutorial Day: October 7, 2025<br>\n*Main FMCAD days: October 8 - October 10, 2025</p>\n<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>\n<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmcad2025\">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmcad2025</a><br>\nTwo categories of papers are invited: Regular papers, and Tool &amp; Case <br>\nStudy papers.<br>\n*<em>Regular papers</em>are expected to offer novel foundational ideas, <br>\ntheoretical results,<br>\nor algorithmic improvements to existing methods, along with experimental <br>\nimpact validation<br>\nwhere applicable.<br>\n*<em>Tool &amp; Case Study papers</em>are expected to report on the design, <br>\nimplementation<br>\nor use of verification (or related) technology in a practically relevant <br>\ncontext<br>\n(which need not be industrial), and its impact on design processes.<br>\nBoth Regular and Tool &amp; Case Study papers must use the IEEE Transactions <br>\nformat on<br>\nletter-size paper with a 10-point font size; preferably, use the FMCAD <br>\ntemplate for<br>\npapers. Papers in both categories can be either 8 pages (long) or 4 <br>\npages (short)<br>\nin length excluding references. Short papers that describe emerging <br>\nresults, practical<br>\nexperiences, or original ideas that can be described succinctly are <br>\nencouraged. Authors<br>\nwill be required to select an appropriate paper category at abstract <br>\nsubmission time.<br>\nSubmissions may contain an optional appendix, which will not appear in <br>\nthe final<br>\nversion of the paper. The reviewers should be able to assess the quality <br>\nand the<br>\nrelevance of the results in the paper without reading the appendix.<br>\nSubmissions in all categories must contain original research that has <br>\nnot been previously<br>\npublished, nor is concurrently submitted for publication. Any partial <br>\noverlap with<br>\npublished or concurrently submitted papers must be clearly indicated.<br>\nFMCAD employs a rigorous peer-review process and each submission will be <br>\nreviewed<br>\nby at least four members of the program committee. The review process is <br>\nsingle-blind.<br>\nThe review process will incorporate a feedback and rebuttal period <br>\nduring which authors<br>\nwill have the opportunity to formally respond to reviewer comments.<br>\n<strong>New - Artifact Evaluation:</strong>FMCAD 2025 introduces optional artifact <br>\nevaluation<br>\nto enhance transparency and the usability of research outcomes. Authors <br>\nreporting<br>\nexperimental results are strongly encouraged to publish their final data <br>\nin a long-term<br>\nrepository (e.g. zenodo (<a href=\"https://zenodo.org\">https://zenodo.org</a>)). With artifacts serving as <br>\nsupplementary<br>\nevidence, high-quality artifacts can improve the likelihood of paper <br>\nacceptance.<br>\nArtifact evaluation will be integrated into the main review process, <br>\nwith one selected<br>\nprogram committee member assessing the quality of the artifact alongside <br>\nthe paper.<br>\nAccepted artifacts require a DOI and will be clearly identified in the <br>\npublished<br>\npaper. Details are available on the Artifacts Page <br>\n(<a href=\"https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/cfa\">https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/cfa</a>).<br>\nAccepted papers are published by TU Wien Academic Press under a Creative <br>\nCommons<br>\nlicense (the authors retain the copyright) and distributed through the <br>\nIEEE XPlore<br>\ndigital library. IEEE CEDA is a technical co-sponsor of FMCAD. There are <br>\nno publication<br>\nfees. Authors of accepted contributions will be required to sign the <br>\nFMCAD copyright<br>\ntransfer form found here: <a href=\"https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf\">https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf</a>.<br>\nFor each accepted paper, at least one unique author must register for <br>\nthe conference.<br>\nMoreover, authors of accepted papers ensure that at least one of them <br>\nwill attend<br>\nthe conference and present the work.</p>\n<h2>Student Forum</h2>\n<p>Continuing the tradition of the previous years, FMCAD 2025 will host a <br>\nStudent Forum<br>\nthat provides a platform for graduate students at any career stage to <br>\nintroduce their<br>\nresearch to the wider Formal Methods community, and solicit feedback.<br>\nSubmissions for the student forum must be short reports describing <br>\nresearch ideas<br>\nor ongoing work that the student is currently pursuing, and must be <br>\nwithin the scope<br>\nof FMCAD. Work that has been partly published previously might be <br>\nconsidered; the<br>\nnovel aspect to be addressed in future work must be clearly described in <br>\nsuch cases.<br>\nAll submissions will be reviewed by a selected group of FMCAD student <br>\nforum committee<br>\nmembers. Details are available on the Student Forum Page <br>\n(<a href=\"https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/student_forum\">https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/student_forum</a>).</p>\n<h2>FMCAD 2025 Committees</h2>\n<h3>Program Chair</h3>\n<p>Ahmed Irfan, SRI, CA, USA<br>\nDaniela Kaufmann, TU Wien, Austria</p>\n<h3>Program Committee</h3>\n<p>Guy Amir, Cornell University<br>\nErika Ábrahám, RWTH Aachen University<br>\nKshitij Bansal, Google<br>\nHaniel Barbosa, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais<br>\nPer Bjesse, Synopsys Inc.<br>\nNikolaj Bjørner, Microsoft<br>\nMartin Blicha, University of Lugano<br>\nRoderick Bloem, Graz University of Technology<br>\nRayna Dimitrova, CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security<br>\nSupratik Chakraborty, IIT Bombay<br>\nAleksandar Chakarov, Phase Change Software LLC<br>\nPascal Fontaine, Université de Liège<br>\nKatalin Fazekas, TU Wien<br>\nDivya Gopinath, NASA Ames (KBR Inc.)<br>\nAlberto Griggio, Fondazione Bruno Kessler<br>\nArie Gurfinkel, University of Waterloo<br>\nLiana Hadarean, Amazon Web Services<br>\nPaula Herber, University of Münster<br>\nOsman Hasan, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)<br>\nMarijn Heule, Carnegie Mellon University<br>\nAntti Hyvärinen, Certora<br>\nAlexey Ignatiev, Monash University<br>\nMitesh Jain, Rivos Inv.<br>\nMikolas Janota, Czech Technical University in Prague<br>\nSusmit Jha, SRI International<br>\nMartin Jonas, Masaryk University<br>\nJianwen Li, East China Normal University<br>\nEnrico Magnago, Amazon Web Services<br>\nSergio Mover, Ecole Polytechnique<br>\nAntonina Nepeivoda, Program System Institute of RAS<br>\nAina Niemetz, Stanford University<br>\nMathias Preiner, Stanford University<br>\nStefan Ratschan, Czech Academy of Sciences<br>\nKristin Rozier, Iowa State University<br>\nPhilipp Rümmer, University of Regensburg and Uppsala University<br>\nMark Santolucito, Barnard College<br>\nChristoph Scholl, University of Freiburg<br>\nMartina Seidl, Johannes Kepler University Linz<br>\nNatarajan Shankar, SRI International<br>\nNatasha Sharygina, University of Lugano<br>\nAnna Slobodova, ARM<br>\nMate Soos, Ethereum Foundation<br>\nChristoph Sticksel, The MathWorks<br>\nNestan Tsiskaridze, Stanford University<br>\nAshish Tiwari, Microsoft<br>\nGeorg Weissenbacher, TU Wien<br>\nAndrew Wu, Amherst College<br>\nNisansala Yatapanage, Australian National University<br>\nEmily Yu, Institute of Science and Technology Austria<br>\nCunxi Yu, University of Maryland<br>\nZhen Zhang, Utah State University<br>\nHongce Zhang, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)<br>\nYoni Zohar, Bar-Ilan University</p>\n<h3>Local Chair</h3>\n<p>Stéphane Graham-Lengrand, SRI, CA, USA</p>\n<h3>Registration Chair</h3>\n<p>Jenny McNeill, SRI, CA, USA</p>\n<h3>Student Forum Chairs</h3>\n<p>Tanja Schindler, University of Basel, Switzerland<br>\nLee A.
