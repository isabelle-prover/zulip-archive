FMICS brings together <br>\nscientists and engineers who are active in the area of formal methods <br>\nand interested in exchanging their experiences in the industrial usage <br>\nof these methods. The FMICS conference series also strives to promote <br>\nresearch and development for the improvement of formal methods and tools <br>\nfor industrial applications.</p>\n<p>FMICS is the ERCIM Working Group conference on Formal Methods for <br>\nIndustrial Critical Systems, and it is the key conference in the <br>\nintersection of industrial applications and Formal Methods.</p>\n<p>Topics of Interest:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches that bring together <br>\nformal methods and industrial applications.<br>\n     * Formal specification, including specification elicitation, <br>\nvalidation, debugging, sanity checking, revision, coverage, and <br>\nexplainability.<br>\n     * Case studies and experience reports on industrial applications of <br>\nformal methods, focusing on lessons learned or identification of new <br>\nresearch directions.<br>\n     * Methods, techniques, and tools to support automated analysis, <br>\ncertification, debugging, learning, optimization, and transformation of <br>\ncomplex, distributed, real-time, embedded, mobile, and autonomous systems.<br>\n     * Verification and validation methods (model checking, theorem <br>\nproving, SAT/SMT constraint solving, abstract interpretation, etc.) that <br>\naddress shortcomings of existing methods with respect to their <br>\nindustrial applicability (e.g., scalability and usability issues, tool <br>\nqualification, and certification).<br>\n     * Transfer to industry and impact of adoption of formal methods on <br>\nthe development process and associated costs in industry. Application of <br>\nformal methods in standardization and industrial forums.</p>\n<p>Important Dates:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Abstract Submission: 10 Apr 2026<br>\nPaper Submission:    17 Apr 2026<br>\nPaper Notifications:  1 Jun 2026<br>\nCamera-ready Papers: 15 Jun 2026<br>\nConference:         2-4 Sep 2026</p>\n<p>Submission Details:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Papers must describe original research work and results. Submitted <br>\npapers must not have previously appeared in a journal or conference with <br>\npublished proceedings and must not be concurrently submitted to any <br>\nother peer-reviewed workshop, symposium, conference, or archival <br>\njournal. Any partial overlap with any such published or concurrently <br>\nsubmitted paper must be clearly indicated.</p>\n<p>Submissions should clearly motivate relevance to industrial <br>\napplications. Case study papers should identify lessons learned, <br>\nvalidate theoretical results (such as scalability of methods), and <br>\nprovide specific motivation for further research and development.</p>\n<p>Papers should not exceed 15 pages (excluding references) formatted <br>\naccording to the Springer author guidelines LNCS style. Any appendices <br>\n(beyond the above page limit) might not be considered in the review <br>\nprocess. All submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of <br>\nthe Programme Committee, which will make a selection among the <br>\nsubmissions based on the novelty, soundness, and applicability of the <br>\npresented ideas and results. Papers must be written in English and <br>\nsubmitted in PDF format at the EasyChair submission site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmics2026\">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmics2026</a></p>\n<p>For all papers with experimental results, we strongly recommend <br>\nproviding reviewers with an artifact that they can use to reproduce <br>\nresults, e.g., via a paper website.</p>\n<p>ERCIM Award:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As in best FMICS tradition, the paper with the best contributions to <br>\nSoftware Science and Technology will be honoured with the EASST ERCIM award.</p>\n<p>Keynote Speakers:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Julia Badger, NASA Johnson Space Center<br>\nColin O’Halloran, D-RisQ</p>\n<p>Organizers:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Peter Gorm Larsen (Aarhus University, Denmark)<br>\nKristin Yvonne Rozier (Iowa State University, USA)</p>\n<p>Programme Committee:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Jefferson Andrade, Instituto Federal do Espírito Santo<br>\nRamesh Bharadwaj, U.S. Navy<br>\nJohn Fitzgerald, Newcastle University<br>\nJohn Hatcliff, Kansas State University<br>\nJoseph Kiniry, Galois, Inc.<br>\nTsutomu Kobayashi, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)<br>\nTiziana Margaria, University of Limerick<br>\nMieke Massink, CNR-ISTI, Pisa, Italy<br>\nStephan Merz, INRIA Nancy<br>\nStefan Mitsch, DePaul University<br>\nRosemary Monahan, Maynooth University<br>\nTomohiro Oda, Software Research Associates, Inc.<br>\nClaudio Pinello, Collins Aerospace<br>\nAnne Remke, WWU Münster<br>\nCristina Seceleanu, Mälardalen University<br>\nMartina Seidl, Johannes Kepler University Linz<br>\nGiulia Sindoni, University of Leeds<br>\nLaura Titolo, Code Metal<br>\nChristoph Torens, German Aerospace Center, Institute of Flight Systems<br>\nJaco van de Pol, Aarhus University and University of Twente<br>\nMarcel Verhoef, European Space Agency<br>\nVirginie Wiels, ONERA / DTIS<br>\nAnton Wijs, Eindhoven University of Technology</p>\n<p>-- </p>\n<hr>\n<p>__<br>\n            /\\                       \\ \\_____<br>\n           /  \\                   ###[==_____&gt;<br>\n          /    \\                     /_/      __<br>\n         /  __  \\                             \\ \\_____<br>\n         | (  ) |                          ###[==_____&gt;<br>\n        /| /\\/\\ |\\                            /_/<br>\n       / | |  | | \\<br>\n      /  |=|==|=|  \\       Kristin Yvonne Rozier, Ph.D.<br>\n    /    | |  | |    \\     Associate Professor, Iowa State Univ<br>\n   / USA | ~||~ |NASA \\    Departments of Aerospace Engineering,<br>\n  |______|  ~~  |______|     Computer Science, Mathematics, and<br>\n         (__||__)            Electrical and Computer Engineering<br>\n         /_\\  /_\\<br>\n         !!!  !!!https://laboratory.temporallogic.org</p>",
