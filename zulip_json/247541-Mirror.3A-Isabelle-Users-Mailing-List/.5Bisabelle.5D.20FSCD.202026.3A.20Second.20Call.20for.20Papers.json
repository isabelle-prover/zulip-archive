Building on two communities, RTA (Rewriting Techniques <br>\nand Applications) and TLCA (Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications), FSCD <br>\nembraces their core topics and broadens their scope to closely related <br>\nareas in logic, models of computation, semantics and verification in new <br>\nchallenging areas.</p>\n<p>The suggested, but not exclusive, list of topics for submission is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Calculi:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Rewriting systems (string, term, higher-order, nominal, graph, <br>\nconditional, modulo, infinitary, etc.);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lambda calculus;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logics (first-order, higher-order, equational, modal, linear, <br>\nclassical, constructive, etc.);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proof theory (natural deduction, sequent calculus, proof nets, etc.);</p>\n</li>\n<li>Type theory and logical frameworks;</li>\n<li>Homotopy type theory;</li>\n<li>\n<p>Process algebras (synchronous, asynchronous, static and dynamic <br>\nsemantics with and without time, etc.);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Quantum calculi.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Methods in Computation and Deduction:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Type systems (polymorphism, dependent, recursive, intersection, <br>\nsession, etc.);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Induction, coinduction;</p>\n</li>\n<li>Matching, unification, completion, orderings;</li>\n<li>Strategies (normalisation, completeness, etc.);</li>\n<li>Tree automata;</li>\n<li>Model building and model checking;</li>\n<li>Proof search and theorem proving;</li>\n<li>Constraint solving and decision procedures.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Semantics:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Operational semantics and abstract machines;</li>\n<li>Game Semantics and applications;</li>\n<li>Domain theory and categorical models;</li>\n<li>Quantitative models (timing, probabilities, etc.);</li>\n<li>Quantum computation and emerging models of computation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Algorithmic Analysis and Transformations of Formal Systems:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Type inference and type checking;</li>\n<li>Abstract Interpretation;</li>\n<li>Complexity analysis and implicit computational complexity;</li>\n<li>\n<p>Checking termination, confluence, derivational complexity and related <br>\nproperties;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Symbolic computation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Tools and Applications:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Programming and proof environments;</li>\n<li>Verification tools;</li>\n<li>Proof assistants and interactive theorem provers;</li>\n<li>Applications in industry;</li>\n<li>Applications of formal systems in other sciences;</li>\n<li>Applications of formal systems in education.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Formal Systems for Modelling and Verification in new challenging areas:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Certification;</li>\n<li>Security;</li>\n<li>Blockchain;</li>\n<li>Databases;</li>\n<li>Deep learning and machine learning algorithms;</li>\n<li>Planning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PUBLICATION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The proceedings will be published as an electronic volume in the Leibniz <br>\nInternational Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) of Schloss Dagstuhl. <br>\nAll LIPIcs proceedings are open access.</p>\n<p>SPECIAL ISSUE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There will be a special issue of Logical Methods in Computer Science of <br>\nselected papers. More details will be provided later.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The submission site is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://submissions.floc26.org/fscd/\">https://submissions.floc26.org/fscd/</a></p>\n<p>Submissions must be formatted using the LIPIcs style files <br>\n(<a href=\"https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author\">https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author</a>).</p>\n<p>Submissions can be made in two categories: regular research papers and <br>\nsystem descriptions. Please indicate in the submission page in HotCRP <br>\nand in the first page of the paper in which category you are submitting. <br>\nRegular research papers are limited to 15 pages, excluding references <br>\nand appendices. They must present original research which is unpublished <br>\nand not submitted elsewhere. System descriptions are limited to 15 <br>\npages, excluding references. Shorter papers are welcome and will be <br>\ngiven equal consideration. A system description must present new <br>\nsoftware tools, or significantly new versions of such tools, in which <br>\nFSCD topics play an important role. An archive of the code with <br>\ninstructions on how to install and run the tool must be submitted. In <br>\naddition, a webpage where the system can be experimented with should be <br>\nprovided.</p>\n<p>One author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present <br>\nthe work in person at the conference. In case that this is not possible, <br>\nonline presentation will be arranged, but in person registration will <br>\nstill be required.</p>\n<p>BEST PAPER AWARD BY JUNIOR RESEARCHERS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The programme committee will select a paper in which at least one author <br>\nis a junior researcher, i.e., either a student or someone whose PhD <br>\naward date is less than three years from the first day of the meeting. <br>\nWhen submitting the paper, other authors should declare to the PC Chair <br>\nthat at least 50% of contribution is made by the junior researcher(s).</p>\n<p>CODE OF CONDUCT</p>\n<hr>\n<p>FSCD 2026 stands by the FLoC 2026 Code of conduct <br>\n(<a href=\"https://www.floc26.org/policies\">https://www.floc26.org/policies</a>).</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE CHAIR</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Frank Pfenning         Carnegie Mellon University</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Alejandro Díaz-Caro    INRIA (LORIA) &amp; UNQuilmes, France &amp; Argentina<br>\nAlexis Saurin          CNRS &amp; University Paris Cité, France<br>\nAlwen Tiu              Australian National University, Australia<br>\nAndreas Abel           Chalmers University of Technology &amp; University of <br>\nGothenburg, Sweden<br>\nAndreia Mordido        University of Lisbon, Portugal<br>\nCynthia Kop            Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands<br>\nDaniel Gratzer         Aarhus University, Denmark<br>\nDominic Orchard        University of Kent &amp; University of Cambridge, UK<br>\nElaine Pimentel        University College London, UK<br>\nKristina Sojakova      Free University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands<br>\nKwangkeun Yi           Seoul National University, Korea<br>\nLiron Cohen            Ben-Gurion University, Israel<br>\nMałgorzata Biernacka   University of Wrocław, Poland<br>\nNao Hirokawa           JAIST, Japan<br>\nNatarajan Shankar      SRI International, USA<br>\nNiki Vazou             IMDEA Madrid, Spain<br>\nPaul Downen            UMass Lowell, USA<br>\nPeter Selinger         Dalhousie University, Canada<br>\nSalvador Lucas         Technical University of Valencia, Spain<br>\nSarah Winkler          Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Italy<br>\nUgo Dal Lago           University of Bologna, Italy</p>\n<p>CONFERENCE CHAIR</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Sandra Alves           University of Porto</p>\n<p>WORKSHOPS CHAIR</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Cynthia Kop            Radboud University Nijmegen</p>\n<p>FSCD STEERING COMMITTEE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Chair:<br>\n   Patrick Baillot      CNRS, University of Lille<br>\nPast Chair:<br>\n   Herman Geuvers       Radboud University Nijmegen<br>\nWorkshop Chair:<br>\n   Cynthia Kop          Radboud University Nijmegen<br>\nPublicity Chair:<br>\n   Carsten Fuhs         Birkbeck University of London<br>\nPast PC Chairs:<br>\n   Marco Gaboardi       Boston University<br>\n   Femke van Raamsdonk  VU Amsterdam<br>\n   Jakob Rehof          TU Dortmund<br>\n   Maribel Fernández    King's College London<br>\nElected Members:<br>\n   Guilio Manzonetto    Université Paris Cité<br>\n   Ugo Dal Lago         University of Bologna<br>\n   Sandra Alves         University of Porto<br>\n   Jürgen Giesl         RWTH Aachen</p>",
