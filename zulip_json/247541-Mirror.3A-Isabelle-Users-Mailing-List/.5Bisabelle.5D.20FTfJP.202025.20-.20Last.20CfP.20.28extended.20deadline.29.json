Modern programming languages (such as C#, Java, Kotlin, Rust, or Scala) are interesting targets for formal techniques due to their ubiquity and wide user base, stable and well-defined interfaces and platforms, and powerful (but also complex) libraries. New languages and applications in this space are continually arising, resulting in new programming languages research challenges.</p>\n<p>Work on formal techniques and tools and on the formal underpinnings of programming languages themselves naturally complement each other.<br>\nThe Formal Techniques for Judicious Programming (FTfJP) workshop is an established workshop which has run annually since 1999 alongside ECOOP, with the goal of bringing together people working in both fields. Webpages for previous workshops in this series are available at <a href=\"https://ftfjp.github.io/\">https://ftfjp.github.io/</a>.</p>\n<p>Example topics of interest include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Language design and semantics</li>\n<li>Type systems</li>\n<li>Concurrency and new application domains</li>\n<li>Specification and verification of program properties</li>\n<li>Program analysis (static or dynamic)</li>\n<li>Program synthesis</li>\n<li>Security</li>\n<li>Pearls (programs or proofs)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FTfJP welcomes submissions on technical contributions, case studies, experience reports, challenge proposals, tools, and position papers.</p>\n<p>=== Paper Categories ===</p>\n<p>We solicit two categories of papers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Full Papers (12 pages, excluding references) present a technical contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. We welcome both complete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is particularly welcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate interesting discussions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short Papers (6 pages, excluding references) should advocate a promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely to stimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage e.g. established researchers to set out a personal vision, and beginning researchers to present a planned path to a PhD.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the workshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed and will be evaluated based on their clarity and their potential to generate interesting discussions. Reviewing will be single blind, i.e, submissions need not be anonymized.</p>\n<p>The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in which a wide range of people share their expertise, from experienced researchers to beginning PhD students.</p>\n<p>=== Submission guidelines ===</p>\n<p>Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS papers.<br>\nSubmissions should be made via EasyChair: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ftfjp2025\">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ftfjp2025</a>.<br>\nThere is no need to indicate the paper category (long/short).</p>\n<p>The accepted papers will be published as post-proceedings in JOT (Journal of Object Technology), though authors will be able to opt out of this publication, if desired. At least one author of an accepted paper must register to the workshop by the early registration date and attend the workshop to present the work and participate in the discussions.</p>\n<p>=== Steering Committee ===</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rosemary Monahan, National University of Ireland, Ireland (SC chair)</li>\n<li>Radu Grigore, Facebook, United Kingdom</li>\n<li>Gary T.
