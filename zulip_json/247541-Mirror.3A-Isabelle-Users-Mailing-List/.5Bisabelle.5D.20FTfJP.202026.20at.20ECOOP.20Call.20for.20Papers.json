The Formal Techniques for Judicious Programming (FTfJP) workshop is an established workshop which has run annually since 1999 alongside ECOOP, with the goal of bringing together people working in both fields.</p>\n<p>Important dates</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission deadline: 18th February, 2026</li>\n<li>Notification: 1st April, 2026</li>\n<li>Camera ready: 30th April, 2026</li>\n<li>Workshop: 30th June, 2026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Paper categories</p>\n<p>We solicit two categories of papers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full Papers (12 pages, excluding references) present a technical contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. We welcome both complete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is particularly welcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate interesting discussions.</li>\n<li>Short Papers (6 pages, excluding references) should advocate a promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely to stimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage e.g. established researchers to set out a personal vision, and beginning researchers to present a planned path to a PhD.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the workshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed and will be evaluated based on their clarity and their potential to generate interesting discussions. Reviewing will be single blind, i.e, submissions need not be anonymized.</p>\n<p>The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in which a wide range of people share their expertise, including experienced researchers, industry practitioners, and early-stage PhD students.</p>\n<p>Submission guidelines</p>\n<p>Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for ACM sigplan papers (\\documentclass[sigplan,screen]{acmart}), see <a href=\"https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/\">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/</a> for details. Submissions should be made via Easychair (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ftfjp2026\">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ftfjp2026</a>). There is no need to indicate the paper category (long/short).</p>\n<p>The accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library, though authors will be able to opt out of this publication, if desired. At least one author of an accepted paper must register to the workshop by the early registration date and attend the workshop to present the work and participate in the discussions.</p>\n<p>Lightning talks</p>\n<p>In addition to papers, we also invite lightning talks (~10 minutes) on topics related to the workshop goals that allow participants to present preliminary work in academia and industry. Examples include but not limited to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposing a research problem/challenge</li>\n<li>Presenting a tool/demo</li>\n<li>Presenting a short summary of a work already published elsewhere</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission information will be announced closer to the workshop, but we plan it to be a lightweight process (e.g. title/abstract submission via Google Form).</p>\n<p>Invited speakers<br>\nBart Jacobs (KU Leuven)<br>\nJulien Lange (Royal Holloway, University of London)</p>\n<p>Akos Hajdu<br>\nSoftware engineer<br>\nMeta/WhatsApp<br>\nPC Chair</p>",
