The Formal Techniques for <br>\nJudicious Programming (FTfJP) workshop is an established workshop which <br>\nhas run annually since 1999 alongside ECOOP, with the goal of bringing <br>\ntogether people working in both fields.</p>\n<p><em>Paper categories</em></p>\n<p>We solicit two categories of papers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Full Papers (12 pages, excluding references) present a technical <br>\ncontribution, case study, or detailed experience report. We welcome both <br>\ncomplete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is particularly <br>\nwelcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate interesting <br>\ndiscussions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short Papers (6 pages, excluding references) should advocate a <br>\npromising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely to <br>\nstimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage e.g. established <br>\nresearchers to set out a personal vision, and beginning researchers to <br>\npresent a planned path to a PhD.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the <br>\nworkshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed and will be evaluated based <br>\non their clarity and their potential to generate interesting <br>\ndiscussions. Reviewing will be single blind, i.e, submissions need not <br>\nbe anonymized.</p>\n<p>The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in <br>\nwhich a wide range of people share their expertise, including <br>\nexperienced researchers, industry practitioners, and early-stage PhD <br>\nstudents.</p>\n<p><em>Submission guidelines</em></p>\n<p>Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for ACM sigplan <br>\npapers (\\documentclass[sigplan,screen]{acmart}), see <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/\">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/</a> for details. Submissions <br>\nshould be made via Easychair <br>\n(<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ftfjp2026\">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ftfjp2026</a>). There is no need to <br>\nindicate the paper category (long/short).</p>\n<p>The accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library, though <br>\nauthors will be able to opt out of this publication, if desired. At <br>\nleast one author of an accepted paper must register to the workshop by <br>\nthe early registration date and attend the workshop to present the work <br>\nand participate in the discussions.</p>\n<p><em>Lightning talks</em></p>\n<p>In addition to papers, we also invite lightning talks (~10 minutes) on <br>\ntopics related to the workshop goals that allow participants to present <br>\npreliminary work in academia and industry. Examples include but not <br>\nlimited to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposing a research problem/challenge</li>\n<li>Presenting a tool/demo</li>\n<li>Presenting a short summary of a work already published elsewhere</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission information will be announced closer to the workshop, but we <br>\nplan it to be a lightweight process (e.g. title/abstract submission via <br>\nGoogle Form).</p>\n<p><em>Important dates</em><br>\n*<br>\n*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission deadline: 18th February, 2026</li>\n<li>Notification: 1st April, 2026</li>\n<li>Camera ready: 30th April, 2026</li>\n<li>Workshop: 30th June, 2026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Akos Hajdu<br>\nSoftware engineer<br>\nMeta/WhatsApp<br>\nPC Chair</p>",
