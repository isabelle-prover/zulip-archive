Let me use this opportunity<br>\ngive a little feedback (I am using Isabelle 2025 under Windows):</p>\n<p>* Isabelle does not start if other programs opened by Isabelle are<br>\nstill running, e.g. manuals.<br>\n    * How do I call Isabelle's cygwin from jEdit (or somehow more<br>\ndirectly)?</p>\n<p>NO BIBLATEX-SUPPORT</p>\n<p>* </p>\n<p>No command biblatex_file. As far as I can see, the essential definitions<br>\nfor this are in Pure/General/bibtex.scala. IF THERE IS INTEREST, I WOULD<br>\nBE HAPPY TO CREATE A BIBLATEX.SCALA. <br>\n    * </p>\n<p>It took me a working day and AI to figure out how to finally include<br>\nBibLaTeX. Ideally, once a biblatex_file command is called, the build<br>\nfile should be automatically adjusted so that biber is called. </p>\n<p>DOCUMENT PANEL</p>\n<p>* </p>\n<p>gives no error feedback when sessions are not loaded in the ROOT file<br>\n(in contrast to the command line). <br>\n    * </p>\n<p>doesn't create a folder with files, like the command line does. Why this<br>\ndifference? Shouldn't there be an option to switch between both<br>\nbehaviours? </p>\n<p>ROOT AND ROOT FILES</p>\n<p>* </p>\n<p>There seems to be no convenient way to change the root file by a command<br>\nlike document_root = root_luckhardt.tex. <br>\n    * </p>\n<p>When end-of-line characters in BOOT files are messed up, only a general<br>\n\"Corrupted character\" message is coming. Ideally, there would just a<br>\nbutton to be hit to fix the problem. </p>\n<p>Yours<br>\nDaniel</p>\n<p>-- <br>\nDaniel Luckhardt<br>\nSenior Research Fellow<br>\nUniversity College London</p>",
