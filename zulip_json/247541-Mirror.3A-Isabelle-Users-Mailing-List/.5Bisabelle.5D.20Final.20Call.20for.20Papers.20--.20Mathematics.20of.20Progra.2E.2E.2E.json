Topics of interest range from algorithmics to<br>\nsupport for program construction in programming languages and systems.<br>\nTypical areas include type systems, program analysis and transformation,<br>\nprogramming language semantics, security, and program logics. The notion<br>\nof a 'program' is interpreted broadly, ranging from algorithms to hardware.</p>\n<p>Theoretical contributions are welcome, provided that their relevance<br>\nto program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome,<br>\nprovided that their mathematical basis is evident. We also encourage<br>\nthe submission of 'programming pearls' that present elegant and<br>\ninstructive examples of the mathematics of program construction.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION:</p>\n<p>Submission is in two stages. Abstracts (plain text, maximum 250 words)<br>\nmust be submitted by 10th April 2022. Full papers (pdf, formatted using<br>\nthe llncs.sty style file for LaTex) must be submitted by 17th April 2022.<br>\nThere is no prescribed page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.<br>\nBoth abstracts and papers will be submitted using EasyChair.</p>\n<p>Papers must present previously unpublished work, and not be submitted<br>\nconcurrently to any other publication venue. Submissions will be<br>\nevaluated by the program committee according to their relevance,<br>\ncorrectness, significance, originality, and clarity. Each submission<br>\nshould explain its contributions in both general and technical terms,<br>\nclearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is<br>\nsignificant, and comparing it with previous work. Accepted papers must<br>\nbe presented in person at the conference by one of the authors.</p>\n<p>The proceedings of MPC 2022 will be published in the Lecture Notes<br>\nin Computer Science (LNCS) series, as with all previous instances<br>\nof the conference.  Authors of accepted papers will be expected to<br>\ntransfer copyright to Springer for this purpose.</p>\n<p>After the conference, authors of the best papers from MPC 2022<br>\nwill be invited to submit revised versions to a special<br>\nissue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP).</p>\n<p>For any queries about submission please contact the program chair,<br>\nEkaterina Komendantskaya &lt;<a href=\"mailto:ek19@hw.ac.uk\">ek19@hw.ac.uk</a>&gt; or<br>\npublicity chair Matthew Daggitt &lt;<a href=\"mailto:M.Daggitt@hw.ac.uk\">M.Daggitt@hw.ac.uk</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>KEYNOTE SPEAKERS:</p>\n<p>Daniela Petrisan         University Paris Diderot, France</p>\n<p>Conor McBride           University of Strathclyde, UK</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE:</p>\n<p>Georg Struth                  University of Sheffield, UK</p>\n<p>Ana Sokolova                 University of Salzburg, Austria</p>\n<p>Annabelle McIver         Macquerie University, Australia</p>\n<p>Jacques Carette            McMaster University, Canada</p>\n<p>Shin-Cheng Mu             Academia Sinica, Taiwan</p>\n<p>Jose Oliveira                  University of Minho, Portugal</p>\n<p>Johan Jeuring                Utrecht University, Netherlands</p>\n<p>Ambrus Kaposi              Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary</p>\n<p>Henning Basold             Leiden University, Netherlands</p>\n<p>Peter Hoefner               Australian National University, Australia</p>\n<p>Grant Passmore            Imandra, USA</p>\n<p>Kathrin Stark                 Princeton University, USA</p>\n<p>Philip Saville                  University of Oxford, UK</p>\n<p>William Byrd                 University of Arizona, USA</p>\n<p>Andrea Costea             National University of Singapore, Singapore</p>\n<p>Radu Mardare              University of Strathclyde, UK</p>\n<p>Patricia Johann            Appalachian State University, USA</p>\n<p>Aurore Alcolei             University of Bologna, Italy</p>\n<p>Abdulaziz Mohammad      TU Munich, Germany</p>\n<p>CONFERENCE VENUE:</p>\n<p>The conference will be held at the Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State<br>\nUniversity (TSU), which is the oldest and largest educational and<br>\nresearch institution not only in Georgia, but also in the South Caucasus.<br>\nThe venue is located in the city center, with many hotels, pubs,<br>\nrestaurants, parks, other attractions (zoo, theaters, cinemas, opera,<br>\netc.) within walking distance.</p>\n<p>Tbilisi International Airport is 15 km away from the city and offers<br>\ndirect connections to more than 30 destinations in Europe, Asia, and the<br>\nMiddle East. From the airport, the city can be reached by bus or taxi.<br>\nAnother option is to  fly to Kutaisi in the west of Georgia, where low<br>\nbudget air companies  (such as WizzAir) are operating. A shuttle bus from<br>\nthe Kutaisi airport to Tbilisi takes about 3 hours.</p>\n<p>Georgia allows visa-free entry for nearly 100 countries around the world.<br>\nFurther details may be found at<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://www.geoconsul.gov.ge/HtmlPage/Html/View?id=956&amp;lang=Eng\">https://www.geoconsul.gov.ge/HtmlPage/Html/View?id=956&amp;lang=Eng</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>LOCAL ORGANISERS:</p>\n<p>Besik Dundua               International Black Sea University</p>\n<p>For any queries about local issues please contact the local organiser,<br>\nBesik Dundua &lt;<a href=\"mailto:bdundua@ibsu.edu.ge\">bdundua@ibsu.edu.ge</a>&gt;.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Founded in 1821, Heriot-Watt is a leader in ideas and solutions.
