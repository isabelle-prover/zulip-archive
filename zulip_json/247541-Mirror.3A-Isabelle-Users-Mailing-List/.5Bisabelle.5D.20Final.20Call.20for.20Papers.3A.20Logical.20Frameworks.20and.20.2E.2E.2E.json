Their<br>\ndesign, implementation and their use in reasoning tasks, ranging from<br>\nthe correctness of software to the properties of formal systems,<br>\nhave been the focus of considerable research over the last two decades.<br>\nThis workshop will bring together designers, implementors and<br>\npractitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and<br>\nutility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable<br>\nbinding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the<br>\nexpressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning process.</p>\n<p>LFMTP 2023 will provide researchers a forum to present state-of-the-art<br>\ntechniques and discuss progress in areas such as the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming languages,<br>\n  logical systems and related formally specified systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable<br>\n  binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning about,<br>\n  datatypes defined from binding signatures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and<br>\n  associated reasoning techniques, including inductive types of higher<br>\n  dimension in homotopy type theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Graphical languages for building proofs, applications in geometry,<br>\n  equational reasoning and category theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New theory contributions: canonical and substructural frameworks,<br>\n  contextual frameworks, proof-theoretic foundations supporting<br>\n  binders, functional programming over logical frameworks,<br>\n  homotopy and cubical type theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of logical frameworks: proof-carrying architectures,<br>\n  proof exchange and transformation, program refactoring, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Techniques for programming with binders in functional programming<br>\n  languages such as Haskell, OCaml or Agda, and logic programming<br>\n  languages such as lambda Prolog or Alpha-Prolog.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The workshop's program will include contributed and invited talks.<br>\nWe hope that LFMTP takes place physically in Rome, but online<br>\nparticipation will be possible and may even be necessary.</p>\n<h2>Important Dates</h2>\n<p>Abstract submission deadline: April 10<br>\nPaper submission deadline: April 20<br>\nNotification to authors: May 20</p>\n<h2>Submission</h2>\n<p>Submit on EasyChair: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lfmtp23\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lfmtp23</a></p>\n<p>All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another<br>\njournal or conference.</p>\n<p>In addition to regular papers, we welcome/encourage the submission of<br>\n\"work in progress\" reports, in a broad sense. Those do not need to<br>\nreport fully polished research results, but should be of interest for<br>\nthe community at large.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers should be in PDF, formatted using the EPTCS style<br>\nguidelines (<a href=\"https://info.eptcs.org/\">https://info.eptcs.org/</a>). The length is restricted to 15<br>\npages for regular papers and 8 pages for \"work in progress\" papers<br>\n(both limits include references).</p>\n<h2>Proceedings</h2>\n<p>A selection of the presented papers will be published online in the<br>\nElectronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).</p>\n<h2>Invited Speakers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Niki Vazou (IMDEA Software Institute Madrid, Spain)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: shared session with LSFA'23 (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/ufg.br/lsfa2023\">https://sites.google.com/ufg.br/lsfa2023</a><br>\n).</p>\n<h2>Program Committee</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Roberto Blanco (MPI-SP)</li>\n<li>Frédéric Blanqui (Inria)</li>\n<li>Ana Bove (Chalmers University of Technology)</li>\n<li>Alberto Ciaffaglione, co-chair (Università degli Studi di Udine)</li>\n<li>Amy Felty (University of Ottawa)</li>\n<li>Assia Mahboubi (Inria)</li>\n<li>Narciso Marti-Oliet (Universidad Complutense de Madrid)</li>\n<li>Gopalan Nadathur (University of Minnesota)</li>\n<li>Carlos Olarte, co-chair (LIPN, Université Sorbonne Paris Nord)</li>\n<li>Clément Pit-Claudel (Amazon AWS)</li>\n<li>Andrei Popescu (University of Sheffield)</li>\n<li>Claudio Sacerdoti Coen (University of Bologna)</li>\n</ul>",
