JELIA strives to foster links and <br>\nfacilitate cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers from various <br>\ndisciplines, among researchers from academia and industry, and between <br>\ntheoreticians and practitioners.</p>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished <br>\nresearch in all areas related to the use of logics in Artificial <br>\nIntelligence, including, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abductive and inductive reasoning</li>\n<li>Applications of logic-based AI systems</li>\n<li>Argumentation</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automated reasoning including satisfiability checking and its <br>\nextensions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Causality and logics</p>\n</li>\n<li>Computational complexity and expressiveness</li>\n<li>Deontic logic and normative systems</li>\n<li>Description logics and other logical approaches to ontologies</li>\n<li>Knowledge representation, reasoning, and compilation</li>\n<li>Learning and reasoning</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logic programming, answer set programming, constraint logic <br>\nprogramming</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logics in machine learning</p>\n</li>\n<li>Logics for uncertain and probabilistic reasoning</li>\n<li>Logics in multi-agent systems, games, and social choice</li>\n<li>Neural networks and logic rules</li>\n<li>\n<p>Non-classical logics, such as modal, temporal, epistemic, dynamic, <br>\nspatial, paraconsistent, and hybrid logics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nonmonotonic logics, default logics, conditional logics</p>\n</li>\n<li>Planning and diagnosis based on logic</li>\n<li>Preferences and optimization</li>\n<li>Reasoning about actions</li>\n<li>Updates, belief revision and nonmonotonic reasoning</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions describing implemented systems/applications and their <br>\napplication area(s) are also welcome.</p>\n<p>== SPECIAL TRACK ==</p>\n<p>Also this year we will include a Special Track on Logics for Explainable <br>\nand Trustworthy AI. We welcome contributions that explore logic-based <br>\napproaches to making AI more transparent, safer, or more trustworthy. <br>\nThe track aims to draw attention to this timely topic and create a space <br>\nfor discussing the role of logic. The papers accepted for the special <br>\ntrack will be presented in dedicated sessions at the conference.</p>\n<p>== AWARDS  ==</p>\n<p>JELIA 2025 is happy to announce that there will be Best Paper and Best <br>\nStudent Paper Prizes sponsored by Springer, each is a cash prize <br>\namounting to EUR 500. The Program Committee will select for this honor <br>\nthe contribution of the highest technical excellence and scientific <br>\nmerit. In the case of the latter award, the primary author of the paper <br>\nmust be a student at the time of submission.</p>\n<p>== SUBMISSION DETAILS ==</p>\n<p>Submission Site: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jelia2025\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jelia2025</a></p>\n<p>JELIA 2025 welcomes submissions of long or short papers. All submissions <br>\nshould contain original research, and sufficient detail to assess the <br>\nmerits and relevance of the contribution. Submissions must not have been <br>\npreviously published or be simultaneously submitted for publication <br>\nelsewhere; see also the note below.</p>\n<p>All submissions should not exceed 13 pages for long papers and 6 pages <br>\nfor short papers (excluding references and acknowledgments, including <br>\neverything else, for example figures), and should be written in English. <br>\nPapers must be self-contained; appendices with additional material (such <br>\nas proofs) will only be considered at the reviewers' discretion and will <br>\nnot be published. Submissions must be formatted according to the <br>\nstandard Springer LNCS style (see <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>), <br>\nand are not anonymous. The conference proceedings of JELIA 2025 will be <br>\npublished by Springer Verlag in the series Lecture Notes in Artificial <br>\nIntelligence, a sub-series of Lecture Notes in Computer Science <br>\n(important note: Springer will require all the LaTeX source files of all <br>\naccepted submissions).</p>\n<p>== CONFERENCE CHAIRS ==</p>\n<p>** General Chair<br>\nBesik Dundua, Tbilisi State University &amp; Kutaisi International <br>\nUniversity, Georgia</p>\n<p>** Program Chairs<br>\nGiovanni Casini, CNR - Institute of Information Science and <br>\nTechnologies, Italy<br>\nTemur Kutsia, RISC, Johannes Kepler University, Austria</p>\n<p>**Organization Chair<br>\nMikheil Rukhaia, Institute of Applied Mathematics, Tbilisi State <br>\nUniversity, Georgia</p>\n<p>**Organization Committee<br>\nMatthias Baaz, Vienna University of Technology<br>\nMariam Gamsakhurdia, Vienna University of Technology<br>\nRevaz Grigolia, Tbilisi State University<br>\nLia Kurtanidze, Georgian National University - SEU<br>\nLevan Uridia, Andrea Razmadze Mathematical Institute, Tbilisi State <br>\nUniversity</p>\n<p>== POLICY ON MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS ==</p>\n<p>JELIA 2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is <br>\nunder review or has already been published or accepted for publication <br>\nin a journal or another conference.
