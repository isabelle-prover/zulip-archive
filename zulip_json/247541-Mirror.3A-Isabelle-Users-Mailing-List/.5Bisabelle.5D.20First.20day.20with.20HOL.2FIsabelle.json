Isabelle is mostly a tool for <br>\nchecking<br>\nproofs that are well understood. If you think you have an argument or <br>\nproof<br>\nwhy two graphs are isomorphic, Isabelle can help you check that.</p>\n<p>If you're looking for some software to help you compute whether two <br>\nconcrete graphs<br>\nare isomorphic or not, I think you would be better off looking <br>\nelsewhere.</p>\n<p>I hope I'm not underestimating your understanding ;-)</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n     Thomas.</p>",
