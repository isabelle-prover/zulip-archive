Nonetheless, it has been noticed that some of them may lead to different results for identical floating-point computations. Formal development efforts have been made to increase confidence in floating-point computations. As an example, the Flocq library for the Coq proof assistant provides a formalization of generic floating-point formats.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to initiate the Coq development of a whole correct-by-construction domain-specific Floating-Point Unit (FPU). This includes the design of the hardware instructions set, its formal implementation and the verification of its compliance with IEEE-754 high-level properties as formalized in the Flocq library. In order to complete the formalization effort, it would be interesting to investigate the interaction of these hardware instructions with formally-verified compilers. The project scope also includes the verification of lower-level properties of the floating-point-units, e.g. the compliance of the circuits with the floating-point instructions they are intended to execute, taking the inherent parallelism of hardware into account. An approach would be to compare the formalized instructions with RTL/Netlist implementations. Finally, we envision the formal integration of the FPU into a global processor and its verification.</p>\n<p>The detailed position and contact information are provided at the following address:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mitsubishielectric-rce.eu/job/machine-checked-verification-of-domain-specific/\">https://www.mitsubishielectric-rce.eu/job/machine-checked-verification-of-domain-specific/</a></p>\n<p>If you are interested or would like to have additional information, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>\n<p>Contact for application: Magali BRANCHEREAU (jobs@fr.merce.mee.com&lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:jobs@fr.merce.mee.com\">jobs@fr.merce.mee.com</a>&gt;)</p>\n<p>Contact for further technical enquiry: Florian FAISSOLE (f.faissole@fr.merce.mee.com&lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:f.faissole@fr.merce.mee.com\">f.faissole@fr.merce.mee.com</a>&gt;) ; Beno√Æt BOYER (b.boyer@fr.merce.mee.com&lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:b.boyer@fr.merce.mee.com\">b.boyer@fr.merce.mee.com</a>&gt;).<br>\nBest regards,<br>\nFlorian Faissole.</p>",
