In contrast, @{term [break] \"c;; d\"} would produce the line break after <br>\nthe ;;. This was quite convenient because one had a choice. At some point in the <br>\nlast few releases, the treatment of // changed and became uniform: the line <br>\nbreak would always be printed. What is the best way now to print terms whose <br>\nsyntax contains //, without getting a line break? I have some crude latex <br>\nworkaround, but there might be a better way (something like a [no_break]).</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nTobias</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/mJqOKDnKedWQY8R3O1Qs-__C/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
