Recently, I discovered a book called \"Logic of chemical synthesis\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ia601303.us.archive.org/25/items/Logic_of_Chemical_Synthesis_Corey_1989/Logic_of_Chemical_Synthesis_Corey_1989_text.pdf\">https://ia601303.us.archive.org/25/items/Logic_of_Chemical_Synthesis_Corey_1989/Logic_of_Chemical_Synthesis_Corey_1989_text.pdf</a></p>\n<p>I suppose it would be fun to design a deduction system for organic synthesis and have the provability of chemical formulas. Is there any existing work on such a topic? If not, does it sound possible to start one? Or are there any barriers which are already obvious?</p>\n<p>Thanks for any discussion!</p>\n<p>Best regards.</p>\n<p>Yiming Xu</p>",

I recently came across <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12150\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12150</a>, but my ignorance of chemistry prevents me from going further — I need to study a good introduction to chemicals book; references are welcome. This seems more related to the lines you described: deductive reasoning or formalization of chemical reactions. The work shared by Alex is also relevant since the ontologies may describe initial axioms and appropriate concepts and relations from the domain.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAlexandre</p>",
