These posts provide<br>\nexcellent opportunities for graduate students (UK and overseas) to obtain a<br>\nPhD in any active research area of the group (see below the research<br>\ninterests of potential supervisors).</p>\n<p>The posts are fully funded for three and half years. Note that<br>\nexceptionally strong overseas candidates will be considered as well, with<br>\nfull cover of tuition fees.</p>\n<p>Dr. Charles Grellois is mainly interested in the verification of functional<br>\nprograms, would they be deterministic or probabilistic. He has worked on<br>\nhigher-order model-checking in the deterministic case, and on higher-order<br>\ntermination analysis in the probabilistic case. These approaches use<br>\ntechniques from linear logic and its models, category theory,<br>\n(intersection) type theory, tree automata theory, probabilistic semantics,<br>\nrealizabilityâ€¦ Several interesting questions are still open so that several<br>\ndifferent PhD projects could be discussed on these topics; but he is also<br>\nopen to other research topics in this area, to be discussed with the<br>\nprospective student.</p>\n<p>Dr. Maksim Zhukovskii is interested in combinatorics, probability, logic,<br>\ncomputational and descriptive complexity. Currently Maksim is working on<br>\nvariety of topics including extremal combinatorics (Turan-type questions,<br>\nsaturation, colourings, etc), random graphs (thresholds, limiting<br>\ndistributions, logical limit laws, almost sure theories), average-case<br>\ncomplexity (canonical labelling of random graphs, search problems in random<br>\ngraphs, reconstruction problems), enumerative combinatorics (random regular<br>\ngraphs, degree sequences), algebraic combinatorics (Cayley graphs,<br>\nisomorphism problem for abelian groups, matroids), random walks, first<br>\norder logic and expressive power of its fragments, second order logic and<br>\nmodal logic. See <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sd_xBDQAAAAJ\">scholar.google.com/citations?user=sd_xBDQAAAAJ</a> for the<br>\nlist of publications.</p>\n<p>Dr. Jonni Virtema is keen to supervise students in any area of his current<br>\nresearch, which relate to the interplay of logic and complexity theory.<br>\nCurrent topics include logics and complexity theory related to numerical<br>\ndata, and temporal logics designed to express so-called hyperproperties,<br>\nwhich are important in information flow and security. A further emerging<br>\ntopic is to study foundations of neural networks using the machinery of<br>\nlogics and complexity theory related to numerical data. See <a href=\"http://www.virtema.fi\">www.virtema.fi</a><br>\nfor further details.</p>\n<p>Dr. Harsh Beohar is broadly interested in comparative concurrency semantics<br>\nand in the interplay of category theory, logic, and semantics. Current<br>\ntopics include expressive modal logics, behavioural equivalence games,<br>\nsynthesising distinguishing/characteristic formulae all at the level of<br>\ncoalgebras.
