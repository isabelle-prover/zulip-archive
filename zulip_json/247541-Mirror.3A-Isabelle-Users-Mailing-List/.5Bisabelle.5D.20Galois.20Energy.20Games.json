All we demand is that energies form well-founded <br>\nbounded join-semilattices, and that energy updates have upward-closed domains <br>\nand can be “undone” through Galois-connected functions. Offering a simple <br>\nframework to construct decidable energy games we introduce the class of Galois <br>\nenergy games. We establish decidability of the (un)known initial credit problem <br>\nfor Galois energy games assuming energy-positional determinacy. For this we show <br>\ncorrectness and termination of a simple algorihm relying on an inductive <br>\ncharacterization of winning budgets and properties of Galois connections. <br>\nFurther, we prove that energy games over vectors of (extended) naturals with <br>\nvector-adition and min-updates form a subclass of Galois energy games and are <br>\nthus decidable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Galois_Energy_Games.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Galois_Energy_Games.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy this astounding entry: it formalizes \"Galois energy games\", a new and <br>\n(afaiu) yet unpublished new theory that one could say is the one game to rule <br>\nthem all. The formalization (of almost 10000 lines!) draws on a number of other <br>\nAFP entries, even making use of the obscure function \"those\". Amazing!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/xPJvFOb0BrPRU1KkpQpAdJJl/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
