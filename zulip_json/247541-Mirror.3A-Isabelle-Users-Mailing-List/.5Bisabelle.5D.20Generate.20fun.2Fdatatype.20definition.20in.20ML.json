At the moment I'm building a string corresponding to the datatype I want to generate and then pass that to \"BNF_FP_Def_Sugar.co_datatype_cmd\". And I guess the equivalent solution for fun's would be passing a definition string to \"Function_Common.function_parser\". This seems a bit fragile to me, and I was wondering if there is a cleaner/higher-level interface for doing it.</p>\n<p>Kind regards and thank you in advance,</p>\n<p>Giuseppe</p>",

I had seen that function, but no example of how to use it, so it was kind of difficult to figure out if it was useful.</p>\n<p>I have now found the function \"define_simple_datatype\" in <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Automated_Stateful_Protocol_Verification/trac.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Automated_Stateful_Protocol_Verification/trac.html</a> which does exactly what I wanted.</p>\n<p>I also saw that a function called \"define_simple_fun\" is also in there which just might also solve the second part of my question.</p>\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n<p>Giuseppe</p>",
