However I am having issues generating the set comprehension structure.</p>\n<p>For example, given the syntax \\&lt;lrel&gt; x &gt; x' \\&lt;rrel&gt; with the list of terms [Free(\"x\",...), Free(\"y\", ...)] from the context, the resulting translation would be {((x, y), (x', y')). x &gt; x'}.</p>\n<p>At the moment, I've created a mapping for each term to its de Bruijn index in the comprehension and manually replaced all of the Free variables in the term provided by the syntax (i.e. x &gt; x') with their Bound equivalents. However at this point I'm stuck since I have no idea how to then collect these terms into a final set comprehension with the appropriate structure and typing (a set of pairs of tuples where the tuple pairs depend on the context). I also feel like I may be overcomplicating things.</p>\n<p>I've looked at the set comprehension parse_translation function in HOL/Set.thy however I'm not sure how it works to build the set itself. I noticed that it uses Syntax_Trans.mk_binder_tr which seems like something I may be able to use but I'm not certain about how it's supposed to be used.</p>\n<p>Kind regards and thank you in advance,<br>\nMatthys Grobbelaar</p>",
