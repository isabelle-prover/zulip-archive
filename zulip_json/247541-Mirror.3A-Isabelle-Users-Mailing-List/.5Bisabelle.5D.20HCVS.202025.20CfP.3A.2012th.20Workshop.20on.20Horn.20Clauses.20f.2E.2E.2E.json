We also solicit <br>\nextended abstracts describing work-in-progress, as well as presentations <br>\ncovering previously published results, extended abstracts of doctoral <br>\ntheses, and overviews of research projects that are of interest to the <br>\nworkshop. At least one author of each accepted paper will be required to <br>\nattend the workshop to present the contribution.</p>\n<p>Submission has to be done in one of the following formats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Extended abstracts (up to 3 pages in EPTCS format), which describe <br>\nwork in progress or aim to initiate discussions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Presentation-only papers, i.e., papers already submitted or presented <br>\nat a conference or another workshop. Such papers can be submitted in any <br>\nformat, and will not be included in the workshop post-proceedings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Regular papers (up to 12 pages plus bibliography in EPTCS <br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.eptcs.org/\">http://www.eptcs.org/</a>) format), which should present previously <br>\nunpublished work (completed or in progress), including descriptions of <br>\nresearch, tools, and applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tool papers (up to 4 pages in EPTCS format), including the papers <br>\nwritten by the CHC-COMP participants, which can outline the theoretical <br>\nframework, the architecture, the usage, and experiments of the tool.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All submitted papers will be refereed by the program committee and will <br>\nbe selected for inclusion in accordance with the referee reports. If <br>\nenough regular papers are accepted, both regular papers and extended <br>\nabstracts will be published electronically. The publication of a paper <br>\nis not intended to preclude later publication. Full versions of extended <br>\nabstracts, or substantial revisions, may later be published elsewhere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Committees *</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Program Chairs:</p>\n<p>Emanuele De Angelis, IASI-CNR, Rome, Italy<br>\nFlorian Frohn, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany</p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>TBA</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CHC Competition *</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HCVS 2025 is planning to host the 8th competition on constraint Horn <br>\nclauses (CHC-COMP <a href=\"https://chc-comp.github.io/\">https://chc-comp.github.io/</a>), which will compare <br>\nstate-of-the-art tools for CHC solving for performance and effectiveness <br>\non a set of publicly available benchmarks.</p>",
