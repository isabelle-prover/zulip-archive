See attached file 81471.patch for Isabelle and 15047.patch for the AFP, which also adapts Vector-Matrix-Multiplications for AFP-defined arrays, where necessary. Feel free to use them in any way you see fit.<br>\nI have successfully built all sessions using vector_matrix_mult in their theory files, but not all possibly impacted sessions due to performance constraints, so I'd appreciate someone doing a complete build.<br>\nKind regards<br>\nAlexander Pach</p>\n<p>P.S.
