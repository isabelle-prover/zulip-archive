It is more the interaction <br>\nthat somehow leads to a problem.</p>\n<p>I have the following observations:</p>\n<p>* It's not jEdit that's stuck (because unloading the plugin and<br>\n    reloading it tends to resolve the problem).</p>\n<p>* There seems to be frequent GC once Isabelle is in this state.<br>\n  * It does not seem to be due to the load of the running sledghammers<br>\n    itself (because sometimes I have waited a long time to give it a<br>\n    chance to finish with whatever it is doing, to no avail).</p>\n<p>* Sometimes, it's not just a slowdown but Isabelle completely stops<br>\n    doing anything (one can edit, but colors/output tab are not<br>\n    updated). However, I don't know if it's the same issue.</p>\n<p>Since it is almost impossible to produce something reproducible here <br>\nexcept something like \"work for a few hours and intensively edit and run <br>\nsledgehammer or try after every goal\", I think what we need is the <br>\nfollowing:</p>\n<p>Is there some way to produce some post-mortem analysis? I.e., next time <br>\nI observe this, would there be something I can do to get a core-dump or <br>\nthread-dump or whatever that would be helpful (for Makarius, I assume) <br>\nto diagnose what is happening or at least what further inquiries need to <br>\nbe made?</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",
