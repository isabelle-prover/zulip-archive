Everything else works via the implicit dependency and build <br>\nmanagement of e.g. \"isabelle jedit\" or \"isabelle scala_build\" or \"isabelle build\".</p>\n<p>Bisection is particularly relevant to figure out if changed behaviour after <br>\nthe last release was intentional or just some accident. Without hard evidence <br>\nfrom the history it is difficult to figure out the truth (or approximate it as <br>\nmuch as possible).</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
