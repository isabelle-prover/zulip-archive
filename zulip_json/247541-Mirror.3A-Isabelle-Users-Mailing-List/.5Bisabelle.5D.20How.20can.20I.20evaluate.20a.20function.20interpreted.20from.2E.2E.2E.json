Not expected, but appreciated!<br>\nI'm pretty sure that section 8.4 from the code gen manual is exactly what I<br>\nneeded. I wouldn't have found that so quickly without your help. This<br>\nmattered a great deal to me. I sometimes get truly distraught when I can't<br>\nfigure something out. Can I PayPal you $20? Feel free to message my<br>\npersonal email with your username, email, or whatever.</p>",
