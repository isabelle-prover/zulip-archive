Outside of terms shortcuts that<br>\ndon’t start with a backslash, like ==&gt; for ⟹ and &lt;&lt; for ‹ don’t work,<br>\nand inside terms not even those that start with a backslash work (a<br>\ncompletion window just won’t pop up). Any hints on what to do about<br>\nthat?</p>\n<p>All the best,<br>\nWolfgang</p>",
