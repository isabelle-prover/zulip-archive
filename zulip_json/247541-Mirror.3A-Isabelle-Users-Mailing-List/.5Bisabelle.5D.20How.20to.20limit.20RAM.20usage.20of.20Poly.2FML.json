I have the impression that Poly/ML is adapting its maximum<br>\nheap size to the total amount of RAM rather than some notion of<br>\navailable RAM, and therefore I want to manually limit its heap size.</p>\n<p>To this end, I have tried to set the <code>--max-heap</code> option, but it seems<br>\nthat this option is ignored. Concretely, I have the following in<br>\n<code>~/.isabelle/Isabelle2022/etc/settings</code>:</p>\n<p>ISABELLE_TOOL_JAVA_OPTIONS=\"-Djava.awt.headless=true -Xms64m -Xmx512m -Xss2m\"<br>\n    ML_OPTIONS=\"--max-heap 768M\"</p>\n<p>While the Java-related options seem to be taken into account when<br>\nIsabelle/VSCode is run, the heap size limitation for ML doesn’t seem to<br>\nhave any effect. Right now, <code>ps -eO rss | grep polyml</code> gives the<br>\nfollowing output:</p>\n<p>203686 1497964 S ?      00:20:29 /home/wolfgang/Software/isabelle/contrib/polyml-test-bafe319bc3a6-1/x86_64_32-linux/poly -q --max-heap 768M --gcthreads 0 --exportstats --eval (PolyML.SaveState.loadHierarchy [\"/home/wolfgang/Software/isabelle/heaps/polyml-5.9_x86_64_32-linux/Pure\", \"/home/wolfgang/Software/isabelle/heaps/polyml-5.9_x86_64_32-linux/HOL\"]; PolyML.print_depth 0) handle exn =&gt; (TextIO.output (TextIO.stdErr, General.exnMessage exn ^ \": HOL\\n\"); OS.Process.exit OS.Process.failure) --eval Options.load_default () --eval Isabelle_Process.init ()<br>\n     203724  6512 S ?        00:00:36 /home/wolfgang/Software/isabelle/contrib/polyml-test-bafe319bc3a6-1/x86_64_32-linux/poly -q --use src/Pure/ML/ml_statistics.ML --eval ML_Statistics.monitor 203686 0.5</p>\n<p>As can be seen, there is a Poly/ML process that did receive the option<br>\n<code>--max-heap 768M</code> but nevertheless takes about 1.5 GB of RAM.</p>\n<p>How can I effectively limit the amount of RAM that Poly/ML will use?</p>\n<p>All the best,<br>\nWolfgang</p>",
