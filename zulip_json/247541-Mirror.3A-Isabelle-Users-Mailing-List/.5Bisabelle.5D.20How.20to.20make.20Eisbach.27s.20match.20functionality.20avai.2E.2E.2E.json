It does not seem that the<br>\npublic interface of MATCH_METHOD allows for this at the moment. However, it<br>\nis interesting to note that the signature of MATCH_METHOD contains the<br>\nfollowing comment: \"FIXME proper ML interface for the main thing\".</p>\n<p>What would be the easiest workaround for this problem? On the other hand,<br>\nif a solution does not exist (apart from copy-pasting parts of the<br>\nimplementation), would it be too much to ask to convert my query into a<br>\nfeature request?</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nMikhail Chekhov</p>",

While I am still genuinely interested in finding an answer<br>\nto the question, it seems that it will no longer have a significant impact<br>\non my work and, therefore, finding an answer has a very low priority for<br>\nme. Generally, you can view this email as a retraction of the question.</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nMikhail Chekhov</p>",
