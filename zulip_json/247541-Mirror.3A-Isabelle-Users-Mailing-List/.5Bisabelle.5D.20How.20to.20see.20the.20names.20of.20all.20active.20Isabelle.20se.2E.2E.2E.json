Maybe there is some more specific (child) session under which my custom theory file is being processed and I should export this specific session?</p>\n<p>I have made 2 stackoverflow questions about it (with not reaction so far), but it is fine to receive quick answer here. If it solves, then I can transform it into answers to my own SO questions for the reference for others.</p>\n<p>My intention is to use the session export for conversion into mmt xml (I have good documentation and source code for that, so I can handle it myself with the current or older versions, I will see).</p>\n<p>Alex</p>",
