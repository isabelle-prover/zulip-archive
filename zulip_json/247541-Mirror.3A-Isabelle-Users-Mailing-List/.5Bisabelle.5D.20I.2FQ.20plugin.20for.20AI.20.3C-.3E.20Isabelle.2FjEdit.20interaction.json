Once setup, you start your favorite MCP-capable chatbot (e.g. Amazon Q: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/\">https://aws.amazon.com/q/</a>) and interface with an open Isabelle/jEdit IDE through natural language.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please note:</em></strong><br>\nI/Q is still a very early prototype. We expect that its mechanisms will need tweaking/expanding. I/Q is mechanism <em>only</em>: It needs to be complemented with behavioral guidance and/or additional knowledge to become an effective proof engineer. We share I/Q with the community at this early stage because we see experimentation as the primary path to identify those improvements. If you are curious, please try I/Q and let us know about your use cases and ideas for improvement!</p>\n<p>I/Q is part of AutoCorrode and can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/AutoCorrode\">https://github.com/awslabs/AutoCorrode</a></p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nHanno</p>",
