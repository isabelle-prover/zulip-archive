The workshop welcomes contributions spanning the<br>\nspectrum from theoretical models to practical implementations and<br>\nempirical studies. Topics of interest include (but are not limited<br>\nto):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formal semantics</li>\n<li>Process algebras and calculi</li>\n<li>Models and languages</li>\n<li>Protocols</li>\n<li>Logics and types</li>\n<li>Expressiveness</li>\n<li>Model transformations</li>\n<li>Tools, implementations, and experiments</li>\n<li>Specification and verification</li>\n<li>Coinductive techniques</li>\n<li>Tools and techniques for automation</li>\n<li>Synthesis techniques</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prospective authors are welcome to contact the chairs for advice on<br>\nwhether their proposed submission is in scope.</p>\n<p>=== SELECTION PROCEDURE ===</p>\n<p>Since its first edition in 2008, the distinguishing feature of ICE has<br>\nbeen an innovative paper selection mechanism based on an interactive,<br>\nfriendly, and constructive discussion amongst authors and PC members<br>\nin an online forum.</p>\n<p>During the review phase, each submission is published in a dedicated<br>\ndiscussion forum. The discussion forum can be accessed by the authors<br>\nof the submission and by all PC members not in conflict with the<br>\nsubmission (the forum preserves anonymity). The forum is used by<br>\nreviewers to ask questions, clarifications, and modifications from the<br>\nauthors, allowing them better to explain and to improve all aspects of<br>\ntheir submission. The evaluation of the submission will take into<br>\naccount not only the reviews, but also the outcome of the discussion.</p>\n<p>As witnessed by the past editions of ICE, this procedure considerably<br>\nimproves the accuracy of the reviews, the fairness of the selection,<br>\nthe quality of camera-ready papers, and the discussion during the<br>\nworkshop.</p>\n<p>ICE adopts a light double-anonymous reviewing process, detailed below.</p>\n<p>=== SUBMISSION GUIDELINES ===</p>\n<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via hotcrp:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ice26.hotcrp.com/\">https://ice26.hotcrp.com/</a></p>\n<p>We invite two types of submissions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Research papers: original contributions that will be published<br>\nin the workshop post-proceedings. Research papers must not be<br>\nsimultaneously submitted to other conferences or workshops with<br>\nrefereed proceedings. Research papers should be 4-17 pages<br>\nin length, excluding references. Short research papers are<br>\nwelcome; for example, a concise 5-page contribution is <br>\nappropriate within this category. The submitted PDF may use <br>\nany LaTeX style. However, accepted papers must be prepared in the <br>\nEPTCS style for inclusion in the post-proceedings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Oral communications: will be presented at the workshop, but will<br>\nnot appear in the post-proceedings. This type of contribution<br>\nincludes e.g., previously published contributions, preliminary<br>\nwork, and position papers. Submissions for oral communications<br>\nshould have a maximum length of 2 pages, excluding references.<br>\nFor example, a one-page summary of previously published work<br>\nis welcome in this category.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Authors of research papers must omit their names and institutions from<br>\nthe title page, they should refer to their other work in the third<br>\nperson and omit acknowledgements that could reveal their identity or<br>\naffiliation. The purpose is to avoid any bias based on authors’<br>\nidentity characteristics, such as gender, seniority, or nationality,<br>\nin the review process. Our goal is to facilitate an unbiased approach<br>\nto reviewing by supporting reviewers’ access to works that do not<br>\ncarry obvious references to the authors’ identities. As mentioned<br>\nabove, this is a lightweight double-anonymous process. Anonymization<br>\nshould not be a heavy burden for authors, and should not make papers<br>\nweaker or more difficult to review. Advertising the paper on alternate<br>\nforums (e.g., on a personal web-page, pre-print archive, email, talks,<br>\ndiscussions with colleagues) is permitted.</p>\n<p>Papers in the “Oral communications” category need not be<br>\nanonymized. For any questions concerning the double anonymous process,<br>\nfeel free to consult the ICEcreamers.</p>\n<p>We are keen to enhance the balanced, inclusive and diverse nature of<br>\nthe ICE community, and would particularly encourage female colleagues<br>\nand members of other underrepresented groups to submit their work.</p>\n<p>Submission by PC members (apart from the ICEcreamers) is allowed and encouraged.</p>\n<p>=== PUBLICATIONS ===</p>\n<p>Accepted research papers and communications must be presented at the<br>\nworkshop by one of the authors.</p>\n<p>Accepted research papers will be published after the workshop in<br>\nElectronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (to be confirmed).</p>\n<p>We plan to invite authors of selected papers and brief announcements<br>\nto submit their work in a special issue in the Journal of Logical and<br>\nAlgebraic Methods in Programming (Elsevier). Such contributions will<br>\nbe peer-reviewed according to the standard journal policy, but they<br>\nwill be handled in a shorter time than regular submissions.
