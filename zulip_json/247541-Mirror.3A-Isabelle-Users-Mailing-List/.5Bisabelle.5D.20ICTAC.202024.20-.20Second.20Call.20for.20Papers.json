ICTAC <br>\nalso aims to promote research cooperation between developing and <br>\nindustrial countries.</p>\n<p>TOPICS<br>\nThe conference concerns all aspects of theoretical computer science, <br>\nincluding, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formal languages and automata</li>\n<li>Semantics of programming languages</li>\n<li>Logic in computer science</li>\n<li>Lambda calculus, type theory, and category theory</li>\n<li>Domain-specific languages</li>\n<li>Theories of concurrency and mobility</li>\n<li>Theories of distributed computing</li>\n<li>Models of objects and components</li>\n<li>Coordination models</li>\n<li>Timed, hybrid, embedded, and cyber-physical systems</li>\n<li>Security and privacy</li>\n<li>Static analysis</li>\n<li>Software verification</li>\n<li>Software testing</li>\n<li>Program generation and transformation</li>\n<li>Model checking and theorem proving</li>\n<li>Theoretical aspects of quantum computing</li>\n<li>Theory and methods of trustworthy AI</li>\n<li>Applications and experiences</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>\nWe solicit submissions, related to the topics of ICTAC, in the following <br>\ncategories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full papers describing original research contributions;</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short papers describing original work in progress, new ideas, and <br>\nemerging challenges; and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tool papers describing tools supporting formal techniques for software <br>\nmodeling, system design, and verification.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Full paper submissions must not exceed 16 pages (excluding a <br>\nbibliography of a maximum of 2 pages). Short and tool papers should not <br>\nexceed 8 pages.</p>\n<p>Submissions must not have been published or be under consideration for <br>\npublication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged based on <br>\noriginality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation <br>\nquality, and relevance to the conference's topics.</p>\n<p>All contributions to ICTAC 2024 have to be submitted electronically in <br>\nPDF format via Easy Chair:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac24\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac24</a></p>\n<p>Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS <br>\npapers (see <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/lncs\">http://www.springer.com/lncs</a>), without modifications of <br>\nmargins and other space-saving measures. Authors should consult <br>\nSpringer's authors' instructions and use their proceedings templates, <br>\neither for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. <br>\nSpringer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers.</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION<br>\nAll accepted papers in the above categories will appear in the <br>\nproceedings of the conference that will be published as a volume in <br>\nSpringer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.</p>\n<p>All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their authors <br>\nmust be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one <br>\nauthor of each accepted paper must register for the conference by the <br>\nearly registration deadline, and present the paper.</p>\n<p>We plan to have a special issue for selected accepted papers from ICTAC <br>\n2024.</p>",
