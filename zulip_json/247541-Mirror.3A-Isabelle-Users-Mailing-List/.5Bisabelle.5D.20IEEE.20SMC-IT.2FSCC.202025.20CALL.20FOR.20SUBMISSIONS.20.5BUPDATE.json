Note that IEEE</p>\n<p>has a \"Podium and Publish\" policy for conferences, which means that</p>\n<p>no manuscript will be published in IEEE Xplore without first being</p>\n<p>presented at the conference.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Authors of SCC presentations without a corresponding paper need to</p>\n<p>submit a 1-page abstract, which will allow the conference</p>\n<p>organizers to determine if the proposed presentation is germane for</p>\n<p>the conference, determine which track/session the proposed</p>\n<p>presentation belongs, and ensure the author is in contact with the</p>\n<p>track/session chair for feedback prior to the final submission. All</p>\n<p>presentation-only abstract submissions must be submitted by the</p>\n<p>full paper deadline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All submissions are uploaded via EasyChair:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=smcitscc2025\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=smcitscc2025</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Selected papers may be invited to appear in a special issue of a</p>\n<p>reputable journal.
