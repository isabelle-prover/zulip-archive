The following paper categories are <br>\nwelcome:</p>\n<p>Regular papersdescribing solid new research results. They can be</p>\n<p>up to 15 pages in LNCS style, including figures but excluding references</p>\n<p>and appendices. Where applicable, regular papers are supported by</p>\n<p>experimental validation. Submissions reporting on case studies in an</p>\n<p>industrial context are strongly invited as regular papers.</p>\n<p>Short papersdescribing implemented systems, user experiences,</p>\n<p>case studies and domain models, etc. They can be up to 7 pages in</p>\n<p>LNCS style, excluding references and appendices.</p>\n<p>All submissions will be judged on relevance, originality, significance, <br>\ncorrectness, and readability. Proofs of theoretical results that do not <br>\nfit in the page limit, executables of systems, and input data of <br>\nexperiments should be made available, e.g., via a reference to a website <br>\nor in an appendix of the paper.</p>\n<p>The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors <br>\nwill have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may <br>\nsolicit further reviews after the rebuttal period.</p>\n<p>All submissions must be formatted using the Springer LNCS styles <br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>&gt; and <br>\nsubmitted in PDF via EasyChair: <br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2024\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2024</a> <br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2024\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2024</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>The IJCAR 2024 proceedings will be published in the Springer series <br>\nLecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI/LNCS) as Gold Open <br>\nAccess, and will be available online during the conference. At least one <br>\nperson must register for each accepted paper, and this registration must <br>\nalso cover the Gold Open Access processing fee of 200 Euro net per <br>\npaper. Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least <br>\none of them will participate in the conference and present the work.</p>\n<p>The papers delivered to us will be processed according to theour regular <br>\nworkﬂow, meaning Springer will generate both full-text HTML and PDF <br>\nversions of the papers, to be made available in SpringerLink, and the <br>\nfull book will be available in PDF and ePub formats. The papers will be <br>\npublished under the CC-BY-4.0-license.</p>\n<p>BEST PAPER AWARD</p>\n<p>================</p>\n<p>IJCAR 2024 will recognize the most outstanding submissions with a best <br>\npaper award and a best student paper award at the conference.</p>\n<p>STUDENT TRAVEL AWARDS</p>\n<p>=====================</p>\n<p>Woody Bledsoe Travel Awards will be available to support selected <br>\nstudents in attending the conference.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION</p>\n<p>============</p>\n<p>Conference Co-Chairs:</p>\n<p>* Didier Galmiche (University of Lorraine, France)</p>\n<p>* Stephan Merz (Inria Nancy, France)</p>\n<p>* Christophe Ringeissen (Inria Nancy, France)</p>\n<p>Programme Chairs:</p>\n<p>* Christoph Benzmüller (University of Bamberg &amp; FU Berlin, Germany)</p>\n<p>* Marijn Heule (Carnegie Mellon University, USA)</p>\n<p>* Renate Schmidt (University of Manchester, UK)</p>\n<p>Workshop, Tutorial and Competition Chairs:</p>\n<p>* Sophie Tourret (Inria Nancy, France)</p>\n<p>Publicity Chair</p>\n<p>* Peter Lammich (University of Twente, The Netherlands)</p>\n<p>Local Arrangements</p>\n<p>* Anne-Lise Charbonnier (Inria Nancy, France)</p>\n<p>* Sabrina Verdenal (Inria Nancy, France)</p>\n<p>Programme Committee:</p>\n<p>* The list of PC members <br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://merz.gitlabpages.inria.fr/2024-ijcar/committee/pc/&gt;is\">https://merz.gitlabpages.inria.fr/2024-ijcar/committee/pc/&gt;is</a> available <br>\non the conference website <br>\n<a href=\"https://merz.gitlabpages.inria.fr/2024-ijcar/committee/pc/\">https://merz.gitlabpages.inria.fr/2024-ijcar/committee/pc/</a></p>\n<p>*</p>",
