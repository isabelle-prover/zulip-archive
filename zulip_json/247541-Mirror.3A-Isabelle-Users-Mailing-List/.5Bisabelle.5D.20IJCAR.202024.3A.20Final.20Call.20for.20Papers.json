The following paper categories are <br>\nwelcome:</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>|Regular papers|describing solid new research results. They can be<br>\n    up to 15 pages in LNCS style, including figures but excluding<br>\n    references and appendices. Where applicable, regular papers are<br>\n    supported by experimental validation. Submissions reporting on case<br>\n    studies in an industrial context are strongly invited as regular papers.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>|Short papers|describing implemented systems, user experiences, case<br>\n    studies and domain models, etc. They can be up to 7 pages in LNCS<br>\n    style, excluding references and appendices.</p>\n<p>All submissions will be judged on relevance, originality, significance, <br>\ncorrectness, and readability. Proofs of theoretical results that do not <br>\nfit in the page limit, executables of systems, and input data of <br>\nexperiments should be made available, e.g., via a reference to a website <br>\nor in an appendix of the paper.</p>\n<p>The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors <br>\nwill have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may <br>\nsolicit further reviews after the rebuttal period.</p>\n<p>All submissions must be formatted using the Springer LNCS styles and <br>\nsubmitted in PDF via EasyChair:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2024\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2024</a></p>\n<p>The IJCAR 2024 proceedings will be published in the Springer <br>\nseriesLecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence <br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/conference/ijcar&gt;(LNAI/LNCS)\">https://link.springer.com/conference/ijcar&gt;(LNAI/LNCS)</a> as Gold Open <br>\nAccess, and will be available online during the conference. At least one <br>\nperson must register for each accepted paper, and this registration must <br>\nalso cover the Gold Open Access processing fee of 200 Euro net per <br>\npaper. Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least <br>\none of them will participate in the conference and present the work.</p>\n<p>The papers delivered to us will be processed according to the regular <br>\nworkﬂow, meaning Springer will generate both full-text HTML and PDF <br>\nversions of the papers, to be made available in SpringerLink, and the <br>\nfull book will be available in PDF and ePub formats. The papers will be <br>\npublished under the CC-BY-4.0-license.</p>\n<p>Best Paper Award</p>\n<p>IJCAR 2024 will recognize the most outstanding submissions with a best <br>\npaper award and a best student paper award at the conference.</p>\n<p>Student Travel Award</p>\n<p>Woody Bledsoe Travel Awards will be available to support selected <br>\nstudents in attending the conference.</p>",
