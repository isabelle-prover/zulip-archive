It will be co-located with LICS and ICTCS conferences.</p>\n<p>ITP will carefully monitor the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, and take guidance from the health authorities, to determine whether ITP21 will be held physically, virtually or in a hybrid manner.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://easyconferences.eu/itp2021/\">http://easyconferences.eu/itp2021/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all aspects of interactive theorem proving, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications in program verification, security, and the formalization of mathematics. This will be the 12th conference in the ITP series, while predecessor conferences from which it has evolved have been going since 1988.</p>\n<p>ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of interactive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p>• formalizations of computational models<br>\n• improvements in theorem prover technology<br>\n• formalizations of mathematics<br>\n• integration with automated provers and other symbolic tools<br>\n• verification of security algorithms<br>\n• industrial applications of interactive theorem provers<br>\n• formal aspects of hardware and software<br>\n• user interfaces for interactive theorem provers<br>\n• use of theorem provers in education<br>\n• concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)</p>\n<p><strong>Paper Submission</strong></p>\n<p>Submissions will undergo single-blind peer review. They should be no more than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic references and are to be submitted in PDF format via EasyChair via the following link: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp202\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp202</a></p>\n<p>We also welcome short papers, which can be used to describe interesting work that is still ongoing and not fully mature. Such a preliminary report is limited to 6 pages and may consist of an extended abstract. Each of these papers should bear the phrase “(short paper)” beneath the title. Accepted submissions in this category will be published in the main proceedings and will be presented as short talks.</p>\n<p>All submissions are expected to be accompanied by verifiable evidence of a suitable implementation, such as the source files of a formalization for the proof assistant used.</p>\n<p><strong>Important Dates</strong></p>\n<p>• Abstract submission deadline: January 25, 2021<br>\n• Paper submission deadline: February 1, 2021<br>\n• Author notification: March 25, 2021<br>\n• Camera-ready copy due: April 20, 2021<br>\n• Conference: June 29-July 1, 2021</p>\n<p><strong>Publication Details</strong></p>\n<p>The conference proceedings will be published in the LIPIcs series (“Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics”). This was chosen in large part because of its commitment to free and open access to all papers.
