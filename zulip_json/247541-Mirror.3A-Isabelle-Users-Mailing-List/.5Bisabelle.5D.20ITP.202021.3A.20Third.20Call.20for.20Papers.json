It will be co-located with LICS and ICTCS<br>\nconferences.</p>\n<p>ITP will carefully monitor the development of the COVID-19<br>\npandemic to decide if ITP 2021 will be held completely<br>\nvirtually or in a hybrid manner. In either case, the authors<br>\nnot able to come to Rome will be able to present remotely.</p>\n<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all aspects of<br>\ninteractive theorem proving, ranging from theoretical<br>\nfoundations to implementation aspects and applications in<br>\nprogram verification, security, and the formalization of<br>\nmathematics. This will be the 12th conference in the ITP<br>\nseries, while predecessor conferences from which it has<br>\nevolved have been going since 1988.</p>\n<p>Paper Submission<br>\n================</p>\n<p>ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on<br>\nall aspects of interactive theorem proving and its<br>\napplications. Suggested topics include, but are not limited<br>\nto, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formalizations of computational models</li>\n<li>improvements in theorem prover technology</li>\n<li>formalizations of mathematics</li>\n<li>integration with automated provers and other symbolic tools</li>\n<li>verification of security algorithms</li>\n<li>industrial applications of interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>formal aspects of hardware and software</li>\n<li>user interfaces for interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>use of theorem provers in education</li>\n<li>concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions will undergo single-blind peer review. They<br>\nshould be no more than 16 pages in length excluding<br>\nbibliographic references and are to be submitted in PDF<br>\nformat via EasyChair via the following link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2021\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2021</a></p>\n<p>We also welcome short papers, which can be used to describe<br>\ninteresting work that is still ongoing and not fully<br>\nmature. Such a preliminary report is limited to 6 pages and<br>\nmay consist of an extended abstract. Each of these papers<br>\nshould bear the phrase \"(short paper)\" beneath the<br>\ntitle. Accepted submissions in this category will be<br>\npublished in the main proceedings and will be presented as<br>\nshort talks.</p>\n<p>All submissions are expected to be accompanied by<br>\nverifiable evidence of a suitable implementation, such as<br>\nthe source files of a formalization for the proof assistant<br>\nused.</p>\n<p>Important Dates<br>\n===============</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract submission deadline: January 25, 2021</li>\n<li>Paper submission deadline: February 1, 2021</li>\n<li>Author notification: March 25, 2021</li>\n<li>Camera-ready copy due: April 20, 2021</li>\n<li>Conference: June 29-July 1, 2021</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Publication Details<br>\n===================</p>\n<p>The conference proceedings will be published in the LIPIcs<br>\nseries (\"Leibniz International Proceedings in<br>\nInformatics\"). This was chosen in large part because of its<br>\ncommitment to free and open access to all papers.
