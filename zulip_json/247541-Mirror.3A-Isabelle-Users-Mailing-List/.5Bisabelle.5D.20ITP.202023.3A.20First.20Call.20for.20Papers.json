It is planned as a<br>\nface-to-face (physical) meeting.</p>\n<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all aspects of interactive theorem<br>\nproving, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and<br>\napplications in program verification, security, and the formalization of<br>\nmathematics. This will be the 14th conference in the ITP series, while<br>\npredecessor conferences from which it has evolved have been going since 1988.</p>\n<p>Paper Submission</p>\n<p>ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of<br>\ninteractive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics include, but<br>\nare not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formalizations of computational models</li>\n<li>improvements in theorem prover technology</li>\n<li>formalizations of mathematics</li>\n<li>integration with automated provers and other symbolic tools</li>\n<li>verification of security algorithms</li>\n<li>industrial applications of interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>formal aspects of hardware and software</li>\n<li>user interfaces for interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>use of theorem provers in education</li>\n<li>concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions will undergo single-blind peer review. </p>\n<p>Regular papers should be no more than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic<br>\nreferences in LIPIcs format, and they should not include an appendix. For<br>\ndetailed instructions for authors on document preparation see:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/\">https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/</a></p>\n<p>We also welcome short papers, which can be used to describe interesting work<br>\nthat is still ongoing and not fully mature. Such a preliminary report is limited<br>\nto 6 pages and may consist of an extended abstract. Each of these papers should<br>\nhave the phrase \"Short paper\" as a subtitle. Accepted submissions in this<br>\ncategory will be published in the main proceedings and will be presented as<br>\nshort talks.</p>\n<p>The papers are to be submitted via EasyChair via the following link:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2023\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2023</a></p>\n<p>All submissions are expected to be accompanied by verifiable evidence of a<br>\nsuitable implementation, such as the source files of a formalization for the<br>\nproof assistant used.</p>\n<p>Important Dates (AoE)</p>\n<p>Abstract submission deadline:  February 13, 2023<br>\nPaper submission deadline:     February 20, 2023<br>\nAuthor notification:           April 17, 2023<br>\nCamera-ready copy due:         May 15, 2023<br>\nConference:                    July 31 to August 4, 2023</p>\n<p>Publication Details</p>\n<p>As in earlier years, the conference proceedings will be published open access in<br>\nthe LIPIcs series (\"Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics\").
