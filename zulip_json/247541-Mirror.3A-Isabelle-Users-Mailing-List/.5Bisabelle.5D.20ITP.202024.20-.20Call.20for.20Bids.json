This message concerns the first phase. A long-standing ITP/TPHOLs<br>\nconvention is that the conference should be held on a continent different from<br>\nthe location of the previous meeting. So for 2024, we particularly solicit bids<br>\nfrom prospective hosts located outside Europe. Similar to previous years, we<br>\nexpect bids to propose a date in July, August or September.</p>\n<p>Bids should be sent to &lt;<a href=\"mailto:itp2023@easychair.org\">itp2023@easychair.org</a>&gt; and should include at least<br>\nthe following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>name and email address of a contact person </li>\n<li>names of other people involved </li>\n<li>address of website for the bid</li>\n<li>approximate dates of the conference </li>\n<li>structure (e.g., k workshop days and n days of presentations, excursion, etc.) </li>\n<li>advantages of the proposed venue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example of previous winning bids follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ITP 2023 in Bialystok, Poland: <a href=\"http://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/ITP2023-bid/\">http://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/ITP2023-bid/</a> </li>\n<li>ITP 2019 in Portland, USA: <a href=\"http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/itp2019bid/\">http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/itp2019bid/</a> </li>\n<li>ITP 2016 in Nancy, France: <a href=\"https://members.loria.fr/JCBlanchette/itp2016/bid.html\">https://members.loria.fr/JCBlanchette/itp2016/bid.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The deadline for bids is March 31. Shortly after, all admitted bids will be made<br>\npublic and the voting phase will take place. The people eligible to vote are<br>\nthose who are seriously considering attending ITP 2024.</p>\n<p>With best regards, <br>\nAdam Naumowicz and René Thiemann <br>\n(chairs of ITP 2023)</p>",
