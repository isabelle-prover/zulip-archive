It is<br>\nplanned as a hybrid meeting.  It will mostly be a face-to-face (physical)<br>\nmeeting but facilities will be provided for remote presentation and<br>\nremote attendance.</p>\n<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all aspects of interactive<br>\ntheorem proving, ranging from theoretical foundations to<br>\nimplementation aspects and applications in program verification,<br>\nsecurity, and the formalization of mathematics. This will be the 15th<br>\nconference in the ITP series, while predecessor conferences from which<br>\nit has evolved have been going since 1988.</p>\n<p>Paper Submission</p>\n<p>The main proceedings will be published as part of the Leibniz International<br>\nProceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs).</p>\n<p>ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects<br>\nof interactive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics<br>\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formalizations of computational models</li>\n<li>improvements in interactive theorem prover technology</li>\n<li>formalizations of mathematics</li>\n<li>integration with automated provers and other symbolic tools</li>\n<li>verification of security algorithms</li>\n<li>industrial applications of interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>formal specification and verification of hardware and software</li>\n<li>user interfaces for interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>use of theorem provers in education</li>\n<li>concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions will undergo single-blind peer review.</p>\n<p>Regular papers must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>be no more than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic references</li>\n<li>not include an appendix; and</li>\n<li>be in LIPIcs format.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For detailed instructions for authors on document preparation see:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/\">https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/</a></p>\n<p>We also welcome short papers, which can be used to describe<br>\ninteresting work that is still ongoing and not fully mature. Such a<br>\npreliminary report is limited to 6 pages and may consist of an<br>\nextended abstract. Each of these papers should have the phrase \"Short<br>\npaper\" as a subtitle. Accepted submissions in this category will be<br>\npublished in the main proceedings and will be presented as short<br>\ntalks.</p>\n<p>The papers are to be submitted via EasyChair via the following link:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2024\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2024</a></p>\n<p>All submissions are expected to be accompanied by verifiable evidence<br>\nof a suitable implementation, such as the source files of a<br>\nformalization for the proof assistant used.</p>\n<p>Important Dates (AoE)</p>\n<p>Abstract submission deadline:  March 11, 2024<br>\nPaper submission deadline:     March 18, 2024<br>\nAuthor notification:           May 20, 2024<br>\nCamera-ready copy due:         June 10, 2024<br>\nConference:                    September 9-14, 2024</p>",
