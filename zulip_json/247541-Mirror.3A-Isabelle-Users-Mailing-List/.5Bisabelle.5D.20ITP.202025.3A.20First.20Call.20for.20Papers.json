This will be the 16th conference in the<br>\nITP series, while predecessor conferences from which it has evolved have<br>\nbeen going since 1988.</p>\n<h1>Important dates</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract submission deadline: March 12, 2025</li>\n<li>Paper submission deadline: March 19, 2025</li>\n<li>Author notification: May 23, 2025</li>\n<li>Camera-ready copy due: June 27, 2025</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Topics</h1>\n<p>ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of<br>\ninteractive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics<br>\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formalizations of computational models</li>\n<li>improvements in interactive theorem prover technology</li>\n<li>formalizations of mathematics</li>\n<li>integration with automated provers and other symbolic tools</li>\n<li>verification of security algorithms</li>\n<li>industrial applications of interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>formal specification and verification of hardware and software</li>\n<li>user interfaces for interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>use of theorem provers in education</li>\n<li>concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Paper categories and submission</h1>\n<p>We welcome regular papers and short papers. Submission for both is<br>\nlightweight double-blind. This means that (1) author names and<br>\ninstitutions must be omitted using the the anonymous option of the<br>\ndocument class, (2) references to authors' own related work should be in<br>\nthe third person, and (3) the identity of authors will be reveiled to<br>\nreviewers once they have submitted a first draft of their review.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers<br>\ncome to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it<br>\nimpossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing<br>\nshould be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or<br>\nmakes the job of reviewing it more difficult. In particular, important<br>\nbackground references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition,<br>\nauthors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their<br>\npapers as usual. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on<br>\nthe web or give talks on their research ideas.</p>\n<p>Regular papers must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>be no more than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic<br>\n     references</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>not include an appendix, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>be in LIPIcs format.</p>\n<p>Short papers can be used to describe interesting work that is still <br>\nongoing and not fully mature. Accepted short papers will be published in <br>\nthe main proceedings and will be presented as short talks. Short papers must</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>be no more than 6 pages in length excluding bibliographic <br>\nreferences and may consist of an extended abstract,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>have the phrase \"Short paper\" as a subtitle,</p>\n</li>\n<li>not include an appendix, and</li>\n<li>be in LIPIcs format.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both categories of papers must be prepared in LaTeX using the <br>\nlipics-v2021 style (v2021.1.3) and must be submitted electronically as <br>\npdf files through HotCRP:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itp25.hotcrp.com\">https://itp25.hotcrp.com</a></p>\n<p>All submissions are expected to be accompanied by supplementary material <br>\ncontaining verifiable evidence of a suitable implementation, such as the <br>\nsource files of a formalization for the proof assistant used. They also <br>\nneed to have a README explaining how the source files can be compiled <br>\nand what exact version of the proof assistant and packages to use.</p>\n<p>Two forms of supplementary material may be submitted: (1) Anonymous <br>\nsupplementary material is made available to the reviewers before they <br>\nsubmit their first-draft reviews. (2) Non-anonymous supplementary <br>\nmaterial is made available to the reviewers after they have submitted <br>\ntheir first-draft reviews and have learned the identity of the authors. <br>\nWe strongly encourage anonymous supplementary material whenever possible.</p>\n<h1>Publication</h1>\n<p>The conference proceedings will be published in Dagstuhl Publishing\\'s<br>\n<a href=\"https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/series/LIPIcs\">Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics\n(LIPIcs)</a> series in<br>\nGold Open Access under the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC-BY-4.0\nlicense</a>.</p>\n<h1>Registration and Participation</h1>\n<p>Remote attendance of the conference will be possible for a low or no<br>\nfee. For all accepted papers, at least one author must pay a full<br>\nregistration fee. For presenters we strongly encourage physical<br>\nparticipation since coming to the conference benefits the dissemination<br>\nof the paper and the overall quality of the conference. Remote talks are<br>\nonly possible if agreed with the organizers by the registration<br>\ndeadline, but still one author must pay the full registration fee.</p>\n<h1>Program committee</h1>\n<p>Yannick Forster (co-chair), Inria Paris<br>\n     Chantal Keller (co-chair), LMF, Université Paris-Saclay<br>\n     Mohammad Abdulaziz, King's College London<br>\n     Reynald Affeldt, AIST<br>\n     Jeremy Avigad, Carnegie Mellon University<br>\n     Anne Baanen, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Lean FRO LLC<br>\n     Małgorzata Biernacka, University of Wroclaw<br>\n     Mario Carneiro, Chalmers University of Technology<br>\n     Évelyne Contejean, CNRS<br>\n     María Inés de Frutos Fernández, University of Bonn<br>\n     Tom de Jong, University of Nottingham<br>\n     Thaynara Arielly de Lima, Universidade Federal de Goiás<br>\n     Manuel Eberl, University of Innsbruck<br>\n     Chelsea Edmonds, University of Sheffield<br>\n     Andres Erbsen, Google<br>\n     Thiago Felicissimo, Inria Rennes<br>\n     Amy Felty, University of Ottawa<br>\n     Asta Halkjær From, University of Copenhagen<br>\n     Aymeric Fromherz, Inria Paris<br>\n     Ruben Gamboa, University of Wyoming<br>\n     Hrutvik Kanabar, Arm<br>\n     Dominik Kirst, Inria<br>\n     Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki, University of Cambridge<br>\n     Vincent Laporte, Inria Nancy<br>\n     Meven Lennon-Bertrand, University of Cambridge<br>\n     Robert Lewis, Brown University<br>\n     Heather Macbeth, Fordham University, NYC<br>\n     Paolo Masci, NASA<br>\n     Cody Roux, AWS<br>\n     Yong Kiam Tan, Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore<br>\n     Andrew Tolmach, Portland State University<br>\n     Sophie Tourret, Inria Nancy<br>\n     Dmitriy Traytel, University of Copenhagen<br>\n     Niccolò Veltri, Tallinn University of Technology<br>\n     Bohua Zhan, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences</p>",
