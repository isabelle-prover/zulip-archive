ITP 2026 is part of the ITP conference series<br>\nwhose history goes back to 1988.</p>\n<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all aspects of<br>\ninteractive theorem proving, ranging from theoretical foundations<br>\nto implementation aspects and applications in program verification,<br>\nsecurity, and the formalization of mathematics. This will be the 17th<br>\nconference in the ITP series, while predecessor conferences from which<br>\nit has evolved have been going since 1988.</p>\n<p>##Important Dates</p>\n<p>Abstract Deadline: February 12, 2026 (AOE)<br>\nPaper Submission Deadline: February 19, 2026 (AOE)<br>\nAuthor Notification: April 26, 2026<br>\nCamera-ready Copy: May 24, 2026<br>\nConference: July 26-29, 2026</p>\n<p>##Topics</p>\n<p>ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of<br>\ninteractive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics include,<br>\nbut are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formalizations of computational models</li>\n<li>improvements in interactive theorem prover technology</li>\n<li>formalizations of mathematics</li>\n<li>integration with automated provers and other symbolic and neurosymbolic tools</li>\n<li>industrial applications of interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>formal specification and verification of hardware and software</li>\n<li>user interfaces for interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>use of theorem provers in education</li>\n<li>concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)</li>\n<li>sound methods for using AI in proof discovery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We welcome regular papers and short papers. Submission for both is<br>\nlightweight double-blind. This means that (1) author names and<br>\ninstitutions must be omitted using the anonymous option of the document<br>\nclass, (2) references to authors' own related work should be in the third<br>\nperson.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come<br>\nto an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it<br>\nimpossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing<br>\nshould be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes<br>\nthe job of reviewing it more difficult. In particular, important background<br>\nreferences should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors are free<br>\nto disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as usual.<br>\nFor example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give<br>\ntalks on their research ideas.</p>\n<p>Regular papers must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>be no more than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic references</li>\n<li>not include an appendix, and</li>\n<li>be in LIPIcs format.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Short papers can be used to describe interesting work that is still<br>\nongoing and not fully mature. Accepted short papers will be published<br>\nin the main proceedings and will be presented as short talks.</p>\n<p>Short papers must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>be no more than 6 pages in length excluding bibliographic references<br>\n  and may consist of an extended abstract,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>have the phrase \"Short paper\" as a subtitle,</p>\n</li>\n<li>not include an appendix, and</li>\n<li>be in LIPIcs format.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both categories of papers must be prepared in LaTeX using the lipics-v2021<br>\nstyle (v2021.1.3):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author\">https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author</a></p>\n<p>and must be submitted electronically as pdf files through<br>\nHotCRP. All submissions are expected to be accompanied by anonymised<br>\nsupplementary material containing verifiable evidence of a suitable<br>\nimplementation, such as the source files of a formalization for the<br>\nproof assistant used.</p>\n<p>##Publication</p>\n<p>The conference proceedings will be published in Dagstuhl Publishing's Leibniz<br>\nInternational Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series in Gold Open Access<br>\nunder the CC-BY-4.0 license.</p>\n<p>##Registration, Participation and Colocated Workshops</p>\n<p>Refer to FLoC 2026 webpage: <a href=\"https://www.floc26.org/\">https://www.floc26.org/</a></p>\n<h2>Program Co-chairs</h2>\n<p>Ekaterina Komendantskaya, University of Southampton, Heriot-Watt University<br>\nTobias Nipkow, Technical University of Munich</p>\n<p>##Publicity Chair</p>\n<p>Natalia Ślusarz, Heriot-Watt University</p>\n<p>##Programme Committee</p>\n<p>Mohammad Abdulaziz, King's College London<br>\nReynald Affeldt, AIST<br>\nGuillaume Allais, University of Strathclyde<br>\nRobert Atkey, University of Strathclyde<br>\nJeremy Avigad, Carnegie Mellon University<br>\nJasmin Blanchette, LMU Munich<br>\nSandrine Blazy, University of Rennes<br>\nSylvie Boldo, INRIA<br>\nEdwin Brady,  University of St Andrews<br>\nAlessandro Bruni, ITU Copenhagen<br>\nSwarat Chaudhuri, University of Texas, Austin<br>\nMatthew Daggitt,  The University of Western Australia<br>\nSander Dahmen, VU Amsterdam<br>\nFloris van Doorn,  University of Bonn<br>\nManuel Eberl, University of Innsbruck<br>\nAmy Felty, University of Ottawa<br>\nJacques Fleuriot, University of Edinburgh<br>\nYannick Forster, INRIA<br>\nMaría Inés de Frutos-Fernández, University of Bonn<br>\nRalf Jung, ETH Zürich<br>\nAmbrus Kaposi, Eötvös Loránd University<br>\nYonghyun Kim,  MPI-SP<br>\nKatherine Kosaian, University of Iowa<br>\nK.
