Baksys\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:mb2412@cam.ac.uk\">mb2412@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>\nDear all,</p>\n<p>I am writing this to ask about an induction argument, which generalizes the<br>\ntype in its induction hypothesis. My current use case for this is Kneser's<br>\ntheorem and more specifically, formalisation of its proof, which can be found<br>\non arXiv here: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3539.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3539.pdf</a>. In the proof, the argument<br>\ninducts over all abelian groups and passes to the quotient group in one of the<br>\ncases during the induction step. This creates a type issue even if<br>\ngeneralizing the group itself since the types of elements of the quotient<br>\ngroup and the original group is different. Searching on the internet, I have<br>\nfound this related StackOverflow question:<br>\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41002312/free-type-variables-in-proof-by-induction?answertab=trending#tab-top\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41002312/free-type-variables-in-proof-by-induction?answertab=trending#tab-top</a>.<br>\nIt is claimed that a general approach to do this is to \"prove instances for<br>\nfixed types first\" and \"then derive a proof generalized in the type itself\",<br>\nwhich I can't quite parse myself. Therefore, I would appreciate any help with<br>\nthis issue.</p>\n<p>Note: It is not sufficient to split the argument into an auxiliary lemma<br>\ndealing with when the stabilizer is trivial because the proof of that case<br>\nuses the induction hypothesis for not necessarily trivial stabilizers.</p>",
