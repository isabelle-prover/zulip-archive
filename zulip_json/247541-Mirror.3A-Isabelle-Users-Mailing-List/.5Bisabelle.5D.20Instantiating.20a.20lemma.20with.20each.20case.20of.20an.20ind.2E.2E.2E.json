Structural induction would work fine.<br>\nWhat greatly shortens the proof, however, is that <code>rule: wf_induct...</code><br>\nenables the line <code>using LEMMA[of i x] by (cases x) auto</code>.<br>\nWith structural induction, it seems that I would have to write out all the<br>\ncases to be able to do a similar instantiation of LEMMA (without which the<br>\nautomation is not powerful enough).<br>\nThat is, I want to avoid doing something like this with many cases:</p>\n<p>proof (induct p arbitrary: i)<br>\n  case (1 a)<br>\n  then show ?case<br>\n    using LEMMA[of i ‹1 a›] by auto<br>\nnext<br>\n  case (2 b c)<br>\n  then show ?case<br>\n    using LEMMA[of i ‹2 b c›] by  auto<br>\nnext<br>\n  etc.</p>\n<p>What is the best way to do this?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAsta</p>",
