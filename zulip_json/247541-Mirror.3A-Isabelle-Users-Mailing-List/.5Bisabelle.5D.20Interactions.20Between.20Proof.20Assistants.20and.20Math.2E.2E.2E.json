Abstracts should be around 200 words.  The short abstract deadline is<br>\nthe 24th February 2024, but we will review and accept abstracts on a rolling<br>\nbasis before then. Please send abstracts via email to<br>\nalexjbest+icms@gmail.com.</p>\n<p>We hope to inspire people to bring both their completed projects but also<br>\nworks in progress and demos to meet and discuss the intersections of formal<br>\nand informal mathematical software with a wide range of interested<br>\nparticipants. Abstracts will be published on the website<br>\n<a href=\"https://proof-assistants-and-software-icms2024.github.io/\">https://proof-assistants-and-software-icms2024.github.io/</a> as they are<br>\naccepted.</p>\n<p>We welcome expressions of interest before the official deadline, both of<br>\npotential speakers and other participants in order to help us with the<br>\nplanning.</p>\n<p>There will be the opportunity for accepted speakers to publish extended<br>\nabstracts / papers in the proceedings of the ICMS, subject to participant<br>\ninterest.<br>\nSo if you have some work you'd like to present that would be of interest for<br>\nthis session please submit an abstract to us whenever it is ready!<br>\nFor funding and other particulars about the ICMS and location and travel<br>\nplease see the main ICMS website (which will be updated further in future).</p>\n<p>The full description of the session is as follows:<br>\nInteractive proof assistants (ITPs) are pieces of software that allow<br>\none to express mathematical constructs and arguments and check them<br>\ninteractively. Formalisation, the process of writing mathematical<br>\nproofs in these systems, is becoming increasingly popular amongst<br>\nmathematicians.</p>\n<p>This session will showcase projects bridging the gap between ITPs and<br>\nother kinds of mathematical software and computation. There are many<br>\naspects of this which could be explored further. For example; tactics<br>\nfor ITPs which make use (and verify) witnesses extracted from<br>\nunverified computation; code extraction, allowing formalised<br>\nalgorithms to be used for computer algebra; proof discovery and<br>\nvisualisation tools within ITPs which make use of external<br>\nmathematical software; using proof assistants to check key reductions<br>\nin computer algebra; or interfaces between ITPs and SAT/SMT solvers to<br>\nverify completely automated proofs.</p>\n<p>We hope that this session will foster collaboration among people<br>\nworking in formalisation, computer algebra, and other areas of<br>\nmathematical computation.</p>\n<p>Alex Best and Heather Macbeth</p>",

However, would your Apple contract allow this?   If not, Iâ€™d be prepared to step in and give the talk.</p>\n<p>*   Paul.</p>",
