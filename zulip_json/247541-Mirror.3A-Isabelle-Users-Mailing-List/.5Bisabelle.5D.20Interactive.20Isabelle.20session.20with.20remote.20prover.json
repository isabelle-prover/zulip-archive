We'd love feedback on how to make the approach more robust -- it's still a prototype and pretty hacky in places.</p>\n<p>Since I/P works at the PIDE level, it is compatible with other tooling operating at the Scala level, like our MCP interface I/Q or Isabelle Assistant that Dominic posted about earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nHanno</p>",
