Responses will be used as data for an AI<br>\npaper from Cambridge, which can inform future AI, human-computer<br>\ninteraction, and mathematics research. The evaluations will be<br>\nopen-sourced. No personal information will be stored, with the exception of<br>\nyour level of mathematical experience that you may indicate in the opening<br>\nsurvey.</p>\n<p>We are very much appreciative of any evaluations that you may provide. You<br>\ncan complete up to 9 interactive AI evaluations, though you are welcome to<br>\nstop at any time. Even 15 minutes of your time is very much appreciated,<br>\nand hopefully fun to interact with AI systems :)</p>\n<p>We ask that you are enrolled in, or have, at least an undergraduate-level<br>\ndegree in mathematics (or equivalent level of mathematics expertise) to do<br>\nthe evaluations. You may choose a particular topic to evaluate.</p>\n<p>If you are keen (and consent to having the evaluation data open-sourced)<br>\nplease partake here &lt;<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/interactivemathevals/\">https://sites.google.com/view/interactivemathevals/</a>&gt;.<br>\nPlease expect a short delay when loading the website and up to a potential<br>\n60 second delay for AI agents to generate content.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to Katie (<a href=\"mailto:kmc61@cam.ac.uk\">kmc61@cam.ac.uk</a>) or Albert (<a href=\"mailto:qj213@cam.ac.uk\">qj213@cam.ac.uk</a>) if<br>\nyou have any questions or concerns. Thank you!</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\nKatie Collins and Albert Jiang</p>",
