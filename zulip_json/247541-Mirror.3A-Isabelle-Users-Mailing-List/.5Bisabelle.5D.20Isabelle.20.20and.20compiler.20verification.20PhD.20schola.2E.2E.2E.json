Graal is a high-performance polyglot virtual machine (VM) that not only supports JVM-based languages such as Java, Scala, Kotlin and Groovy, and LLVM-based languages like C and C++, but also more dynamic languages like Python and JavaScript. This research project focuses on verifying optimization passes of the Graal compiler, using the Isabelle interactive theorem prover.</p>\n<p>For more details please see:<br>\n<a href=\"https://scholarships.uq.edu.au/scholarship/phd-scholarship-verifying-compiler-optimization-passes\">https://scholarships.uq.edu.au/scholarship/phd-scholarship-verifying-compiler-optimization-passes</a></p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nMark</p>\n<p>Associate Professor Mark Utting<br>\nMSc Waikato, PhD UNSW<br>\nDiscipline Leader, Cyber Security and Software Engineering</p>\n<p>School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering<br>\nThe University of Queensland<br>\nBrisbane Qld 4072 Australia</p>\n<p>T +61 7 3365 2386<br>\nE m.utting@uq.edu.au&lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:m.utting@uq.edu.au\">m.utting@uq.edu.au</a>&gt; W https://cyber.uq.edu.au&lt;<a href=\"https://cyber.uq.edu.au/\">https://cyber.uq.edu.au/</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>CRICOS Provider: 00025B</p>\n<p>[https://support.staff.uq.edu.au/ci/inlineImage/get/4826099/277631508108acd58f44b90a9297a394]</p>\n<p>The University of Queensland is embracing the Green Office philosophy.
