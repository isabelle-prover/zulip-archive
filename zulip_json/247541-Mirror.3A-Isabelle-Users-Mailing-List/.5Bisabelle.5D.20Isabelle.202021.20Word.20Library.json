I previously made use of the libraries \"HOL-Word.Word” and \"HOL-Word.Word_Bitwise” and see that these have been replaced with improved versions. I am now including \"HOL-Library.Word”, but I cannot find some of the things previously available (or new versions of them). For example, I cannot find the signed shiftr operator &gt;&gt;&gt;, functions such as to_bl and msb, or bitwise theorems such as to_bl_plus_carry.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know where these can be found in Isabelle 2021? I am especially looking for the bitwise theorems over arithmetic, i.e., theorems similar to “twos_complement\" and “to_bl_plus_carry\".</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>Freek</p>",
