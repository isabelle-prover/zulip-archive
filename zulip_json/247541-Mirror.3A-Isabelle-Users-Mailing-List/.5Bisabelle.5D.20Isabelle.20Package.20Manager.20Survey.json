Such Isabelle-specific <br>\nconcepts have emerged over decades from technical and cultural <br>\nside-conditions. There is usually little concern to copy other approaches, <br>\njust because they are \"popular\" or \"every does it\".</p>\n<p>Further note, that for 25 years I've always been talking about \"formal proof <br>\ndocuments\" or \"formal mathematical documents\", rather than \"program code\" etc. <br>\nIt still remains to be seen, if or when Isabelle will manage to present an <br>\nauthoring model that is free from \"program development\" paradigms, <br>\nterminology, tooling etc. In this respect, see also my paper \"Interaction with <br>\nFormal Mathematical Documents in Isabelle/PIDE\" <br>\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01735\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01735</a> from CICM 2019.</p>\n<p>* At ITP 2023, some Coq people have published a paper on their build and <br>\npackage management under the somewhat misleading title \"Proof Repair <br>\nInfrastructure for Supervised Models: Building a Large Proof Repair Dataset\", <br>\nsee <br>\n<a href=\"https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol268-itp2023/LIPIcs.ITP.2023.26/LIPIcs.ITP.2023.26.pdf\">https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol268-itp2023/LIPIcs.ITP.2023.26/LIPIcs.ITP.2023.26.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Note that Coq projects follow a conventional model of make files with OPAM <br>\npackages (with many variations). That causes some problems, though, which were <br>\nthe starting point for this paper: The authors wanted to collect data, but <br>\nended up tinkering with Coq builds.</p>\n<p>In Isabelle you could move directly to the application (harvesting formal <br>\ncontent from project results). See also this quote from section \"5.2 Other <br>\nproof assistants\" of the Coq paper:</p>\n<p>\"\"\"<br>\nIn Isabelle, the Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP) provides a highly centralized, <br>\nstandard host for proof developments and eases their association with metadata <br>\nthat may be useful for ML. The AFP also neatly versions proof developments for <br>\nevery official release of Isabelle and semantically groups them in different <br>\nfolders. At the time of writing, the AFP includes 725 proof developments [1], <br>\nand it already forms the basis of a static dataset for Isabelle [32]. We <br>\nsuspect the AFP would also make a very strong basis for a proof repair dataset <br>\ndue to its neat versioning.<br>\n\"\"\"</p>\n<p>Please ignore what they later about PISA and scala-isabelle. The official <br>\nIsabelle/Scala infrastructure is sufficient to do all the heavy lifting, <br>\nwithout extra complication.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
