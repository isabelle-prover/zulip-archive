This early announcement may help to organize travels accurately, and not <br>\nmiss important parts of the ITP event.</p>\n<p>As usual the workshop website <br>\n<a href=\"https://sketis.net/isabelle/isabelle-workshop-2024\">https://sketis.net/isabelle/isabelle-workshop-2024</a> will be continuously <br>\nupdated to reflect the current state of affairs.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
