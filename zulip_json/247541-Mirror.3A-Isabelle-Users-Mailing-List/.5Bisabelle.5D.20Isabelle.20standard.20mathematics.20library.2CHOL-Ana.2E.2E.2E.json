Is this the most<br>\nappropriate reference? For HOL-Algebra, I was not able to find any relevant<br>\npublications. It seems that [2] is relevant for HOL-Analysis, but I am not<br>\ncertain if this is the only article and/or the most relevant one, as it<br>\nseems to cover only one part of the library. Any help/advice on how to<br>\nreference these libraries in the most appropriate manner would be highly<br>\nappreciated.</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nMikhail Chekhov</p>\n<p>[1] Hölzl J, Immler F, Huffman B.
