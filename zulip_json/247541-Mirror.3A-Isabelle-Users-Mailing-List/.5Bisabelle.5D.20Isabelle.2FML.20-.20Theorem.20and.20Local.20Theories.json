Indeed, in case the locale is not yet there in your Isar theory, it is not obvious how to put Isabelle/ML text within that locale. So you loose the convenience of antiquotations to refer to locale content at that point.</p>\n<p>But the scenario you describe seems to be different. One central question is in which context “ctxt” do you make the Goal.prove.Is this also a locale context?<br>\nNote that the theorem you get out of Goal.prove lives within that ctxt that you supplied. So it depends very much on the ctxt to know where you can immediately use it. When you want to use that theorem in another context ctxt1 (like the locale you generate in step 2) the idea is that you first <em>export</em> the theorem from ctxt to the theory level and then <em>import</em> it to ctxt1. For the export there is Proof_Context.export but for the import there is no obvious Isabelle/ML API (as far as I know). My understanding of the current state of Isabelle is that the “import” is something that should be implicitly handled by the locale infrastructure. So here some ideas how to use what is there to do the import. One way I usually think about this is to think about how I would write down an example in the Isar top-level and then think about what happens in the background.</p>\n<p>Here some sketch:</p>\n<p>context some_locale_one<br>\nbegin<br>\n …<br>\n  lemma foo: ...<br>\nend</p>\n<p>locale my_new_locale<br>\nbegin</p>\n<p>… here I want to use foo<br>\nend</p>\n<p>You cannot directly use theorem foo in my_new_locale. What technically is available is the theory-level version <a href=\"http://some_locale_one.foo\">some_locale_one.foo</a>, which is a generalised version of foo with respect to the fixes / assumes of some_locale_one. So you can use that one, but then you have to discharge the assumptions by yourself.</p>\n<p>The canonical way to access foo in my_new_locale is to do some kind of interpretation (or sublocale, …) command of some_locale_one inside my_new_locale. As a result you can access the interpreted version of foo potentially with a qualified name that you supplied with the interpretation. So this interpretation is the kind of automatic import of the theorem foo that the infrastructure provides.</p>\n<p>Note that one important ingredient in the background is that the lemma foo above is not just a Goal.prove but more importantly  it “notes” the theorem to the local theory, via a derivative of Local_Theory.note. This Local_Theory.note is one kind of “declaration” that I referred to in my last mail. Everything that is noted will then also be subject to interpretation and be automatically imported.</p>\n<p>I routinely use the following idiom for such things in Isabelle/ML where I use named theorems and attributes to store the theorems.</p>\n<p>named_theorems my_collection</p>\n<p>context some_locale_one<br>\nbegin<br>\n …<br>\n  lemma foo[my_collection]: ...<br>\nend</p>\n<p>locale my_new_locale<br>\nbegin</p>\n<p>… here I want to use foo<br>\n  So I interprete some_locale_one and then use </p>\n<p>Named_Theorems.get ctxt @{named_theorems my_collection}<br>\nend</p>\n<p>Instead of the theorem name I use the more robust named theorems (via antiquotation named_theorems) to access the theorems in Isabelle/ML. You can also directly supply attributes like my_collection to Local_Theory.note.</p>\n<p>This illustrates the general principle with the existing ingredients like named theorems and attributes. <br>\nFor more ambitious and custom use cases there is the Local_Thoery.declaration which is more general than Local_Theory.note.

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.</p>\n<p>Dear Diego, </p>\n<p>One standard use case that works out of the box can be thought of as viewing the problem from \"inside out”. Where by “inside” I mean inside of the locale.<br>\n1. You enter the locale you are interested in. There you operate and think relative to the “fixes” and “assumes” of that locale (including all ancestors).<br>\n2. Within that locale you write our Isabelle/ML code, which on the Isar toplevel could be via commands like “declaration” or for example “simproc_setup”. Those commands expect your Isabelle/ML code do be a function depending on a morphism “phi\". Whenever you want to refer to some abstract entity of the locale, e.g. the fixes and assumes (or theorems) you can and usually should make use of “phi\" to transform them from the abstract version to the concrete interpretation. E.g. if you have an assumption (or theorem) named foo in your locale you can transform it by \"Morphism.thm phi @{thm foo}”. Note that as you are within the locale you can use the antiquotation mechanisms like @{thm …} to have static checks that you actually refer to what you mean.<br>\n3. Whenever the locale is interpreted (e.g. by “sublocale\", “interpretation\", new locales that have this locale as ancestor,  …), the locale infrastructure of Isabelle automatically activates all the declarations (and simprocs) by supplying the proper “phi\" to your declaration, simproc… So in case of the simproc there may be a lot of instances of the same simproc active at the same moment with different phi. That’s why it is important that you transform all abstract entities in step 2 by using Morphism.thm, Morphism.term etc. </p>\n<p>So when your use case fits into this model of thinking, there is no need to worry about where to get the phi from. Generating all the necessary phi’s and applying them to all the “declarations” is done by the infrastructure. In this context a simproc is just a special kind of declaration. The more general “declaration” can also be used to work with custom Theory_Data / Generic_Data, as Makarius has pointed out. The core idea here is that in step 2 above you also use the phi at hand to transform that custom data.</p>\n<p>Here is a small example from the AFP that illustrates this approach:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/sessions/autocorres2_test/#Match_Cterm_Ex.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/sessions/autocorres2_test/#Match_Cterm_Ex.html</a></p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nNorbert</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Norbert Schirmer (<a href=\"mailto:nschirmer@apple.com\">nschirmer@apple.com</a> &lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:nschirmer@apple.com\">nschirmer@apple.com</a>&gt;)<br>\n SEG Formal Verification</p>\n<p>On 16.

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.</p>\n<p>Hi Diego,</p>\n<p>I see. Indeed, in case the locale is not yet there in your Isar theory, it is not obvious how to put Isabelle/ML text within that locale. So you loose the convenience of antiquotations to refer to locale content at that point.</p>\n<p>But the scenario you describe seems to be different. One central question is in which context “ctxt” do you make the Goal.prove.Is this also a locale context?<br>\nNote that the theorem you get out of Goal.prove lives within that ctxt that you supplied. So it depends very much on the ctxt to know where you can immediately use it. When you want to use that theorem in another context ctxt1 (like the locale you generate in step 2) the idea is that you first <em>export</em> the theorem from ctxt to the theory level and then <em>import</em> it to ctxt1. For the export there is Proof_Context.export but for the import there is no obvious Isabelle/ML API (as far as I know). My understanding of the current state of Isabelle is that the “import” is something that should be implicitly handled by the locale infrastructure. So here some ideas how to use what is there to do the import. One way I usually think about this is to think about how I would write down an example in the Isar top-level and then think about what happens in the background.</p>\n<p>Here some sketch:</p>\n<p>context some_locale_one<br>\nbegin<br>\n …<br>\n  lemma foo: ...<br>\nend</p>\n<p>locale my_new_locale<br>\nbegin</p>\n<p>… here I want to use foo<br>\nend</p>\n<p>You cannot directly use theorem foo in my_new_locale. What technically is available is the theory-level version <a href=\"http://some_locale_one.foo\">some_locale_one.foo</a>, which is a generalised version of foo with respect to the fixes / assumes of some_locale_one. So you can use that one, but then you have to discharge the assumptions by yourself.</p>\n<p>The canonical way to access foo in my_new_locale is to do some kind of interpretation (or sublocale, …) command of some_locale_one inside my_new_locale. As a result you can access the interpreted version of foo potentially with a qualified name that you supplied with the interpretation. So this interpretation is the kind of automatic import of the theorem foo that the infrastructure provides.</p>\n<p>Note that one important ingredient in the background is that the lemma foo above is not just a Goal.prove but more importantly  it “notes” the theorem to the local theory, via a derivative of Local_Theory.note. This Local_Theory.note is one kind of “declaration” that I referred to in my last mail. Everything that is noted will then also be subject to interpretation and be automatically imported.</p>\n<p>I routinely use the following idiom for such things in Isabelle/ML where I use named theorems and attributes to store the theorems.</p>\n<p>named_theorems my_collection</p>\n<p>context some_locale_one<br>\nbegin<br>\n …<br>\n  lemma foo[my_collection]: ...<br>\nend</p>\n<p>locale my_new_locale<br>\nbegin</p>\n<p>… here I want to use foo<br>\n  So I interprete some_locale_one and then use</p>\n<p>Named_Theorems.get ctxt @{named_theorems my_collection}<br>\nend</p>\n<p>Instead of the theorem name I use the more robust named theorems (via antiquotation named_theorems) to access the theorems in Isabelle/ML. You can also directly supply attributes like my_collection to Local_Theory.note.</p>\n<p>This illustrates the general principle with the existing ingredients like named theorems and attributes.<br>\nFor more ambitious and custom use cases there is the Local_Thoery.declaration which is more general than Local_Theory.note. With it you can implement your own approach to “store” and “retrieve” data.
