Unfortunately I the code base is rather big and I cannot seem to produce a small example where the same problem is occurring. Therefore I try to explain the problem on an abstract level:</p>\n<p>I have two functions \"contextChangingFunction1\" and \"contextChangingFunction2\" which, as the name suggests, are functions from local_theory to local_theory. Here \"contextChangingFunction1\" defines some function in the current context using \"Function_Fun.add_fun\" and then \"contextChangingFunction2\" proofs a lemma which uses the \"eresolve_tac\" with the \".elims\" theorem of the newly defined function.</p>\n<p>At the moment I can use these two functions with the \"local_setup\"-Isar command to change my context like in VERSION 1 (below). Unfortunately if I chain them together as in VERSION 2 (also below) I get an error because the proof of the lemma fails. I cannot seem to work out an explanation for my problem as I had the impression that \"local_setup\" only executes the function given to change the current context. But if that would be the case, then VERSION 1 and VERSION 2 would have an equivalent result.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know what the reason for this could be? Or is this a problem that can only be narrowed down considering the whole code-base?</p>\n<p>Cheers and thanks for your help,</p>\n<p>Cedric</p>\n<p>VERSION 1 (works):</p>\n<p>local_setup \\&lt;open&gt;</p>\n<p>contextChangingFunction1</p>\n<p>\\&lt;close&gt;</p>\n<p>local_setup \\&lt;open&gt;</p>\n<p>contextChangingFunction2</p>\n<p>\\&lt;close&gt;</p>\n<p>VERSION 2 (does not work):</p>\n<p>local_setup \\&lt;open&gt;</p>\n<p>contextChangingFunction1</p>\n<p>#&gt; contextChangingFunction2</p>\n<p>\\&lt;close&gt;</p>\n<p>ML-MOCKUP OF THE TWO FUNCTIONS CORE FUNCTIONALITY:</p>\n<p>ML \\&lt;open&gt;</p>\n<p>fun contextChangingFunction1 (ctxt: local_theory) =</p>\n<p>Function_Fun.add_fun  [(<a href=\"http://Binding.name\">Binding.name</a> funcName, ...)] ...;</p>\n<p>fun contextChangingFunction2 (ctxt: local_theory) =<br>\nlet<br>\n     val proof =<br>\n         Goal.prove ctxt [] [] someGoal<br>\n         (fn _ =&gt; ...<br>\n                        THEN (eresolve_tac ctxt [Proof_Context.get_thm ctxt \"funcName.elims\")] 1)<br>\n                         ... );<br>\nin<br>\n    (Local_Theory.note ((<a href=\"http://Binding.name\">Binding.name</a> lemmaName, ...), [proof]) #&gt; snd) ctxt<br>\nend;</p>\n<p>\\&lt;close&gt;</p>",
