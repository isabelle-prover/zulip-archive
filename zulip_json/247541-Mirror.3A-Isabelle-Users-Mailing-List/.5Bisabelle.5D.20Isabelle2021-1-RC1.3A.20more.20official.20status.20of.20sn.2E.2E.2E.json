For<br>\nexample, this is relevant to \"launch\" add-on projects that are awaiting a<br>\nproper Isabelle release eventually. The Admin/init script within the<br>\nrepository greatly helps with that, see<br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle/file/72d2ef5ee128/Admin/init\">https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle/file/72d2ef5ee128/Admin/init</a></p>\n<p>It is not in the NEWS, because the communication model of that file is to talk<br>\nabout proper releases.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
