Stark\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:isabelle-users@starkeffect.com\">isabelle-users@starkeffect.com</a>&gt;<br>\nThis is not necessarily new behavior to Isabelle2021-RC1, but I just observed a reason that<br>\nexplains why it occurs, and might lead someone to be able to fix it.</p>\n<p>Not infrequently, sledgehammer will report \"Try this: using X Y Z ... by presburger\", but when you<br>\nactually insert this, the proof fails.  In the past, I have observed that the result can often be<br>\nsalvaged by using \"metis\" in place of \"presburger\" (though for the cases where this arises, which<br>\ndo not actually involve Presburger arithmetic, presburger can often be much, much faster than other<br>\nmethods).</p>\n<p>Today I just noticed that whether or not presburger succeeds can sometimes be sensitive to the<br>\nordering of the assumptions in the \"using\" clause that precedes \"by presburger\".  I confirmed that,<br>\nin at least one instance where the \"using X Y Z ... by presburger\" did not succeed, that it<br>\ndid succeed when the assumptions were permuted.  More specifically, I applied sledgehammer to<br>\nsomething of the form:</p>\n<p>using A B C ...</p>\n<p>I received the suggestion \"using X Y Z ... by presburger\", but \"using A B C ... X Y Z ... by presburger\"<br>\ndid not succeed.  However after permuting \"A B C ... X Y Z ...\" appropriately, presburger did succeed.</p>\n<p>I don't know if proof methods are permitted to be sensitive to the order of assumptions in the context.<br>\nI would think that this would not be desirable.  In any case, it seems that one class of failures of<br>\n\"by presburger\" suggestions returned by sledgehammer are due to presburger having such a sensitivity.</p>",
