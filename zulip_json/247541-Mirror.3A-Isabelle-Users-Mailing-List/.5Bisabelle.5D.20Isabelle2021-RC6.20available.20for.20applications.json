The final<br>\nversion will presumably be published towards the end of the week.</p>\n<p>So here is some very last release candidate<br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.sketis.net/website-Isabelle2021-RC6\">https://isabelle.sketis.net/website-Isabelle2021-RC6</a></p>\n<p>See again<br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/phame/post/view/28/release_candidates_for_isabelle2021\">https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/phame/post/view/28/release_candidates_for_isabelle2021</a><br>\nand 4 for further details.</p>\n<p>The main change: more examples and more documentation for Isabelle/Naproche:<br>\nit is like a formal version of LaTeX with every block of a statement or proof<br>\nchecked by E Prover (similar to Sledgehammer).</p>\n<p>Any feedback about release candidates should be posted with a meaningful<br>\nSubject including the version (not just a clone of this announcement).</p>\n<p>People who have tested earlier release candidates should definitely follow<br>\nthis one, otherwise some last-minute problems might remain undetected.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
