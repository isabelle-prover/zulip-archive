()) ›<br>\n  by simp</p>\n<p>lemma ‹inv (λs. id s) = (λ_. ()) ›<br>\n  by force</p>\n<p>lemma ‹(λs. id s) = inv(λ_. ()) ›<br>\n  by force</p>\n<p>lemma ‹inv (λs. id s) = inv(λ_. ()) ›<br>\n  by force</p>\n<p>While this example of lemmas are trivial, the same cases can be<br>\nhidden behind definitions based on a complicated data model, which is<br>\nsometimes hard to see(especially when reviewing Isabelle theories for some<br>\npaper).</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Yakoub.</p>",
