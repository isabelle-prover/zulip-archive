The Isabelle functions <br>\nBash.string (in ML or Scala) do it differently, e.g. see <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle-release/file/Isabelle2022-RC3/src/Pure/System/bash.scala\">https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle-release/file/Isabelle2022-RC3/src/Pure/System/bash.scala</a> <br>\n--- but this only covers processes started from within  Isabelle/ML/Scala.</p>\n<p>The bootstrap of Java/Scala itself is subject to further side-conditions that <br>\nI don't fully understand (e.g. default Locale). E.g. on Windows, \"Test a\" <br>\nusually works, but \"Test ä\" fails.</p>\n<p>Likewise there can be differences with Simplified Chinese vs. Traditional <br>\nChinese; I sometimes try \"Test 中国\". After experimenting with the Windows <br>\nmachine of a Chinise student approx. 10 years ago, I am still unsure how well <br>\nit works for far Eastern users.</p>\n<p>I guess that the Cyrillic world is fine (e.g. Russian or Serbian Locales).</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
