So the <br>\ntime for testing is <em>now</em>, before the end of the release process (early <br>\nSeptember).</p>\n<p>In continuation of the blog entry <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/phame/post/view/68/release_candidates_for_isabelle2023\">https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/phame/post/view/68/release_candidates_for_isabelle2023</a> <br>\nthe release train has arrived at Isabelle2023-RC2. Notable changes are <br>\nreported in the blog.</p>\n<p>Despite hardly any public discussion of release candidates so far, a few <br>\nimportant things have happened internally. Now is the turn of everyone else on <br>\nthis channel: We need more serious testing.</p>\n<p>As usual, any feedback about Isabelle release candidates should be posted with <br>\na meaningful<br>\nSubject --- not just a clone of the announcement.</p>\n<p>As I will attend ITP 2023 in Bia≈Çystok next week, there will be also <br>\nopportunities to show me things in person.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
