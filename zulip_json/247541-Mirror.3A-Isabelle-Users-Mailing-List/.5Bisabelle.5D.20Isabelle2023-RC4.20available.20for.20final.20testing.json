There is <br>\na final chance to test Isabelle2023-RC4 from <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2023-RC4\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2023-RC4</a> -- less than 2 weeks <br>\nbefore the release becomes final and unchangeable (this saves a lot of <br>\nresources for development and maintenance).</p>\n<p>People who have started using Isabelle2023-RC3 already, should now switch to <br>\nIsabelle2023-RC4, to avoid bad surprises in the last moment.</p>\n<p>Further details are recorded in the release blog: <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/phame/post/view/68/release_candidates_for_isabelle2023\">https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/phame/post/view/68/release_candidates_for_isabelle2023</a></p>\n<p>Side-remark: support for distributed build clusters has now become officially <br>\nvisible with status <em>experimental</em>. It should work sufficiently well for our <br>\nown testing of Isabelle + AFP (this is its main purpose right now).</p>\n<p>Very ambitious and large projects may venture to use it on their own account, <br>\nbut it will require notable tinkering with SSH and PostgreSQL databases (there <br>\nare no further system dependencies).</p>\n<p>In the next Isabelle release, cluster builds will become more accessible for <br>\neveryone who needs it.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
