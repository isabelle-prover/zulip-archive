Thus we are entering the final stage <br>\nof testing, which lasts approx. 2 weeks. People who have tested previous <br>\nrelease candidates should follow RC3. People who have not participated in <br>\ntesting yet, should try RC3 now.</p>\n<p>As usual, \"final release of Isabelle\" really means final / immutable / <br>\nunchangeable: problem reports that arrive too late are only relevant for a <br>\nlater release.</p>\n<p>Any feedback about Isabelle release candidates should be posted with a <br>\nmeaningful Subject line, not just a clone of this announcement.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
