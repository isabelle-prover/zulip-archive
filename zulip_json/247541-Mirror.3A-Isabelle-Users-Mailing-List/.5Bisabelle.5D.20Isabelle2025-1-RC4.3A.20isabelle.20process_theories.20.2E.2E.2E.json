Short answer: We <br>\nhave given up this model &gt; 10 years ago, and won't go back. Isabelle is a <br>\ndocument-oriented proof assistant instead.</p>\n<p>And in fact, asking the canonical questions: \"What is your application? What <br>\nare you trying to do?\" the answer is often something like this: \"I want to <br>\ninspect intermediate states of processed theories (including proofs), but not <br>\nnecessarily while the engine is still running\".</p>\n<p>Here are some answers to that, from the NEWS of Isabelle2021-1:</p>\n<p>\"\"\"<br>\n<strong>* System </strong>*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The command-line tool \"isabelle process_theories\" tool takes source<br>\nfiles and theories within a proper session context (like regular<br>\n\"isabelle build\"). Output of prover messages works roughly like<br>\n\"isabelle build_log\", while the theories are being processed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p>isabelle process_theories -U -O HOL-Library.Multiset</p>\n<p>isabelle process_theories -U -O -o show_states HOL-Library.Multiset</p>\n<p>isabelle process_theories -f '~~/src/HOL/Examples/Seq.thy'</p>\n<ul>\n<li>System option \"record_theories\" tells \"isabelle build\" to record<br>\nintermediate theory commands and results, at the cost of approx. 5 times<br>\nlarger ML heap images. This allows to retrieve fine-grained semantic<br>\ninformation later on, using Thy_Info.get_theory_segments or<br>\nThy_Info.get_theory_elements in Isabelle/ML.<br>\n\"\"\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That status-quo will be the starting point for any further discussions about <br>\nthis topic (private or public).</p>\n<p>I do want to see Isabelle system tools eventually that work properly --- <br>\n<em>with</em> the system and not against it. My claim is that it can be done with a <br>\nlittle bit Isabelle/Scala, and maybe some tiny Isabelle/ML addons that are <br>\nloaded beforehand in a proper session context.</p>\n<p>Note that in the Isabelle System manual (\"isabelle doc system\") there is some <br>\nexplanation on \"isabelle scala_project\", to use Java/Scala IDEs like IntelliJ <br>\nIDEA with Isabelle/Scala. There is also our src/Tools/Demo/ for the <br>\nIsabelle/Scala project setup via etc/build.props --- it is easier and more <br>\nrobust than Maven / Gradle / sbt from the Java/Scala world.</p>\n<p>Further note that in Isabelle2025-1, the terminology \"Isabelle Process\" means <br>\n\"Isabelle/Scala process running on the JVM\" by default, and the old notion of <br>\n\"Isabelle/ML process running on Poly/ML\" is explicitly called \"ML_Process\" <br>\n(which is a module in Isabelle/Scala and Isabelle/ML). That has a command-line <br>\ninterface \"isabelle ML_process\", although it is rarely useful, because it lack <br>\nthe mandatory Isabelle/Scala/PIDE session context.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
