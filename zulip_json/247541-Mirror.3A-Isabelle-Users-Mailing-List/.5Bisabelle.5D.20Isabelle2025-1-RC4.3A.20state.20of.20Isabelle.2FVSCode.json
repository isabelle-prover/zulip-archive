E.g. when I hit the tracing limit <br>\nmessage (\"Tracing paused. Stop, or continue with next 100, 1000, 10000 <br>\nmessages?\"), I cannot click it to see more messages.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Kevin</p>\n<p>On 08.12.25 22:05, Makarius wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Isabelle users,</p>\n<p>there is a lot of excitement and publicity around VSCode, and I have <br>\nspent a lot of time on Isabelle/VSCode recently.
