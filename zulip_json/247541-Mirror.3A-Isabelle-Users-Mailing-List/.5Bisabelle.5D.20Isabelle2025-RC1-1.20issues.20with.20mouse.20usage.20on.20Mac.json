The issues have been <br>\nin Isabelle for many years. They are exacerbated when one uses a (higher <br>\nresolution) Apple Magic Mouse as compared to the track pad or an old <br>\nDell wheel mouse (although they occur with all three).</p>\n<p>From my mailing list post 6/2/2025:<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/msg/cl-isabelle-users/2025-02/vsz7n4TvV8DU6LkdrX4hOA\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/msg/cl-isabelle-users/2025-02/vsz7n4TvV8DU6LkdrX4hOA</a>&gt;<br>\n--<br>\nA slight movement of the mouse when Command clicking through to a <br>\nlemma/definition means it fails and selects the character under the <br>\ncursor. I'm guessing this is something to do with the fact that the <br>\nCommand click occurs, not on pressing the mouse, but when it is then <br>\nreleased. For example, if you Command press and move the mouse a little <br>\nand then release, it won't go through to the definition but rather <br>\nselects the text under the cursor. And the behaviour is worse when I use <br>\nan Apple magic mouse in place of an old mouse -- I suspect because the <br>\nMagic mouse will generate a small movement more easily.</p>\n<p>A similar issue occurs when clicking on a the output of sledgehammer to <br>\nget it to copy the suggested proof into the theory file.</p>\n<p>Another issue is double-clicking the name of a theory in the theories <br>\nmenu is also flaky if the mouse moves slightly between the two clicks, <br>\neven if one remains within the same menu item.<br>\n--</p>\n<p>From my mailing list post 10/2/2025<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/msg/cl-isabelle-users/2025-02/EG0nW0_Z5p704b34yHE6eA\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/msg/cl-isabelle-users/2025-02/EG0nW0_Z5p704b34yHE6eA</a>&gt;<br>\n--<br>\nFor MacOS for a left mouse click there are the following mouse events:</p>\n<p>* Press down the button:  NSLeftMouseDown which invokes mouseDown<br>\n  * Move the mouse while pressing the button: NSLeftMouseDragged which<br>\n    invokes mouseDragged</p>\n<p>* Release the button:|NSLeftMouseUp which invokesmouseUp|<br>\n  * ||Move the mouse without pressing any button: NSMouseMoved which<br>\n    invokes mouseMoved</p>\n<p>A combination of mouseDown-mouseDragged-mouseUp selects the text between <br>\nthe coordinates of the mouseDown and mouseUp. The problem with <br>\nCommand-click would appear to be that the text selection behaviour is <br>\nhappening when the Command key is held down (for a click through) and <br>\nthe selection behaviour is taking precedence over the Command click*. If <br>\nthe selection behaviour was disabled while the Command key is held down <br>\nthat might fix the problem. Alternatively, the Command click behaviour <br>\nshould take precedence over selection of text.</p>\n<p>*In practice, sometimes it recognises the Command-click and other it <br>\nrecognises a selection, so this looks like a classic (concurrency) race <br>\nbetween the two actions. With the Command key held down, mouseDown-move <br>\na few characters-mouseUp always selects the text, even if it is in the <br>\none name.</p>\n<p>An alternative scenario is the following.<br>\nThe mouseDown-mouseUp combination (*without *Command key held) moves the <br>\ncursor to the location of the mouse. With the Command key held down, it <br>\nnon-deterministically either moves the cursor or clicks through to the <br>\ndefinition. Again this looks like a race between the two actions. If the <br>\ncursor movement action was disabled while the Command key is held down <br>\nor the Command-click given precedence that may work.</p>\n<p>From my experimentation, it appears the Command-click does not happen <br>\nuntil the mouse is released (mouseUp). If the Command click action was <br>\ninvoked on mouseDown, the issue might be resolved.</p>\n<p>Using the track-pad rather than the mouse is more reliable but can still <br>\nexhibit the same behaviour. The detailed behaviour is that with Command <br>\nheld down, mouseDown moves the cursor to the mouse location and on <br>\nmouseUp it moves it to the definition of the item. On some occasions it <br>\njust moves the cursor to the mouse location and does not go to the <br>\ndefinition, and on other occasions it moves the cursor to the mouse <br>\nposition and removes the highlight from the item under the mouse, where <br>\nby highlight, I mean the highlighting that occurs when one presses the <br>\nCommand key.</p>\n<p>Another symptom is that if the cursor is on name and the Command key <br>\nheld, the name is not highlighted, but if one leaves the Command key <br>\nheld and moves the cursor a little, the name is then highlighted.<br>\nA related symptom is that when the Command key is held and the name <br>\nhighlighted for a couple of seconds, a pop-up window appears and the <br>\nhighlight is removed from the name until one moves the cursor again.</p>\n<p>An old (lower resolution) Dell wheel mouse is more reliable than the <br>\ntrack-pad, which is in turn more reliable than a magic mouse. But note <br>\nthat even with the old Dell mouse a small mouse movement between down <br>\nand up gives a cursor move or select text action, and not a <br>\nclick-through to definition action. The symptoms occur on both my old M1 <br>\nlaptop and a new mini with a fresh install of everything.</p>\n<p>Probably not relevant here but in the Finder under MacOS, if wants to <br>\nselect multiple files, one holds down the Command key while clicking on <br>\neach file.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a mouse event handling expert.<br>\n--</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance<br>\nIan</p>\n<p>On 6/11/2025 04:36, Makarius wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Isabelle users,</p>\n<p>this calendar year has two Isabelle releases (which happen every 8-10 <br>\nmonths).
