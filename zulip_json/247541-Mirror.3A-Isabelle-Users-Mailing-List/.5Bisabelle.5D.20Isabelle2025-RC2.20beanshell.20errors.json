Save the attached Emacs_Remap_keys.prop in $JEDIT_SETTINGS/keymaps,<br>\n   and select \"Emacs Remap\" through<br>\n   Isabelle &gt; Settings &gt; Global Options &gt; jEdit &gt; Shortcuts.</p>\n<p>2. To activate the option key, add<br>\n     Debug.ALT_KEY_PRESSED_DISABLED = false;<br>\n     Debug.ALTERNATIVE_DISPATCHER = false;<br>\n   in<br>\n   /Applications/Isabelle2025-RC2.app/contrib/jedit-20250209/jedit5.7.0-patched/startup/startup.bsh.</p>\n<p>However, I now get the two errors:</p>\n<p>1. When I start Isabelle (through terminal), I get the error message in<br>\n   the attached file Error_ALTERNATIVE_DISPATCHER.txt.<br>\n   (Isabelle starts anyway, though.)</p>\n<p>2. The Shortcut key such as Control+n does not work, and invokes the<br>\n   error message in the attached file Error_ Accessibility.txt.</p>\n<p>Since these errors are due to my own customization, there may be no problem<br>\nin Isabelle2025-RC2 itself.<br>\nHowever, I have not encountered such errors until Isabelle2024.<br>\nTo be honest, I currently have no idea how to fix them.<br>\nI would be happy if you give me some workarounds.</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>-- <br>\n伊藤 洋介<br>\nYosuke ITO<br>\n+81 80-5057-6931<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:glacier345@gmail.com\">glacier345@gmail.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/do0wNLAYOU69zdrI49RSwK5w/Error_ALTERNATIVE_DISPATCHER.txt\">Error_ALTERNATIVE_DISPATCHER.txt</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/_YO4jeq6mLNeOKzeH4SbVxgr/Emacs_Remap_keys.props\">Emacs_Remap_keys.props</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/phcO47TiBDuJ1rZ6jpVsE4PD/Error_-Accessibility.txt\">Error_ Accessibility.txt</a></p>",
