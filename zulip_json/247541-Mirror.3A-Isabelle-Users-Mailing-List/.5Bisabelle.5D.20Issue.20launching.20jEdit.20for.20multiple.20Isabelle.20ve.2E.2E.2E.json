This seems to apply to multiple versions <br>\nof Isabelle,<br>\nincluding 2020 and 2021 instances. This is very strange, because I think <br>\nthey're using<br>\ndifferent jdk and jedit components, and they worked in the past.</p>\n<p>The build processes still seem to work fine, but attempting to start the <br>\njedit process<br>\nresults in heaps of errors (though the editor itself starts up). I <br>\nattach the errors<br>\nthat ended up on the command line.</p>\n<p>This is on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS. Could some kind of update there be <br>\nrelevant?</p>\n<p>Curiously, the development snapshot I built last week is still working <br>\nfine.</p>\n<p>I tried deleting and reinstalling some components from my contrib <br>\ndirectories, etc.<br>\nThis did not result in any apparent change. I'm not sure what else to do <br>\nto debug the<br>\nsituation. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Is there <br>\nsomething else I<br>\nshould be trying or investigating?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,<br>\n     Thomas.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/IEMBnziQRptulYLsI-97Ju0f/components-2020\">components-2020</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/N1P2J6K6oX6r-byV2JXj1LaC/components-2021\">components-2021</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/R4Fvw4k6PFWnaZi7htEzVcvC/errors-2020\">errors-2020</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/btkuFcSNuFGPtAtQ-VqVnaMO/errors-2021\">errors-2021</a></p>",
