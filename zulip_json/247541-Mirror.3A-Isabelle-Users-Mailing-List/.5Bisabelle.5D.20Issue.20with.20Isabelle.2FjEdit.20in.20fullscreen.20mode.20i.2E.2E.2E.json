When using Isabelle / jEdit in fullscreen mode (via the green window-fullscreen toggle in the left-upper corner of the window, not View -&gt; Toggle fullscreen mode), popup windows like the search window (Command - F) or the hypersearch results are now also presented in fullscreen (in Catalina they were presented as ordinary windows on top).</p>\n<p>This does not only look odd, but also makes navigating hypersearch results impossible, as one switches back and forth between the editor view and the result view. Moreover, it is unclear how to close the hypersearch results again. Hope this can be resolved with the upcoming Isabelle2021.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nNorbert</p>",
