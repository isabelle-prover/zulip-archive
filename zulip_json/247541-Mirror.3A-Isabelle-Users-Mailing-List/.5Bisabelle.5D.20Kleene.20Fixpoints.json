But it comes with set-versions of order properties, sup, omega-chains, generic continuity and completeness. They might be too much to be in Main (though I tried to make them good enough).</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAkihisa</p>\n<hr>\n<p>From: <a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users-request@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users-request@lists.cam.ac.uk</a> on behalf of Tobias Nipkow<br>\nSent: Sunday, April 06, 2025 1:50<br>\nTo: Isabelle Users List<br>\nSubject: [isabelle] Kleene Fixpoints</p>\n<p>Do we have Kleene's fixed-point theorem readily available?
