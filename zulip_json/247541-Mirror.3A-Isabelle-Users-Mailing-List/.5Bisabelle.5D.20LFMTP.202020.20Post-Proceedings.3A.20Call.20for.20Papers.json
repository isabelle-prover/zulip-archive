Their design, implementation and their use in<br>\nreasoning tasks, ranging from the correctness of software to the properties<br>\nof<br>\nformal systems, have been the focus of considerable research over the last<br>\ntwo<br>\ndecades. This workshop will bring together designers, implementors and<br>\npractitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and<br>\nutility<br>\nof logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable binding,<br>\ninductive<br>\nand co-inductive reasoning techniques and the expressiveness and lucidity<br>\nof the<br>\nreasoning process.</p>\n<p>The LFMTP 2020 workshop adopts a post-proceedings publication model. The<br>\nworkshop itself took place on 29-30 June 2020 online, jointly with IJCAR and<br>\nFSCD. Now that the workshop has concluded, we solicit submissions of full<br>\npapers<br>\nfor the post-proceedings of LFMTP 2020, which will go through the normal<br>\npeer-review process. Submission is open to all; attendance at the workshop<br>\nis<br>\nnot prerequisite.</p>\n<p>Submissions related to the following topics are welcome: * Encoding and<br>\nreasoning about the meta-theory of programming languages, process calculi<br>\nand<br>\nrelated formally specified systems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Formalisation of model-theoretic and proof-theoretic semantics of logics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable<br>\nbinding,<br>\nespecially the representation of, and reasoning about, datatypes defined<br>\nfrom<br>\nbinding signatures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and<br>\nassociated<br>\nreasoning techniques, including inductive types of higher dimension in<br>\nhomotopy<br>\ntype theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Graphical languages for building proofs and their applications in<br>\ngeometry,<br>\nequational reasoning and category theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New theory contributions: canonical and substructural frameworks,<br>\ncontextual<br>\nframeworks, proof-theoretic foundations supporting binders, functional<br>\nprogramming over logical frameworks, homotopy and cubical type theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of logical frameworks: proof-carrying architectures, proof<br>\nexchange and transformation, program refactoring, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Techniques for programming with binders in functional programming<br>\nlanguages<br>\nsuch as Haskell, OCaml or Agda, and logic programming languages such as<br>\nlambda<br>\nProlog or Alpha-Prolog.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Design and implementation of systems and tools related to meta-languages<br>\nand<br>\nlogical frameworks</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>All deadlines are established as the end of day (23:59) AoE.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract submission deadline:  2 October 2020</li>\n<li>Paper submission deadline:     9 October 2020</li>\n<li>Notification to authors:      20 November 2020</li>\n<li>Final version due:             4 December 2020</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSION INFORMATION</p>\n<p>Submitted papers should be in PDF, formatted using the EPTCS LaTeX style.<br>\nThe<br>\nlength is restricted to 15 pages.</p>\n<p>Submission is via EasyChair:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=lfmtp2020\">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=lfmtp2020</a></p>\n<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed and accepted papers will be published<br>\nin<br>\nthe Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) series.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>David Baelde, LSV, ENS Paris-Saclay &amp; Inria Paris<br>\nFrédéric Blanqui, INRIA<br>\nAlberto Ciaffaglione, University of Udine<br>\nDennis Müller, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg<br>\nMichael Norrish, Data61<br>\nCarlos Olarte, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norde<br>\nClaudio Sacerdoti Coen, University of Bologna (PC Co-Chair)<br>\nUlrich Schöpp, fortiss GmbH<br>\nAlwen Tiu, Australian National University (PC Co-Chair)<br>\nTjark Weber, Uppsala University</p>",
