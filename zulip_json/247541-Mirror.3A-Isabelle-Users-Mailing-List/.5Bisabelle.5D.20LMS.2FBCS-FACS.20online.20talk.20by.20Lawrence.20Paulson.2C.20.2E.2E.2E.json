Recent decades<br>\nhave seen the machine formalisation of lengthy and technically<br>\ncomplicated proofs, but some have argued that even these were not<br>\nrepresentative of modern mathematics. Recent achievements by a number<br>\nof different groups are starting to challenge this scepticism. The<br>\nspeaker will outline some of these, while also noting some of the<br>\nremaining trouble spots.</p>\n<p>Biography: Lawrence Paulson FRS is an American computer scientist. He<br>\nis a Professor of Computational Logic at the University of Cambridge<br>\nComputer Laboratory and a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge. He is<br>\nbest known for the cornerstone text on the programming language ML, ML<br>\nfor the Working Programmer. His research is based around the<br>\ninteractive theorem prover Isabelle, which he introduced in 1986. He<br>\nhas worked on the verification of cryptographic protocols using<br>\ninductive definitions, and he has also formalised the constructible<br>\nuniverse of Kurt GÃ¶del. Recently he has built a new theorem prover,<br>\nMetiTarski, for real-valued special functions.</p>",
