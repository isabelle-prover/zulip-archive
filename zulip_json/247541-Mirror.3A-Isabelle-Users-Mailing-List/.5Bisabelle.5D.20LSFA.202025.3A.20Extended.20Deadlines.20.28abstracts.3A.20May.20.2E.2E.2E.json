Logical and semantic frameworks are formal languages<br>\nthat represent logics and languages, as well as computational, AI and<br>\ndeductive systems. These frameworks provide mathematical foundations<br>\nfor the formal specification of systems and programming languages,<br>\nsupporting tool development and reasoning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:<br>\nautomated deduction; applications of logical and/or semantic<br>\nframeworks; computational and logical properties of semantic<br>\nframeworks; formal semantics of languages and systems; implementation<br>\nof logical and/or semantic frameworks; lambda and combinatory calculi;<br>\nlogical aspects of computational complexity; logical frameworks;<br>\nprocess calculi; proof theory; semantic frameworks; specification<br>\nlanguages and meta-languages; type theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Important dates (AoE):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract submission: May 19, 2025 (extended, previously May 5)</li>\n<li>Paper submission: May 26, 2025 (extended, previously May 12)</li>\n<li>Notification: June 27, 2025</li>\n<li>Camera-ready: July 18, 2025</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Invited Speakers:<ul>\n<li>Temur Kutsia, RISC, Johannes Kepler University (joint with CICM 2025)</li>\n<li>Bruno Lopes, Instituto de Computação, Universidade Federal Fluminense</li>\n<li>Yoni Zohar, Department of Computer Science, Bar Ilan University</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Detailed information can be found on the webpage.</li>\n</ul>",
