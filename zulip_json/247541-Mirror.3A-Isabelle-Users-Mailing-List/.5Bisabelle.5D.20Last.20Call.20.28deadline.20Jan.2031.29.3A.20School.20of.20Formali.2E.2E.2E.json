This is targeted<br>\ntowards junior researchers and mathematicians with little prior exposure to<br>\nFormalization and Automated Theorem Proving and any who are interested in<br>\nthis technology.</p>\n<p>Prospective participants can still apply at [1] DEADLINE: Jan. 31. 2024<br>\n(CET).</p>\n<p>At the school the major theorem proving systems and libraries are<br>\nintroduced by their developers. We envision it to be quite informal,<br>\nhands-on, and interactive. We plan to have plenary sessions in the mornings<br>\n9-11 on Monday May 13 to introduce the systems in a ca. 20 min lightning<br>\ntalks, and in the remaining days present specific aspects of general<br>\ninterest of the systems (please volunteer two topics) in 40 min<br>\npresentations. In the afternoons we will form small groups that get their<br>\nhands dirty in specific formalization projects.</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://him-application.uni-bonn.de/index.php?id=5960\">https://him-application.uni-bonn.de/index.php?id=5960</a></p>",
