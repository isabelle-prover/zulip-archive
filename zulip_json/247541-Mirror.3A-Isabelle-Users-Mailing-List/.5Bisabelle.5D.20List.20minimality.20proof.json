That is, if there exists a list l which <br>\nsatisfies a property P, then there exists a shortest list which <br>\nsatisfies that property. This particular proof is very useful to me, and <br>\nI was somewhat surprised that it had not already been proven. I <br>\ntherefore thought that it might be of use generally, and wondered <br>\nwhether there was any possibility of it being included into List.thy? <br>\nThe proof is quite short (less than 100 lines including all sub-lemmas)  <br>\nand I am happy to send it to whoever may be interested.</p>\n<p>As an aside, I think I could extend the minimality property to ordered <br>\ndatatypes reasonably easily and prove that, if there exists an element <br>\nwhich satisfies a given property, there exists a minimal element. I <br>\nwould be happy to have a go at this if people think this is worthwhile, <br>\nand make the proof generally available if I succeed.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Michael F.</p>",
