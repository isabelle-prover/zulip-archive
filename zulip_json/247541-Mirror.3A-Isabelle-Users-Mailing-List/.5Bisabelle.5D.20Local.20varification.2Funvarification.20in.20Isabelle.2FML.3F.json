For example,<br>\nconsider the following problem:</p>\n<p>definition \"test x = (SOME x. True)\"</p>\n<p>context<br>\n  fixes x :: 'a<br>\nbegin</p>\n<p>definition \"test_of_a = test x\"</p>\n<p>ML‹<br>\nval thm = Thm.full_prop_of @{thm test_of_a_def}<br>\nval out = try Logic.unvarify_global thm (<em>NONE</em>)<br>\nval out' = try Logic.varify_global thm (<em>NONE</em>)<br>\n›</p>\n<p>end</p>\n<p>While it is not very difficult to develop this functionality, it seems like<br>\na good candidate for something already available. However, I was not able<br>\nto find anything similar to the functionality that I seek after a<br>\nreasonably thorough search of the Isabelle/ML source code. Of course, if<br>\nanyone familiar with the Isabelle/ML source code is confident that the<br>\nfunctionality that I seek is not available in the standard distribution, I<br>\nwould highly appreciate a confirmation.</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nMikhail Chekhov</p>",
