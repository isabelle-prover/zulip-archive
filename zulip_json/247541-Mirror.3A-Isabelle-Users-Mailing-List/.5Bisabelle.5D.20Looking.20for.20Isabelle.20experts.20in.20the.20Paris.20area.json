If you happen to be <br>\nworking in the Paris area, or even just visiting, and think you could <br>\ngive an interesting talk to current beginners in Isabelle, please don't <br>\nhesitate to reach out! The date and any specific arrangements are fully <br>\nflexible.</p>\n<p>We are looking forward to hear back from you.</p>\n<p>With kind regards,<br>\nMarco</p>",
