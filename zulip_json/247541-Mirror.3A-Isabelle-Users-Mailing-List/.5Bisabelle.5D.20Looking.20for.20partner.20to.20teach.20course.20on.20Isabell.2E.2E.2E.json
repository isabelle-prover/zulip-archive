The course will be set in the framework of summer camps called \"Deutsche Sch√ºlerAkademie\" that have become quite an established institution in Germany over the last decades. I am myself participated as a student.</p>\n<p>I am open with regard to further development of the course. Unfortunately, one has to apply asap for a course in 2021 or wait for next year.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the good aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>students are highly motivated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>travel expenses are covered (you get some honorarium as well, iirc, but it's not in relation to the time you invest).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So now let's come to the bad part/requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You should be female (they prefer mixed teams, and I am male)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You must have a good command of German</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>be ready to invest quite some time. This includes a preliminary meeting in spring (that will be online in 2021 due to Corona).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the summer camp is exhausting due to the high motivation of the students (the course is 6 hours/day but you are in contact with the students for the whole day)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you feel ready for this challenge, please contact me asap.</p>\n<p>Yours,</p>\n<p>Daniel Luckhardt</p>",
