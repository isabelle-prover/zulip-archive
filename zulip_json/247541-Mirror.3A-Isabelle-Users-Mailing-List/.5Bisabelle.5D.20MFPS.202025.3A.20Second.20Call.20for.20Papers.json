It will take place at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland.</p>\n<p>MFPS conferences are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and computer science that are related to models of computation in general, and to semantics of programming languages in particular. This is a forum where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and exchange ideas. The participation of researchers in neighbouring areas is strongly encouraged.</p>\n<p>Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: bio-computation; concurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed systems; process calculi; probabilistic systems; constructive mathematics; domain theory and categorical models; formal languages; formal methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; programming language theory; quantum computation; security; topological models; logic; type systems; type theory; denotational and operational semantics; rewrite theory; proof theory. We also welcome contributions that address applications of semantics to novel areas.</p>\n<p>Participation in the meeting is expected to be in person; one author of every accepted paper has to attend  the meeting and give the presentation. Exceptions might be in case there are unexpected problems with travel/visa.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Gordon Plotkin (keynote; joint with CALCO)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Chris Heunen</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delia Kesner</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jurriaan Rot</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>SPECIAL SESSIONS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Quantitative Semantics, organized by Ugo Dal Lago (joint session with CALCO)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mathematics of Natural Language, organized by Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Types and the Extraction of Correct Programs, organized by Ulrich Berger</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE:</p>\n<p>Sandra Alves, University of Porto, Portugal<br>\nGiorgio Bacci, Aalborg University, Denmark<br>\nLars Birkedal, University of Arhus, Denmark<br>\nFlorence Clerc, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland<br>\nRobin Cockett, University of Calgary, Canada<br>\nClaudia Faggian, IRIF Paris, France<br>\nGiulio Guerrieri, University of Sussex, UK<br>\nShin-ya Katsumata, NII, Tokyo, Japan<br>\nS.
