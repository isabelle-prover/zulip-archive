We also encourage presentations from related<br>\nlanguages (such as Haskell, Scala, Rust, Nemerle, Links, Koka, F*,<br>\nEff, ATS, etc), to exchange experience of further developing ML ideas.</p>\n<p>The workshop does not have proceedings, making it the perfect venue to<br>\nrun some ideas with the community or present some work in progress<br>\nwithin a friendly environment. The PC has a broad expertise and<br>\nsubmissions are 3 pages long: when in doubt, just submit!</p>\n<p>Currently, the workshop is scheduled to be an in-person event. We will<br>\ngive to the authors of accepted abstracts the opportunity to give<br>\ntheir talks remotely if necessary, in case they could not travel.</p>\n<p>See the detailed CFP online on the ICFP website:<br>\n<a href=\"https://icfp22.sigplan.org/home/mlfamilyworkshop-2022#Call-for-Presentations\">https://icfp22.sigplan.org/home/mlfamilyworkshop-2022#Call-for-Presentations</a></p>\n<p>Important dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Friday 3th June (any time zone): Abstract submission deadline<br>\n     Tuesday 28th June: Author notification<br>\n     Thursday 15th August: ML Family Workshop</p>\n<p>Program committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Kenichi Asai (Ochanomizu University)<br>\n     Arthur Azevedo de Amorim (Boston University)<br>\n     Dariusz Biernacki (University of Wrocław)<br>\n     Stephen Dolan (Jane Street)<br>\n     Kavon Farvardin (Apple)<br>\n     Armaël Guéneau (Inria)<br>\n     Sam Lindley (University of Edinburgh)<br>\n     Guido Martínez (CIFASIS-CONICET)<br>\n     Keiko Nakata (SAP Innovation Center Potsdam)<br>\n     Lionel Parreaux (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)<br>\n     Matija Pretnar (University of Ljubljana)<br>\n     Mike Rainey (Carnegie Mellon University)<br>\n     Yann Régis-Gianas (Nomadic Labs)<br>\n     KC Sivaramakrishnan (IIT Madras and Tarides)<br>\n     Ningning Xie (University of Cambridge)</p>\n<p>Chair: Benoît Montagu (Inria)</p>\n<p>Submission details</p>\n<hr>\n<p>See the online CFP for the details on the expected submission format.</p>\n<p>Submissions must be uploaded to the workshop submission website<br>\n<a href=\"https://ml2022.hotcrp.com/\">https://ml2022.hotcrp.com/</a> before the submission deadline.</p>",
