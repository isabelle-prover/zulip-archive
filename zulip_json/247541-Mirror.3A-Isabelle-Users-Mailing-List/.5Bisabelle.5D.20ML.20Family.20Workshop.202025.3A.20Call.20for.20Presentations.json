The development of these languages has inspired a large amount<br>\nof computer science research, both practical and theoretical.</p>\n<p>The ML 2025 workshop will continue the informal approach followed<br>\nsince 2010. Presentations are selected by the program committee from<br>\nsubmitted proposals. There are no published proceedings, so<br>\ncontributions may be submitted for publication elsewhere. The main<br>\ncriterion is promoting and informing the development of the entire<br>\nextended ML family and delivering a lively workshop atmosphere. We<br>\nparticularly encourage talks about works in progress, presentations of<br>\nnegative results (things that were expected to but did not quite work<br>\nout) and informed positions.</p>\n<p>Each presentation should take 20-25 minutes. The exact time will be<br>\ndecided based on scheduling constraints.</p>\n<p>We plan the workshop to an be in-person event with remote<br>\nparticipation (streamed live). We hope that speakers are able to<br>\npresent in person. If a speaker is unable to attend, they may<br>\ninstead present remotely.</p>\n<p>The 2025 ML Family Workshop is co-located with ICFP/SPLASH 2025<br>\nand will take place on <strong>October 16, 2025</strong> in Singapore.</p>\n<h2>Scope</h2>\n<p>We seek presentations on topics including (but not limited to):</p>\n<p>* Language design: abstraction, higher forms of polymorphism,<br>\n    concurrency and parallelism, distribution and mobility, staging,<br>\n    extensions for semi-structured data, generic programming,<br>\n    object systems, etc.</p>\n<p>* Implementation: compilers, interpreters, type checkers, partial<br>\n    evaluators, runtime systems, garbage collectors, foreign function<br>\n    interfaces, etc.</p>\n<p>* Type systems: inference, effects, modules, contracts, specifications<br>\n    and assertions, dynamic typing, error reporting, etc.</p>\n<p>* Applications: case studies, experience reports, pearls, etc.</p>\n<p>* Environments: libraries, tools, editors, debuggers, cross-language<br>\n    interoperability, functional data structures, etc.</p>\n<p>* Semantics of ML-family languages: operational and denotational<br>\n    semantics, program equivalence, parametricity, mechanization, etc.</p>\n<p>We specifically encourage reporting what did not meet expectations or<br>\nwhat, despite all efforts, did not work to satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Four kinds of submissions are solicited: Research Presentations,<br>\nExperience Reports, Demos, and Informed Positions.</p>\n<p>* Research Presentations: Research presentations should describe new<br>\n    ideas, experimental results, or significant advances in ML-related<br>\n    projects. We especially encourage presentations that describe work<br>\n    in progress, that outline a future research agenda, or that<br>\n    encourage lively discussion. These presentations should be<br>\n    structured in a way which can be, at least in part, of interest to<br>\n    (advanced) users.</p>\n<p>* Experience Reports: Users are invited to submit Experience Reports<br>\n    about their use of ML and related languages. These presentations do<br>\n    not need to contain original research but they should tell an<br>\n    interesting story to researchers or other advanced users, such as an<br>\n    innovative or unexpected use of advanced features or a description<br>\n    of the challenges they are facing or attempting to solve.</p>\n<p>* Demos: Live demonstrations or short tutorials should show new<br>\n    developments, interesting prototypes, or work in progress, in the<br>\n    form of tools, libraries, or applications built on or related to ML<br>\n    and related languages. (You will need to provide all the hardware<br>\n    and software required for your demo; the workshop organizers are<br>\n    only able to provide a projector.)</p>\n<p>* Informed Positions: A justified argument for or against a language<br>\n    feature. The argument must be substantiated, either theoretically<br>\n    (e.g., by a demonstration of (un)soundness, an inference algorithm,<br>\n    a complexity analysis), empirically or by substantial experience.<br>\n    Personal experience is accepted as justification so long as it is<br>\n    extensive and illustrated with concrete examples.</p>\n<h2>Submission details</h2>\n<p>Submissions must be in the PDF format and have a short summary<br>\n(abstract) at the beginning. Submissions in the categories of<br>\nExperience Reports, Demos, or Informed Positions should indicate so in<br>\nthe title or subtitle. The point of the submission should be clear<br>\nfrom its two first pages (PC members are not obligated to read any<br>\nfurther.)</p>\n<p>Submissions must be uploaded to the workshop submission website before<br>\nthe submission deadline.</p>\n<p>Only the short summary/abstract of accepted submissions will be<br>\npublished on the conference website. After acceptance, authors will<br>\nhave the opportunity to attach or link to that summary any relevant<br>\nmaterial (such as the updated submission, slides, etc.)</p>\n<p><strong>Submission Website</strong>:<br>\n<a href=\"https://ml2025.hotcrp.com/\">https://ml2025.hotcrp.com/</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://ml2025.hotcrp.com/\">https://ml2025.hotcrp.com/</a>&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>Workshop Website</strong>:<br>\n<a href=\"https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/mlsymposium-2025\">https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/mlsymposium-2025</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/mlsymposium-2025\">https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/mlsymposium-2025</a>&gt;</p>\n<h2>Dates and Deadlines</h2>\n<p><strong>Submission Deadline</strong>:<br>\nThursday, June 19 AoE</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Author Notification</strong> (most cases):<br>\nThursday, July 31</p>\n<p><strong>Final Author Notification</strong> (if needed):<br>\nThursday, Aug 7</p>\n<p><strong>Workshop Date</strong>:<br>\nThursday, Oct 16</p>\n<h2>Program Committee</h2>\n<p>* Sam Westrick (New York University, USA) (Chair)<br>\n  * Michael D.

In contrast, the ML family workshop is not focused<br>\non any language in particular, is more research-oriented, and deals<br>\nwith general issues of ML-style programming and type systems. There<br>\nis some overlap, which we are keen to explore in various ways. The<br>\nauthors who feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged<br>\nto mention it at submission time or contact the program chairs.</p>",
