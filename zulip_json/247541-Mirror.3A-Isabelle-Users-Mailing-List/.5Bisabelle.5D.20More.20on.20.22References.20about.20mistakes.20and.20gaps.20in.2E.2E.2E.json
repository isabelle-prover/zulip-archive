To plug this gap, we are currently working on verifying an <br>\nimplementation of Ondřej's cyclicity checker and connecting that to our <br>\nconsistency proof.</p>\n<p>I must confess I was not aware of the deviations between the paper and <br>\nthe implementation in Isabelle, thanks for the pointer to that!</p>\n<p>Cheers / Johannes</p>",
