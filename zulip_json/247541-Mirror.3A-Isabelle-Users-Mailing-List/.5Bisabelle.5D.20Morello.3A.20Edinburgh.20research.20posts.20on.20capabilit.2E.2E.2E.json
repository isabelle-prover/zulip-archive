This is a <br>\nresearch collaboration between Arm and the Universities of Cambridge and <br>\nEdinburgh to develop the Morello platform, applying a novel capability-based <br>\narchitecture to a mainstream high-performance processor and software stack.</p>\n<p>Further information below: for full details and how to apply please follow the <br>\nlink above.</p>\n<p>If you would like to discuss informally then please contact <br>\n<a href=\"mailto:Ian.Stark@ed.ac.uk\">Ian.Stark@ed.ac.uk</a>, the project lead for Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>The University of Edinburgh only take formal references after appointment: if <br>\nyou have individual letters of support then please submit these as part of <br>\nyour initial application.</p>\n<p>Follow these links for more about the wider project.</p>\n<p>Morello Platform: <a href=\"https://www.morello-project.org\">https://www.morello-project.org</a></p>\n<p>CHERI Architecture:  <a href=\"http://www.cheri-cpu.org\">http://www.cheri-cpu.org</a></p>\n<p>Sail Language: <a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/\">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/</a></p>\n<p>Detailed developer information from Arm<br>\n<a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/a-profile/morello\">https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/a-profile/morello</a></p>\n<p>Video presentation of CHERI security architecture and Morello platform<br>\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/486754830\">https://vimeo.com/486754830</a></p>\n<p>The only essential requirement for these positions is that a PhD or equivalent<br>\nresearch experience in computer science, informatics, mathematics, or a<br>\nrelated discipline.  This includes being close to PhD completion and <br>\nsubmission.</p>\n<p>We are particularly interested to hear from candidates with any of the<br>\nfollowing.  There is no requirement to demonstrate all of these together: this<br>\nproject crosses domains and the precise tasks followed will depend on each<br>\nresearcher's individual skills, experience, and interests.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Experience with machine-assisted reasoning tools and automated provers: such<br>\n   as Coq, Isabelle, HOL4; or SAT/SMT solvers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experience with functional programming in OCaml</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Knowledge of instruction-set architectures; specifically Arm A64, but RISC-V<br>\n   also relevant</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Knowledge of programming-language semantics and type systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Knowledge of program logics, program analysis, and specification</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
