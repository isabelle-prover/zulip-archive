Please see<br>\nbelow for further information on individual openings; interested candidates<br>\nshould contact us directly.</p>\n<p>Luke Ong, Professor</p>\n<p>We invite motivated and well-qualified candidates to work on Bayesian<br>\nStatistical Probabilistic Programming, as part of a research programme<br>\nfunded by the National Research Foundation, Singapore.</p>\n<p>The appointees will work in the Probabilistic Programming Lab, where<br>\nresearch is carried out on a wide range of topics, especially in the<br>\ninterface of programming languages, machine learning, and Bayesian<br>\nstatistics, but also in allied areas in semantics of computation, formal<br>\nmethods and verification, and in logic and algorithms.</p>\n<p>Bayesian Statistical Probabilistic Programming lies in the interface of<br>\nprogramming languages, machine learning, and Bayesian statistics. These<br>\npositions will suit researchers with expertise in one (or more) of the<br>\nthree areas, and are interested and committed to collaborating with experts<br>\nin the other areas.</p>\n<p>Further details are available at<br>\n<a href=\"https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/luke.ong/Vacancies/phd.html\">https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/luke.ong/Vacancies/phd.html</a></p>\n<p>Yang Liu, Professor</p>\n<p>I have fully-funded PhD positions available for PL/SE/Security on web3<br>\nsecurity (smart contract and runtime monitoring), AV security and<br>\nrobustness, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications: applying LLM for<br>\nFM (specification/property generation, proof automation), LLM for security<br>\n(vulnerability detection via static analysis or fuzzing, vulnerability<br>\nrepair), LLM for SE (multi-agent software development), LLM security<br>\n(prompt injection, jailbreak, defence against LLM attacks).</p>\n<p>website: <a href=\"https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/\">https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/</a></p>\n<p>contact: <a href=\"mailto:yangliu@ntu.edu.sg\">yangliu@ntu.edu.sg</a></p>\n<p>Conrad Watt, Assistant Professor</p>\n<p>I have fully-funded PhD positions available for PL research, broadly<br>\nconstrued, related to the WebAssembly programming language and virtual<br>\nmachine. A successful applicant will have the opportunity to work closely<br>\nwith WebAssembly's industrial standards body and inform the future<br>\ndirection of the language.</p>\n<p>I am also looking to recruit postdocs with experience in mechanised theorem<br>\nproving and programming language semantics, to work on advanced extensions<br>\nand applications of the WasmCert-Isabelle mechanisation of WebAssembly and<br>\nrelated artefacts. A key theme of this work will be driving industrial<br>\nadoption of verified artefacts - for example, see<br>\n<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3591224\">https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3591224</a>. Experience with Isabelle/HOL<br>\nwould be highly desirable. Funding is available for up to 4 years of<br>\nfull-time employment.</p>\n<p>website: <a href=\"http://conrad-watt.github.io\">conrad-watt.github.io</a></p>\n<p>contact: <a href=\"mailto:conrad.watt@ntu.edu.sg\">conrad.watt@ntu.edu.sg</a></p>\n<p>Yong Kiam Tan, (incoming) Assistant Professor</p>\n<p>I am interested in applications of deductive verification and interactive<br>\ntheorem proving in automated reasoning, compilers (CakeML), randomized<br>\nalgorithms, hybrid systems, and cryptography. I am recruiting up to three<br>\nPhD students and three postdocs for these topics under a new Singapore NRF<br>\nfellowship project.</p>\n<p>Please visit <a href=\"https://tanyongkiam.github.io/advert.html\">https://tanyongkiam.github.io/advert.html</a> for contact and<br>\nother details.</p>\n<p>Conrad and Yong Kiam would also like to draw attention to A*STAR's graduate<br>\nscholarships (<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/overview\">https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/overview</a>).<br>\nThese competitive national awards offer enhanced support for exceptional<br>\nPhD applicants, who we would jointly supervise in a project related to the<br>\nintersection of WebAssembly and CakeML. Please contact us for more details.</p>",
