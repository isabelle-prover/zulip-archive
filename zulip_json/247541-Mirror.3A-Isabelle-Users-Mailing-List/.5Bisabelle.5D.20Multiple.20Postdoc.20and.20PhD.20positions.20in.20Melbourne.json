The group focuses on<br>\nautomated reasoning, formal proof, and learning-assisted proof<br>\nguidance.</p>\n<p>For postdoc positions, a solid background in formal proof or automated<br>\nreasoning is highly desirable. Applicants for a PhD position should<br>\nhold an MSc or a BSc with Honours in computer science or mathematics.</p>\n<p>The project aims to advance powerful automated mathematical reasoning<br>\ncombined with formal proof. It focuses on developing effective AI<br>\nguidance for higher-order reasoning systems, improving proof advice<br>\nand automation for dependently typed foundations, and integrating<br>\nstrong guided provers into modern proof assistants optimized for large<br>\nlibraries.</p>\n<p>For further information please contact Cezary Kaliszyk<br>\n(<a href=\"mailto:ckaliszyk@unimelb.edu.au\">ckaliszyk@unimelb.edu.au</a>).</p>\n<p>One postdoc position is currently open for immediate hiring, with<br>\nfurther positions to be filled in the succeeding months - please email<br>\nyour interest as early as possible:<br>\n<a href=\"https://unimelb.wd105.myworkdayjobs.com/UoM_External_Career/job/Parkville/Research-Fellow-in-Computer-Science_JR-005382\">https://unimelb.wd105.myworkdayjobs.com/UoM_External_Career/job/Parkville/Research-Fellow-in-Computer-Science_JR-005382</a></p>",
