I don't understand lifting well enough to know what's the best course of action. What do you think?</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nJasmin</p>",

Unfortunately, after adding \"lifting_forget\" at the end of \"Multiset.thy\", I get errors in the AFP file as before (\"Nested_Multisets_Ordinals/Signed_Multiset.thy\"): Before, the error was on a \"lift_definition\", and after adding \"unbundle multiset.lifting\" to the top of that file, the error is a few lines below on a \"transfer\" call.</p>\n<p>Maybe we could debug this offline?</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nJasmin</p>",
