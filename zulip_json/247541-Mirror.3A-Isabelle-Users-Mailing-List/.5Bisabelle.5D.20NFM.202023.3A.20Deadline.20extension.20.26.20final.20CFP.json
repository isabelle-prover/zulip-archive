The NASA <br>\nFormal Methods Symposium (NFM) is an annual forum to foster <br>\ncollaboration between theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, <br>\nacademia, and industry. NFM's goals are to identify challenges and to <br>\nprovide solutions for achieving assurance for such critical systems.</p>\n<p>New developments and emerging applications like autonomous software for <br>\nuncrewed deep space human habitats, caretaker robotics, Unmanned Aerial <br>\nSystems (UAS), UAS Traffic Management (UTM), and the need for <br>\nsystem-wide fault detection, diagnosis, and prognostics provide new <br>\nchallenges for system specification, development, and verification <br>\napproaches. The focus of these symposiums are on formal techniques and <br>\nother approaches for software assurance, including their theory, current <br>\ncapabilities and limitations, as well as their potential application to <br>\naerospace, robotics, and other NASA-relevant safety-critical systems <br>\nduring all stages of the software life-cycle.</p>\n<p>Topics of Interest:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches that bring together <br>\nformal methods and techniques from other domains such as probabilistic <br>\nreasoning, machine learning, control theory, robotics, and quantum <br>\ncomputing among others.<br>\n     * Formal verification, including theorem proving, model checking, <br>\nand static analysis<br>\n     * Advances in automated theorem proving including SAT and SMT solving<br>\n     * Use of formal methods in software and system testing<br>\n     * Run-time verification<br>\n     * Techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods, such as <br>\nabstraction and symbolic methods, compositional techniques, as well as <br>\nparallel and/or distributed techniques<br>\n     * Code generation from formally verified models<br>\n     * Safety cases and system safety<br>\n     * Formal approaches to fault tolerance<br>\n     * Theoretical advances and empirical evaluations of formal methods <br>\ntechniques for safety-critical systems, including hybrid and embedded <br>\nsystems<br>\n     * Formal methods in systems engineering and model-based development<br>\n     * Correct-by-design controller synthesis<br>\n     * Formal assurance methods to handle adaptive systems</p>\n<p>Important Dates:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Abstract Submission:  6 Jan 2023 (firm)<br>\nPaper Submission:     6 Jan 2023 (firm)<br>\nPaper Notifications:  6 Mar 2023<br>\nCamera-ready Papers: 27 Mar 2023<br>\nSymposium:        16-18 May 2023</p>\n<p>Location &amp; Cost:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The symposium will take place in the STEM Building at University of <br>\nHouston Clear Lake, Houston, Texas, USA, 16-18 May 2023.</p>\n<p>There will be no registration fee for participants. All interested <br>\nindividuals, including non-US citizens, are welcome to attend, to listen <br>\nto the talks, and to participate in discussions; however, all attendees <br>\nmust register.</p>\n<p>Submission Details:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There are two categories of submissions:</p>\n<p>1. Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete <br>\nresults (15 pages + references)<br>\n    2. Two categories of short papers: (6 pages + references)<br>\n    (a) Tool Papers describing novel, publicly-available tools<br>\n    (b) Case Studies detailing complete applications of formal methods <br>\nto real systems with publicly-available artifacts</p>\n<p>All papers should be in English and describe original work that has not <br>\nbeen published or submitted elsewhere. All submissions will be fully <br>\nreviewed by members of the Programme Committee. Papers will appear in <br>\nthe Formal Methods subline of Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer <br>\nScience (LNCS) and must use LNCS style formatting <br>\n(<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>). <br>\nPapers must be submitted in PDF format at the EasyChair submission site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nfm2023\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nfm2023</a></p>\n<p>Keynote Speakers:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Julia Badger, NASA Johnson Space Center<br>\nKen McMillan, UT Austin<br>\nSanjit Seshia, UC Berkeley</p>\n<p>Organizers:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Swarat Chaudhuri (UT Austin)<br>\nJim Dabney (University of Houston Clear Lake/NASA JSC)<br>\nKristin Yvonne Rozier (Iowa State University/NASA JSC)</p>\n<p>Programme Committee:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Julia Badger, NASA Johnson Space Center<br>\nStanley Bak, Stony Brook University<br>\nSuguman Bansal, University of Pennsylvania<br>\nDirk Beyer, LMU Munich<br>\nNikolaj Bjørner, Microsoft Research<br>\nSylvie Boldo, Inria and Université Paris-Saclay<br>\nGeorgiana Caltais, University of Twente<br>\nSwarat Chaudhuri, UT Austin<br>\nDarren Cofer, Rockwell Collins<br>\nJennifer Davis, Collins Aerospace<br>\nEwen Denney, NASA Ames Research Center<br>\nCatherine Dubois, ENSIIE-Samovar<br>\nRohit Dureja, IBM Corporation<br>\nAlexandre Duret-Lutz, LRDE/EPITA<br>\nBruno Dutertre, Amazon<br>\nAaron Dutle, NASA Langley Research Center<br>\nSouradeep Dutta, University of Pennsylvania<br>\nRüdiger Ehlers, Clausthal University of Technology<br>\nChuchu Fan, MIT<br>\nMarie Farrell, The University of Manchester<br>\nBernd Finkbeiner, CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security<br>\nAlwyn Goodloe, NASA Langley Research Center<br>\nArie Gurfinkel, University of Waterloo<br>\nKlaus Havelund, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>\nConstance Heitmeyer, Naval Research Laboratory<br>\nMarijn Heule, Carnegie Mellon University<br>\nKerianne Hobbs, Air Force Research Laboratory<br>\nBardh Hoxha, Toyota Research Institute North America<br>\nSusmit Jha, SRI International<br>\nRajeev Joshi, Amazon Web Services<br>\nPanagiotis Manolios, Northeastern University<br>\nAnastasia Mavridou, SGT Inc. / NASA Ames Research Center<br>\nStefan Mitsch, Carnegie Mellon University<br>\nCesar Munoz, Amazon<br>\nNatasha Neogi, NASA Langley Research Center<br>\nCorina Pasareanu, CMU NASA, KBR<br>\nIvan Perez, KBR / NASA Ames Research Center<br>\nZvonimir Rakamaric, University of Utah<br>\nGiles Reger, Amazon Web Services and The University of Manchester<br>\nKristin Yvonne Rozier, Iowa State University<br>\nJohann Schumann, NASA Ames Research Center<br>\nCristina Seceleanu, Mälardalen University<br>\nYasser Shoukry, University of California Irvine<br>\nLaura Titolo, National Institute of Aerospace<br>\nOksana Tkachuk, Amazon Web Services<br>\nAaron Tomb, Amazon<br>\nStefano Tonetta, FBK<br>\nNestan Tsiskaridze, Stanford University<br>\nCaterina Urban, INRIA<br>\nCristian-Ioan Vasile, Lehigh University<br>\nVirginie Wiels, ONERA / DTIS<br>\nHuan Xu, University of Maryland<br>\nHuafeng Yu, Boeing Research &amp; Technology USA</p>",
