In 2011, a review book titled \"AGM 25 Years: Twenty-Five Years of Research in <br>\nBelief Change\" was edited to summarize the first twenty five years of works based on AGM. <br>\nThis HOL-based AFP entry is a faithful formalization of the AGM operators (e.g. <br>\ncontraction, revision, remainder ...) axiomatized in the original paper. It also contains <br>\nthe proofs of all the theorems stated in the paper that show how these operators combine. <br>\nBoth proofs of Harper and Levi identities are established.</p>\n<p>You find it online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Belief_Revision.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Belief_Revision.html</a></p>\n<p>With this entry, we've reached 400 authors who have contributed to the AFP!</p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
