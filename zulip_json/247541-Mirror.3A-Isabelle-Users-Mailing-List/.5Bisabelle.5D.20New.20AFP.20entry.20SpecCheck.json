You can use it to write <br>\nspecifications for ML functions. SpecCheck then checks whether your specification holds by <br>\ntesting your function against a given number of generated inputs. It helps you to identify <br>\nbugs by printing counterexamples on failure and provides you timing information. SpecCheck <br>\nis customisable and allows you to specify your own input generators, test output formats, <br>\nas well as pretty printers and shrinking functions for counterexamples among other things.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/SpecCheck.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/SpecCheck.html</a></p>\n<p>Great to see that we can now sanity-check our ML functions similarly to what quickcheck <br>\ndoes for our theorems!</p>\n<p>Andreas</p>",
