The characterisation might be used for deriving approximative safety <br>\nproperties to be targeted by static analyses or checked at runtime.  We utilise a simple <br>\nyet versatile control flow graph model as a program representation.  As our model is not <br>\nassumed to be finite it can be instantiated for a broad class of programs.  The targeted <br>\nsecurity property is indistinguishable security where executions produce sequences of <br>\nobservations and only non-terminating executions are allowed to drop a tail of those.</p>\n<p>A very crude approximation of our characterisation is slicing based on program dependence <br>\ngraphs, which we use as a minimal example and derive a corresponding soundness result.</p>\n<p>For further details and applications refer to the authors upcoming dissertation.</p>\n<p>You find it online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IFC_Tracking.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IFC_Tracking.html</a></p>\n<p>Andreas</p>",
