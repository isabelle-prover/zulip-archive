This sample <br>\nmodel is used to verify that the pseudonymous identifiers output by user identification <br>\ntokens remain anonymous under the expected conditions.</p>\n<p>You'll find it at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Logging_Independent_Anonymity.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Logging_Independent_Anonymity.html</a><br>\nThe modelling of the security protocol is exceptionally well-documented!</p>\n<p>Andreas</p>",
