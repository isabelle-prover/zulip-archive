Paulson</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Ordinal_Partitions.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Ordinal_Partitions.html</a></p>\n<p>The theory of partition relations concerns generalisations of Ramsey’s<br>\ntheorem. For any ordinal α, write α → (α, m)² if for each function f<br>\nfrom unordered pairs of elements of α into {0, 1}, either there is a<br>\nsubset X ⊆ α order-isomorphic to α such that f {x, y} = 0 for all {x, y}<br>\n⊆ X, or there is an m element set Y ⊆ α such that f {x, y} = 1 for all<br>\n{x, y} ⊆ Y. (In both cases, with {x, y} we require x ≠ y.)</p>\n<p>In particular, the infinite Ramsey theorem can be written in this<br>\nnotation as ω → (ω, ω)², or if we restrict m to the positive integers as<br>\nabove, then ω → (ω, m)² for all m.</p>\n<p>This entry formalises Larson’s proof of ω^ω → (ω^ω, m)² along with a<br>\nsimilar proof of a result due to Specker: ω² → (ω², m)² . Also proved is<br>\na necessary result by Erdős and Milner: ω^(1+α·n) → (ω^(1+α), 2^n)².<br>\nThese examples demonstrate the use of Isabelle/HOL to formalise advanced<br>\nresults that combine ZF set theory with basic concepts like lists and<br>\nnatural numbers.</p>\n<p>It is certainly nice to see more and more set theory in Isabelle,<br>\nalthough I for one don't understand much of it (yet). And someone is<br>\ncertainly putting the AFP's new LaTeX support to good use!</p>\n<p>Enjoy,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
