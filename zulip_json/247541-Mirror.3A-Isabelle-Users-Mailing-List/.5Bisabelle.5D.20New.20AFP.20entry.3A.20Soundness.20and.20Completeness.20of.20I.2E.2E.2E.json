The completeness proof is constructive following the approach by László Kalmár, Elliott Mendelson and others. The result can be extended to full classical propositional logic by uncommenting a few lines for falsehood.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Implicational_Logic.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Implicational_Logic.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
