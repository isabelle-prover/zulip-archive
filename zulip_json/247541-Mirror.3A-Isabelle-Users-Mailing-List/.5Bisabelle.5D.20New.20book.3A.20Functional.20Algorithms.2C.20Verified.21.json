It covers both functional correctness and <br>\nrunning time analysis. It does so in a unified manner with inductive proofs <br>\nabout functional programs and their running time functions.<br>\nAll proofs have been machine-checked by the proof assistant Isabelle.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nTobias<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/wiAM30Afb70fSJC_PmOsQkrp/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
