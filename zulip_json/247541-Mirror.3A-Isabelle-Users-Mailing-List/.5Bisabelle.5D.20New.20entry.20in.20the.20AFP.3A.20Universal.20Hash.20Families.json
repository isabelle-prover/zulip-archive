They can often be used in place <br>\nof classic (or cryptographic) hash functions and allow the rigorous analysis of the <br>\nperformance of randomized algorithms and data structures that rely on hash functions. In <br>\n1981 Wegman and Carter introduced a generic construction for such families with arbitrary <br>\nk using polynomials over a finite field. This entry contains a formalization of them and <br>\nestablishes the property of k-universality. To be useful the formalization also provides <br>\nan explicit construction of finite fields using the factor ring of integers modulo a <br>\nprime. Additionally, some generic results about independent families are shown that might <br>\nbe of independent interest.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Universal_Hash_Families.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Universal_Hash_Families.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
