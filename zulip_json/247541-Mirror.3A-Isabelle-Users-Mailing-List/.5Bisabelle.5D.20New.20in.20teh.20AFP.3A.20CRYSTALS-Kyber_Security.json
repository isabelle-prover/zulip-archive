The correctness proof <br>\nis expanded to cover both the deterministic part from the previous formalization <br>\nand the probabilistic part of randomly chosen inputs. Indeed, the probabilistic <br>\nversion of the delta-correctness in the original paper was flawed and could only <br>\nbe formalized for a modified delta'. The authors of Kyber also remarked, that <br>\nthe security proof against indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack <br>\n(IND-CPA) does not hold for the original version of Kyber. Thus, the newer <br>\nversion (round 2 and 3 of NIST standarisation process) was formalized as well, <br>\nincluding the adapted deterministic and probabilistic correctness theorems. <br>\nMoreover, the IND-CPA security proof against the new version of Kyber has been <br>\nverified using the CryptHOL library. Since the new version also included a <br>\nchange of parameters, the Kyber algorithms have been instantiated with the new <br>\nparameter set as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CRYSTALS-Kyber_Security.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CRYSTALS-Kyber_Security.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/hTxExDvlDxdjLfyR2B0dbPO7/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
