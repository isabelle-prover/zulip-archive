MLTL is a variant of Linear Temporal Logic, which has already been formalized in Isabelle/HOL. In contrast to LTL, MLTL includes finite discrete time bounds on the temporal operators. We do not directly build on the LTL AFP entry, but aim to mirror its style; in particular, we found it useful when defining our syntactic sugar binding precedences. Another closely related AFP entry is the formalization of MFOTL.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Mission_Time_LTL.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Mission_Time_LTL.html</a></p>\n<p>Mission-time Linear Temporal Logic to Regular Expressions</p>\n<p>by Zili Wang and Katherine Kosaian</p>\n<p>We formalize the WEST algorithm for translating from Mission-time Linear Temporal Logic Formulas to regular expressions and prove it correct, building upon the previous Mission_time_LTL entry in Isabelle/HOL. Additionally, we formalize an algorithm for checking the equivalence of a restricted subset of regular expressions. Both of these algorithms are executable, and the code export is used to validate the existing (previously unverified) WEST tool.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Mission_Time_LTL_to_Regular_Expression.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Mission_Time_LTL_to_Regular_Expression.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
