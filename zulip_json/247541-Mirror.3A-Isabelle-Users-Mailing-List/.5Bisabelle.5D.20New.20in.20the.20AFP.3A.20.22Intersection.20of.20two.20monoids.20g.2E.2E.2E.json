Our proof uses the terminology of<br>\nmorphisms which allows us to formulate the result in a shorter and more<br>\ntransparent way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Two_Generated_Word_Monoids_Intersection.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Two_Generated_Word_Monoids_Intersection.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Binary codes that do not preserve primitivity <br>\n  by Štěpán Holub and Martin Raška</p>\n<p>A code X is not primitivity preserving if there is a primitive list ws in lists<br>\nX whose concatenation is imprimitive. We formalize a full characterization of<br>\nsuch codes in the binary case in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. Part of the<br>\nformalization, interesting on its own, is a description of {x,y}-interpretations<br>\nof the square xx if length y &lt;= length x. We also provide a formalized<br>\nparametric solution of the related equation x^jy^k = z^l.</p>\n<p>The core of the theory is an investigation of imprimitive words which are<br>\nconcatenations of copies of two noncommuting words (such a pair of words is<br>\ncalled a binary code). We follow the article [Barbin-Le Rest, Le Rest, '85]<br>\n(mainly Théorème 2.1 and Lemme 3.1), while substantially optimizing the proof.<br>\nSee also [Spehner, '76] for an earlier result on this question, and [Maňuch, '01]<br>\nfor another proof.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Binary_Code_Imprimitive.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Binary_Code_Imprimitive.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
