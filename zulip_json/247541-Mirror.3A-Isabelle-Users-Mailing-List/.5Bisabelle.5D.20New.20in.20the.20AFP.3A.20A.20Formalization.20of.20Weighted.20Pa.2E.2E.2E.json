Our definition of WPO extends the original <br>\ndefinition by also permitting multiset comparisons of arguments instead of just <br>\nlexicographic extensions. Therefore, our WPO not only subsumes lexicographic <br>\npath orders (LPO), but also recursive path orders (RPO). We formally prove these <br>\nsubsumptions and therefore all of the mentioned properties of WPO are <br>\nautomatically transferable to LPO and RPO as well. Such a transformation is not <br>\nrequired for Knuth–Bendix orders (KBO), since they have already been formalized. <br>\nNevertheless, we still provide a proof that WPO subsumes KBO and thereby <br>\nunderline the generality of WPO.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Weighted_Path_Order.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Weighted_Path_Order.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/5wyY8yHHpl-cNA-ylmErwKxG/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
