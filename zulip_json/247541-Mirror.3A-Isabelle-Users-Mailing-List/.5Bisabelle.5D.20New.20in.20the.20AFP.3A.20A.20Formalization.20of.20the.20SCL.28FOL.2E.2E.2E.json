The main <br>\nresults are formal proofs of soundness, non-redundancy of learned clauses, <br>\ntermination, and refutational completeness. Compared to the unformalized <br>\nversion, the formalized calculus is simpler, a number of results were <br>\ngeneralized, and the non-redundancy statement was strengthened. We found and <br>\ncorrected one bug in a previously published version of the SCL Backtrack rule. <br>\nCompared to related formalizations, we introduce a new technique for showing <br>\ntermination based on non-redundant clause learning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Simple_Clause_Learning.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Simple_Clause_Learning.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/kuKembHBA90EAa23q1Hmb52D/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
