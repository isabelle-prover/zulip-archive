It was originally independently discovered by Cauchy and Davenport and has been formalized in the AFP entry Kneser's Theorem and the Cauchy–Davenport Theorem as a corollary of Kneser's theorem. More recently, many generalizations of this theorem have been found. In this entry, we formalise a generalization due to DeVos, which proves the theorem in a non-abelian setting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Generalized_Cauchy_Davenport.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Generalized_Cauchy_Davenport.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
