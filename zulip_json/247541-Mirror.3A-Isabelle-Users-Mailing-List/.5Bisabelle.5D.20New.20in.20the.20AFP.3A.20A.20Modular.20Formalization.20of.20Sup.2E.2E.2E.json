This is the second formalization of this result in the AFP (after Peltier’s <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/SuperCalc.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/SuperCalc.html</a>). The authors’ ITP’24 paper (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPICS.ITP.2024.12\">https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPICS.ITP.2024.12</a>) details the differences.</p>\n<p>A Modular Formalization of Superposition<br>\nby Martin Desharnais and Balazs Toth</p>\n<p>Superposition is an efficient proof calculus for reasoning about first-order logic with equality that is implemented in many automatic theorem provers. It works by saturating the given set of clauses and is refutationally complete, meaning that if the set is inconsistent, the saturation will contain a contradiction. In this formalization, we restructured the completeness proof to cleanly separate the ground (i.e., variable-free) and nonground aspects. We relied on the IsaFoR library for first-order terms and on the Isabelle saturation framework. A paper describing this formalization was published at the 15th International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP 2024).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Superposition_Calculus.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Superposition_Calculus.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Dmitriy</p>",
