The<br>\nframework preserves the completeness of the original calculus. We focus here on<br>\nthe simplest splitting model described in details in the first three sections of<br>\n\"Unifying Splitting\" by Gabriel Ebner, Jasmin Blanchette and Sophie Tourret and<br>\nprovide an extension of the ordered resolution calculus with a variant of<br>\nsplitting called Lightweight AVATAR. A paper describing the present<br>\nformalization has been accepted at ITP'25.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Splitting_Framework.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Splitting_Framework.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
