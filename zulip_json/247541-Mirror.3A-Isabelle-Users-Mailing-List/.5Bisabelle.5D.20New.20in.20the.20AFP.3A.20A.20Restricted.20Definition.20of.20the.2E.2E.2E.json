In this entry, we formalize a novel, restricted definition of the magic wand, described in a paper at CAV 22, which we call the combinable wand. We prove some key properties of the combinable wand; in particular, a combinable wand is combinable if its right-hand side is combinable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You will find it online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Combinable_Wands.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Combinable_Wands.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
