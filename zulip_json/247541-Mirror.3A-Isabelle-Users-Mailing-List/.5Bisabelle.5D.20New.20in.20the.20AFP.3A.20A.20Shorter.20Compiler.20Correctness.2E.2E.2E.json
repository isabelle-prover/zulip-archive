As such, it <br>\npromises to constitute a further enhanced reference for the formal verification <br>\nof compilers meant for larger, real-world programming languages. The presented <br>\nproof does not depend on language determinism, so that the proposed approach can <br>\nbe applied to non-deterministic languages as well. As a confirmation, this paper <br>\nextends IMP with an additional non-deterministic choice command, and proves <br>\ncompiler correctness, viz. the simulation of compiled code execution by source <br>\ncode, for such extended language.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IMP_Compiler.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IMP_Compiler.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/8Lqd4admpxcWsqBkUzM5Qy-E/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
