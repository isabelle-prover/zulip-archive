Both the ISQ and the SI are deeply<br>\nintegrated into Isabelle's type system. Quantities are parameterised by<br>\ndimension types, which correspond to base vectors, and thus only quantities of<br>\nthe same dimension can be equated. Since the underlying \"algebra of quantities\"<br>\ninduces congruences on quantity and SI types, specific tactic support is<br>\ndeveloped to capture these. Our construction is validated by a test-set of known<br>\nequivalences between both quantities and SI units. Moreover, the presented<br>\ntheory can be used for type-safe conversions between the SI system and others,<br>\nlike the British Imperial System (BIS).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Physical_Quantities.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Physical_Quantities.html</a></p>",
