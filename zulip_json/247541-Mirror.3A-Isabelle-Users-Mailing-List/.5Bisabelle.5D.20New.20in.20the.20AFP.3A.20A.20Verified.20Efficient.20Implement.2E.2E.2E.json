In a previous AFP entry, the WPO was defined and properties of WPO <br>\nhave been formally verified. However, the implementation of WPO was naive, <br>\nleading to an exponential runtime in the worst case.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in this AFP entry we provide a poly-time implementation of WPO. The <br>\nimplementation is based on memoization. Since WPO generalizes the recursive path <br>\norder (RPO), we also easily derive an efficient implementation of RPO.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Efficient_Weighted_Path_Order.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Efficient_Weighted_Path_Order.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy this latest contribution to the ever growing formalization of term <br>\nrewriting theory!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/NbsZGBwqxsM2l-yeOOOh2pKp/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
