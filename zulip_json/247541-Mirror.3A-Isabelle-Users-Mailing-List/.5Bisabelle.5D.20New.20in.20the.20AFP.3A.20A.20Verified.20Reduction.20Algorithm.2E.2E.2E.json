It is an extension of multi-level syllogistic with singleton (MLSS), which involves the predicates membership, set equality, set inclusion, and the operators union, intersection, set difference, and singleton. In this work we formalize the reduction algorithm from MLSSmf to MLSS and verify the correctness proof originally presented by Cantone et al. Combined with the verified decision procedure for MLSS formalized by Stevens, this yields an executable and verified decision procedure for MLSSmf.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MLSSmf_to_MLSS.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MLSSmf_to_MLSS.html</a></p>",
