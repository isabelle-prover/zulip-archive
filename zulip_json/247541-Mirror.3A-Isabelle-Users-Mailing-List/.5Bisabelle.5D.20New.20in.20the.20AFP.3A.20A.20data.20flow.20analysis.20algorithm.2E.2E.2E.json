It gives a specification of computing dominators <br>\non a control flow graph where each node refers to its reverse post order number. <br>\nA semilattice of reversed-ordered list which represents dominators is built and <br>\na Kildall-style algorithm on the semilattice is defined for computing <br>\ndominators. Finally the soundness and completeness of the algorithm are proved <br>\nw.r.t. the specification.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Dominance_CHK.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Dominance_CHK.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ZaFhRVS38Xs8QN8aZpDencvR/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
