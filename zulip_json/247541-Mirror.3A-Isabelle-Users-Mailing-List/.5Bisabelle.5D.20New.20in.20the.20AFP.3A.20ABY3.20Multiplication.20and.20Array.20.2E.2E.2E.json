In particular, we consider the <br>\nmultiplication protocol and the array shuffling protocol, both based on ABY3's additive <br>\nsecret sharing scheme. We proved their security in the semi-honest setting under the <br>\nideal/real simulation paradigm. These two proof-of-concept opens the door to further <br>\nverification of more protocols within the framework.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/ABY3_Protocols.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/ABY3_Protocols.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
