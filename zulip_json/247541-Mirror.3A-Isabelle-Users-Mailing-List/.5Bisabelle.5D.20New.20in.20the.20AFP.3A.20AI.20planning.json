It also contains formally verified checkers for checking the well-formedness of problems specified in either language as well the correctness of potential solutions. The formalisation in this entry was described in an earlier publication.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/AI_Planning_Languages_Semantics.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/AI_Planning_Languages_Semantics.html</a></p>\n<p>And also</p>\n<p>Verified SAT-Based AI Planning <br>\nMohammad Abdulaziz and Friedrich Kurz</p>\n<p>We present an executable formally verified SAT encoding of classical AI planning that is based on the encodings by Kautz and Selman and the one by Rintanen et al. The encoding was experimentally tested and shown to be usable for reasonably sized standard AI planning benchmarks. We also use it as a reference to test a state-of-the-art SAT-based planner, showing that it sometimes falsely claims that problems have no solutions of certain lengths. The formalisation in this submission was described in an independent publication.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Verified_SAT_Based_AI_Planning.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Verified_SAT_Based_AI_Planning.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
