The theorem also holds for complex numbers, but this entry <br>\nhas not covered it yet. An application example of this theorem is also <br>\npresented in this entry to extend the generalised binomial theorem for a <br>\nspecific example from (-1,1) to its boundary cases -1 and 1.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
