Here is an extract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AOT is a foundational metaphysical theory, developed by Edward Zalta, that explains the objects presupposed by the sciences as abstract objects that reify property patterns. In particular, AOT aspires to provide a philosphically grounded basis for the construction and analysis of the objects of mathematics. We can support this claim by verifying Uri Nodelman's and Edward Zalta's reconstruction of Frege's theorem: we can confirm that the Dedekind-Peano postulates for natural numbers are consistently derivable in AOT using Frege's method. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact it was submitted in late November and I apologise for the delay in handling it.</p>\n<p>You will find Abstract Object Theory on-line at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/AOT.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/AOT.html</a></p>\n<p>An earlier realisation of similar ideas is also in the AFP, here: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/PLM.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/PLM.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
