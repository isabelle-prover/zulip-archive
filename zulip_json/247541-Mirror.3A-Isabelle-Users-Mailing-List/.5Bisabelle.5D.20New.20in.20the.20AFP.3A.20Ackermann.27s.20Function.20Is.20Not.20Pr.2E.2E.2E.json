Paulson</p>\n<p>Ackermann's function is defined in the usual way and a number of its elementary <br>\nproperties are proved. Then, the primitive recursive functions are defined <br>\ninductively: as a predicate on the functions that map lists of numbers to <br>\nnumbers. It is shown that every primitive recursive function is strictly <br>\ndominated by Ackermann's function. The formalisation follows an earlier one by <br>\nNora Szasz.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Ackermanns_not_PR.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Ackermanns_not_PR.html</a></p>\n<p>This formalization was moved to the AFP from the distribution (HOL/Examples/)</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/5ZKczE7FemxrEtFxTRiPd07z/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
