This entry formalizes ApproxMC, an algorithm due to Chakraborty et al. with a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee, i.e., ApproxMC returns a multiplicative (1+ε)-factor approximation of the model count with probability at least 1-δ, where ε &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; δ ≤ 1. The algorithmic specification is further refined to a verified certificate checker that can be used to validate the results of untrusted ApproxMC implementations (assuming access to trusted randomness).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Approximate_Model_Counting.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Approximate_Model_Counting.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
