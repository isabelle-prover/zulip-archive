In this setting, we establish a three-way correspondence between the financial feasibility of trading strategies, the validity of universal probability inequalities, and the solutions to bounded Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problems. The central result demonstrates that proving a trading strategy constitutes an arbitrage opportunity (i.e., guaranteeing a risk-free profit regardless of the outcome) is equivalent to proving a specific inequality identity holds for all probability functions, and is computationally equivalent to establishing a lower bound on a corresponding MaxSAT instance. Dually, we show that checking the coherence of a strategy (i.e., ensuring it does not guarantee a loss) also corresponds to verifying a probability identity and bounding a MaxSAT problem from above.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Arbitrage_Probability_Correspondence.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Arbitrage_Probability_Correspondence.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
