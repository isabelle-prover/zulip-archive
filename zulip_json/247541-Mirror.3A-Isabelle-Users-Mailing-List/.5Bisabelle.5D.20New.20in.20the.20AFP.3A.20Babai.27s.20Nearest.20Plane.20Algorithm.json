If the<br>\nbasis for L is LLL-reduced, Babai's Closest Hyperplane algorithm solves<br>\ngamma-CVP for gamma = 2^(n/2), where n is the dimension of the lattice L, in<br>\ntime polynomial in n. This session formalizes said algorithm, using the AFP<br>\nformalization of LLL and adapting a proof of correctness from the lecture notes<br>\nof Stephens-Davidowitz.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Babai_Nearest_Plane.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Babai_Nearest_Plane.html</a></p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nRené</p>",
