The isomorphism preserves order, meets and joins as <br>\nwell as complementation in the case the lattice is a Boolean algebra. A <br>\nconsequence of this representation theorem is that every finite Boolean algebra <br>\nis isomorphic to a powerset algebra.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Birkhoff_Finite_Distributive_Lattices.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Birkhoff_Finite_Distributive_Lattices.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/RudVLZo_ArxAUhAiymH93f4l/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
