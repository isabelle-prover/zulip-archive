(A phenomenon first noted by Kurt Gödel in 1936.) Boolos's example concerned an inference I with five premises, and a conclusion, such that the shortest derivation of the conclusion from the premises in a standard system for first-order logic is astronomically huge; while there exists a second-order derivation whose length is of the order of a page or two. Boolos gave a short sketch of that second-order derivation, which relies on the comprehension principle of second-order logic. Here, Boolos's inference is formalized into fourteen lemmas, each quickly verified by the automated-theorem-proving assistant Isabelle/HOL.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Boolos_Curious_Inference.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Boolos_Curious_Inference.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
