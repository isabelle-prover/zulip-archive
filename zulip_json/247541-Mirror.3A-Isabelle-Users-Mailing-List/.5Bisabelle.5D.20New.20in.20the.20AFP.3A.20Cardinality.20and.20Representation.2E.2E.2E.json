We generalise the cardinality axioms to <br>\nStone relation algebras, which model weighted graphs, and study the <br>\nrelationships between various axioms for cardinality. We also give a <br>\nrepresentation theorem for Stone relation algebras.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Relational_Cardinality.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Relational_Cardinality.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/Pea-gibbBTiLI9AJEVMDOJS2/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
