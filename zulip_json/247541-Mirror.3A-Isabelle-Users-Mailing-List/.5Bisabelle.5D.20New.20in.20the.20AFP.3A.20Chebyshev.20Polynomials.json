To be more precise, there are polynomials T_n and U_n ... the Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind, respectively. This entry contains a definition of these two familes of polynomials in Isabelle/HOL along with some of their most important properties. In particular, it is shown that T_n and U_n are orthogonal families of polynomials.
