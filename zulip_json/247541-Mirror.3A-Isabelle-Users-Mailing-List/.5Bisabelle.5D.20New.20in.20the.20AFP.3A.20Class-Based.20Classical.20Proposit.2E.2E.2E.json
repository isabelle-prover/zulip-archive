Our class <br>\nrepresents a Hilbert-style proof system with the axioms ... along with the rule <br>\nmodus ponens. In this axiom class we provide lemmas to obtain Maximally <br>\nConsistent Sets via Zorn's lemma. We define the concrete classical propositional <br>\ncalculus inductively and show it instantiates our axiom class. We formulate the <br>\nusual semantics for the propositional calculus and show strong soundness and <br>\ncompleteness. We provide conventional definitions of the other logical <br>\nconnectives and prove various common identities. Finally, we show that the <br>\npropositional calculus embeds into any logic in our axiom class.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Propositional_Logic_Class.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Propositional_Logic_Class.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/cLH3jg6dP-Y14Ursvabxp0S4/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
