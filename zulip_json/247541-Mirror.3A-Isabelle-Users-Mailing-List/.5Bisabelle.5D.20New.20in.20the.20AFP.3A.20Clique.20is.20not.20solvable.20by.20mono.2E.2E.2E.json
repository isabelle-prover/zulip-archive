For this NP-complete problem there <br>\nexists a non-trivial lower bound: no monotone circuit of a size that is polynomial in<br>\nn can solve Clique.</p>\n<p>This entry provides an Isabelle/HOL formalization of a concrete lower bound (the bound is <br>\n$\\sqrt[7]{n}^{\\sqrt[8]{n}}$ for the fixed choice of $s = \\sqrt[4]{n}$), following a proof <br>\nby Gordeev.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Clique_and_Monotone_Circuits.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Clique_and_Monotone_Circuits.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
