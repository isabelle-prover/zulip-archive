It is closely related to hypergraph theory. This<br>\nformalisation presents a general library for formal reasoning on incidence set<br>\nsystems, designs and their applications, including formal definitions and proofs<br>\nfor many key properties, operations, and theorems on the construction and<br>\nexistence of designs. Notably, this includes formalising t-designs, balanced<br>\nincomplete block designs (BIBD), group divisible designs (GDD), pairwise<br>\nbalanced designs (PBD), design isomorphisms, and the relationship between graphs<br>\nand designs. A locale-centric approach has been used to manage the relationships<br>\nbetween the many different types of designs. Theorems of particular interest<br>\ninclude the necessary conditions for existence of a BIBD, Wilson's construction<br>\non GDDs, and Bose's inequality on resolvable designs. Parts of this<br>\nformalisation are explored in the paper \"A Modular First Formalisation of<br>\nCombinatorial Design Theory\", presented at CICM 2021.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Design_Theory.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Design_Theory.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
