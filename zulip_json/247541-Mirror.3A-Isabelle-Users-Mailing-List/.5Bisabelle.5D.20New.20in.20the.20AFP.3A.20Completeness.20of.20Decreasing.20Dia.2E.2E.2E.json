As a consequence, the decreasing diagrams method is <br>\ncomplete for proving confluence of relations of the least uncountable cardinality.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Completeness_Decreasing_Diagrams_for_N1.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Completeness_Decreasing_Diagrams_for_N1.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/HKRhPLxPLQtu_PA0WVdBBSFl/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
