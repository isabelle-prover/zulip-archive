Our<br>\nformalization contains material on complex vector spaces (normed spaces,<br>\nBanach spaces, Hilbert spaces) that complements and goes beyond the<br>\ndevelopments of real vectors spaces in the Isabelle/HOL standard library. We<br>\ndefine the type of bounded operators between complex vector spaces (cblinfun)<br>\nand develop the theory of unitaries, projectors, extension of bounded linear<br>\nfunctions (BLT theorem), adjoints, Loewner order, closed subspaces and more.<br>\nFor the finite-dimensional case, we provide code generation support by<br>\nidentifying finite-dimensional operators with matrices as formalized in the<br>\nJordan_Normal_Form AFP entry.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Complex_Bounded_Operators.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Complex_Bounded_Operators.html</a></p>",
