We define a ring-class quotient<br>\ntype consisting of equivalence classes of prime-indexed sequences of formal<br>\nLaurent series, in which every p-adic field is contained as a subring. Via a<br>\nfurther quotient of the ring of p-adic integers (that is, the elements of depth<br>\nat least 0) by the prime ideal (that is, the subring of elements of depth at<br>\nleast 1), we define a ring-class type in which every prime-order finite field is<br>\ncontained as a subring. Finally, some topological properties are developed using<br>\ndepth as a proxy for a metric, Hensel's Lemma is proved, and the compactness of<br>\nlocal rings of integers is established.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Computational_pAdics.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Computational_pAdics.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
