The most <br>\nimportant concentration inequalities (the Markov, Chebyshev, and Hoelder <br>\ninequalities and the Chernoff bounds) are already part of <br>\nHOL-Probability. This entry collects more advanced results, such as <br>\nBennett's/Bernstein's Inequality, Bienayme's Identity, Cantelli's <br>\nInequality, the Efron-Stein Inequality, McDiarmid's Inequality, and the <br>\nPaley-Zygmund Inequality.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Concentration_Inequalities.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Concentration_Inequalities.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
