Our focus is on Åqvist’s system E for conditional obligation and its extensions. We present both a correspondence-theory-focused metalogical study and a use-case application to Parfit’s repugnant conclusion, focusing on the mere addition paradox. Our contribution is explained in detail in [2]. This document presents a corresponding (but sligthly modified) Isabelle/HOL dataset.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CondNormReasHOL.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CondNormReasHOL.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
