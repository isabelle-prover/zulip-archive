The first of these is the Gauß–Lucas Theorem: The critical points of a complex polynomial lie inside the convex hull of its roots. The second one is Jensen's Theorem: Every non-real critical point of a real polynomial lies inside a disc between two conjugate roots.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Polynomial_Crit_Geometry.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Polynomial_Crit_Geometry.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
