This formalization is based on the proof for BL-chains (i.e., bounded totally ordered hoops) found in Decomposition of BL-chains by M. Busaniche (Algebra Universalis, 2005).</p>\n<p>It is now online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Isabelle_hoops.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Isabelle_hoops.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
