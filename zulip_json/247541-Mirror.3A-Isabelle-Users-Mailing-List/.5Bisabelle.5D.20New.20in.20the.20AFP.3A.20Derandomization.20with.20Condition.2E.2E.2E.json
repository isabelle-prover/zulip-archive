Given a randomized algorithm, it allows the construction of <br>\na deterministic algorithm with a result that matches the average-case <br>\nquality of the randomized algorithm. Using this technique, this entry <br>\nstarts with a simple example, an algorithm that obtains a cut that <br>\ncrosses at least half of the edges. This is a well-known approximate <br>\nsolution to the Max-Cut problem. It is followed by a more complex and <br>\ninteresting result: an algorithm that returns an independent set <br>\nmatching (or exceeding) the Caro-Wei bound:<br>\nwhere is the vertex count and is the average degree of the graph. Both <br>\nalgorithms are efficient and deterministic, and follow from the <br>\nderandomization of a probabilistic existence proof.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Derandomization_Conditional_Expectations.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Derandomization_Conditional_Expectations.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
