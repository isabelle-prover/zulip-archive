In general, <br>\ndifferential privacy is discussed using measurable spaces. Sato and Katsumata <br>\nshowed that quasi-Borel spaces are also applied to formulate differential <br>\nprivacy. We formalize basic definitions and properties of differential privacy <br>\nusing quasi-Borel spaces, and show two examples: randomized response and the <br>\nnaive report noisy max algorithm.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/DP_QBS.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/DP_QBS.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy &amp; Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/pE2aGzlXVLyApcpuISW9Wnkh/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
