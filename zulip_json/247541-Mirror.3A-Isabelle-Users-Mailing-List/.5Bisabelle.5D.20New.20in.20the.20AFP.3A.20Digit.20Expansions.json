This includes the formalization of concepts such as digit shifts and carries. For a base that is a power of 2 we formalize the binary AND, binary orthogonality and binary masking of two natural numbers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What’s really interesting is the last line of the abstract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This library on digit expansions builds the basis for the formalization of the DPRM theorem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, it’s the first instalment of the huge development promised here: <a href=\"https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/11088/pdf/LIPIcs-ITP-2019-33.pdf\">https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/11088/pdf/LIPIcs-ITP-2019-33.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Looking forward to the rest! It is now online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Digit_Expansions.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Digit_Expansions.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
