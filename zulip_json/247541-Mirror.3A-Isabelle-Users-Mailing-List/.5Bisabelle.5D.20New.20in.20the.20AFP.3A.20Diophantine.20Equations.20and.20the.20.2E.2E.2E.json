This result from 1970 yields a negative solution to Hilbert's 10th problem over the integers. To represent recursively enumerable sets in equations, we implement and arithmetize register machines. We formalize a general theory of Diophantine sets and relations to reason about them abstractly. Using several number-theoretic lemmas, we prove that exponentiation has a Diophantine representation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many thanks to Jonas Bayer, Marco David, Benedikt Stock, Abhik Pal, Yuri Matiyasevich and Dierk Schleicher for this substantial and deeply impressive development.
