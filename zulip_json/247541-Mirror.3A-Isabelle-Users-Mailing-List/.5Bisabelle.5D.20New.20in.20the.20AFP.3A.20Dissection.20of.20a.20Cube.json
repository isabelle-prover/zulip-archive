Itâ€™s on the famous list of 100 theorems, taking Isabelle to 91, well above HOL Light at 87.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This entry formalizes Littlewood's argument, demonstrating that a 3-dimensional cube cannot be dissected into a finite collection of smaller cubes, each of a different size. The formalization addresses theorem #82, \"Dissection of Cubes (J.E. Littlewood's 'elegant' proof)\" from Freek Wiedijk's \"100 Mathematical Theorems\" list, and is based upon a prior formalization in Lean.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Cube_Dissection.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Cube_Dissection.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
