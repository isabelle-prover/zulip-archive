It is inspired by the streaming algorithm <br>\npresented by Błasiok in 2018. His work closed the gap between the best-known <br>\nlower bound and upper bound after a long line of research started by Flajolet <br>\nand Martin in 1984 and was to first to apply expander graphs (in addition to <br>\nhash families) to the problem. The formalized algorithm has two improvements <br>\ncompared to the algorithm by Błasiok. It supports operation in parallel mode, <br>\nand it relies on a simpler pseudo-random construction avoiding the use of code <br>\nbased extractors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Distributed_Distinct_Elements.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Distributed_Distinct_Elements.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/LIZ8qbFQcYRa4lPSpGVtDpJJ/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
