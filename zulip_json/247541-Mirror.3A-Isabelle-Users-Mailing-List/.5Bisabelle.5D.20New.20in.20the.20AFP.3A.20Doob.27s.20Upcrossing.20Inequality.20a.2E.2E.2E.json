It provides a bound on the expected number of times a <br>\nsubmartingale crosses a certain threshold within a given interval.</p>\n<p>Doob's martingale convergence theorem states that if we have a <br>\nsubmartingale where the supremum over the mean of the positive parts is <br>\nfinite, then the limit process exists almost surely and is integrable. <br>\nFurthermore, the limit process is measurable with respect to the <br>\nsmallest σ-algebra containing all of the σ-algebras in the filtration. <br>\nEquivalent statements for martingales and supermartingales are also <br>\nprovided as corollaries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Doob_Convergence.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Doob_Convergence.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
