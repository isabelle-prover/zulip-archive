We formalize the notion of a DPN in <br>\nIsabelle and describe the algorithm for computing the<br>\n-set from a regular set of configurations, and prove its correctness. We first <br>\ngive a nondeterministic description of the algorithm, from that we then infer a <br>\ndeterministic one, from which we can generate executable code using Isabelle's <br>\ncode-generation tool.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Dynamic_Pushdown_Networks.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Dynamic_Pushdown_Networks.html</a></p>\n<p>Merry Christmas!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/Fx787xwXlYsa5BjjOdKh2AR3/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
