Paulson</p>\n<p>Euler stated in 1752 that every convex polyhedron satisfied the formula V - E +<br>\nF = 2 where V, E and F are the numbers of its vertices, edges, and faces. For<br>\nthree dimensions, the well-known proof involves removing one face and then<br>\nflattening the remainder to form a planar graph, which then is iteratively<br>\ntransformed to leave a single triangle. The history of that proof is extensively<br>\ndiscussed and elaborated by Imre Lakatos, leaving one finally wondering whether<br>\nthe theorem even holds. The formal proof provided here has been ported from HOL<br>\nLight, where it is credited to Lawrence. The proof generalises Euler's<br>\nobservation from solid polyhedra to convex polytopes of arbitrary dimension.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Euler_Polyhedron_Formula.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Euler_Polyhedron_Formula.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
