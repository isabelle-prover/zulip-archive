However, that approach does not provide a way to generate executable code for such algorithms. In this entry, we introduce a new monad for randomized algorithms, for which it is possible to generate code and simultaneously reason about the correctness of randomized algorithms. The latter works by a Scott-continuous monad morphism between the newly introduced random monad and PMFs. On the other hand, when supplied with an external source of random coin flips, the randomized algorithms can be executed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’ve always found probabilistic algorithms to be paradoxical and the idea of their verification more so. (It was first tackled here at Cambridge by Joe Hurd, a student of Mike Gordon, in 2003.) This new approach introduces executability. </p>\n<p>It’s on-line at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Executable_Randomized_Algorithms.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Executable_Randomized_Algorithms.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
