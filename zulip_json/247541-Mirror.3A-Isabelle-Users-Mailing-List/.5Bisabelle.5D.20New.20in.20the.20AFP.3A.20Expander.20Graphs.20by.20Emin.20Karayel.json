They have<br>\ndiverse applications, for example in derandomization and pseudo-randomness,<br>\nerror-correcting codes, as well as pure mathematical subjects such as metric<br>\nembeddings. This entry formalizes the concept and derives main theorems about<br>\nthem such as Cheeger's inequality or tail bounds on distribution of random walks<br>\non them. It includes a strongly explicit construction for every size and<br>\nspectral gap. The latter is based on the Margulis-Gabber-Galil graphs and<br>\nseveral graph operations that preserve spectral properties. The proofs are based<br>\non the survey papers/monographs by Hoory et al. and Vadhan, as well as results<br>\nfrom Impagliazzo and Kabanets and Murtagh et al.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Expander_Graphs.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Expander_Graphs.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
