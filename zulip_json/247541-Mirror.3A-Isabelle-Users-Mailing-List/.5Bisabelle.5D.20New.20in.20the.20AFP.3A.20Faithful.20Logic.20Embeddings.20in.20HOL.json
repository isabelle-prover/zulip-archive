The approach, which is particularly fruitful for logic education, is explained in detail in an associated CADE conference paper. This paper presents the corresponding Isabelle/HOL dataset (which is only slightly modified to meet AFP requirements).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/FaithfulPMLinHOL.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/FaithfulPMLinHOL.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
