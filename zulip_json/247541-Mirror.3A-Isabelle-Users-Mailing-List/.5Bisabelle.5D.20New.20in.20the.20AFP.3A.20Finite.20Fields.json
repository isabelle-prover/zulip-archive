The derivation includes a formalization of the<br>\ncharacteristic of rings, the Frobenius endomorphism, formal differentiation for polynomials<br>\nin HOL-Algebra and Gauss' formula for the number of monic irreducible polynomials over finite <br>\nfields: </p>\n<p>1/n * sum_{d | n} mu(d) p^(n/d).</p>\n<p>The proofs are based on the books from Ireland and Rosen, as well as, Lidl and Niederreiter.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nRené</p>",
