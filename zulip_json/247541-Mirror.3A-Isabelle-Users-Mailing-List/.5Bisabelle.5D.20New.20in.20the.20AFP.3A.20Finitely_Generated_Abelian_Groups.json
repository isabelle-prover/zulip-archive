Both the invariant factor decomposition and the primary decomposition are covered. Additional work includes results about the direct product, the internal direct product and more group-theoretic lemmas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Itâ€™s online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Finitely_Generated_Abelian_Groups.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Finitely_Generated_Abelian_Groups.html</a></p>\n<p>And incidentally, we passed 600 articles some time ago. Keep them coming!</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
