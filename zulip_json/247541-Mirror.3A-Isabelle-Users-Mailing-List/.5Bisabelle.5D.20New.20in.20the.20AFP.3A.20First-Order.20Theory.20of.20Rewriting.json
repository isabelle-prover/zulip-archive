The decision procedure is based on tree <br>\nautomata technique and an inference system presented in \"Certifying Proofs in <br>\nthe First-Order Theory of Rewriting\". This AFP entry provides a formalization of <br>\nthe underlying decision procedure. Moreover it allows to generate a function <br>\nthat can verify each inference step via the code generation facility of <br>\nIsabelle/HOL. Additionally it contains the specification of a certificate <br>\nlanguage (that allows to state proofs in FORT) and a formalized function that <br>\nallows to verify the validity of the proof. This gives software tool authors, <br>\nthat implement the decision procedure, the possibility to verify their output.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/FO_Theory_Rewriting.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/FO_Theory_Rewriting.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/VIvjtXPRC7HIFG_B0vtTstuV/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
