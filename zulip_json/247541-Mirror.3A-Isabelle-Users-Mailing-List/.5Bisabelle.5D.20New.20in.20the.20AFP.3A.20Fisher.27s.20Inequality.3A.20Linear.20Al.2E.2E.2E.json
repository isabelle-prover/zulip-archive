Paulson</p>\n<p>Linear algebraic techniques are powerful, yet often underrated tools in<br>\ncombinatorial proofs. This formalisation provides a library including matrix<br>\nrepresentations of incidence set systems, general formal proof techniques for<br>\nthe rank argument and linear bound argument, and finally a formalisation of a<br>\nnumber of variations of the well-known Fisher's inequality. We build on our<br>\nprior work formalising combinatorial design theory using a locale-centric<br>\napproach, including extensions such as constant intersect designs and dual<br>\nincidence systems. In addition to Fisher's inequality, we also formalise proofs<br>\non other incidence system properties using the incidence matrix representation,<br>\nsuch as design existence, dual system relationships and incidence system<br>\nisomorphisms. This formalisation is presented in the paper \"Formalising Fisher's<br>\nInequality: Formal Linear Algebraic Techniques in Combinatorics\", accepted to<br>\nITP 2022.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Fishers_Inequality.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Fishers_Inequality.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
