Those vectors are indexed with a numeral type that represent their length. This can be employed to avoid carrying around length constraints on lists. Instead, those constraints are discharged by the type checker. As compared to the vectors defined in the distribution, this definition can easily work with unit vectors. We exploit the fact that the cardinality of an infinite type is defined to be 0: thus any infinite length index type represents a unit vector. Furthermore, we set up automation and BNF support.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can find the entry here: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Fixed_Length_Vector.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Fixed_Length_Vector.html</a></p>\n<p>Having BNF support means that the new type is ready for usage in (co)datatypes (with nested recursion through the vector).</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nDmitriy</p>",

I guess you can find an experience report on the usability of vector types in John Harrison’s TPHOLs 2005 paper (<a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/papers/hol05.html\">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/papers/hol05.html</a>), which introduced the numeral trick AFAIK. Harrison’s vector type exists in HOL-Analysis. The below entry introduces a variant that supports the unit vector (of length 0) and is integrated with datatypes via the BNF infrastructure, i.e., allows you to define funnily shaped trees such as:</p>\n<p>datatype 'a tree = Leaf 'a | Node \"'a tree ^ 42\"</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDmitriy</p>",
