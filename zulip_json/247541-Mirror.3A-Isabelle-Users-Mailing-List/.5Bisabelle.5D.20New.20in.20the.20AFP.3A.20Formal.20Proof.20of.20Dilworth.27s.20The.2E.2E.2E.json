Prathamesh and <br>\nAditya Swami</p>\n<p>A chain is defined as a totally ordered subset of a partially ordered set. A <br>\nchain cover refers to a collection of chains of a partially ordered set whose <br>\nunion equals the entire set. A chain decomposition is a chain cover consisting <br>\nof pairwise disjoint sets. An antichain is a subset of elements of a partially <br>\nordered set in which no two elements are comparable.</p>\n<p>In 1950, Dilworth proved that in any finite partially ordered set, the <br>\ncardinality of a largest antichain equals the cardinality of a smallest chain <br>\ndecomposition.</p>\n<p>In this paper, we formalise a proof of the theorem above, also known as <br>\nDilworth's theorem, based on a proof by Perles (1963). We draw on the <br>\nformalisation of Dilworth's theorem in Coq by Abhishek Kr. Singh, and depend on <br>\nthe AFP entry containing formalisation of minimal and maximal elements in a set <br>\nby Martin Desharnais.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Dilworth.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Dilworth.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/rQmgLthhEqv5wLYKMNxgd5df/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
