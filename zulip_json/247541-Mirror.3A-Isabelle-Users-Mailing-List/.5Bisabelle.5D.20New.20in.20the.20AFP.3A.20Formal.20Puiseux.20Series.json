Furthermore, it proves the Newton–Puiseux Theorem, namely that the Puiseux series over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 are also algebraically closed.</p>\n<p>You will find it online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Formal_Puiseux_Series.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Formal_Puiseux_Series.html</a></p>\n<p>Many thanks, Manuel!</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",

We do have a big amount of<br>\nprobability theory in Isabelle/HOL, and I think there is even some<br>\nmartingale theory in some AFP entry. The proof looks fairly simple, as<br>\nlong as the necessary background theory is there.</p>\n<p>The Isoperimetric Theorem is a bit more tricky because to even state it,<br>\none needs a way to talk about the perimeter of a set (or in higher<br>\ndimensions, the \"surface area\"), and there are a number of different<br>\napproaches, some of which are more general than others.</p>\n<p>The best approach, I think, would be to define the Minkowski measure and<br>\nprove the Brunn–Minkowski inequality in R^n (all very doable with some<br>\nbasic measure theory; I even have some material about these things lying<br>\naround somewhere already).
