The <br>\nTimely Dataflow distributed system supports expressive cyclic dataflows for <br>\nwhich it offers low-latency data- and pipeline-parallel stream processing. To <br>\nachieve high expressiveness and performance, Timely Dataflow uses an intricate <br>\ndistributed protocol for tracking the computation’s progress. We formalize this <br>\nprogress tracking protocol and verify its safety. Our formalization is described <br>\nin detail in our forthcoming ITP'21 paper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Progress_Tracking.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Progress_Tracking.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/W79fI4mQAGvTRNg_4D74bdye/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
