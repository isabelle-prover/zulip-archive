We provide a theory for a non-Boolean Gray code, <br>\nwhich is a generalisation of the idea for an arbitrary base. Contained is the <br>\nnecessary theoretical environment to express and reason about the respective <br>\nproperties.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Gray_Codes.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Gray_Codes.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/lUBvXQGJTUS1zR18K364PwKL/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
