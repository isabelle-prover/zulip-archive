CVP and SVP are two fundamental problems in lattice<br>\ntheory. Lattices are a discrete, additive subgroup of R^n and are used for<br>\nlattice-based cryptography. The CVP asks to find the nearest lattice vector to a<br>\ntarget. The SVP asks to find the shortest non-zero lattice vector. This entry<br>\nformalizes the basic properties of lattices, the reduction from CVP to Subset<br>\nSum in both maximum and p-norm for a finite p with 1&lt;= p and the reduction of<br>\nSVP to Partition using the Bounded Homogeneous Linear Equations problem (BHLE)<br>\nas an intermediate step. The formalization uncovered a number of problems with<br>\nthe existing proofs in the literature.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CVP_Hardness.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CVP_Hardness.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
