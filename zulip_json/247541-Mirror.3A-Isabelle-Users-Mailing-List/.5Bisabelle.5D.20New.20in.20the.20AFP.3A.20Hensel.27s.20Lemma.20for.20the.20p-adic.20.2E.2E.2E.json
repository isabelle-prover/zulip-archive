The carrier of the ring is formalized as the<br>\ninverse limit of quotients of the integers by powers of a fixed prime p.<br>\nWe define an integer-valued valuation, as well as an extended-integer<br>\nvalued valuation which sends 0 to the infinite element. Basic<br>\ntopological facts about the p-adic integers are formalized, including<br>\ncompleteness and sequential compactness. Taylor expansions of<br>\npolynomials over a commutative ring are defined, culminating in the<br>\nformalization of Hensel's Lemma based on a proof due to Keith Conrad.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Padic_Ints.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Padic_Ints.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy</p>\n<p>Manuel<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/Gzm7OrK2CdY84THBiS9L-lfk/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
