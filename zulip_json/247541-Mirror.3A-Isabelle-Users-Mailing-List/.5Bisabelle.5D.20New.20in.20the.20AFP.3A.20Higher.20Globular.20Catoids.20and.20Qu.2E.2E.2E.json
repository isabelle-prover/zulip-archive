Due to strictness, the cells of these higher <br>\ncategories have globular shape. We use a single-set approach, generalised to <br>\ncatoids and based on type classes. The higher Kleene algebras and quantales <br>\nintroduced extend features of modal and concurrent Kleene algebras and <br>\nquantales. They arise for instance as powerset extensions of higher catoids, and <br>\nhave been used in algebraic confluence proofs in higher-dimensional rewriting. <br>\nDetails are described in two companion articles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/OmegaCatoidsQuantales.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/OmegaCatoidsQuantales.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/hwNxdpdttIlHiyAAaISH_pEW/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
