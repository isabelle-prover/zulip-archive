Paulson</p>\n<p>This library includes several example applications of the probabilistic method <br>\nfor combinatorics to establish bounds for hypergraph colourings. This focuses on <br>\nProperty B - the existence of a two-colouring of the vertex set of a hypergraph. <br>\nA stricter bound was formalised using the Lov√°sz local lemma, which in turn <br>\nrequired a surprisingly complex proof of the mutual independence principle for <br>\nhypergraph edges that is often omitted on paper. The formalisation uncovered <br>\nseveral interesting examples of circular intuition on proofs involving <br>\nindependence on paper. The formalisation is based on the textbook proofs from <br>\nAlon and Spencer's famous textbook, The Probabilistic Method, further supported <br>\nby notes by Zhao. The mutual independence principle proof is inspired by the <br>\nless precise proof provided in Molloy and Reed's textbook on graph colourings, <br>\nas it was omitted in all other sources. Additionally, this library demonstrates <br>\nhow locales can be used to establish a reusable probability space framework, <br>\nthus minimizing the setup required for future formalisations requiring a <br>\nprobability space on numerous possible properties around an incidence system's <br>\nvertex set.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hypergraph_Colourings.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hypergraph_Colourings.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/g3CzZv2ZosVuYdeWc8rk_M7Y/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
