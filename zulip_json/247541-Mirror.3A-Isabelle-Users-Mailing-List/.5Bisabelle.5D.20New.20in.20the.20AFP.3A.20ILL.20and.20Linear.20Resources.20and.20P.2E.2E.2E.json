Fleuriot</p>\n<p>In this entry we formalise intuitionistic linear logic (ILL) with a deep <br>\nembedding of propositions, and shallow and deep embeddings of deductions. We <br>\nintroduce the logic with an explicit exchange rule, meaning sequents have a list <br>\nof propositions as antecedents. We then prove that sequents that differ only in <br>\nthe order of their antecedents are equivalently valid, representing the <br>\nalternative implicit exchange rule. The deep embedding of deductions allows for <br>\ndirect construction, manipulation and verification of ILL deductions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/ILL.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/ILL.html</a></p>\n<p>Linear Resources and Process Compositions<br>\nFilip Smola and Jacques D. Fleuriot</p>\n<p>In this entry we formalise a framework for process composition based on actions <br>\nthat are specified by their input and output resources. We verify their <br>\ncorrectness by translating compositions of process into deductions of <br>\nintuitionistic linear logic. As part of the verification we derive simple <br>\nconditions on the compositions which ensure well-formedness of the corresponding <br>\ndeduction.</p>\n<p>We describe an earlier version of this formalisation in our article Linear <br>\nResources in Isabelle/HOL, which also includes a formalisation of manufacturing <br>\nprocesses in the simulation game Factorio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/ProcessComposition.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/ProcessComposition.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/RqNigbbBJ9uVoxOfzdo9ll7M/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
