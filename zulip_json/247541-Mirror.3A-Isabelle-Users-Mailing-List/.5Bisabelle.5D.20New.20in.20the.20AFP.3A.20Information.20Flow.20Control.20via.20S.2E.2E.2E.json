Then, a static type system is specified and is proven to be capable of enforcing such policies. Finally, the information flow correctness notion and the static type system introduced here are proven to degenerate to the counterparts formalized in Nipkow and Klein's book in case of a stateless level-based information flow correctness policy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is now online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IMP_Noninterference.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IMP_Noninterference.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
