We investigate this<br>\nalternating structure in a relational language based on power allegories<br>\nextended with specific operations on multirelations. We develop algebras of<br>\nmodal operators over multirelations, related to concurrent dynamic logics, in<br>\nthis language.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Multirelations_Heterogeneous.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Multirelations_Heterogeneous.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
