Formal methods being critical for the safety and<br>\nsecurity of algorithms and protocols, we foresee their widespread use for<br>\nquantum computing in the future. We have developed a large library for quantum<br>\ncomputing in Isabelle based on a matrix representation for quantum circuits,<br>\nsuccessfully formalising the no-cloning theorem, quantum teleportation,<br>\nDeutsch's algorithm, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the quantum Prisoner's<br>\nDilemma.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Isabelle_Marries_Dirac.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Isabelle_Marries_Dirac.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
