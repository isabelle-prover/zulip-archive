Integers are represented as LSBF (least significant bit first) boolean lists, on which the algorithm by Karatsuba is implemented. The running time of O(n^{\\log_2 3}) is verified using the Time Monad defined in Root-Balanced Trees by Nipkow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is now online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Karatsuba.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Karatsuba.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
