Paulson</p>\n<p>Abstract:<br>\nWe formalise the proof of an important theorem in additive combinatorics due to<br>\nKhovanskii, attesting that the cardinality of the set of all sums of n many<br>\nelements of A, where A is a finite subset of an abelian group, is a polynomial<br>\nin n for all sufficiently large n. We follow a proof due to Nathanson and Ruzsa<br>\nas presented in the notes \"Introduction to Additive Combinatorics\" by Timothy<br>\nGowers for the University of Cambridge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Khovanskii_Theorem.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Khovanskii_Theorem.html</a></p>",
