We also show a strict version of Kneser's Theorem as well as the<br>\nCauchy–Davenport Theorem as a corollary of Kneser's Theorem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Kneser_Cauchy_Davenport.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Kneser_Cauchy_Davenport.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
