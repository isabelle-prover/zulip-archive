If n · m is even, then there exists a Knight's <br>\ncircuit. A Knight's Path is a sequence of moves of a Knight on a chessboard s.t. <br>\nthe Knight visits every square of a chessboard exactly once. Finding a Knight's <br>\npath is a an instance of the Hamiltonian path problem. A Knight's circuit is a <br>\nKnight's path, where additionally the Knight can move from the last square to <br>\nthe first square of the path, forming a loop. During the formalization two <br>\nmistakes in the original proof were discovered. These mistakes are corrected in <br>\nthis formalization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Knights_Tour.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Knights_Tour.html</a></p>\n<p>Happy New Year!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/WUI-gbVEgrMlI4FvAV_R2ZZ3/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
