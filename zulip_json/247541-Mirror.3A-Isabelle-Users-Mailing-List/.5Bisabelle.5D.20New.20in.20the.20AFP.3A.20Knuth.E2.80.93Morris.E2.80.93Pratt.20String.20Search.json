The worst-case time is . Knuth–Morris–Pratt <br>\nexploits the knowledge gained from the partial match, never re-comparing <br>\ncharacters that matched and thereby achieving linear time. At the first <br>\nmismatched character, it shifts as far to the right as safely possible. To do <br>\nso, it consults a precomputed table, based on the pattern. The KMP algorithm is <br>\nproved correct.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/KnuthMorrisPratt.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/KnuthMorrisPratt.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/IwpO7mILNAY0YNp1k7KNcUSK/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
