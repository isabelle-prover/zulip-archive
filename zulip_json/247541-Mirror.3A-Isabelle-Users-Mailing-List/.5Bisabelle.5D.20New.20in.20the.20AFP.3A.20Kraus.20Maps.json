(In the finite-dimensional setting and the <br>\nsetting of separable Hilbert spaces, those are known to be equivalent to <br>\ncompletely-positive maps, another common formalization of quantum channels.) Our <br>\nresults hold for arbitrary (i.e., not necessarily finite-dimensional or <br>\nseparable Hilbert spaces. Specifically, in theory Kraus_Families, we formalize <br>\nthe type of families of Kraus operators (Kraus families for short), from <br>\ntrace-class operators on Hilbert space to those on , indexed by of type . This <br>\ninduces both a Kraus map, as well as a quantum measurement with outcomes of type <br>\n.... We define and study various special Kraus families such as zero, identity, <br>\napplication of an operator, sum of two Kraus maps, sequential composition, <br>\ninfinite sum, random sampling, trace, tensor products, and complete <br>\nmeasurements. Furthermore, since working with explicit Kraus families can be <br>\ncumbersome when the specific family of operators is not relevant, in theory <br>\nKraus_Maps, we define a Kraus map to be a function between two spaces that is of <br>\nthe form ... for some Kraus family, and restate our results in terms of such <br>\nfunctions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Kraus_Maps.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Kraus_Maps.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/9qgnXY8juK43iZonr8rPLK4H/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
