Hereâ€™s a summary of the abstract (omitting the mathematical formulas):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This entry provides proofs for two important congruences involving Bernoulli numbers. The proofs follow Cohen's textbook Number Theory Volume II: Analytic and Modern Tools. The first result that I showed is Voronoi's congruence. Building upon this, I then derive Kummer's congruence. One application of these congruences is to prove that there are infinitely many irregular primes, which I formalised as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Kummer_Congruence.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Kummer_Congruence.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
