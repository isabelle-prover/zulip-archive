Löb's theorem essentially states that if Provable(“φ”) → φ is formally provable then so is φ itself. It is a generalisation of the second incompleteness theorem, and now has its own chapter (the last).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Incompleteness.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Incompleteness.html</a></p>",
