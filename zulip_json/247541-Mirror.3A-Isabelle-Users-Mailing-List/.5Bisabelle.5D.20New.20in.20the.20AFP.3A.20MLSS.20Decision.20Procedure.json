The fragment is called multi-level syllogistic with singleton, or MLSS for short. Its syntax syntax includes the usual set operations union, intersection, difference, membership, equality as well as the construction of a set containing a single element. We specify the semantics of MLSS in terms of hereditarily finite sets and provide a sound and complete tableau calculus for it. We also provide an executable specification of a decision procedure that applies the rules of the calculus exhaustively and prove its termination. Furthermore, we extend the calculus with a light-weight type system that paves the way for an integration of the procedure into Isabelle/HOL.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now on-line at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MLSS_Decision_Proc.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MLSS_Decision_Proc.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
