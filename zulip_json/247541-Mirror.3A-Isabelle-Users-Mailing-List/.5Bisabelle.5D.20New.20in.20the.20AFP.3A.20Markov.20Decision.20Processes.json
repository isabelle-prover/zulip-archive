In particular we build on our analysis of the Bellman operator for discounted infinite horizon MDPs. From the iterator rule on the Bellman operator we directly derive executable value iteration and policy iteration algorithms to iteratively solve finite MDPs. … Our formalization is based on chapters 5 and 6 in Puterman's book \"Markov Decision Processes: Discrete Stochastic Dynamic Programming”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both now available at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org\">https://www.isa-afp.org</a> !</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
