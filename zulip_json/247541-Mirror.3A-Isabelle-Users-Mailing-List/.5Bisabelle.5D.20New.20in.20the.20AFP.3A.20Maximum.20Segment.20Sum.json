We assume that the elements of the list are not necessarily numbers <br>\nbut just elements of some linearly ordered group. Both a naive algorithm <br>\n(O(n^2)) and Kadane's algorithm (O(n)) are given and their correctness is proved.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Maximum_Segment_Sum.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Maximum_Segment_Sum.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/GQRu_Bqie6bI9X-PDTAe3Efc/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
