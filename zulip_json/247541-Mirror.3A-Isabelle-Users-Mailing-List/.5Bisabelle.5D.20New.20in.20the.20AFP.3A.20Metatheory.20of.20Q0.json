Q0 is a classical higher-order logic equivalent to Church's Simple Theory of Types. In this entry we formalize Chapter 5 of \"An Introduction to Mathematical Logic and Type Theory: To Truth Through Proof\" (Andrews, 2002), up to and including the proofs of soundness and consistency of Q0. These proof are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to be formalized in a proof assistant.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Q0_Metatheory.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Q0_Metatheory.html</a></p>\n<p>Could this be a starting point to formally verify soundness and consistency of Isabelle/HOL?</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nDmitriy</p>",

I have taken a look at it, and I have to say that I am very impressed! This is a very thorough formalization of Peter Andrews' Q0 system!</p>\n<p>I have myself also formalized the soundness result for theorems in Q0.<br>\nIt is available here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/IsaFoL/IsaFoL/tree/master/Q0\">https://github.com/IsaFoL/IsaFoL/tree/master/Q0</a><br>\n(Previously it was at <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/isafol/isafol/src/master/Q0/\">https://bitbucket.org/isafol/isafol/src/master/Q0/</a> )</p>\n<p>By coincidence my plan was (and still is) to submit this to AFP tomorrow.<br>\nI have uploaded the generated pdf, if someone is curious to take a look already now:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/IsaFoL/IsaFoL/blob/master/Q0/document-13Nov2023.pdf\">https://github.com/IsaFoL/IsaFoL/blob/master/Q0/document-13Nov2023.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Javier, I will of course update my submission to cite your impressive AFP entry.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nAnders</p>",
