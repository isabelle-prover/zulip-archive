This theorem is listed in the 100 theorem list. In this <br>\ntheory, we define some basics elements on complex geometry such as axial <br>\nsymmetry, rotations. We also define basic property of congruent <br>\ntriangles in the complex field following the model already presented in <br>\nthe afp. In addition we demonstrate sines law in the complex context. <br>\nFinally we prove the Morley theorem using Alain Connes's proof.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Morley_Theorem.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Morley_Theorem.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
