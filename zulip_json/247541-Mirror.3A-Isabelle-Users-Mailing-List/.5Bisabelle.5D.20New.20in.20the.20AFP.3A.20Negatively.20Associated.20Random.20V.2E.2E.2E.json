In <br>\nparticular closure properties, such as composition with monotone functions, as <br>\nwell as, the well-known Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds. This entry introduces the <br>\nconcept and verifies the most important closure properties, as well as, the <br>\nconcentration inequalities. It also verifies the FKG inequality, which is a <br>\ngeneralization of Chebyshev's sum inequality for distributive lattices and a key <br>\ntool for establishing negative association, but has also many applications <br>\nbeyond the context of negative association, in particular, statistical physics <br>\nand graph theory. As an example, permutation distributions are shown to be <br>\nnegatively associated, from which many more sets of negatively random variables <br>\ncan be derived, such as, e.g., n-subsets, or the the balls-into-bins process. <br>\nFinally, the entry derives a correct false-positive rate for Bloom filters using <br>\nthe library.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Negative_Association.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Negative_Association.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/IMvtf0tJhQqQn0p-ohJnhI6b/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
