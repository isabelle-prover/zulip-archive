The theorem states that <br>\nfor binary classification prediction tasks, there is no universal learner, <br>\nmeaning that for every learning algorithms, there exists a distribution on which <br>\nit fails.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/No_Free_Lunch_ML.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/No_Free_Lunch_ML.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/rlQ9BArucsinglTJa9qmOcyJ/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
