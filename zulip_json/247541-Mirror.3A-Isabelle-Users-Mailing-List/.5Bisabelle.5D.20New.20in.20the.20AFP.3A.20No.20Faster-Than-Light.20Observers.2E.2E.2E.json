Specifically, we prove that whenever an observer m encounters <br>\nanother observer k (so that m and k are both present at some spacetime location <br>\nx), k will necessarily be observed by m to be traveling at less than light speed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/No_FTL_observers_Gen_Rel.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/No_FTL_observers_Gen_Rel.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/1ibhR3NTafNhrLxBPUXL1nKD/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
