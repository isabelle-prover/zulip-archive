The<br>\nresulting framework is purely denotational and, given the possibility to define<br>\narbitrary events in a HOL-type, more expressive than the original. However,<br>\nthere is a need for an operational semantics for CSP. From the latter,<br>\nmodel-checkers, symbolic execution engines for test-case generators, and<br>\nanimators and simulators can be constructed. In the literature, a few versions<br>\nof operational semantics for CSP have been proposed, where it is assumed, of<br>\ncourse, that denotational and operational constructs coincide, but this is not<br>\nobvious at first glance. The present work addresses this issue by providing the<br>\nfirst (to our knowledge) formal theory of operational behavior derived from<br>\nHOL-CSP via a bridge definition between the denotational and the operational<br>\nsemantics. In fact, several possibilities are discussed. As a bonus, we have<br>\ndefined three new operators: Sliding, Throw and Interrupt which are of<br>\nparticular pragmatic interest in operational semantics. Moreover, we have proven<br>\nnew laws for HOL-CSP improving the latter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/HOL-CSP_OpSem.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/HOL-CSP_OpSem.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
