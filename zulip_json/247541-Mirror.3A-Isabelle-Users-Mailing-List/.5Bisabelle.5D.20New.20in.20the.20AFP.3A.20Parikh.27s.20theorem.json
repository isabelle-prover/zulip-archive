Parikh's Theorem states that the Parikh image<br>\nof a context-free language is the same as the Parikh image of some regular<br>\nlanguage. This formalization closely follows Pilling's proof: It describes a<br>\ncontext-free language as a minimal solution to a system of equations induced by<br>\na context free grammar for this language. Then it is shown that there exists a<br>\nminimal solution to this system which is regular, such that the regular solution<br>\nand the context-free language have the same Parikh image.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Parikh.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Parikh.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
