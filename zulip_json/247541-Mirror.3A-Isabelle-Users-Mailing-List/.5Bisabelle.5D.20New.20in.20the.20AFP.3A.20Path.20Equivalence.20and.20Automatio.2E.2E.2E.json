It also provides the path tactic, which proves or simplifies some common proof obligations for composite paths, e.g. showing that a path is not self-intersecting or decomposing integrals on a composite path into the integrals on the constituent paths.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Path_Automation.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Path_Automation.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
