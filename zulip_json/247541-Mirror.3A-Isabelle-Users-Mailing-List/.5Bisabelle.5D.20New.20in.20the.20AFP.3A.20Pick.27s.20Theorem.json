We are inspired by John Harrison's formalization of Pick's theorem in HOL Light, but tailor our proof approach to avoid a primary challenge point in his formalization, which is proving that any polygon with more than three vertices can be split (in its interior) by a line between some two vertices. Our formalization involves augmenting the existing geometry libraries in various foundational ways (e.g., by adding the definition of a polygon and formalizing some key properties thereof).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's a substantial development, nearly 45% bigger than my formalisation of the incompleteness theorems. It also takes Isabelle up to 90 on Freek's List of 100 problems!
