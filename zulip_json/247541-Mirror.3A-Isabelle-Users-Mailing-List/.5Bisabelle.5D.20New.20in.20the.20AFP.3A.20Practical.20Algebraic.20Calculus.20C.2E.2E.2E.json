In recent years formal verification<br>\nusing computer algebra became more important and is heavily used in<br>\nautomated circuit verification. An existing proof format which covers<br>\nalgebraic reasoning and allows efficient proof checking is the practical<br>\nalgebraic calculus (PAC). In this development, we present the verified<br>\nchecker Past√®que that is obtained by synthesis via the Refinement<br>\nFramework. This is the formalization going with our FMCAD'20 tool<br>\npresentation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/PAC_Checker.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/PAC_Checker.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
