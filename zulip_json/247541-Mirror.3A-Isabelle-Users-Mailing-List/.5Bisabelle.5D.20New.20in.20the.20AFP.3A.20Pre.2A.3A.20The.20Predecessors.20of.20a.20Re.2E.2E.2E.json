Moreover, given an NFA $M$ for $L$, <br>\nan NFA $M'$ for $pre^*(L)$<br>\ncan be computed very elegantly from $M$. Starting from a suitable $M$, <br>\nsimple checks on $M'$<br>\nprovide solutions to many elementary decision problems concerning $G$,<br>\nsuch as the word-problem, emptiness problem, and more.</p>\n<p>We formalize two algorithms to compute $pre^*(L)$ for a regular $L$ <br>\n(using NFAs as representation).<br>\nThe first one is very simple and elegant and works for any CFG, while <br>\nthe second one is<br>\nmore efficient but is restricted to CFGs in in extended-CNF.<br>\nAll our algorithms are executable,<br>\nallowing many elementary problems on context-free grammars to be solved <br>\nautomatically.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Pre_Star_CFG.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Pre_Star_CFG.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Peter</p>",
