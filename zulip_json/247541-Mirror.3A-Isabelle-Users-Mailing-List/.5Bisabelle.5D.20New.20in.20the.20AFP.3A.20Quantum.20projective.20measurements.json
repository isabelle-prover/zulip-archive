We also formalized the CHSH inequality, an inequality involving expectations in a probability space that is violated by quantum measurements, thus proving that quantum mechanics cannot be modeled with an underlying local hidden-variable theory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You will find it online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Projective_Measurements.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Projective_Measurements.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
