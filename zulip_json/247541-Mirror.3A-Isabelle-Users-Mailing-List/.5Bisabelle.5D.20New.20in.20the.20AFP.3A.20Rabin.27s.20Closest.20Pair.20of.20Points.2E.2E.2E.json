Hence this algorithm is one of the first <br>\nknown examples of randomized algorithms that outperform deterministic <br>\nalgorithms. The formalization also introduces a probabilistic time <br>\nmonad, which builds on the existing deterministic time monad.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Randomized_Closest_Pair.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Randomized_Closest_Pair.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
