Aside from helping us avoid circular reasoning, this is, as far as we are aware, the first time real exponents are mechanised in this way within a proof assistant.\"</p>\n<p>It is online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Real_Power.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Real_Power.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
