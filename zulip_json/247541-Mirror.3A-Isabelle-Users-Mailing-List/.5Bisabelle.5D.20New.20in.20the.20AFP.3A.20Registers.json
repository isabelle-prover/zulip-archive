In a nutshell, a register refers to a part of a larger <br>\nmemory or system that can be accessed independently. Registers can be constructed from <br>\nother registers and several (compatible) registers can be composed. This formalization <br>\ndevelops both the generic theory of registers as well as specific instantiations for <br>\nclassical and quantum registers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Registers.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Registers.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
