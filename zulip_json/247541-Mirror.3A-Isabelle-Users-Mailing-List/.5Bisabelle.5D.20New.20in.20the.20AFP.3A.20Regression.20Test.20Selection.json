RTS algorithms select which tests to rerun on </p>\n<p>revised code, reducing the time required to check for newly introduced errors. <br>\nAn RTS algorithm is considered safe if and only if all deselected tests would <br>\nhave unchanged results.  This definition is instantiated with two <br>\nclass-collection-based RTS algorithms run over the JVM as modeled by JinjaDCI. <br>\nThis is achieved with a general definition for Collection Semantics, small-step <br>\nsemantics instrumented to collect information during execution. As the RTS <br>\ndefinition mandates safety, these instantiations include proofs of safety.  This <br>\nwork is described in Mansky and Gunter's LSFA 2020 paper and Mansky's doctoral <br>\nthesis (UIUC, 2020).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Regression_Test_Selection.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Regression_Test_Selection.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/-S19r-alDw8LGA6NSepZrFsd/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
