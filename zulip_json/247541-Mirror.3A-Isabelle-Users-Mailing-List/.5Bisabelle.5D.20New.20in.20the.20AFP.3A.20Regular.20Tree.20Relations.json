This formalization contains among other things the <br>\nproofs of many closure properties of tree automata (anchored) ground tree <br>\ntransducers and regular relations. Additionally it includes the well known <br>\npumping lemma and a lifting of the Myhill Nerode theorem for regular languages <br>\nto tree languages. We want to mention the existence of a tree automata APF-entry <br>\ndeveloped by Peter Lammich. His work is based on epsilon free top-down tree <br>\nautomata, while this entry builds on bottom-up tree auotamta with epsilon <br>\ntransitions. Moreover our formalization relies on the Collections Framework, <br>\nalso by Peter Lammich, to obtain efficient code. All proven constructions of the <br>\nclosure properties are exportable using the Isabelle/HOL code generation facilities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Regular_Tree_Relations.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Regular_Tree_Relations.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/p4-PJ-k4DIjOzx7h9zrAGI6j/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
