They use standard relational constructions for extrema, bounds, suprema, the univalent part and symmetric quotients, which we also formalise. We moreover prove that mono-atomic elements correspond to join-irreducible elements under the divisibility axioms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Relational_Divisibility.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Relational_Divisibility.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
