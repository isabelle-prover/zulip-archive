The <br>\nformulas quantify over relations while still avoiding quantification over <br>\nelements of the base set. We formalise the property of undirected graphs being <br>\nacyclic this way. This involves a study of various kinds of orientation of <br>\ngraphs. We also verify basic algorithms to constructively prove several <br>\nsecond-order properties.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Relational_Forests.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Relational_Forests.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/TklCDXwWooiqxlZYPNI0UpE9/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
