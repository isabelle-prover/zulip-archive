Rensets are an algebraic axiomatization of renaming (variable-for-variable substitution). The formalization includes a connection with nominal sets, showing that any renset naturally gives rise to a nominal set. It also includes examples of deploying the renaming-based recursor: semantic interpretation, counting functions for free and bound occurrences, unary and parallel substitution, etc. Finally, it includes a variation of rensets that axiomatize term-for-variable substitution, called substitutive sets, which yields a corresponding recursion principle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is now on-line at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Rensets.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Rensets.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
