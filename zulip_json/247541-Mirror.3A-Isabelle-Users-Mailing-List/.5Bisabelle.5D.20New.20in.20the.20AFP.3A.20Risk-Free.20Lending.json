The risk-free lending protocol is a system for issuing and <br>\nexchanging novel financial products we call risk-free loan. The system <br>\nallows one party to lend money at 0% APY to another party in exchange <br>\nfor a good or service. On every update of the ledger, accounts have <br>\ninterest distributed to them. Holders of lent assets keep interest <br>\naccrued by those assets. After distributing interest, the system returns <br>\na fixed fraction of each loan. These fixed fractions determine loan <br>\nperiods. Loans for longer periods have a smaller fixed fraction <br>\nreturned. Loans may be re-lent or used as collateral for other loans. We <br>\ngive a sufficient criterion to enforce all accounts will forever be <br>\nsolvent. We give a protocol for maintaining this invariant when <br>\ntransferring or lending funds. We also show this invariant holds after <br>\nupdate. Even though the system does not track counter-party obligations, <br>\nwe show that all credited and debited loans cancel and the monetary <br>\nsupply grows at a specified interest rate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Risk_Free_Lending.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Risk_Free_Lending.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
