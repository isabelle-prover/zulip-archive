Due to the space constraints of a 16-pages paper, the published proof is monolithic and hard to comprehend. In this work, we reuse the existing strategy for ground ordered resolution and present a new, simpler strategy for SCL(FOL). We prove a stronger bisimulation theorem between these two strategies (i.e., they both simulate each other). Our proof is modular: it consists of ten refinement steps focusing on different aspects of the two strategies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/SCL_Simulates_Ground_Resolution.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/SCL_Simulates_Ground_Resolution.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Dmitriy</p>",
