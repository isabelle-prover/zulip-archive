Minsky et al. [1]. The algorithm allows two communication partners, who have a similar pair of sets, to reconcile them while using messages of nearly optimal size, proportional to a bound on the maximum symmetric difference between the sets. The formalization also introduces an optimization, which reduces the communication complexity even further compared to the original publication.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Set_Reconciliation.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Set_Reconciliation.html</a></p>",
