The (finite-dimensional) spectral theorem states <br>\nthat any such matrix can be decomposed into a product of a unitary <br>\nmatrix and a diagonal matrix containing only real elements. We formalize <br>\nthe generalization of this result, which states that any finite set of <br>\nHermitian and pairwise commuting matrices can be decomposed as <br>\npreviously, using the same unitary matrix; in other words, they are <br>\nsimultaneously diagonalizable. Sets of pairwise commuting Hermitian <br>\nmatrices are called /Complete Sets of Commuting Observables/ in Quantum <br>\nMechanics, where they represent physical quantities that can be <br>\nsimultaneously measured to uniquely distinguish quantum states.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Commuting_Hermitian.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Commuting_Hermitian.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
