That <br>\nis, there exist no nontrivial integer solutions x,y,z ∈ ℤ to the <br>\nequation x^p + y^p = z^p such that p divides neither x, y nor z. After <br>\nsome preliminary results, mainly on sufficient criteria for FLT, we <br>\npropose a formalization of the classical version of Sophie Germain's <br>\ntheorem as well as a variant involving the concept of auxiliary primes <br>\nthat generalizes Sophie Germain primes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Sophie_Germain.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Sophie_Germain.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
