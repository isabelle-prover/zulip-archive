Andrews together with the system's soundness. Most of the used theorems and lemmas are also from his book. The soundness proof is with respect to general models and as a consequence also holds for standard models. Higher-order logic is given a semantics by porting to Isabelle/HOL the specification of set theory by Kumar et al. from the CakeML project. The independently developed AFP entry \"Metatheory of Q0\" by Javier Díaz also formalizes Q0 in Isabelle/HOL. I highly recommend the reader to also take a look at his formalization!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Q0_Soundness.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Q0_Soundness.html</a></p>\n<p>An independent formalization of the same result and more by Javier Díaz (<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Q0_Metatheory.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Q0_Metatheory.html</a>) has appeared in the AFP recently. Anders’ formalization was part of IsaFoL (<a href=\"https://github.com/IsaFoL/IsaFoL\">https://github.com/IsaFoL/IsaFoL</a>) for more than a year. One interesting aspect is that Anders uses a formalization of set theory inspired by CakeML, and shows that it is consistent with the two existing axiomatizations (HOLZF and ZFC_in_HOL).</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
