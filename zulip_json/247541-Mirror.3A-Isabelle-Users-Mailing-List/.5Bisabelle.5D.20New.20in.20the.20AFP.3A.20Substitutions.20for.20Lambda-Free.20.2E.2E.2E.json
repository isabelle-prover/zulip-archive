It introduces a type construction for the rigorous definition and manipulation of substitutions. The main theorem of this theory proves the existence of fixed-point substitutions under acyclicity, a theorem that is too often regarded as trivial in the literature.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Substitutions_Lambda_Free.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Substitutions_Lambda_Free.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
