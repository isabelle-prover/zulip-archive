We define it in terms of the Seidel triangle, a number triangle similar to Pascal's triangle, and then prove the closed form B(f) = (sec+tan)f.<br>\nWe also define several related sequences, such as:<br>\nReasonably efficient executable algorithms to compute the Boustrophedon transform and related sequences are also given, using Imperative HOL.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Boustrophedon_Transform.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Boustrophedon_Transform.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
