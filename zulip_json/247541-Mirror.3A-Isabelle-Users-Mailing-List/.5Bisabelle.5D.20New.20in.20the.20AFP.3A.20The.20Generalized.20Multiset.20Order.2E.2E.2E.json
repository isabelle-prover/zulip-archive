We show that the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete. To be <br>\nmore precise, we encode multiset-comparisons into propositional formulas or into <br>\nconjunctive normal forms of quadratic size; we further prove that satisfiability <br>\nof conjunctive normal forms can be encoded as multiset-comparison problems of <br>\nlinear size. As a corollary, we also show that the problem of deciding whether <br>\ntwo terms are related by a recursive path order is NP-hard, provided the <br>\nrecursive path order is based on the generalized multiset ordering.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Multiset_Ordering_NPC.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Multiset_Ordering_NPC.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/-NjyAAH5h4QkJerCtizM4U1B/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
