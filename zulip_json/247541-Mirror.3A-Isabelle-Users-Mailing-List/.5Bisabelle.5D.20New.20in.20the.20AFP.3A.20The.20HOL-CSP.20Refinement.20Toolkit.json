This<br>\nanalysis enables to derive a number of properties that allow to deepen<br>\nthe understanding of these notions, in particular with respect to<br>\nspecification decomposition principles for the case of infinite sets of<br>\nevents. The established relations between the refinement relations help<br>\nto clarify some obscure points in the CSP literature, but also provide a<br>\nweapon for shorter refinement proofs. Furthermore, we provide a<br>\nframework for state-normalisation allowing to formally reason on<br>\nparameterised process architectures. As a result, we have a modern<br>\nenvironment for formal proofs of concurrent systems that allow for the<br>\ncombination of general infinite processes with locally finite ones in a<br>\nlogically safe way. We demonstrate these verification-techniques for<br>\nclassical, generalised examples: The CopyBuffer for arbitrary data and<br>\nthe Dijkstra's Dining Philosopher Problem of arbitrary size.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CSP_RefTK.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CSP_RefTK.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Manuel<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ZzR_RBq9dCLUzLcfZzcN_4WT/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
