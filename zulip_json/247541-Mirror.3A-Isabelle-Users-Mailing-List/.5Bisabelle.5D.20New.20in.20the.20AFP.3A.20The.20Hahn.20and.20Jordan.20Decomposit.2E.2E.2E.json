We also formalize the Jordan decomposition theorem as a<br>\ncorollary, which states that the signed measure under consideration admits a<br>\nunique decomposition into a difference of two positive measures, at least one of<br>\nwhich is finite.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hahn_Jordan_Decomposition.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hahn_Jordan_Decomposition.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
