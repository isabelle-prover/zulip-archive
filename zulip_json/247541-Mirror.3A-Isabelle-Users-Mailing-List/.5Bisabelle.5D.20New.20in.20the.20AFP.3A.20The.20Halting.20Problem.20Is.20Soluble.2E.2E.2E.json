Our proof is quite general -- rather than <br>\nassume the full machinery of general relativity, we only assume the existence of <br>\na reachability relation defined on an abstract space of locations. An MH <br>\nspacetime can then be described as a space in which there exists an unboundedly <br>\nlong path together with a location which is reachable from all points on that <br>\npath. Likewise, we use a very general notion of computation - the current state <br>\nof a computation is assumed to be representable as a machine configuration <br>\ncontaining all the information required to determine how the system changes with <br>\nthe execution of each ensuing instruction. The program is deemed to halt if the <br>\nsystem enters a stable configuration. Since this situation is generally <br>\ndetectable by an operating system, we can use its occurrence to trigger events <br>\nthat exploit the nature of MH spacetimes, thereby enabling us to detect whether <br>\nor not halting will eventually have occurred. Our verification follows existing <br>\narguments in the literature, albeit translated into this more general setting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MHComputation.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MHComputation.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/5t_ZnaTeWxenpB8t7W6ISafw/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
