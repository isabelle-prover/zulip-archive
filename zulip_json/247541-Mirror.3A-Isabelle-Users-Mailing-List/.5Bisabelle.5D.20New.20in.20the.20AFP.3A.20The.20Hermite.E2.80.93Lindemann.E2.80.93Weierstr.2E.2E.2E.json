This theorem is one of the crowning achievements of 19th century number theory. … This has a number of direct corollaries, e.g. e, pi and numerous expressions involving transcendental functions are transcendental.</p>\n<p>Manuel remarks that this theorem is “#56 on Freek Wiedijk's list. That puts us on par with HOL Light.”</p>\n<p>You’ll find it online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hermite_Lindemann.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hermite_Lindemann.html</a></p>\n<p>Manuel, many thanks!</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
