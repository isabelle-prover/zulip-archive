Intuitively, the HNP involves<br>\ndemonstrating the existence of an algorithm (the ``adversary'') which can<br>\ncompute (with high probability) a hidden number alpha given access to a<br>\nbit-leaking oracle. Originally developed to establish the security of<br>\nDiffie--Hellman key exchange, the HNP has since been used not only for protocol<br>\nsecurity but also in cryptographic attacks, including notable ones on DSA and<br>\nECDSA. Additionally, the HNP makes use of an instance of Babai's nearest plane<br>\nalgorithm, which solves the approximate closest vector problem. Thus, building<br>\non the LLL algorithm (which has already been formalized), we formalize Babai's<br>\nalgorithm, which itself is of independent interest. Our formalizations of<br>\nBabai's algorithm and the HNP adversary are executable, setting up potential<br>\nfuture work, e.g. in developing formally verified instances of cryptographic<br>\nattacks. Note, our formalization of Babai's algorithm here is an updated version<br>\nof a previous AFP entry of ours. The updates include a tighter error bound,<br>\nwhich is required for our HNP proof.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hidden_Number_Problem.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hidden_Number_Problem.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>\n<p>P.S.: No further announcements from my side for today.</p>",
