The DRUP proof output by <br>\nthe SAT solver is then converted into Lammich's GRAT format and imported into Isabelle/HOL <br>\nwith some custom-written ML code.</p>\n<p>This transformation is proof-producing, so the final Isabelle/HOL theorem does not rely on <br>\nany oracles or other trusted external trusted components.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/PAPP_Impossibility.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/PAPP_Impossibility.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
