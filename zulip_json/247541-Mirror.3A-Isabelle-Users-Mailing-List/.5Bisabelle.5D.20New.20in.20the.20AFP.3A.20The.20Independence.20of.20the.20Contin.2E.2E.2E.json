It is again by Emmanuel Gunther, Miguel Pagano, Pedro Sánchez Terraf and and Matías Steinberg:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We redeveloped our formalization of forcing in the set theory framework of Isabelle/ZF. Under the assumption of the existence of a countable transitive model of ZFC, we construct proper generic extensions that satisfy the Continuum Hypothesis and its negation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A remark for the confused: Isabelle/ZF is a separate instance of Isabelle, which extends Isabelle/FOL (first-order logic) with the Zermelo Frankel axioms, so it is a reasonably orthodox implementation of ZF (and ZFC). It is independent from Isabelle/HOL, with a lot less automation: basic data types, auto, blast but no arithmetic decision procedures, sledgehammer or counterexample finders. So it is a much tougher world to work in than, say, Isabelle/HOL plus the AFP entry ZFC_in_HOL.</p>\n<p>It’s online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Independence_CH.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Independence_CH.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
