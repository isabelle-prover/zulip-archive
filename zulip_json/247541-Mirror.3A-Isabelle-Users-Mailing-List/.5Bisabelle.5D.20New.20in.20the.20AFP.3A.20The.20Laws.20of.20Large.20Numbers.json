The approach used for the proof of the strong law is a particularly quick and slick one based on ergodic theory, which was formalised by GouÃ«zel in another AFP entry.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Laws_of_Large_Numbers.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Laws_of_Large_Numbers.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
