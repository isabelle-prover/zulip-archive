Roots of unity in the complex numbers are <br>\nreplaced by those in a finite field.</p>\n<p>First, we define both NTT and the inverse transform INTT in Isabelle and <br>\nprove them to be mutually inverse.<br>\nDFT can be efficiently computed by the recursive Fast Fourier Transform <br>\n(FFT). In our formalization, this algorithm is adapted to the setting of <br>\nthe NTT: We implement a Fast Number Theoretic Transform (FNTT) based on <br>\nthe Butterfly scheme by Cooley and Tukey. Additionally, we provide an <br>\ninverse transform IFNTT and prove it mutually inverse to FNTT.<br>\nAfterwards, a recursive formalization of the FNTT running time is <br>\nexamined and the famous<br>\nbounds O(n log n) are proven.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Number_Theoretic_Transform.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Number_Theoretic_Transform.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
