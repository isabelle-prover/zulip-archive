Even though some tools are already tackling this issue,<br>\nnone are foundational. We take a first step in this direction and present a<br>\ncomplete formalization of the One-way to Hiding (O2H) Theorem, a central theorem<br>\nfor security proofs against quantum attackers. With this new formalization, we<br>\nbuild more secure foundations for proof-checking tools in the quantum setting.<br>\nUsing the theorem prover Isabelle, we verify the semi-classical O2H Theorem by<br>\nAmbainis, Hamburg and Unruh (Crypto 2019) in different variations. We also give<br>\na novel (and for the formalization simpler) proof to the O2H Theorem for mixed<br>\nstates and extend the theorem to non-terminating adversaries. This work provides<br>\na theoretical and foundational background for several verification tools and for<br>\nsecurity proofs in the quantum setting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Oneway2Hiding.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Oneway2Hiding.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
