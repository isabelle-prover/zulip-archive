After proving positivity,<br>\nstrict monotonicity, C^infinity smoothness, and the limits at plus/minus<br>\ninfinity, we derive a closed-form expression for the n-th derivative using<br>\nStirling numbers of the second kind, following the combinatorial argument of<br>\nMinai and Williams. These results are packaged into a small reusable library of<br>\nlemmas on sigma. Building on this analytic groundwork we mechanise a<br>\nconstructive version of the classical Universal Approximation Theorem: for every<br>\ncontinuous function f : [a,b] -&gt; R and every epsilon &gt; 0 there is a<br>\nsingle‑hidden‑layer neural network with sigmoidal activations whose output is<br>\nwithin epsilon of f everywhere on [a,b]. Our proof follows the method of<br>\nCostarell and Spigler, giving the first fully verified end-to‑end proof of this<br>\ntheorem inside a higher‑order proof assistant.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Sigmoid_Universal_Approximation.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Sigmoid_Universal_Approximation.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
