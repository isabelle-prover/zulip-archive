He defines the sum-of-squares function r_k(n), which counts the number of ways to write a natural number n as a sum of k squares of integers. Signs and permutations of these integers are taken into account. He then formalises the main result: Jacobi's two-square theorem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Sum_Of_Squares_Count.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Sum_Of_Squares_Count.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
