The theory is based on <br>\nthe AFP entry Complex_Bounded_Operators that introduces Hilbert spaces <br>\nand operators and related concepts, but in addition to their work, we <br>\ndefined and study a number of additional concepts needed for the tensor <br>\nproduct. Specifically: Hilbert-Schmidt and trace-class operators; <br>\ncompact operators; positive operators; the weak operator, strong <br>\noperator, and weak^* topology; the spectral theorem for compact <br>\noperators; and the double commutant theorem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hilbert_Space_Tensor_Product.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hilbert_Space_Tensor_Product.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
