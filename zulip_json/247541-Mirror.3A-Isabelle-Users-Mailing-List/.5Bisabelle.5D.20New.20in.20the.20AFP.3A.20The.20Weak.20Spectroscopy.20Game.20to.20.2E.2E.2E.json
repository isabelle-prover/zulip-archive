Unlike the short title suggests, the entry is more computer science than physics. In particular, it is not formalizing a method for detecting oxygen on exoplanets (<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1517\">https://xkcd.com/1517</a>):</p>\n<p>The Weak Spectroscopy Game to Characterize Behavioral Equivalences<br>\nby Lisa A. Barthel, Leonard M. Hübner, Caroline Lemke, Karl P. P. Mattes, Lenard Mollenkopf, and Benjamin Bisping</p>\n<p>We provide an Isabelle/HOL formalization of Bisping and Jansen's weak spectroscopy game (2024), which can be used to simultaneously characterize and decide a hierarchy of behavioral equivalences for systems with internal behavior. This is valuable for applications in concurrency theory and formal verification where equivalences and distinctions of the “linear-time–branching-time spectrum” are a recurring topic.</p>\n<p>This entry contains a game characterization of most behavioral equivalences from stability-respecting branching bisimilarity to weak trace equivalence. Technically, the results link distinguishing sublanguages of Hennessy–Milner logic to winning attacker budgets in an energy game through an eight-dimensional measurement of syntactic features appearing in formulas.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Weak_Spectroscopy.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Weak_Spectroscopy.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
