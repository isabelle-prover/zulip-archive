We also relativize Paulson's work on Aleph and our former treatment of the Axiom of Dependent Choices. This work is a prerrequisite to our formalization of the independence of the Continuum Hypothesis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And I am looking forward to that proof of independence, a result so difficult that some claim it threatened Gödel’s sanity.</p>\n<p>I hope it is not significant that this is article number 666.</p>\n<p>It’s online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Transitive_Models.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Transitive_Models.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
