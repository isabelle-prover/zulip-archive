The theorem is an important result in graph theory and the foundation of<br>\nthe field of extremal graph theory. The formalisation follows Aigner and<br>\nZiegler's presentation in Proofs from THE BOOK of Turán's initial proof. Besides<br>\na direct adaptation of the textbook proof, a simplified, second proof is<br>\npresented which decreases the size of the formalised proof significantly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Turans_Graph_Theorem.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Turans_Graph_Theorem.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
