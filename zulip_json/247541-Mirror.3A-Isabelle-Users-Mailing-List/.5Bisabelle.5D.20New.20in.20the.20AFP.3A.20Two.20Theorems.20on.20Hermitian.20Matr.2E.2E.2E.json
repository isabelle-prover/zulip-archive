First, Sylvester's criterion: a Hermitian matrix is positive definite if and only if all its leading principal submatrices have positive determinant. Second, Cauchy's eigenvalue interlacing theorem: given a principal submatrix B of a Hermitian matrix A, the eigenvalues of B interlace those of A. Our approach to Sylvester's criterion is fairly standard, and required us to formalize Schur's block matrix determinant formula, which gives a formula for the determinant of a block matrix (A,B,C,D) when A is invertible. Our approach to Cauchy's eigenvalue interlacing theorem follows a proof given in a set of lecture notes by Dr. David Bindel. This approach involved formalizing the Courant-Fischer minimax theorem (a theorem about the Rayleigh quotient, which we define in this entry). In our statement of the Courant-Fischer minimax theorem, we refer to the infimum and supremum instead of the minimum and maximum, as this simplifies the proof and is sufficient to prove Cauchy's eigenvalue interlacing theorem.</p>\n<p>Now online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Two_Hermitian_Results.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Two_Hermitian_Results.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
