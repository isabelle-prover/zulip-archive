To do this, we also formalize some <br>\nfacts about the modulo operation with symmetric range. Our implementations are based on <br>\nthe original papers, but are otherwise efficient. For basis reduction we formalize two <br>\nversions: one that includes all of the optimizations/heuristics from Storjohann's paper, <br>\nand one excluding a heuristic that we observed to often decrease efficiency. We also <br>\nprovide a fast, self-contained certifier for basis reduction, based on the efficient <br>\nHermite normal form algorithm.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Modular_arithmetic_LLL_and_HNF_algorithms.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Modular_arithmetic_LLL_and_HNF_algorithms.html</a></p>\n<p>Andreas</p>",
