The connection with standard metric spaces is obtained through a subclass relationship, and fundamental properties of ultrametric spaces are formally established.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Elementary_Ultrametric_Spaces.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Elementary_Ultrametric_Spaces.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
