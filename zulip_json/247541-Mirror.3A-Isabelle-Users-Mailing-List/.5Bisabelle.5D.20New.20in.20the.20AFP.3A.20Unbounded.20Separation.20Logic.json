Fractional permissions extend to <br>\ncomposite assertions such as (co)inductive predicates and magic wands by <br>\nallowing those to be multiplied by a fraction. Typical separation logic proofs <br>\nrequire that this multiplication has three key properties: it needs to <br>\ndistribute over assertions, it should permit fractions to be factored out from <br>\nassertions, and two fractions of the same assertion should be combinable into <br>\none larger fraction. Existing formal semantics incorporating fractional <br>\nassertions into a separation logic define multiplication semantically (via <br>\nmodels), resulting in a semantics in which distributivity and combinability do <br>\nnot hold for key resource assertions such as magic wands, and fractions cannot <br>\nbe factored out from a separating conjunction. By contrast, existing automatic <br>\nseparation logic verifiers define multiplication syntactically, resulting in a <br>\ndifferent semantics for which it is unknown whether distributivity and <br>\ncombinability hold for all assertions. In this entry (which accompanies an <br>\nOOPSLA'22 paper), we present and formalize an unbounded version of separation <br>\nlogic, a novel semantics for separation logic assertions that allows states to <br>\nhold more than a full permission to a heap location during the evaluation of an <br>\nassertion. By reimposing upper bounds on the permissions held per location at <br>\nstatement boundaries, we retain key properties of separation logic, in <br>\nparticular, we prove that the frame rule still holds. We also prove that our <br>\nassertion semantics unifies semantic and syntactic multiplication and thereby <br>\nreconciles the discrepancy between separation logic theory and tools and enjoys <br>\ndistributivity, factorisability, and combinability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Separation_Logic_Unbounded.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Separation_Logic_Unbounded.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/j5cgZybZU8DwfxrJ8YPWxeNm/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
