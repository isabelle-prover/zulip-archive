Existing Isabelle libraries still lack a foundational framework for unconstrained optimization. We close this gap with a comprehensive Isabelle/HOL development that formalizes:<br>\n• minimizers, strict and isolated local minimizers;<br>\n• first- and second-order optimality conditions for scalar real-valued functions;<br>\n• first-order optimality conditions for vector-valued functions; and<br>\n• a worked example.<br>\nThe new session provides sound, reusable foundations for future proof-checking tools and mechanized research in optimization, analysis, and algorithmic correctness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Unconstrained_Optimization.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Unconstrained_Optimization.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
