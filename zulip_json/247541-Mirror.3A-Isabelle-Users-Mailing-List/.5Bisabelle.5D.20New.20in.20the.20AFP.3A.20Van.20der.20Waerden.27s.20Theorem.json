Van der Waerden's Theorem states that for integers k and l there exists a number N which guarantees that if an integer interval of length at least N is coloured with k colours, there will always be an arithmetic progression of length l of the same colour in said interval. The proof goes along the lines of Swan. The smallest number N[k,l] fulfilling Van der Waerden's Theorem is then called the Van der Waerden Number. Finding the Van der Waerden Number is still an open problem for most values of k and l.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s another contribution to our collection of results on Ramsey theory.</p>\n<p>And here’s a New Yorker article on Frank Ramsey, who died over 90 years ago at the age of 26: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/04/the-man-who-thought-too-fast\">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/04/the-man-who-thought-too-fast</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
