The main idea is based on a probabilistic invariant that <br>\nallows us to derive concentration bounds using the Cram√©r-Chernoff method.</p>\n<p>This new technique opens up the possible algorithm design space, and we <br>\nintroduce a new variant of the CVM algorithm, that is total, and also has an <br>\nadditional property in addition to concentration: unbiasedness. This means the <br>\nexpected result of the algorithm is exactly equal to the desired result. The <br>\nlatter is also a new property, that neither the original CVM algorithm nor <br>\nclassic algorithms for the distinct elements problem possess.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CVM_Distinct_Elements.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CVM_Distinct_Elements.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/TnlR-4ju-zNd2BW0go66R9d9/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
