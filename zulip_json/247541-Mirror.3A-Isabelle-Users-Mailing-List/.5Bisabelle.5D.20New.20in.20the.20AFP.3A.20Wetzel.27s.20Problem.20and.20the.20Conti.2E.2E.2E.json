The <br>\nanswer is yes if the Continuum Hypothesis is false, i.e., if the cardinality of <br>\nR exceeds Aleph_1. But if CH is true then such an F, of cardinality Aleph_1, can <br>\nbe constructed by transfinite recursion. The formal proof illustrates reasoning <br>\nabout complex analysis (analytic and homomorphic functions) and set theory <br>\n(transfinite cardinalities) in a single setting. The mathematical text comes <br>\nfrom Proofs from THE BOOK by Aigner and Ziegler.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Wetzels_Problem.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Wetzels_Problem.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/pwFCA_IuHkB72rJLO1oAAUO1/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
