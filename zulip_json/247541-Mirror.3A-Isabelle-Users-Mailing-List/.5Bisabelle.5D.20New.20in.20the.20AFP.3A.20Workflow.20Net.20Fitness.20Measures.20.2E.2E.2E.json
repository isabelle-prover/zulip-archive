It then defines measures for<br>\nthe fitness of these nets, namely trace fitness and causal footprint fitness.<br>\nThese attempt to measure how well a model covers all of the traces in an event<br>\nlog (a multiset of traces, which have happened in the business). Most fitness<br>\nmeasures are far from perfect and a number of attributes have been defined in<br>\nliterature. The main goal of this entry is to formalize proofs for some of these<br>\nattributes of fitness measures and learning how to correctly define the measures<br>\nand attributes along the way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Workflow_Net_Fitness_Measures.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Workflow_Net_Fitness_Measures.html</a></p>",
