We construct the Z metalanguage and type universe on top of HOL, and link this to corresponding concrete types (finite functions, lists etc.) in Isabelle, to enable efficient proof automation. We then utilise coercive subtyping and overloading to support processing of Z-like expressions in Isabelle/HOL. We then use this to develop the mathematical toolkit for sets, relations, functions, and sequences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org//entries/Z_Toolkit.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org//entries/Z_Toolkit.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
