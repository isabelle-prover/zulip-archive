Pólya claims that this proof came to him in a dream, and that it was “the best mathematics he had ever dreamt.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Weighted_Arithmetic_Geometric_Mean.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Weighted_Arithmetic_Geometric_Mean.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
