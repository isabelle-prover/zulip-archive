Basic <br>\nfacts about p-adic topology including Hensel's Lemma are proved, <br>\nbuilding on a prior submission by the author. The theory of <br>\nsemialgebraic sets and semialgebraic functions on cartesian powers of <br>\np-adic fields is also developed, following a formalization of these <br>\nconcepts due to Denef. This is done towards a formalization of Denef's <br>\nproof of Macintyre's quantifier elimination theorem for p-adic fields. <br>\nTheories developing general multivariable polynomial rings over a <br>\ncommutative ring are developed, as well as some general theory of <br>\ncartesian powers of an arbitrary ring.</p>\n<p>Enjoy,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
