Our current formalization is <br>\nbased on the first author's bachelor's thesis.</p>\n<p>First, we prove correct a functional implementation, w.r.t. an abstract data <br>\ntype for sets. Apart from functional correctness, we show a resource bound, and <br>\nruntime bounds w.r.t. manually defined timing functions for the operations.</p>\n<p>Next, we refine the operations to Imperative HOL with time, and show correctness <br>\nand complexity. This yields a practically more efficient implementation, and <br>\neliminates the manually defined timing functions from the trusted base of the proof.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Van_Emde_Boas_Trees.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Van_Emde_Boas_Trees.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/NJVPnd-D81TDSIWDNzdHsZB1/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
