We propose algebras that describe iteration for <br>\nstrict and non-strict computations. They unify computation models which differ <br>\nin the fixpoints used to represent iteration. We propose algebras that describe <br>\nthe infinite executions of a computation. They lead to a unified approximation <br>\norder and results that connect fixpoints in the approximation and refinement <br>\norders. This unifies the semantics of recursion for a range of computation <br>\nmodels. We propose algebras that describe preconditions and the effect of <br>\nwhile-programs under postconditions. They unify correctness statements in two <br>\ndimensions: one statement applies in various computation models to various <br>\ncorrectness claims.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Correctness_Algebras.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Correctness_Algebras.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/jEAEQ7i5UryX08iArky6tvoy/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
