Paulson</p>\n<p>The sequence F_n of Farey fractions of order n has the form ... where the <br>\nfractions appear in numerical order and have denominators at most n. The <br>\ntransformation from F_n to F_{n+1} can be effected by combining adjacent <br>\nelements of the sequence F_n, using an operation called the mediant. Adjacent <br>\n(reduced) fractions a/b &lt; c/d satisfy the unimodular relation and their mediant <br>\nis (a+c)/(b+d). A Ford circle is specified by a rational number, and interesting <br>\nconsequences follow in the case of Ford circles obtained from some Farey <br>\nsequence F_n. The formalised material is drawn from Apostol's Modular Functions <br>\nand Dirichlet Series in Number Theory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Farey_Sequences.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Farey_Sequences.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/U-70P-TXu7EYaZ427E_8Z0Bp/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
