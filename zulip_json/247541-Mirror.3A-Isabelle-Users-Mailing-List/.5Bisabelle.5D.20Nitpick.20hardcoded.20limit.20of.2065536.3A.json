This means we're searching for an element (a filter) in a space with $2^4=16$ elements.  There are $65536=2^16=2^{2^4}$ such spaces.  I don't see how to make the problem smaller so it'll fit into Nitpick as it stands, because $2^{2^4}=65536$ is inherent the number of possibilities involved.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Founded in 1821, Heriot-Watt is a leader in ideas and solutions.

Not only it hits a technical limit imposed by its backend, Kodkod, problems of this size even if they were accepted by Nitpick would be much too big to be solvable.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nJasmin</p>",
