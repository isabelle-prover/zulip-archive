This posting provides a bit more information.)</p>\n<p>At AWS re:Invent 2025 in Las Vegas, we announced the AWS Nitro Isolation<br>\nEngine [1, 2, 3], a formally verified enhancement to the AWS Nitro System<br>\nthat enforces isolation between virtual machines hosted on AWS's new<br>\nGraviton5-based EC2 instances.</p>\n<p>Nitro Isolation Engine represents a significant deployment of mechanized<br>\nproof in production infrastructure, and we therefore wanted to bring this<br>\nto the attention of the formal methods and programming languages<br>\ncommunities. This work builds directly on decades of advances in<br>\ninteractive theorem proving, program verification, and programming<br>\nlanguages theory, alongside landmark projects—such as, seL4 [4], CertiKOS<br>\n[5], SeKVM [6], and many others—that were inspirations for this work.<br>\nWhat is Nitro Isolation Engine?</p>\n<p>Nitro Isolation Engine is a small, trusted computing base written in Rust<br>\nthat sits beneath the AWS Nitro Hypervisor, providing a security isolation<br>\nboundary between the hypervisor and guest virtual machines, and between<br>\nco-tenanted guest virtual machines. The Nitro Isolation Engine controls the<br>\ncritical hardware features required for isolating customer workloads,<br>\nprimarily control of Stage Two translation tables.<br>\nThe verification effort</p>\n<p>Nitro Isolation Engine was designed with verification in mind from the<br>\nfirst line of code. Nitro Isolation Engine is subject to AWS’s existing<br>\nrigorous engineering practices, including the deployment of<br>\nproperty-based-testing and lightweight formal methods, for example the Kani<br>\nbounded model checker for Rust [7].</p>\n<p>Building atop this foundation, we have specified and verified the<br>\ncorrectness of Nitro Isolation Engine in Isabelle/HOL [8]. Our model and<br>\nproofs consist of around 260,000 lines of machine-checked models and<br>\nproofs. Specifically, we have proved:</p>\n<p>- *Functional correctness: *Nitro Isolation Engine behaves as specified<br>\n   for all operations: virtual machine creation, memory mapping, instruction<br>\n   and data abort handling, and so on. As corollaries of our total<br>\n   verification style, we have also proven memory-safety, termination, and<br>\n   absence of runtime errors, providing our modelling assumptions are accurate.</p>\n<p>- <em>Confidentiality</em>: We prove a noninterference-style property<br>\n   demonstrating the confidentiality of guest virtual machine states,<br>\n   formalized as indistinguishability preservation up-to permitted flows of<br>\n   declassified information out of a guest.</p>\n<p>- <em>Integrity</em>: The integrity of guest virtual machine state is<br>\n   formalized as a safety property, showing that the private state of one<br>\n   virtual machine is unaffected by operations modifying another distinct<br>\n   virtual machine.</p>\n<p>In addition, we have applied Iris [9] and Verus [10] to prove the<br>\ncorrectness of the Nitro Isolation Engine’s concurrency primitives,<br>\nincluding ticket locks, mutexes, and rendezvous barriers.</p>\n<p>For functional verification, we defined μRust, a restricted subset of Rust<br>\nexpressive enough to write Nitro Isolation Engine but amenable to formal<br>\nreasoning and embedded its semantics into Isabelle/HOL. Specifications are<br>\nwritten in separation logic, and proofs proceed via weakest precondition<br>\ncalculus with custom automation. We have made our verification<br>\ninfrastructure open source as the AutoCorrode library [11] for<br>\nIsabelle/HOL, which may be of independent interest.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nAutomated Reasoning Group, AWS</p>\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-graviton-5-cpu-amazon-ec2\">https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-graviton-5-cpu-amazon-ec2</a><br>\n[2] : <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gt-30Fm38U\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gt-30Fm38U</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gt-30Fm38U\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gt-30Fm38U</a><br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gt-30Fm38U\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gt-30Fm38U</a>&gt;<br>\n[3]: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0P55gHhG4g\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0P55gHhG4g</a><br>\n[4]: <a href=\"https://sel4.systems/\">https://sel4.systems/</a><br>\n[5]: <a href=\"https://flint.cs.yale.edu/certikos/\">https://flint.cs.yale.edu/certikos/</a><br>\n[6]:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/li-shih-wei\">https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/li-shih-wei</a><br>\n[7]: <a href=\"https://github.com/model-checking/kani\">https://github.com/model-checking/kani</a><br>\n[8]: <a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/</a><br>\n[9]: <a href=\"https://iris-project.org/\">https://iris-project.org/</a><br>\n[10]: <a href=\"https://github.com/verus-lang/verus\">https://github.com/verus-lang/verus</a><br>\n[11]: <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/AutoCorrode\">https://github.com/awslabs/AutoCorrode</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"3Gt-30Fm38U\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gt-30Fm38U\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/c2a673a4ef421b446045799706a479eee3883345/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f3347742d3330466d3338552f6d7164656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div><div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"b0P55gHhG4g\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0P55gHhG4g\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/349ce8413fbbc521008106a118bd7fd73ec38614/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f62305035356748684734672f6d7164656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
