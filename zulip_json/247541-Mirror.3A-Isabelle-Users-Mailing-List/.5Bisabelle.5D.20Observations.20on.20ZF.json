I hope they are of some use to make <br>\nthe sources more coherent, especially since we are getting closer to RCs <br>\nseason.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>ZF</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is a duplicate hypothesis in \"InfCard_csquare_eq\".</li>\n<li>\n<p>The names \"lepoll_imp_Card_le\" and \"well_ord_lepoll_imp_Card_le\"<br>\n    seem to be a slight typo, since the relevant term is \"cardinal\", not<br>\n    \"Card\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I noted that the precedence of some binders that output a set (big<br>\n    union \"UN\", big intersection \"INT\" and \"Lamda\") is too low to work<br>\n    well with equality (for instance,<br>\n    \"Z=⋃i∈J. X(i)\"<br>\n    does not parse).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Very early in the development, some alternative names were set for<br>\n    the definitions of some terms (notably \"The\", \"Image\", \"If\", which<br>\n    are called \"the_def\", \"image_def\", \"if_def\", resp., instead of the<br>\n    default capitalized versions). This is a bit misleading. The<br>\n    associated lemmas are also stated in lower case.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p><em>ZF-Constructible</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A better name for \"separation_closed\" would be \"Collect_closed\" (as<br>\n    other similar closure lemmas; in this case, it states that the model<br>\n    M is closed under the term \"Collect\").</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two nameless lemmas in ZF-Constructible.Formula are declared [simp].<br>\n    Appropriate names could be \"sats_Member_iff\" and \"sats_Equal_iff\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the same spirit, I would suggest \"obase_exists\" --&gt;<br>\n    \"obase_closed\" in theory Rank. In the same file, some text comments<br>\n    refer to undefined terms \"oB\" and \"om\" that might be \"obase\" and<br>\n    \"omap\", instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One of the main results in Rank.thy (right after well_ord_abs) does<br>\n    not have a name. It is not quite an \"ordertype_abs\", because it<br>\n    doesn't relate the absolute and relative versions of that concept. A<br>\n    possible name follows from the text comments right before its<br>\n    statement: \"ordertypes_are_absolute\". (Incidentally, I have a proof<br>\n    of a proper \"ordertype_abs\", but it is not in good shape right now.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"pred_set_abs\" in ZF-Constructible.Wellorderings holds in the weaker<br>\n    locale M_trans.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The theorem name \"L_axioms.range_type\" clashes with a similar<br>\n    \"func.range_type\". Perhaps it would be better to have<br>\n    \"L_axioms.range_fm_type\" (since we are typing the term \"range_fm\").<br>\n    However, there are great many theorems that seem to follow the same<br>\n    naming convention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perhaps there is a better name for \"Relative.M_trans.nonempty\" (like<br>\n    \"M_zero\" or \"zero_into_M\").</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>I'm including a patch (output of \"hg diff\") with most of the suggested <br>\nchanges, except the last items in each list (applying them would have <br>\nglobal consequences in both sessions). The changes seem not to affect <br>\nany theory below ZF (builds are all successful).</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>PST.-<br>\n<a href=\"http://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/home_en\">cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/home_en</a> <br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/home_en.html\">https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/home_en.html</a>&gt;<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/5ueJ23SAxjMb3FGNzLsHS0ng/patch\">patch</a></p>",

I’m always glad to hear about duplicate and unnecessary hypotheses, and these days we certainly frown upon nameless top-level theorems. On the other hand, it’s well-established in Isabelle that all variable binding constructions should be explicitly bracketed. I will take a look at the other suggestions too. Many thanks again for your interest in Isabelle/ZF!</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
