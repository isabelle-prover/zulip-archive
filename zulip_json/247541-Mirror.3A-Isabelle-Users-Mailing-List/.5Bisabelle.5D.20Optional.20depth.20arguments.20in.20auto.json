I have a proof where auto does not work but (auto 5 2) works.

But note that 4 3 is the far more popular alternative than 5 2. ;) Still given that there are around 300 000 invocations of auto in the AFP, either is still an outlier. I’m sure that changing the default will create more problems than it will solve.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDmitriy</p>\n<p>1 auto 1 3<br>\n   1 auto 1 4<br>\n   1 auto 11 0<br>\n   1 auto 2 0<br>\n   1 auto 2 1<br>\n   1 auto 2 4<br>\n   1 auto 3 3<br>\n   1 auto 4 10<br>\n   1 auto 6 5<br>\n   1 auto 7 0<br>\n   1 auto 7 2<br>\n   1 auto 9 2<br>\n   1 auto 9 3<br>\n   2 auto 10 10<br>\n   2 auto 2 3<br>\n   2 auto 3 0<br>\n   2 auto 4 7<br>\n   2 auto 5 3<br>\n   2 auto 5 4<br>\n   2 auto 5 5<br>\n   2 auto 9 0<br>\n   3 auto 5 0<br>\n   3 auto 6 4<br>\n   3 auto 6 6<br>\n   4 auto 0 2<br>\n   4 auto 13 2<br>\n   4 auto 6 2<br>\n   4 auto 8 0<br>\n   5 auto 0 6<br>\n   5 auto 4 0<br>\n   6 auto 0 1<br>\n   6 auto 6 0<br>\n   7 auto 0 5<br>\n   7 auto 10 0<br>\n   7 auto 4 6<br>\n   8 auto 5 2<br>\n  13 auto 4 5<br>\n  17 auto 0 0<br>\n  62 auto 3 4<br>\n  80 auto 0 4<br>\n 131 auto 0 3<br>\n 219 auto 4 4<br>\n 325 auto 4 3</p>",

The numeric arguments control the search depth of auto's standard proof search and the search depth of blast as called at each step. I forget which is which. It's no surprise that turning the numbers up from 4 to 5 finds a new proof, that just means that the necessary proof is exactly 5 steps long in some eccentric sense.</p>\n<p>Setting the default higher would make auto take longer to terminate when it isn't making progress, and many proofs do actually use auto in this way. The branching factor of the search is variable, so the effect of changing the limits might be quite different from place to place. It would also break some existing proofs for silly reasons. That's probably not a good option.</p>\n<p>There's a bigger question floating around, is there some way to add more information to the interface? Is there some reasonable time to tell the user \"by the way, the auto you just typed would make more progress if given a longer leash\"?</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\n    Thomas.</p>",

It’s chiefly intended for exploration. With the trivial proofs disposed of, you can focus on the difficult proofs. Then ideally you should restructure your proof with the difficult parts proved first so that auto leaves nothing behind. Making auto work harder and for longer would defeat its main purpose, and we have other tactics such as force that might do what you need.</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
