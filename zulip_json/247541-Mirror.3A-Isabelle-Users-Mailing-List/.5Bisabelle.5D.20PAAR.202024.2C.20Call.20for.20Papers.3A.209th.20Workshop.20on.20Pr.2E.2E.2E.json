PAAR is the workshop on turning this theory into<br>\npractice: how can automated reasoning tools be built that work and are<br>\nuseful in applications? PAAR covers all aspects of this challenge:<br>\nwhich theories, logics, or fragments are well-behaved in practice, and<br>\nconnect well to application domains? which reasoning tasks are<br>\ntractable and useful? which algorithms are able to solve real-world<br>\ninstances? how should automated reasoning tools be designed,<br>\nimplemented, tested, and evaluated?</p>\n<p>The goal of PAAR is to bring together theoreticians, tool developers,<br>\nand users, to concentrate on the practical aspects of automated<br>\nreasoning. The workshop welcomes high-quality contributions of any<br>\nkind, including new research results, presentation of work in<br>\nprogress, presentation of new tools, new implementation techniques,<br>\nnew application domains, or case studies.</p>\n<p>Submission Guidelines</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either an<br>\nextended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15 pages), <br>\nexcluding<br>\nreferences, via EasyChair at <br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=paar2024\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=paar2024</a>.<br>\nSubmissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will select <br>\na balanced<br>\nprogram of high-quality contributions.
