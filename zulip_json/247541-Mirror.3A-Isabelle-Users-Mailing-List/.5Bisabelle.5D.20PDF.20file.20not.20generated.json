I could build a session<br>\nwith option <code>document=pdf</code> and get the PDF file in the <code>browser_info</code><br>\ndirectory.</p>\n<p>Now I use Isabelle2021, and I don’t get the PDF file anymore. Isabelle<br>\nshows me “Preparing ⟨session-name⟩/document ...”, but I cannot find the<br>\nPDF file anywhere. The <code>browser_info</code> directory is completely absent,<br>\nand searching my entire home directory for files with modification time<br>\nduring the last 24 hours and name ending in <code>.pdf</code> doesn’t reveal<br>\nanything.</p>\n<p>Any ideas how I can get the PDF output?</p>\n<p>All the best,<br>\nWolfgang</p>",

In fact, my understanding is that<br>\n<code>document_output</code> is precisely for placing the PDF file in a location<br>\nother than the standard one.</p>\n<p>That said, I meanwhile found out with the help of the people on Zulip<br>\nthat the <code>-P</code> command line option can be used to get a PDF file. When<br>\nused with <code>:</code>, that is, when saying <code>-P :</code>, the PDF file will be placed<br>\nin the standard location.</p>\n<p>I have no idea why the <code>-P</code> option is necessary and what its exact<br>\nmeaning is (the documentation says that it “enables” a directory). My<br>\nunderstanding was that the <code>document</code> option is used for switching on or<br>\noff document generation and the <code>document_output</code> option is used for<br>\nselecting a destination. The <code>-P</code> command line option looks to me a bit<br>\nlike a combination of both, but why should such a combination be<br>\nnecessary? Maybe somebody can clarify.</p>\n<p>All the best,<br>\nWolfgang</p>",
