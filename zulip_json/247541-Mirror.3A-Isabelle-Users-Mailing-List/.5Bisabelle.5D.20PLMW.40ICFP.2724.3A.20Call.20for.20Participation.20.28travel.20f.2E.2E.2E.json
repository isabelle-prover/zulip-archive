This workshop will bring together world leaders in programming<br>\nlanguages research and teaching from academia and industry to help students<br>\nimagine how they might contribute to our research community. Topics will<br>\nrange from the abstract (e.g., what is PL research and how does one become<br>\ninvolved in it) to the concrete (e.g., how to navigate an academic<br>\nconference, how to pick a research area) as well as technical talks on<br>\ncutting-edge topics.</p>\n<p>We especially encourage women and underrepresented minority students, and<br>\npeople with disabilities to attend PLMW.</p>\n<p>This workshop is part of the activities surrounding ICFP, and takes place<br>\nthe day before the main conference. One goal of the workshop is to make the<br>\nICFP conference more accessible to newcomers. We hope that participants<br>\nwill stay through the entire conference.</p>\n<p>Note that ICFP and PLMW are planned to be largely in-person events. While<br>\nwe recognize that travel to conferences is not easy for everyone, we do<br>\nhope you will be able to join us in person to get the most out of the<br>\nconference and its community-building aspects.</p>\n<p>A number of sponsors have generously donated scholarship funds for<br>\nqualified students to attend PLMW. These scholarships can cover expenses<br>\n(airfare, hotel, and registration fees) for attendance at both the workshop<br>\nand the ICFP conference.</p>\n<p>Students attending this year will get one year free student membership of<br>\nSIGPLAN, unless they prefer to opt out during their application.</p>\n<p>The workshop registration is open to all. Students with alternative sources<br>\nof funding are welcome as well.</p>\n<p>â€”--------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>APPLICATION FOR PLMW TRAVEL FUNDING</p>\n<p>For full consideration for scholarship funding, please apply at the link<br>\nbelow by June 21, AoE.
