The student volunteer program is a chance for students from around the world to participate in the conferences whilst assisting us in preparing and running the event.</p>\n<p>The Student Volunteer Program helps more students attend the POPL conference by covering registration to the conferences, tutorials, workshops, and all associated events (but not travel or lodging expenses). In exchange for a fixed number of work hours (usually ~15) helping with the conference organization, you will be able to closely interact with researchers, mentors, and other students at POPL 2024. We are looking forward to seeing you in the SV team!</p>\n<p>Eligibility</p>\n<p>Applicants can be undergraduate, Master’s, Ph.D. full- or part-time students, of computer science or related fields, with or without previous experience as volunteers. Everyone is encouraged to apply!</p>\n<p>Duration</p>\n<p>Applicants must be available for at least four (4) full days between the 14th and 20th of January 2024, and will be expected to provide at least 15 hours of volunteering work in that time. Volunteers will also be expected to be available for some amount of pre-conference discussion and training if necessary.</p>\n<p>Compensation</p>\n<p>Every student volunteer will receive:</p>\n<p>*   A complimentary conference registration, offering access to all open sessions.<br>\n(i.e., parallel paper presentations, demonstrations, and workshops) and conference proceedings.</p>\n<p>*   Free lunches and refreshments during breaks.<br>\n  *   Student volunteer garments.<br>\n  *   Free admission to all social events.</p>\n<p>Please note that Student Volunteers are responsible for their own travel and accommodation arrangements. However, Student Volunteers can apply for extra funding from SIGPLAN PAC funding or PLMW when eligible.</p>\n<p>You can send questions about student volunteering to sbarke@ucsd.edu&lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:sbarke@ucsd.edu\">sbarke@ucsd.edu</a>&gt; and s.ayoun17@imperial.ac.uk&lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:s.ayoun17@imperial.ac.uk\">s.ayoun17@imperial.ac.uk</a>&gt;.</p>\n<p>PS: It’s dangerous to go alone, take some (mildly-disturbing-if-you-zoom)<br>\nAI-generated art with you<br>\n[cid:image001.png@01D9FEBB.9321B6E0]</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/nwWLAPBw5Cl1Cy4Nh1jBHL8-/image001.png\">image001.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/nwWLAPBw5Cl1Cy4Nh1jBHL8-/image001.png\" title=\"image001.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/nwWLAPBw5Cl1Cy4Nh1jBHL8-/image001.png\"></a></div>",
