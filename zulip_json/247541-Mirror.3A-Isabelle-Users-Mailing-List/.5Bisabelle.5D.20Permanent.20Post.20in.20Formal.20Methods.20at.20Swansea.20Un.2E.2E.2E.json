The focus <br>\nof the post is to drive forward applied formal methods research addressing the <br>\nquestion of how to rise formal methods to mature applicability in software <br>\ndevelopment processes.</p>\n<p>In Swansea, we have a very active Railway Verification Group with an excellent, <br>\nlong-standing collaboration with Siemens Mobility, which the successful <br>\ncandidate could join. The department boasts one of the UK’s largest groups in <br>\nlogic and theoretical computer science. Furthermore, there is a newly founded, <br>\nactive group on cyber-security. Overall, the department offers a vibrant <br>\nresearch environment, also with experts in AI, HCI, Robotics, and Visual Computing.<br>\nLinks:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/research-and-impact/swansea-railway-verification/\">https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/research-and-impact/swansea-railway-verification/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/research-and-impact/theoretical-computer-science/\">https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/research-and-impact/theoretical-computer-science/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/research-and-impact/\">https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/research-and-impact/</a></p>\n<p>With kind regards,<br>\n    Monika<br>\nDr Monika Seisenberger<br>\nDeputy Head of Computer Science<br>\nSchool of Mathematics and Computer Science<br>\nSwansea University<br>\nFor informal requests you can contact <a href=\"mailto:M.Seisenberger@swansea.ac.uk\">M.Seisenberger@swansea.ac.uk</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/mD6SHnwww-ckauwscPeYlAzI/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
