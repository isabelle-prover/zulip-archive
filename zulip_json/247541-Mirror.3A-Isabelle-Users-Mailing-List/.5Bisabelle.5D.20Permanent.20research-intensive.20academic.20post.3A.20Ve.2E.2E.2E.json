In RCUK’s recent Grand Challenges Scheme:<br>\nTrustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS),<br>\nour academics form core teams in 2 out of 7 TAS nodes (each node is<br>\nsupported by a £3M research grant). The two nodes<br>\nstand for “Trust” and “Governance” in Autonomous Systems.   Our grant<br>\nfunding in this area has also grown through being<br>\nawarded, jointly with the School Of Engineering at HWU an EPSRC Industrial<br>\nStrategy Challenge Strategy Fund for<br>\nthe Robotics Hub for Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets (ORCA)<br>\nworth £14.6M, which is one of the largest<br>\nindustrial strategy challenge funds awards in Scotland.</p>\n<p>The department has strong collaboration with Industry. Since 2014, we have<br>\nundertaken 107 projects with industrial partners,<br>\nthrough our doctoral training centers (40 industrial partners), the ORCA<br>\nhub (30 industrial partners), and the TAS nodes.<br>\nAmong our collaborators are Amazon Research, BP, Chevron, FiveAI, Horiba<br>\nMira, Imandra, Kawasaki, Kuka Robotics,<br>\nLloyds, Schlumberger, and many others.</p>\n<p>The School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences has an Athena SWAN Bronze<br>\nAward and is committed to an equality charter,<br>\nwhich includes having a diverse and inclusive workforce, and to offering<br>\nequality of opportunity to all<br>\n(see<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.hw.ac.uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences/about/athena-swan.htm\">https://www.hw.ac.uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences/about/athena-swan.htm</a><br>\n).<br>\nWe particularly encourage applications from women, and we welcome requests<br>\nfor flexible working arrangements and<br>\nendeavour to accommodate them, whenever possible.</p>\n<p>For further information about this position, please consult the university<br>\njob portal<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://enzj.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX/job/1658/?utm_medium=jobshare\">https://enzj.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX/job/1658/?utm_medium=jobshare</a>&gt;<br>\n.<br>\nFor informal discussions about the position or the department of Computer<br>\nScience please contact<br>\nProf. Ekaterina Komendantskaya (Head of Computer Science) at <a href=\"mailto:ek19@hw.ac.uk\">ek19@hw.ac.uk</a></p>",
