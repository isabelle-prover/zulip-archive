Brucker\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:adbrucker@0x5f.org\">adbrucker@0x5f.org</a>&gt;<br>\nWe have an exciting funded opportunity for a PhD on developing \"Verification Environment for Distributed Systems Implemented in Go\". The main objectives are to define a formal semantics of Go and its CSP-inspired concurrency model in an interactive theorem prover (e.g., Isabelle/HOL) as well as developing a calculus for program verification. This is a unique opportunity to work in the intersection of theory and application and while doing so, contributing to improving the state of the art in software correctness and security. </p>\n<p>A detailed description of the PhD proposal is available at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.exeter.ac.uk/v8media/recruitmentsites/documents/A_Verification_Environment_for_Distributed_Systems_Implemented_in_Go_EPSRC_DLA_Project_September_2025_Entry.pdf\">https://www.exeter.ac.uk/v8media/recruitmentsites/documents/A_Verification_Environment_for_Distributed_Systems_Implemented_in_Go_EPSRC_DLA_Project_September_2025_Entry.pdf</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Information about the funding and application process is available at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/funding/award/?id=5477\">https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/funding/award/?id=5477</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Application deadline is the midnight GMT on 10th of February 2025.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to me, if you have any questions. </p>\n<p>Best,<br>\n    Achim </p>\n<p>-- <br>\nProf. Achim Brucker | Chair in Cybersecurity &amp; Head of Group | University of Exeter<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.brucker.ch\">https://www.brucker.ch</a> | <a href=\"https://logicalhacking.com/blog\">https://logicalhacking.com/blog</a><br>\n                         @adbrucker | @logicalhacking</p>",
