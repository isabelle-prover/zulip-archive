At my new affiliation, the University of Copenhagen, I am looking to fill two PhD positions and a Postdoc position from early 2021 on the following topics:</p>\n<p>[PhD1] Explanations of runtime monitoring verdicts <a href=\"https://employment.ku.dk/phd/?show=152745\">https://employment.ku.dk/phd/?show=152745</a><br>\n[PhD2] Formal verification of data stream processing <a href=\"https://employment.ku.dk/phd/?show=152743\">https://employment.ku.dk/phd/?show=152743</a><br>\n[Postdoc] Formal verification of runtime monitoring <a href=\"https://employment.ku.dk/faculty/?show=152776\">https://employment.ku.dk/faculty/?show=152776</a></p>\n<p>The positions are funded by a grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation. Especially for the latter two topics, experience with Isabelle is a big plus. The above links provide more details and instructions on how to apply. Feel free to contact me, if you are interested or know suitable candidates.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDmitriy</p>",
