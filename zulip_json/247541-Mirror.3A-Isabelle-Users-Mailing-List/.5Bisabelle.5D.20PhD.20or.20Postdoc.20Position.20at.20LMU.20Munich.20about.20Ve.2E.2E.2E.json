Model theory for modal logics is<br>\nconcerned with the interplay between the language (syntax, i.e., the<br>\nset of its formulas) and its meaning (semantics, i.e., the structures<br>\nover which the language is interpreted). There are, however, different<br>\nways of characterizing meaning for modal sentences and also several<br>\n(well-established) results that allow for restriction on the sets of<br>\nstructures being considered. This project concerns the formalization<br>\nin Isabelle of those results for general Kripke structures for<br>\ngeneralized modal operators (i.e., of any arity). The goal is to<br>\nproduce a library that could then be used (and possibly extended) for<br>\nspecific applications, in particular those related to proof theory.</p>\n<p>The position is categorized as TV-L E13 according to the German salary<br>\nscale. It includes some teaching obligations. The starting date is<br>\nflexible. Please contact Jasmin Blanchette<br>\n(<a href=\"mailto:jasmin.blanchette@ifi.lmu.de\">jasmin.blanchette@ifi.lmu.de</a>) for more information or if you want to<br>\napply. The application deadline is 15 April 2023.</p>",
