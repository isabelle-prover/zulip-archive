The project concerns a collaboration with Virginia Tech (US) and the prestigious DARPA research institute. We are interested in decompilation (retrieving source code from a binary) while maintaining a formal correctness proof that everything is sound. This will make bottom-up formal verification possible: applying formal verification to binaries, instead of to source code. If you have an interest in and affinity with one of the fields of formal methods, compilation, low-level assembly code or reverse-engineering, then you must certainly apply. Unique about the project is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There currently is no formally verified decompilation tool! Research into this can be high impact, and the project has close ties to interested parties with relevant case studies.</li>\n<li>You will be part of a large team of postdocs and PhDs working on the same project.</li>\n<li>It is a close collaboration between a Dutch university, a US university and the US DARPA research institute. If desired, there is the possibility of extended visits to the US.</li>\n<li>You can choose your own work location in The Netherlands (Amsterdam, Utrecht, Nijmegen, Eindhoven, ...).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The project starts in April 2021. For more information, do not hesitate to contact dr. Freek Verbeek: fvb — at — <a href=\"http://ou.nl\">ou.nl</a> &lt;<a href=\"http://ou.nl/\">http://ou.nl/</a>&gt;. Applications can be done by sending your CV and a short application letter indicating your interest in the project to the same e-mail address.</p>",
