It is adding a notation for the half from “big”. This not a “conflicting” notation.</p>\n<p>This is not even due to some form of inheritance conflict, for example:</p>\n<p>locale pos2 = <br>\n  fixes <br>\n    x :: \"int\"<br>\nbegin</p>\n<p>abbreviation<br>\n  ‹half ≡ x div 2›</p>\n<p>notation<br>\n  half (\"<span aria-label=\"spades\" class=\"emoji emoji-2660\" role=\"img\" title=\"spades\">:spades:</span>\")</p>\n<p>end</p>\n<p>locale pos2_pos = <br>\n  pos2 +<br>\n  Y: pos y<br>\n  for<br>\n    y</p>\n<p>begin</p>\n<p>term \"half\" ―‹result: \"♣\"› </p>\n<p>end</p>\n<p>I would submit the suggested “fix” is simply another manifestation of the odd behaviour.</p>\n<p>In any case it does not sort the problem when manifested by an interpretation in a proof environment, which is where my patience wore down enough to make the post.</p>",
