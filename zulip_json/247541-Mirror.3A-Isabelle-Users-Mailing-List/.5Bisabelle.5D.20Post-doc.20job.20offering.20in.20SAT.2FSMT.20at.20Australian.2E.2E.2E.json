We are particularly interested in researching and developing new representations and algorithms that enable us to make productive use of heterogeneous computing environments. Notably, we collaborate closely with practitioners who present us with challenging real-world problems that motivate some of our research directions.</p>\n<p>If you and/or your students might be interested, please share the following link to the job advertisement: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.seek.com.au/job/70985753\">www.seek.com.au/job/70985753</a></p>\n<p>Your assistance in spreading the word about this opportunity to anyone who might be interested would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Charles Gretton &amp; Michael Norrish</p>",
