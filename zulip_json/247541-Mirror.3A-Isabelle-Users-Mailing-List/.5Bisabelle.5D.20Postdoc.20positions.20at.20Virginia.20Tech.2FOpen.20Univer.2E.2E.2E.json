Project goals<br>\ninclude developing trustworthy tools for reasoning about security exploits<br>\nin binary code. Opportunities exist to investigate a broad set of topics<br>\nincluding logic frameworks for automatic reasoning of security<br>\nvulnerabilities, verified decompilation, auto-generation of trustworthy<br>\nsecurity analysis tools, and automatic patching with provable security<br>\nproperties. Opportunities also exist to investigate project-relevant topics<br>\nof mutual interest.</p>\n<p>Recent computer science PhD graduates with expertise in any of the<br>\nfollowing areas are sought: formal verification, proof assistants and<br>\nverification tools, binary/program analysis, or compilers. The positions<br>\nare available either at Virginia Tech or The Open University (or a<br>\ncombination with time at both universities) and have no teaching<br>\nobligations. For experienced candidates, Research Assistant Professor<br>\nappointments at Virginia Tech (inclusive of funding for graduate students)<br>\nare possible.</p>\n<p>Interested candidates are requested to contact Prof. Binoy Ravindran (<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:binoy@vt.edu\">binoy@vt.edu</a>) with a CV or for any questions.</p>",
