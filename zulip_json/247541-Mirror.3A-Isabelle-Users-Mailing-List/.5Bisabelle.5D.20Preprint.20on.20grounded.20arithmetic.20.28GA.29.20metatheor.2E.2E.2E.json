Reasoning around recursion with dynamic typing in grounded arithmetic<br>\n<a href=\"https://bford.info/pub/lang/ga/\">https://bford.info/pub/lang/ga/</a></p>\n<p>This is about a development of the metatheory of grounded arithmetic (GA), a development of a paracomplete logic/arithmetic partly inspired by Kripke’s theory of truth, using Isabelle/HOL as the working metalogic.  It is currently about ~35K lines of Isabelle/HOL and counting, and includes quite a bit of recursion theory including a metacircular evaluator as foundations.  The code repository isn’t public yet but the plan is to make it public with the paper’s formal publication, and in the meantime is shareable privately with colleagues with particular interest and relevant expertise.  I also hope to submit at least the recursion theory part to the AFP, at some point, once it’s cleaned up and better documented.</p>\n<p>Isabelle has served this project extremely well so far — a big thanks to all you who built and continue to maintain it!  But I have built up a small “Isabelle wishlist” and wanted to ask if there might be support for a few potential improvements, which we would be happy to help with under Isabelle developer guidance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A few Unicode symbols not yet supported in Isabelle2025 that would be nice to have for mathematical logic purposes:</li>\n<li>The corners or “Quine quotes” — ⌜ and ⌝ — U+231C and U+231D.  Maybe nice to add the bottom corners U+231E and U+231F just for completeness/symmetry.</li>\n<li>The negated turnstile symbols ⊬ (U+22AC) “Does Not Prove” and ⊭ (U+22AD) “Not True”</li>\n<li>\n<p>The “Left Tack” symbol ⊣ (U+22A3), which would be nice to have for a nontraditional, GA-specific use related to the traditional “proves” turnstile but distinct from either that or its negated version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For purposes of proving interesting HOL functions primitive recursive (or even computable), it would be nice if the standard “default” semantics of undefined cases was uniformly to produce the well-known constant “undefined”.  This is already the semantics of the “case” statement, but is apparently not the semantics of “fun” and “primrec” definitions: an uncovered case effectively yields an undefined <em>function</em>, which could in principle be an arbitrary (non-primitive-recursive, non-computable) function.  Example: the “nth” function in List.thy, which intentionally omits the empty list case.  I have no argument against leaving this case intentionally-undefined, but the current HOL semantics makes this case an undefined <em>function</em> depending on the argument n, which could well be a non-computable function and hence obviously can’t be proven primitive-recursive for a pretty mundane but annoying reason having nothing to do with the normal, intended function of ’nth’, which certainly should be primitive-recursive.  If a future version of Isabelle could semantically treat undefined cases in ‘fun’ and ‘primrec’ definitions like it already treats those in ‘case’ constructs, consistently yielding “undefined” the <em>constant</em>, that would perfectly fix this annoyance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally a nitpick or clarification suggestion for the Isabelle locales tutoral (<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/locales.pdf\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/locales.pdf</a>).  It’s great overall, and with the help of this document we’ve been using locales extremely extensively in this GA metatheory project (maybe overusing/abusing them ;) ).  One quirk of locales that took me a <em>very</em> long time to more-or-less figure out was the issue of when a ’sublocale’ or ‘interpretation’ statement does, and when it doesn’t, import the extensible Isabelle syntax/notation along with the definitions and theorems.  I finally figured out that this depends on whether <em>all</em> of the parameters provided in the sublocale/interpretation statement are in turn “raw” parameters of the current locale the statement appears in (i.e., parameters “passed through” directly), as opposed to values <em>derived indirectly</em> from the current locale’s parameters (via function definitions previously within this locale for example).  Before I figured this out, I regularly struggled with questions of the form, “why did my custom syntax mysteriously get lost in translation for no obvious reason, when all the definitions and theorems from the interpreted locale came through just fine?”  Maybe the locales document actually even talks about this somewhere, and I just missed it — but at least for the benefit of n00bz like me, it might be nice if a future version of the locales tutorial could clarify the rules for when syntax does or does not carry through a sublocale/interpretation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of these are urgent by any means, and again we’re happy to help by submitting concrete patches for example if there’s support for them.</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nBryan</p>",

I have no objection to single-element types in principle, but what exactly the semantics of single-element types “should” be seems orthogonal to the semantic issue I raised.  In HOL, the only possible semantic value of <em>any</em> function returning a single-element type must be that it always yields the one and only value of that type, regardless of how you define the function, since HOL functions are always total.  They always return something, and if there’s only one thing they can return, then that’s the something they return no matter what.  Changing that characteristic of HOL would be a much, much, <em>much</em> more fundamental and universe-breaking change to HOL than the small change I’m proposing to the handling of uncovered patterns in ‘fun’ and ‘primrec’ definitions.</p>\n<p>B</p>\n<p>--John</p>\n<p>On Thu, Jan 29, 2026 at 12:57 PM Bryan Alexander Ford &lt;cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk&lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>\nThanks Larry for your feedback and support in the suggestions!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On 29 Jan 2026, at 13:19, Lawrence Paulson &lt;lp15@cam.ac.uk&lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:lp15@cam.ac.uk\">lp15@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;&gt; wrote:</p>\n<p>Dear Bryan, many thanks for your suggestions.

I’m perfectly fine with function completion for totality, but it should be designed not accidental.</p>\n<p>I completely understand the desire not to have too many “unwanted” theorems in a formal system.  If we were working in ZFC, it would be full of so-called “junk theorems” like ‘2 ∈ 3’; Isabelle’s strong type system already takes us a tremendous distance in minimizing such unwanted theorems.  But the long-ago decisions in HOL to (a) make functions total and (b) make reflexivity unconditional means that we can always prove theorems like “undefined = undefined”, which from a “provability minimization” perspective seems like an undesirable junk theorem as well.  That horse bolted from the HOL barn decades ago.  Is \"nth [] n = last []” so much more offensive than “undefined = undefined”?</p>\n<p>(Incidentally, if you don’t like \"junk theorems\" like these, you might be interested in the grounded reasoning system mentioned in the paper I pointed to in my original post, or its early-prototype embodiment in the “Isabelle/GD” (grounded deduction) built by Sascha Kehri (<a href=\"https://bford.info/thesis/2025-kehrli/\">https://bford.info/thesis/2025-kehrli/</a>).  In this approach, reflexivity in fact isn’t a blanket assumption, and you actually can’t prove “x = x” for any term x until you first prove that x represents a <em>terminating</em> computation that yields something concrete (e.g., a natural number, and in particular not “bottom”).  But I digress…)</p>\n<p>The design of any formal system involves a lot of pragmatic tradeoffs, and HOL is far from an exception.  The consequence of taking a “provability minimization purist” stance on \"nth [] n = last []” is that we <em>cannot</em> prove the “nth” function to be even computable, let alone primitive-recursive, even though it is completely inspired by corresponding <em>computable</em> functions in functional programming tradition (ML, Haskell, etc), and exactly the same definition expressed in exactly the same structural way as ’nth’ is in ML, Haskell, etc., will produce a computable (and even primitive-recursive) function!  Isabelle’s ‘primrec’ and ‘fun’ constructs were originally inspired by functional programming tradition; a big part of their appeal is that they make it easy to express functional <em>computations</em> in HOL and then reason about what those <em>computations</em> do; and a ton of effort has even gone into making functions like nth extractable into executable functional-program code again in languages like ML and Haskell!  Why go to all this effort to make it easy to express normally-computable functions in normal functional programming fashion in HOL, and to be able to reason about it and even extract executable functional code, but <em>not</em> make those “obviously computable” functions actually provably computable?</p>\n<p>All the other ‘fun’ and ‘primrec’ definitions I can think of at the moment in List.thy are provably computable and primitive-recursive.  This even includes ‘hd’ and ’tl’, despite their being “undefined” in the empty-list case, simply because “hd []” and “tl []” are constants by virtue of taking no arguments <em>other than</em> the list argument, and there is only one input argument yielding an undefined output.  Our recursion theory framework has no trouble with these cases.  Yes, “hd []” and “tl []” semantically yield unknown list elements whose values we can prove nothing about, but we can still take their Gödel code in the appropriate type and produce a genuinely (arithmetically, as in definable in Skolem’s PRA) primitive-recursive function that yields that Gödel code, whatever it is, when they get invoked with the empty list.  No problem; this undefined behavior is still <em>computably</em> undefined.</p>\n<p>But because it takes the additional argument n, the “nth” function is a quite rare exception (although I expect there are a few others hiding elsewhere in HOL’s functional-programming-inspired theories).  Despite being “obviously” computable and even primitive recursive by its structural definition, defined using the functional-programming-inspired construct “primrec”, and even fully exportable to genuinely-computable ML/Haskell code, it is not <em>provably</em> even computable due to this particular quirk of Isabelle’s incomplete-pattern-matching semantics.  Does a distaste for \"nth [] n = last []” truly justify the obviously-computable nth function not being provably computable?</p>\n<p>And as I mentioned before, this semantic quirk is already inconsistent with Isabelle/HOL’s semantics for the “case” statement, which already yields the “undefined” constant in incomplete-pattern cases.  What is the principled justification of that semantic inconsistency?</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nBryan</p>",

If we really wanted to avoid unwanted theorems like \"nth [] n = last []” while also making “obviously-computable” functions like nth provably computable, an alternative would be to make each function defined by ‘fun’ or ‘primrec’ produce a <em>distinct</em> undefined constant, specific to that function, for that function’s undefined cases.  Then, “nth [] n” would effectively be equal to some constant symbol like “nth_undefined” but would not be provably equal to the  corresponding undefined constant for any other function with incomplete pattern coverage.  We would not get \"nth [] n = last []” but we would still get “last [] = last []” and “nth [] n = nth [] n”, of course.  And from a provability-minimization-purist stance we would still get the arguably-unwanted theorem “nth [] n = nth [] m” even when n != m, but that’s the property we really need in order for the nth function to be provably computable.  Tradeoffs.</p>\n<p>I still feel however that \"nth [] n = last []” is a small price to pay for “nth” being provably computable, and having every incompletely-defined function like nth produce its own undefined constant like “nth_undefined” sounds to me like more trouble than it's worth.  Especially when there’s already a standard “undefined” constant that’s already widely-used for other “undefinedy” purposes in HOL (such as what case statements produce when they don’t match a pattern).  And especially in comparison to the seemingly much more offensive but pragmatic decision “x/0 = 0” (not even “x/0 = undefined!”) that Larry brought up, a practical-utility compromise that HOL has been living with for a long time now.</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nBryan</p>\n<p>On 30 Jan 2026, at 08:29, Bryan Alexander Ford &lt;<a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt; wrote:</p>\n<p>Thanks Tjark and Gerwin for your follow-up thoughts.</p>\n<p>On 30 Jan 2026, at 01:06, Gerwin Klein &lt;<a href=\"mailto:kleing@unsw.edu.au\">kleing@unsw.edu.au</a>&gt; wrote:</p>\n<p>On 30 Jan 2026, at 10:22, Tjark Weber [cl-isabelle-users-bounces@lists.cam.ac.uk] &lt;<a href=\"mailto:forwarded_for@cse.unsw.edu.au\">forwarded_for@cse.unsw.edu.au</a>&gt; wrote:</p>\n<p>Compared to that, your request seems relatively harmless, though it is<br>\nworth noting that it would still produce \"accidental\" theorems, such as<br>\n\"nth [] n = last []”.</p>\n<p>I would be very much in favour of not being able to prove that.

That horse bolted from the HOL barn decades ago.  Is \"nth [] n = last []” so much more offensive than “undefined = undefined”?</p>\n<p>(Incidentally, if you don’t like \"junk theorems\" like these, you might be interested in the grounded reasoning system mentioned in the paper I pointed to in my original post, or its early-prototype embodiment in the “Isabelle/GD” (grounded deduction) built by Sascha Kehri (<a href=\"https://bford.info/thesis/2025-kehrli/\">https://bford.info/thesis/2025-kehrli/</a>).  In this approach, reflexivity in fact isn’t a blanket assumption, and you actually can’t prove “x = x” for any term x until you first prove that x represents a <em>terminating</em> computation that yields something concrete (e.g., a natural number, and in particular not “bottom”).  But I digress…)</p>\n<p>The design of any formal system involves a lot of pragmatic tradeoffs, and HOL is far from an exception.  The consequence of taking a “provability minimization purist” stance on \"nth [] n = last []” is that we <em>cannot</em> prove the “nth” function to be even computable, let alone primitive-recursive, even though it is completely inspired by corresponding <em>computable</em> functions in functional programming tradition (ML, Haskell, etc), and exactly the same definition expressed in exactly the same structural way as ’nth’ is in ML, Haskell, etc., will produce a computable (and even primitive-recursive) function!  Isabelle’s ‘primrec’ and ‘fun’ constructs were originally inspired by functional programming tradition; a big part of their appeal is that they make it easy to express functional <em>computations</em> in HOL and then reason about what those <em>computations</em> do; and a ton of effort has even gone into making functions like nth extractable into executable functional-program code again in languages like ML and Haskell!  Why go to all this effort to make it easy to express normally-computable functions in normal functional programming fashion in HOL, and to be able to reason about it and even extract executable functional code, but <em>not</em> make those “obviously computable” functions actually provably computable?</p>\n<p>All the other ‘fun’ and ‘primrec’ definitions I can think of at the moment in List.thy are provably computable and primitive-recursive.  This even includes ‘hd’ and ’tl’, despite their being “undefined” in the empty-list case, simply because “hd []” and “tl []” are constants by virtue of taking no arguments <em>other than</em> the list argument, and there is only one input argument yielding an undefined output.  Our recursion theory framework has no trouble with these cases.  Yes, “hd []” and “tl []” semantically yield unknown list elements whose values we can prove nothing about, but we can still take their Gödel code in the appropriate type and produce a genuinely (arithmetically, as in definable in Skolem’s PRA) primitive-recursive function that yields that Gödel code, whatever it is, when they get invoked with the empty list.  No problem; this undefined behavior is still <em>computably</em> undefined.</p>\n<p>But because it takes the additional argument n, the “nth” function is a quite rare exception (although I expect there are a few others hiding elsewhere in HOL’s functional-programming-inspired theories).  Despite being “obviously” computable and even primitive recursive by its structural definition, defined using the functional-programming-inspired construct “primrec”, and even fully exportable to genuinely-computable ML/Haskell code, it is not <em>provably</em> even computable due to this particular quirk of Isabelle’s incomplete-pattern-matching semantics.  Does a distaste for \"nth [] n = last []” truly justify the obviously-computable nth function not being provably computable?</p>\n<p>And as I mentioned before, this semantic quirk is already inconsistent with Isabelle/HOL’s semantics for the “case” statement, which already yields the “undefined” constant in incomplete-pattern cases.  What is the principled justification of that semantic inconsistency?</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nBryan</p>",

With Isabelle’s<br>\ncurrent semantics, however, we can’t even prove nth to be<br>\nprimitive-recursive, because “nth n []” is an arbitrary<br>\npotentially-non-computable <em>function</em> of n, and not a constant.  We instead<br>\nhave to define a different function that behaves the same way as nth for<br>\nall “valid” inputs and prove that primitive recursive.  We can also prove<br>\nnth itself to be <em>conditionally</em> primitive recursive, conditioned on the<br>\ninputs being valid (i.e., n &lt; length of the list), but that just creates<br>\nother unnecessary pain in using that conditional primitive-recursiveness<br>\nproof.</p>\n<p>With nth (or its equivalent) returning the undefined <em>constant</em> on invalid<br>\ninputs, in contrast, we can Gödel-encode that undefined constant in any<br>\nGödel-encodable type, even if we don’t know precisely which value of that<br>\ntype “undefined” actually is, and we can prove that there exists a<br>\nprimitive-recursive function taking a natural number n and the Gödel code<br>\nof a list and yielding the Gödel code of a list element; we simply arrange<br>\nfor that primitive recursive function to return the Gödel code of<br>\n“undefined” of the appropriate type, whatever that is (we don’t care) in<br>\nthe case of invalid input arguments.  So our inability to prove anything<br>\nabout what the undefined constant is doesn’t get in the way of<br>\nprimitive-recursiveness proofs at all for our purposes; what gets in the<br>\nway is the fact that “nth n []” for example is not any constant but an<br>\nundefined function.
