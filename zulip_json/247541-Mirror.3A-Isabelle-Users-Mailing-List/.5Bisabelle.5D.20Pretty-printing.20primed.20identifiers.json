A <br>\npossible solution is to replace \\isacharprime by \\isamath{'}, but one cannot <br>\nperform this replacement blindly because type variables like 'a would suffer as <br>\nwell.</p>\n<p>I tried to solve the problem with a new \"term style\" like (sub) (which turns <br>\ntrailing digits in identifiers into subscripts) that turns a trailing prime into <br>\n\"\\&lt;^latex&gt;\\&lt;open&gt;\\\\isamath{'}\\&lt;close&gt;\". However, probably because this is not a <br>\nlegal variable name (it seems to work for constants) I get the warning</p>\n<p>Legacy feature! Bad name binding: \"m\\&lt;^latex&gt;‹\\isamath{'}›\"</p>\n<p>from @{term \"m'\"}. I have some vague idea why this gives rise to a \"binding\" <br>\n(probably because free variables are quantified in some manner) but have no idea <br>\nhow I can avoid this or what other approach to take.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions?</p>\n<p>Tobias<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/2dBgs6J00wpLBcXrA2UcW2HO/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
