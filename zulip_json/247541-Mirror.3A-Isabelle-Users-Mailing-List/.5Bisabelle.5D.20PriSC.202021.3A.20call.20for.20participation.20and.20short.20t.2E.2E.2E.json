The goal is to bring together researchers<br>\ninterested in secure compilation and to identify interesting research<br>\ndirections<br>\nand open challenges.</p>\n<p>PriSC 2021 will be held on Saturday January 17th, 2021 online.<br>\nIt will be co-located with POPL 2021, also online.</p>\n<p>For more information about this edition and the PriSC series, please<br>\nvisit <a href=\"https://popl21.sigplan.org/home/prisc-2021\">https://popl21.sigplan.org/home/prisc-2021</a></p>\n<h3>Invited Speakers</h3>\n<p>Hugo Vincent (ARM)</p>\n<h3>Accepted papers</h3>\n<p>The list of accepted talks is available at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://popl21.sigplan.org/track/prisc-2021#event-overview\">https://popl21.sigplan.org/track/prisc-2021#event-overview</a></p>\n<h3>Call for Short Talks</h3>\n<p>We also have a short talks session, where participants get 5 minutes to<br>\npresent<br>\nintriguing ideas, advertise ongoing work, etc. If you're interested in<br>\ngiving a<br>\nshort 5-minute talk, please submit an abstract. Any topic that could be of<br>\ninterest to the emerging secure compilation community is in scope.<br>\nPresentations<br>\nthat provide a useful outside view or challenge the community are also<br>\nwelcome.</p>\n<p>- Deadline: January 11th, 2021<br>\n  - More details:<br>\n<a href=\"https://popl21.sigplan.org/home/prisc-2021#Call-for-Short-Talks\">https://popl21.sigplan.org/home/prisc-2021#Call-for-Short-Talks</a></p>\n<p>- Submit here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://forms.gle/wkCyK4fN3i11nbyD7\">https://forms.gle/wkCyK4fN3i11nbyD7</a></p>\n<h3>Workshop summary</h3>\n<p>The emerging field of secure compilation aims to preserve security<br>\nproperties of<br>\nprograms when they have been compiled to low-level languages such as<br>\nassembly,<br>\nwhere high-level abstractions donâ€™t exist, and unsafe, unexpected<br>\ninteractions<br>\nwith libraries, other programs, the operating system and even the hardware<br>\nare<br>\npossible. For unsafe source languages like C, secure compilation requires<br>\ncareful handling of undefined source-language behavior (like buffer<br>\noverflows<br>\nand double frees). Formally, secure compilation aims to protect high-level<br>\nlanguage abstractions in compiled code, even against adversarial low-level<br>\ncontexts, thus enabling sound reasoning about security in the source<br>\nlanguage. A<br>\ncomplementary goal is to keep the compiled code efficient, often leveraging<br>\nnew<br>\nhardware security features and advances in compiler design. Other necessary<br>\ncomponents are identifying and formalizing properties that secure compilers<br>\nmust<br>\npossess, devising efficient security mechanisms (both software and<br>\nhardware),<br>\nand developing effective verification and proof techniques. Research in the<br>\nfield thus puts together advances in compiler design, programming languages,<br>\nsystems security, verification, and computer architecture.</p>\n<h3>Contact</h3>\n<p>For any questions please contact the workshop chairs, Jonathan Protzenko<br>\n(<a href=\"mailto:jonathan.protzenko@gmail.com\">jonathan.protzenko@gmail.com</a>) and Deian Stefan (<a href=\"mailto:deian@cs.ucsd.edu\">deian@cs.ucsd.edu</a>).</p>\n<p>To make sure you receive PriSC announcements in the future please<br>\nsubscribe to the following low-traffic mailing list:<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.gforge.inria.fr/mailman/listinfo/prisc-announce\">https://lists.gforge.inria.fr/mailman/listinfo/prisc-announce</a></p>",
