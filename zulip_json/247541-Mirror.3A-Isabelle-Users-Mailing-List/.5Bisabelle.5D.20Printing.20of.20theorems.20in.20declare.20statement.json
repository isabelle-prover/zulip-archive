How to reproduce:</p>\n<p>Open Isabelle, go to settings-&gt;Global Options-&gt;General-&gt;Restore <br>\npreviously opened files on startup</p>\n<p>Write an apply script (or anything else with formatting), e.g.:<br>\nlemma test: \"A = B\"<br>\n   apply (rule trans)<br>\n    apply (rule trans)<br>\n     apply (rule trans)</p>\n<p>At this point the indent while typing (after pressing Enter) as well as <br>\nthe manually triggered one (CTRL+i) are working (as expected).</p>\n<p>Close Isabelle and restart it. Then trigger the formatter. Now <br>\neverything is just pushed all the way to the left:<br>\nlemma test: \"A = B\"<br>\napply (rule trans)<br>\napply (rule trans)<br>\napply (rule trans)</p>\n<p>Disabling that option and restarting Isabelle fixes the issue.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nJan</p>\n<p>Am 15.02.25 um 21:52 schrieb Makarius:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Isabelle users,</p>\n<p>the Isabelle2025 release train continues on schedule, see again <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/phame/post/view/85/release_candidates_for_isabelle2025\">https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/phame/post/view/85/release_candidates_for_isabelle2025</a> <br>\nfor ongoing details.</p>\n<p>Apart from some linting and minor consolidation, there have been few <br>\nchanges so far.
