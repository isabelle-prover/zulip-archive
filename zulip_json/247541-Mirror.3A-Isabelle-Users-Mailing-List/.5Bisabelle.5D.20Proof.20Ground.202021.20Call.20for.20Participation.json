The competition itself will be run via the contest system,<br>\nwhile the workshop will provide a platform for discussion among the<br>\nparticipants.</p>\n<p>The first edition of the workshop [3] has been held at ITP 2019 [4]. The<br>\nsecond edition [5] was affiliated with IJCAR 2020 [6].</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The registration is now open (<br>\n<a href=\"https://easyconferences.eu/itp2021/registration/\">https://easyconferences.eu/itp2021/registration/</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Workshop and Competition:  June 28, 2021</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organizers</p>\n<p>Maximilian P.
