Consider the <br>\nfollowing (contrived) example (In session HOL-Proofs):</p>\n<p>lemma l[OF TrueI]: \"True ⟹ P\"<br>\n   by (simp add: P_def) (* theorem l: P *)<br>\nfull_prf l (* l ∙ TrueI *)</p>\n<p>The proof of l seems to depend on l itself, but closer inspection showed <br>\nthat in this l hides another proof for the lemma before the application <br>\nof the rule attribute. This intermediate result has, as far as I know, <br>\nno name or way to refer to it. I am therefore confused why the proofterm <br>\nuses the name of the eventual result for it, instead of for example an <br>\nempty name field.</p>\n<p>Running Stefan Berghofer's proofchecker seems to support this being <br>\nunintended, as it complains about a \"Duplicate use of theorem name\" <br>\n(final/intermediate result) for the lemma l. That it is finds a proof <br>\nfor the intermediate result, but from the name would expect one for the <br>\nfinal result.</p>\n<p>Is this intended behavior and if yes, is it possible to identify such <br>\n\"intermediate\" named steps in a proofterm?</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nSimon</p>",
