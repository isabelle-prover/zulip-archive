Stark\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:isabelle-users@starkeffect.com\">isabelle-users@starkeffect.com</a>&gt;<br>\nI have been using a relatively recent snapshot version of Isabelle (Isabelle_04-Nov-2020).  This version<br>\ndoes a rather better job of showing what is going on if the Monitor panel is raised.  That is good.</p>\n<p>My question is: In certain situations, if I use \"try\" and let it crunch for awhile, I can arrive at<br>\na situation where there are perhaps 180K future tasks showing in the Monitor window.  I can sometimes<br>\nthen delete the \"try\" from the input buffer, but the future tasks remain and may take many minutes<br>\nto clear.</p>\n<p>My question is: once I have deleted the \"try\" from the input buffer, why are the existing future tasks<br>\nstill relevant?  Why do they not get canceled somehow, so that they don't spam the interactive<br>\nsession for an unknown period of time?</p>\n<p>Please bear in mind that I don't have any idea about the technical aspects of the implementation.<br>\nIt just strikes me that there is little point in having to wait many minutes to clear a queue of<br>\nfuture tasks that were started by a buffer input that has since been deleted.</p>",
