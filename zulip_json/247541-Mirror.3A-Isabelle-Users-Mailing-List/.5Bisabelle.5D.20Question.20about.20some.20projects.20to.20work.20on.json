I've had some experience with Isabelle back in 2008,<br>\nand I am trying to catch up with the last version of Isabelle.</p>\n<p>My (very old) afp entry (<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Recursion-\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Recursion-</a><br>\nTheory-I.html) was about formalisation of mathematics, but being a software<br>\ndeveloper for many years, working on certified programs also looks very<br>\ninteresting.</p>\n<p>Basically, I don't have very strong preferences besides a desire to do<br>\nsomething useful and interesting with Isabelle.  <br>\nMay be it would be easier to participate in some current project, if it makes<br>\nsense.  <br>\nI would be glad for any suggestions.  </p>\n<p>Kind regards,  <br>\n​​​​​​​ Michael Nedzelsky</p>",
