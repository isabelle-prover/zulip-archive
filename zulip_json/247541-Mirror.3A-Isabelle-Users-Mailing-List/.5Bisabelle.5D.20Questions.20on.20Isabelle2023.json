Then, I<br>\nopened in Isabelle2023 the files related to a new AFP submission on which I am<br>\ncurrently working, which resulted in the following couple of questions which I<br>\nwould like to ask you. I am pretty confident that Isabelle documentation would<br>\nsuffice to answer them, but maybe some of you would already have quick answers<br>\nto them.<br>\nIn more detail:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The name of my session is not listed in the session selector box of the<br>\nDocument panel, so that I cannot select it and generate documents for it from<br>\nthe editor. This happens even if I place the folder containing the theory<br>\nfiles, the bib and tex files, and the ROOT file under the %ISABELLE_HOME%<br>\nfolder and open all those files in the editor, although all the files are<br>\ncorrectly processed and the theory files are closed by the \"end\" keyword.<br>\nWhy does this happen, and how can I solve this issue?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In correspondence with each @{cite xxx} antiquotation, the following<br>\nwarnings are displayed:<br>\n\"Legacy feature! Old antiquotation syntax, better use \"isabelle update -u<br>\ncite\"\"<br>\n\"Unknown session context: cannot check Bibtex entry [entry identifier]\"<br>\nThis happens even in the conditions described above.<br>\nAgain, why does this happen, and how can I solve this issue?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thank you in advance for any possible feedback, much appreciated!<br>\nBest regards,<br>\nPasquale Noce</p>",
