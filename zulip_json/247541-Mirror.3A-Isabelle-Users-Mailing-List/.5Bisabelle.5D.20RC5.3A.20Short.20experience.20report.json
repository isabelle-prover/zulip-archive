I did not run into any<br>\nunrecoverable grey-out.<br>\nIt was killed one time by my OOM killer, but I had two instances in<br>\nparallel on 32GB RAM.</p>\n<p>With the NEWS file, and a bit of guessing, the Isabelle-ML code was<br>\neasily ported, most severe problem was the undocumented change<br>\nPath.smart_implode -&gt; Path.implode_symbolic.</p>\n<p>Porting of lemmas using the word library was, as expected, more<br>\ndifficult. With the help of sledgehammer, which feels really powerful,<br>\nI could force most lemmas through, even without a complete<br>\nunderstanding or overview of the changes to Word.</p>",

Makarius has repackaged many of the provers, using the latest versions; this was long overdue. On the Sledgehammer side, Martin has been doing the necessary integration, testing, and evaluation work. I'm very grateful to both! The integration of veriT as a reconstruction method, by Hans-Jörg, Mathias, and Martin, also helps reduce reconstruction failures by half, they claim in their draft [*]. Two more highlights:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We now communicate with E in a lambda-free HOL logic with support for currying and Booleans. That helps the success rate a lot. (E should get lambdas and HO unification this year.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sledgehammer now includes the Zipperposition higher-order prover that's developed largely by my team. It won last year CASC's higher-order division by a record margin. It's not enabled by default because we ran out of time to test it thoroughly, but you can add it to the Sledgehammer panel or \"sledgehammer_params\". It's good on HO things like p {x. q x | r x} ==&gt; p {x. r x | q x} (which should be trivial but are \"lost in translation\" to FOL). Reconstruction remains a challenge, though.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Jasmin</p>\n<p>[*] <a href=\"https://matryoshka-project.github.io/pubs/verit_isa_paper.pdf\">https://matryoshka-project.github.io/pubs/verit_isa_paper.pdf</a></p>",

        "content": "<p>From: Lawrence Paulson &lt;<a href=\"mailto:lp15@cam.ac.uk\">lp15@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>\nThese are great developments! But already, for some years now, sledgehammer has been good enough to help people prove things they didn’t really understand. That’s how I managed to port tens of thousands of lines of incomprehensible HOL Light proofs. It’s also good at discovering contradictions when people have been using “sorry” a little too freely.</p>\n<p>It’s not fanciful to foresee a “self-healing” capability for proof developments: where you update a definition and the system would identify and automatically repair proofs that broke as a result. Also in the not-too-distant future might be source to source translations of structured proofs from one proof assistant to another, with high-level proofs in the target system being generated automatically using the source proofs as hints (as opposed to the current practice of emulating one formalism within another).</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
