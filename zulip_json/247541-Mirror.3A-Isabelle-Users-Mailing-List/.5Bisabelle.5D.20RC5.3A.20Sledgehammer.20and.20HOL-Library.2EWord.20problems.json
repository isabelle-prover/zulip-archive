There has never been support for<br>\nreconstruction of Z3's proofs involving the word/bitvector theory.<br>\nThere is experimental support to convert goals into SMT problems,<br>\nbut since the reconstruction is missing, I thought that feature was<br>\ndisabled by default, but, I can reproduce the error you posted.<br>\nI had thought that declare [[z3_extensions]] was required to cause<br>\nbitvector constants to appear in generated SMT problems.</p>\n<p>I've been making use of this experimental support as a kind of<br>\nfiddly quickcheck/nitpick for some proofs I've been doing. I'm planning<br>\nto commit some improvements on that, which might include a fix for this<br>\nissue. However, none of that will make it into this release round.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\n     Thomas.</p>",
