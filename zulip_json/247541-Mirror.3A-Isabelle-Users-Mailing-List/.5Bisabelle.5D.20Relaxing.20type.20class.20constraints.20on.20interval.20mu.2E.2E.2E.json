Brucker\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:adbrucker@0x5f.org\">adbrucker@0x5f.org</a>&gt;<br>\nHi,<br>\nIn the theory HOL-Library.Interval, the type \"'a interval\" uses the<br>\nfollowing instantiation for the type class \"times\":</p>\n<p>instantiation \"interval\" :: (linordered_semiring) times</p>\n<p>This prevents, for instance, using interval multiplication with the<br>\ninstance \"ereal interval\".</p>\n<p>It seems to be possible to \"relax\" the instantiation for<br>\ntimes/multiplication-related type classes to \"{times, linorder}\",<br>\nwhich is supported by ereal (and, hence, allows for using interval<br>\nmultiplication over extended reals).</p>\n<p>I did locally change the instantiations in HOL-Library.Interval and<br>\nrebuilt HOL-Library without any problems. HOL-Library.Interval is not<br>\nused a lot. Still, given that this change makes the interval type<br>\napplicable in more situation, I do not expect any major problems with<br>\nthis change.</p>\n<p>My changes are described in the attached patch (relative to the<br>\nIsabelle development tip 79579:57ceacd4a17b).</p>\n<p>Is this a change that could make it into the Isabelle distribution?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\n        Achim</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/4vIadLxTCWGCiZsjxGhX0WLu/relaxing_interval_type_classes.patch\">relaxing_interval_type_classes.patch</a></p>",

From my point of view (as one of the<br>\nauthors of HOL-Library.Interval), these changes are reasonable and could go<br>\nto the Isabelle distribution (after testing with the AFP).<br>\nUnfortunately I currently donâ€™t have access to the development repository.</p>\n<p>Would somebody reading this volunteer to bring these changes to<br>\nisabelle-dev?</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nFabian</p>",
