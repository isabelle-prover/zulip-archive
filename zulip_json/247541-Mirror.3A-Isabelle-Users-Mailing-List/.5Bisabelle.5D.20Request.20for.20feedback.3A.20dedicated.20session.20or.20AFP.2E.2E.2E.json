This<br>\nsession could also include a small document (similar in spirit to<br>\nGuide.thy in Word_Lib) to explain the existing material.</p>\n<p>Any comments?</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/hgAxqc3G6-OqXGSCCIW-TSQD/OpenPGP_signature\">OpenPGP_signature</a></p>",
