The ideal candidate<br>\nwould have some knowledge and interest in homotopy and cubical type theory,<br>\ncombined with concrete experience implementing type theoretic proof<br>\nassistants using modern algorithms, such as bidirectional type checking and<br>\nnormalization-by-evaluation.</p>\n<p>You will be exposed to the latest research in the field and can get<br>\ninvolved in theoretical development of the research ideas. We welcome<br>\napplicants who do not have a Ph.D. degree---a BA/BS degree is sufficient.</p>\n<p>The research project is funded by the AFOSR through their MURI program, and<br>\nyour official affiliation would be the University of Minnesota with Favonia<br>\nbeing your supervisor.
