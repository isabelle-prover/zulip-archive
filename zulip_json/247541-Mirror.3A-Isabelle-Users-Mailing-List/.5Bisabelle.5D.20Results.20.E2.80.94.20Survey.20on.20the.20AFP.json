I am happy to announce that the results have been formally written up and are available at <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01052\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01052</a></p>\n<p>In short, the participants were generally satisfied with the AFP, however there are specific areas which can be improved. I would like to thank the 30 participants for their feedback, and I hope the results are of interest to the community.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nCarlin MacKenzie<br>\nThe University of Edinburgh</p>\n<p>The University of Edinburgh is a charitable body, registered in Scotland, with registration number SC005336.
