Thus it does the job of docker and <br>\nnix to some extent, although Isabelle is a bit older than these.</p>\n<p>Everything is integrated via Isabelle/Scala running on the JVM: there are no <br>\n\"scripts\" to assembly things, but well-typed Scala programs. We do have such <br>\nan Isabelle/Scala build tool almost every Isabelle component, to reproduce the <br>\nbinaries within a certain OS context. Some other components are assembled <br>\nmanually for historic reasons. Note every bit and piece can be reconstructed <br>\nfrom source alone.</p>\n<p>General administrative notes about Isabelle componenents are in <br>\nAdmin/components/README.md --- but nothing of that is relevant to Isabelle <br>\nend-users, only to produces of components.</p>\n<p>Sometimes people disagree with this level of sophistication and ambition in <br>\nIsabelle system integration. Which leads us back to my initial question: <br>\n\"Why?\" (This should be answered first.)</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
