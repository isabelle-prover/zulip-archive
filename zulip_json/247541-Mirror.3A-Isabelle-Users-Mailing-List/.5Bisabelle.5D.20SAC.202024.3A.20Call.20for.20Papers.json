The forum gives <br>\nparticipants an opportunity to interact with different communities <br>\nsharing an interest in applied computing.</p>\n<p>The 39th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2024) <br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2024/&gt;is\">https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2024/&gt;is</a> sponsored by the ACM Special <br>\nInterest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP), and will take place on <br>\nApril 8 - April 12, 2024, in Avila, Spain.</p>\n<p>The Software Verification and Testing track aims to contribute to the <br>\nchallenge of improving the usability of formal methods in software <br>\nengineering. The track covers areas such as formal methods for <br>\nverification and testing, based on theorem proving, model checking, <br>\nstatic analysis, and run-time verification. We invite authors to submit <br>\nnew results in formal verification and testing, as well as development <br>\nof technologies to improve the usability of formal methods in software <br>\nengineering. We also welcome detailed descriptions of applications of <br>\nmechanical verification to large scale software.</p>\n<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* model checking<br>\n  * theorem proving<br>\n  * correct by construction development<br>\n  * model-based testing<br>\n  * software testing<br>\n  * symbolic execution<br>\n  * static and dynamic analysis<br>\n  * abstract interpretation<br>\n  * analysis methods for dependable systems<br>\n  * software certification and proof carrying code<br>\n  * fault diagnosis and debugging<br>\n  * verification and validation of large scale software systems<br>\n  * real world applications and case studies applying software testing<br>\n    and verification</p>\n<p>* benchmarks and data sets for software testing and verification</p>\n<p>Submission Guidelines</p>\n<p>Paper submissions must report on original, unpublished work. Submitted <br>\npapers will undergo a double-blind review process. Author(s) name(s) and <br>\naddress(es) must not appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference <br>\nshould be avoided and made in the third person. We welcome research <br>\npapers and posters. Research papers should have at most 8 two-column <br>\npages in ACM format (further two pages, to a total of 10 pages, may be <br>\navailable at a charge). The length of a poster is limited to three pages <br>\n(one extra page may be available at a charge). Please comply to this <br>\npage limit already at submission time.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in the context of the Student Research Competition (SRC) <br>\nprogram to provide graduate students the opportunity to meet and <br>\nexchange ideas with researchers and practitioners in their areas of <br>\ninterest, graduate students are invited to submit research abstracts <br>\n(maximum of 4 pages in ACM camera-ready format) following the <br>\ninstructions published at the SAC 2024 website. Last yearâ€™s example can <br>\nbe foundhere <br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2023/authorkit/ACM_SigConf-SRC2023.pdf\">https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2023/authorkit/ACM_SigConf-SRC2023.pdf</a>&gt;. <br>\nSubmission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed.</p>\n<p>Accepted papers will be published in the ACM SAC 2024 proceedings in the <br>\nACM digital library. Paper registration is required, allowing the <br>\ninclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author <br>\nor a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement <br>\nfor the paper/poster to be included in the ACM digital library. No-show <br>\nof registered papers and posters will result in excluding them from the <br>\nACM digital library.</p>\n<p>Author kit with formatting guidelines for all submission <br>\ntypes:<a href=\"https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2024/authorkit.php\">https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2024/authorkit.php</a></p>\n<p>The submission system for regular papers:<a href=\"https://softconf.com/n/sac2024/\">https://softconf.com/n/sac2024/</a></p>\n<p>The submission system for SRC (Student Research Competition) <br>\nabstracts:<a href=\"https://softconf.com/n/sac-src2024/\">https://softconf.com/n/sac-src2024/</a></p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>Paper and SRC abstract submission: September 15th, 2023<br>\nNotification: October 30th, 2023<br>\nCamera-ready and author registration: November 30th, 2023</p>\n<p>Track Chairs</p>\n<p>Georgiana Caltais &lt;<a href=\"https://people.utwente.nl/g.g.c.caltais?tab=contact\">https://people.utwente.nl/g.g.c.caltais?tab=contact</a>&gt;, <br>\nUniversity of Twente, The Netherlands<br>\nJustyna Petke &lt;<a href=\"http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Petke/index.html\">http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Petke/index.html</a>&gt;, <br>\nUniversity College London, United Kingdom</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>TBD</p>\n<p>Previous Editions</p>\n<p>The SVT track has been held annually at SAC since 2009.
