These algorithms and methods are successfully<br>\napplied in various fields, including software science, which covers a<br>\nbroad range of topics about software construction and analysis.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, artificial intelligence methods and machine learning<br>\nalgorithms are widely used nowadays in various domains and, in<br>\nparticular, combined with symbolic computation. Several approaches mix<br>\nartificial intelligence and symbolic methods and tools deployed over<br>\nlarge corpora to create what is known as cognitive systems. Cognitive<br>\ncomputing focuses on building systems that interact with humans<br>\nnaturally by reasoning, aiming at learning at scale.</p>\n<p>The purpose of SCSS 2021 is to promote research on theoretical and<br>\npractical aspects of symbolic computation in software science, combined<br>\nwith modern artificial intelligence techniques.</p>\n<p>Scope</p>\n<hr>\n<p>SCSS 2021 solicits submissions on all aspects of symbolic computation<br>\nand their applications in software science, in combination with<br>\nartificial intelligence and cognitive computing techniques. The topics<br>\nof the symposium include, but are not limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>automated reasoning, knowledge reasoning, common-sense reasoning and<br>\nreasoning in science</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>algorithm (program) synthesis and/or verification, alignment and joint<br>\nprocessing of formal, semi-formal, and informal libraries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>formal methods for the analysis of network and system security</p>\n</li>\n<li>termination analysis and complexity analysis of algorithms (programs)</li>\n<li>extraction of specifications from algorithms (programs)</li>\n<li>\n<p>theorem proving methods and techniques, collaboration between<br>\nautomated and interactive theorem proving</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>proof carrying code</p>\n</li>\n<li>generation of inductive assertion for algorithm (programs)</li>\n<li>algorithm (program) transformations</li>\n<li>combinations of linguistic/learning-based and semantic/reasoning methods</li>\n<li>\n<p>formalization and computerization of knowledge (maths, medicine,<br>\neconomy, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>methods for large-scale computer understanding of mathematics and science</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>artificial intelligence, machine learning and big-data methods in<br>\ntheorem proving and mathematics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>formal verification of artificial intelligence and machine learning<br>\nalgorithms, explainable artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial<br>\nintelligence</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>cognitive computing, cognitive vision, perception systems and<br>\nartificial reasoners for robotics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>component-based programming</p>\n</li>\n<li>computational origami</li>\n<li>query languages (in particular for XML documents)</li>\n<li>semantic web and cloud computing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>May 31: title and single-paragraph abstract submission deadline (extended).<br>\nJune 7: paper submission deadline (extended).<br>\nJuly 12: notification deadline.<br>\nJuly 30: final paper submission deadline.<br>\nSeptember 8-10, 2021: the symposium dates (virtual).</p>\n<p>Keynote speaker</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bruno Buchberger (RISC, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria)</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Tateaki Sasaki (University of Tsukuba, Japan)<br>\nMartina Seidl (Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria)<br>\nStephen M.
