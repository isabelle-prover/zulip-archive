It is affiliated with IJCAR 2022, part of FLoC2022, and will<br>\nbe held on August 11th-12th, 2022, in Haifa, Israel.</p>\n<p>The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and users of<br>\nSMT tools and techniques. Relevant topics include but are not limited<br>\nto:</p>\n<p>* Decision procedures and theories of interest<br>\n  * Combinations of decision procedures<br>\n  * Novel implementation techniques<br>\n  * Benchmarks and evaluation methodologies<br>\n  * Applications and case studies<br>\n  * Theoretical results</p>\n<p>Papers on pragmatic aspects of implementing and using SMT tools, as<br>\nwell as novel applications of SMT, are especially encouraged. In<br>\naddition, to celebrate the 20th edition of the workshop, we challenge<br>\nthe community to submit high-impact work!</p>\n<p>== Submission Guidelines</p>\n<p>Three categories of submissions are invited:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Extended abstracts: given the informal style of the workshop, we<br>\n    strongly encourage the submission of preliminary reports of work<br>\n    in progress. They may range in length from very short (a couple of<br>\n    pages) to the full 10 pages and they will be judged based on the<br>\n    expected level of interest for the SMT community. They will be<br>\n    included in the informal proceedings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Original papers: contain original research (simultaneous<br>\n    submissions are not allowed) and sufficient detail to assess the<br>\n    merits and relevance of the submission. For papers reporting<br>\n    experimental results, authors are strongly encouraged to make<br>\n    their data available.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Presentation-only papers: describe work recently published or<br>\n    submitted and will not be included in the proceedings. We see this<br>\n    as a way to provide additional access to important developments<br>\n    that SMT Workshop attendees may be unaware of.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Papers in all three categories will be peer-reviewed. Papers should<br>\nnot exceed 10 pages and should be in standard-conforming PDF. The 10<br>\npage limit does not include references, and technical details may be<br>\nincluded in an appendix to be read at the reviewers' discretion. Final<br>\nversions should be prepared in LaTeX using the easychair.cls class<br>\nfile. To submit a paper, go to the EasyChair SMT 2022 submission page<br>\nand follow the instructions there.</p>\n<p>== Committees</p>\n<p>=== Program Chairs</p>\n<p>* David Déharbe − CLEARSY<br>\n  * Antti Hyvärinen − Università della Svizzera Italiana</p>\n<p>=== Program Committee</p>\n<p>* Leonard Alt − Ethereum Foundation<br>\n  * Haniel Barbosa − Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais<br>\n  * Nikolaj Bjørner − Microsoft Research<br>\n  * Maria Paola Bonacina − Università degli Studi di Verona<br>\n  * Martin Bromberger − Max-Planck Institut für Informatik<br>\n  * Rayna Dimitrova − CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security<br>\n  * Pascal Fontaine − Université de Liège<br>\n  * Stéphane Graham-Lengrand − SRI International<br>\n  * Liana Hadarean − Amazon Web Services<br>\n  * Jochen Hoenicke − University of Freiburg<br>\n  * Chantal Keller − Université Paris-Saclay<br>\n  * Igor Konnov − Informal Systems Austria<br>\n  * Matteo Marescotti − Meta Platforms, UK<br>\n  * Aina Niemetz − Stanford University<br>\n  * Elizabeth Polgreen − University of Edinburgh<br>\n  * Mathias Preiner − Stanford University<br>\n  * Andrew Reynolds − University of Iowa<br>\n  * Tanja Schindler − University of Freiburg<br>\n  * Sophie Tourret − INRIA and MPI for Informatics<br>\n  * Yoni Zohar − Bar Ilan University</p>\n<p>== Contact</p>\n<p>All questions about submissions should be emailed to the PC chairs.</p>",
