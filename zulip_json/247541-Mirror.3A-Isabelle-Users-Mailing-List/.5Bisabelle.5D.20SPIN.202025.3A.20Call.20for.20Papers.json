The symposium specifically focuses on <br>\nconcurrent software but does not exclude the analysis of sequential <br>\nsoftware. Submissions are solicited on theoretical results, novel <br>\nalgorithms, tool development, and empirical evaluation.</p>\n<p>The SPIN symposium originated as a workshop focusing on explicit state <br>\nmodel checking, specifically as related to the SPIN model checker. <br>\nHowever, over the years it has evolved to a broadly-scoped symposium for <br>\nsoftware analysis using any automated techniques, including model <br>\nchecking, automated theorem proving, and symbolic execution. An overview <br>\nof the previous SPIN symposia (and early workshops) can be found at: <br>\n<a href=\"https://spinroot.com/spin/Workshops/\">https://spinroot.com/spin/Workshops/</a>.</p>\n<p>Topics of Interest:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Formal verification techniques for automated analysis of (concurrent) <br>\nsoftware/hardware, including:<br>\n  -- Model checking<br>\n  -- Deductive verification<br>\n  -- Automated theorem proving, including SAT and SMT<br>\n  -- Abstraction and symbolic execution techniques<br>\n  -- Static analysis and abstract interpretation<br>\n  -- Modular and compositional verification techniques<br>\n  -- Verification of timed and probabilistic systems<br>\n  -- Automated testing using advanced analysis techniques<br>\n  -- Program synthesis<br>\n  -- Derivation of specifications, test cases etc. via formal analysis<br>\n  -- Formal specification languages, temporal logic, design-by-contract<br>\n  -- Formal analysis of learned systems<br>\n  -- Any combination of the above</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application and/or engineering of verification tools, including:<br>\n  -- Case studies of interesting systems or with interesting results<br>\n  -- Implementation of novel verification tools<br>\n  -- Benchmarks and comparative studies for verification tools<br>\n  -- Verification tools using modern hardware, e.g.: multi-core CPU, <br>\nGPU, TPU, cloud, and quantum</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Dates:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Paper Submission:                     13 Feb 2025<br>\nArtifact Submission (Tool Papers):    27 Feb 2025<br>\nPaper/Artifact Notifications:         24 Mar 2025<br>\nArtifact Submission (Other Papers):   12 Mar 2025<br>\nNon-tool Paper Artifact Notification: 1 May 2025<br>\nSymposium:                            7-8 May 2025</p>\n<p>Submission Details:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We are soliciting three categories of papers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Full Research Papers describing fully developed work and complete <br>\nresults (16 pages, excluding bibliography and appendices);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Full Tool Papers, accompanied by a <em>Mandatory Artifact</em>, describing <br>\nwork that is closely-related to the development or the evaluation of a <br>\nverification tool or similar (16 pages, excluding bibliography and <br>\nappendices);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short Papers presenting tools, technology, experiences with lessons <br>\nlearned, new ideas, work in progress with preliminary results, and novel <br>\ncontributions to formal methods (6 pages, excluding bibliography and <br>\nappendices). Note: Artifact evaluation is optional for short papers but <br>\nhighly recommended for those with a focus on tools. If you want to have <br>\nthe accompanying artifact of your short paper evaluated, please submit <br>\nit to the mandatory AE on February 27.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers submission website: <br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spin2025\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spin2025</a>  -- in the track <br>\nResearch Papers, select the respective paper category.</p>\n<p>All papers that conform to submission guidelines will be peer-reviewed <br>\nby members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on <br>\nthe basis of originality, the importance of contribution, soundness, <br>\nevaluation, quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to <br>\nrelated work.</p>\n<p>The proceedings of SPIN 2025 will be published as part of <br>\npost-conference proceedings in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer <br>\nScience series. Submissions should adhere to the LNCS format; see <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>. <br>\nPlease take into account Springer’s Book authors code of conduct when <br>\npreparing submissions: <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct\">https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct</a>.</p>\n<p>Artifact Evaluation:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>SPIN 2025 will feature artifact evaluation, performed by an Artifact <br>\nEvaluation Committee (AEC). The AEC evaluates artifacts based on <br>\ndocumentation, availability, reproducibility of results, and tool <br>\nreusability (if applicable). Artifact submission is mandatory for Full <br>\nTool Papers. While artifact submission is optional for papers in other <br>\ncategories, we highly encourage authors of papers involving tool <br>\ndevelopment and empirical evaluation to submit an artifact for <br>\nevaluation. Papers with an accompanying artifact may be awarded one or <br>\nmore badges from the EAPLS artifact badging scheme <br>\n(<a href=\"https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/\">https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/</a>).
