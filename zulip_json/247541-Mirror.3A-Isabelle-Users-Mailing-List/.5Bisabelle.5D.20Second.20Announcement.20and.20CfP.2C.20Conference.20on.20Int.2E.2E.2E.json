CICM  brings  together the  many  separate<br>\ncommunities  that  have  developed   theoretical  and  practical  solutions  for<br>\nmathematical applications such as  computation, deduction, knowledge management,<br>\nand user interfaces. It offers a  venue for discussing problems and solutions in<br>\neach  of these  areas  and their  integration.  Besides  the  CICM main  program<br>\nsoliciting  formal CICM  submissions  there will  be  associated workshops  with<br>\nseparate submission options.</p>\n<p>We  are  inviting formal  submissions  on  all  topics relating  to  intelligent<br>\ncomputer mathematics, in particular, but not limited to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>theorem proving and computer algebra</li>\n<li>mathematical knowledge management</li>\n<li>digital mathematical libraries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A comprehensive but  not exhausting list of  topics of interest can  be found on<br>\nthe conference website:<br>\n<a href=\"https://cicm-conference.org/2025/cicm.php?event=&amp;menu=topics\">https://cicm-conference.org/2025/cicm.php?event=&amp;menu=topics</a></p>\n<p>The program committee is chaired by Valeria de Paiva, Berkeley and Peter Koepke, Bonn.</p>\n<p><strong>* Formal Paper Submissions </strong>*</p>\n<p>Formal  submissions  in  one  of  the  following  categories  will  be  reviewed<br>\nrigorously and accepted papers will be published in a volume of Springer LNAI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>regular papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography) present novel research results</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>project and survey papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography)<br>\n  summarize existing results</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>system and dataset descriptions (4 to 5 pages + bibliography)<br>\n  present digital artifacts</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>* Doctoral Symposium: Two-Page Abstracts</strong>*</p>\n<p>The doctoral program  provides PhD students a forum to  present early results to<br>\nreceive constructive feedback and mentoring.  To attend, submissions of two-page<br>\nabstracts are expected in which the focus and research questions of the expected<br>\nPhD  theses are  described; details  on completed  research tasks  and remaining<br>\nresearch plans should be given. In addition to these abstract, a two-pages CV of<br>\nthe applicant should also be  submitted, detailing background information (name,<br>\nuniversity,   supervisor),   education   (sought  degree,   previous   degrees),<br>\nemployments   and   relevant   research   experience   (publications,   attended<br>\nconferences/workshops).</p>\n<p>The doctoral program will be chaired by Claudia Nalon, UnB Brasilia, and Marcelo<br>\nFinger, USP Sao Paulo.  Further details on the program will  be announced on the<br>\nCICM 2025 website.</p>\n<p><strong>* Important Dates </strong>*</p>\n<p>Formal submissions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract deadline:              April 28, 2025</li>\n<li>Full paper deadline:            May 5, 2025</li>\n<li>Reviews sent to authors:        June 16, 2025</li>\n<li>Rebuttals due:                  June 20, 2025</li>\n<li>Notification of acceptance:     July 4, 2025</li>\n<li>Camera-ready copies due:        July 18, 2025</li>\n<li>Conference:                     October 6-11, 2025</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doctoral programme applications</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission deadline:            TBA</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>* Submissions </strong>*   </p>\n<p>All submissions should be made via EasyChair at<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm25\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm25</a><br>\nusing the Springer LNCS style files<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a><br>\nIf software or data  is relevant to a paper, a link that  provides access to the<br>\nsoftware/data must be provided to enable reproduction of results.</p>\n<p><strong>* Best Papers </strong>*</p>\n<p>CICM 2025 honors the  best paper and best student paper  with respect to reviews<br>\nand program committee discussions with an award.</p>\n<hr>",
