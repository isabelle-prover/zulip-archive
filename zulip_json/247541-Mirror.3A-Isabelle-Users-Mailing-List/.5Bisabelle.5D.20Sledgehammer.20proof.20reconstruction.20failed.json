So, this is an issue in the proof.</p>\n<p>The bad news is: it makes no sense to report the issue, because our Z3 <br>\nversion is too old -- and the proof format has changed compared to the <br>\nversion that is currently used, so it is not only about updating the <br>\nbinary shipped with Isabelle.</p>\n<p>The second bad news: using veriT (the new alternative backend for smt) <br>\nworks but it takes 7s, so no chance here either...</p>\n<p>Thanks for reporting,</p>\n<p>Mathias</p>",
