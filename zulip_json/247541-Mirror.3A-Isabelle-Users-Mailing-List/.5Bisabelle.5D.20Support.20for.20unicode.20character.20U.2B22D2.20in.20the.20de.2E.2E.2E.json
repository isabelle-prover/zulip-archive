My formalisation is not the only one which<br>\nwould benefit from the inclusion of this symbol in the default Isabelle<br>\nfonts: the symbol is already used at least in the following AFP entry:<br>\nConcurrent<br>\nRefinement Algebra and Rely Quotients<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Concurrent_Ref_Alg.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Concurrent_Ref_Alg.html</a>&gt;.</p>\n<p>When extending IsabelleSymbols.sfd locally, I take the missing glyph from<br>\n\"DejaVu Sans Condensed\", and to extend \"IsabelleSymbolsBold.sfd\", I take<br>\nthe glyph from \"DejaVu Sans\". For the latex mapping in<br>\nlib/texinputs/isabellesym.sty, I<br>\nuse \\newcommand{\\isasymCap}{\\isamath{\\Cap}}. The name chosen for the symbol<br>\nwithin Isabelle is not important to me, and I would be happy with any other<br>\narbitrary name.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nDiego Dias</p>",
