We consider submissions that explore the<br>\ninteraction between the two fields - not standalone works on either SC<br>\nor ML.</p>\n<p>Examples of topics in the scope of SCML are (this list is not<br>\nexhaustive, we expect that it will grow rapidly with the evolution of<br>\nthe field):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Applying ML to computer mathematics, algebra, geometry;<br>\n   integrating ML into mathematical software systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying ML to automated reasoning, theorem proving, satisfiability<br>\n   solving; integrating ML into interactive and automated provers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying ML to program synthesis; integrating ML into program<br>\n   verification systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying SC to analyzing ML models (\"explainable AI\"),<br>\n   deriving error bounds, ensuring robustness, interpreting answers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying SC to verifying ML models (\"verified AI\"), preventing errors<br>\n   and hallucinations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying SC to synthesizing ML models with guaranteed error bounds,<br>\n   robustness, correctness properties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integrating SC capabilities (such as computer algebra and automated<br>\n   reasoning) into ML models.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying LLMs to the automatic formalization of mathematical/logical<br>\n   texts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applying LLMs as natural language interfaces to SC systems,<br>\n   integrating co-pilots into SC systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combining linguistic reasoning (LLMs) and formal reasoning<br>\n   (theorem provers).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combining LLMs and SC systems for education.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Teaching (for example, in mathematics) using a combination<br>\n   of SC and ML systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Software and system descriptions, datasets, benchmarks, and<br>\n   metrics related to the interplay of SC and ML.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SCML primarily solicits papers that present original research results<br>\nbut also accepts survey and position papers that add a new perspective<br>\nto the interplay of SC and ML.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<p>SCML papers can be <em>continuously submitted</em> (see the link below)<br>\nand enter the reviewing process immediately after their submission.<br>\nThe final versions of accepted papers are published in the electronic</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RISC Proceedings on Symbolic Computation and Machine Learning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They are archived with a DOI and are freely available for download from<br>\nthe SCML web page under a Creative Commons License. Authors of accepted<br>\npapers are expected to present them at a subsequent SCML workshop. These</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SCML workshops</li>\n</ul>\n<p>take place in semi-regular intervals in purely online form (via Zoom),<br>\ntypically in half a day. Authors of accepted SCML papers that present<br>\noriginal research may be invited to submit extended versions of their<br>\npapers to the</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SCML Track of the Journal of Symbolic Computation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CONTACT</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Web Page &amp; Submission: <a href=\"https://scml.risc.jku.at\">https://scml.risc.jku.at</a></li>\n<li>SCML Managing Editors: <a href=\"mailto:scml@risc.jku.at\">scml@risc.jku.at</a></li>\n<li>Steering Committee, Editorial Board, Scientific Committee:<br>\n   see the web page.</li>\n</ul>",
