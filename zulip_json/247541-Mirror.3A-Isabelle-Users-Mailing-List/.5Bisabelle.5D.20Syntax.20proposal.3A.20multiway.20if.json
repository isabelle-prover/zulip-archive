If we can figure out a way to not fire for single \"if P =&gt; x | otherwise =&gt; y\" case that could be quite nice.

Given that it is not part of the standard, I am<br>\nwondering if there already exist any (third-party) alternatives to this<br>\nnotation. If not, technically, if I was to (outright) copy a part of a post<br>\non the mailing list into my own library, I believe, I would be violating<br>\ncopyright laws (please correct me, if I am wrong). Thus, I have to ask you<br>\nfor explicit permission to reuse this code. Also, what kind of<br>\nattribution/license would such reuse require (provided, of course, that you<br>\ncan grant permission)?</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nMikhail Chekhov</p>",
