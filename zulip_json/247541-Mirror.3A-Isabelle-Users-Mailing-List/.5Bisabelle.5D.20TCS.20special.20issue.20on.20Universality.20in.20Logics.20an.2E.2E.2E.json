It welcomes original <br>\ncontributions exploring the connections between logics, computation, and <br>\npossibly physical theories.</p>\n<p>Topics include, but are not limited to, logical frameworks, proof <br>\nsystems interoperability, ecumenical proof libraries, automated <br>\ndeduction, quantum programming languages, and physics-inspired models of <br>\ncomputation. Submissions presenting advances on the notion of <br>\nuniversality across these domains are particularly encouraged. This <br>\nissue aims to pay tribute — through science only — to the intellectual <br>\nlegacy of Gilles Dowek, whose work built bridges between these communities.</p>\n<p>TCS is not so open to review papers, so we expect mainly original <br>\ncontributions. All contributions will go through rigorous peer-review. <br>\nThe deadline for submission is the 31st of December of this year. All <br>\ndetails are provided on:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/328918/universality-in-logics-and-physics\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/328918/universality-in-logics-and-physics</a> </p>\n<p>Frank Pfenning and Pablo Arrighi, Editors.</p>",
