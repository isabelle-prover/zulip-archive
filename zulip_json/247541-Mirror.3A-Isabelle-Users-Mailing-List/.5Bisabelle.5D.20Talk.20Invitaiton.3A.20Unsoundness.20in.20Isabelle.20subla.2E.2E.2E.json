Indeed a distinction can be made between Isabelle/Pure and Isabelle/HOL, in view of the enormous amount of specialised tools provided in the latter, and specifically, past issues involving type classes. (Such vulnerabilities are impossible for Isabelle/ZF, for example.)</p>\n<p>As far as I know, no soundness bug has necessitated the retraction of a published development using any proof assistant, although 30 years ago some PVS users were complaining that its soundness issues were significant enough to interfere with their work.</p>\n<p>I have even written a blog post on such issues recently:<br>\n<a href=\"https://lawrencecpaulson.github.io/2026/01/15/Broken_proofs.html\">https://lawrencecpaulson.github.io/2026/01/15/Broken_proofs.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On 3 Feb 2026, at 20:09, Jan Bessai &lt;<a href=\"mailto:jan.bessai@tu-dortmund.de\">jan.bessai@tu-dortmund.de</a>&gt; wrote:</p>\n<p>We would be very happy to accommodate a talk (or two) about Isabelle.
