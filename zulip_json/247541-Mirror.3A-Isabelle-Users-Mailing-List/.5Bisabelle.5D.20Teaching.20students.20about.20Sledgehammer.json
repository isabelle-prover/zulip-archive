My class does one day of a reading discussion, followed<br>\nby one day of group programming on an artifact.</p>\n<p>I'm curious if anyone has any recommendations for artifacts for<br>\nSledgehammer. It can be something like:</p>\n<p>- a small collection of proofs that sledgehammer can dispatch, but that<br>\n   students just learning Isabelle/HOL could feasible do by hand too, so they<br>\n   can compare;</p>\n<p>- a look inside of the implementation; or<br>\n   - pretty much anything else that gives students a sense of either what<br>\n   it's like to practically use Isabelle/HOL with sledgehammer, or how it's<br>\n   implemented.</p>\n<p>I figure it is probably best to ask the community. At this point in the<br>\nsemester, students know Coq and Agda, and have seen and read about HOL and<br>\nIsabelle/HOL, but haven't written any proofs in or automation for<br>\nIsabelle/HOL. So something relatively simple would be nice.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>Talia</p>",

In the talk he uses sledgehammer<br>\npretty exclusively to find proofs:<br>\n<a href=\"https://martin.kleppmann.com/2019/09/14/strange-loop-isabelle.html\">https://martin.kleppmann.com/2019/09/14/strange-loop-isabelle.html</a>.</p>\n<p>I would also check out Concrete Semantics: <a href=\"http://concrete-semantics.org/\">http://concrete-semantics.org/</a>.<br>\nIt's about language semantics / compiler correctness, but there's a lot of<br>\nlittle exercises that can be done by students. This book doesn't really<br>\ntalk about sledgehammer, directly but heavily uses the \"auto\" tactic which<br>\nis also very powerful in terms of proof automation. If sledgehammer has to<br>\nbe used, you can pretty much use it in place of auto for most of the proofs<br>\nand it will work fine.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alex</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p>From: Lawrence Paulson &lt;<a href=\"mailto:lp15@cam.ac.uk\">lp15@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>\nRegarding the general objectives underlying Sledgehammer (which have hardly changed since 2005), I suggest looking at early papers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Automation for Interactive Proof: First Prototype (first 2 pages only)<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Automation/info-and-comp.pdf\">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Automation/info-and-comp.pdf</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three Years of Experience with Sledgehammer<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Automation/paar.pdf\">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Automation/paar.pdf</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a glimpse of the powerful Mark II version built by Jasmin Blanchette, here’s a good starting point:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extending Sledgehammer with SMT Solvers (see page 3 for the key ideas)<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Automation/cade2011-sledge-smt.pdf\">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Automation/cade2011-sledge-smt.pdf</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the big advantages of this new version is the abolition of unsound translations into first-order logic, eliminating the risk that a sledgehammer proof will fail.</p>\n<p>Regarding examples: one great thing about sledgehammer is how well it works with structured proofs. If it can’t prove something, often it’s enough to find an intermediate fact and prove that first. So I was able to cook up this little proof in a few minutes, not copying previous examples, simply by recalling the intuitive proof. Every line was justified by sledgehammer alone. No need to memorise hundreds of tactics. You could invite your students to try to justify some of these lines some other way.</p>\n<p>lemma \"\\&lt;not&gt; (\\&lt;exists&gt;q::rat. q^2 = 2)\"<br>\nproof<br>\n  assume \"\\&lt;exists&gt;q::rat. q^2 = 2\"<br>\n  then obtain q::rat where \"q^2 = 2\"<br>\n    by blast <br>\n  obtain m n where \"coprime m n\" \"q = of_int m / of_int n\"<br>\n    by (meson quotient_of_coprime quotient_of_div surj_pair)<br>\n  then have \"of_int m ^ 2 / of_int n ^ 2 = (2::rat)\"<br>\n    by (metis \\&lt;open&gt;q\\&lt;^sup&gt;2 = 2\\&lt;close&gt; power_divide)<br>\n  then have 2: \"of_int m ^ 2 = (2::rat) * of_int n ^ 2\"<br>\n    by (metis division_ring_divide_zero double_eq_0_iff mult_2_right mult_zero_right nonzero_divide_eq_eq)<br>\n  then have \"2 dvd m\"<br>\n    by (metis (mono_tags, lifting) even_mult_iff even_numeral of_int_eq_iff of_int_mult of_int_numeral power2_eq_square)<br>\n  then obtain r where \"m = 2*r\"<br>\n    by blast<br>\n  then have \"2 dvd n\"<br>\n    by (smt (verit, ccfv_threshold) \"2\" Groups.mult_ac(3) dvd_def even_mult_iff mult_cancel_left of_int_1 of_int_add of_int_eq_of_int_power_cancel_iff of_int_mult one_add_one power2_eq_square)<br>\n  then show False<br>\n    using \\&lt;open&gt;coprime m n\\&lt;close&gt; \\&lt;open&gt;m = 2 * r\\&lt;close&gt; by auto<br>\nqed</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
