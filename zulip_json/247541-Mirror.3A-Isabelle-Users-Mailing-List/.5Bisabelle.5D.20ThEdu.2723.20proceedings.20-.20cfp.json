It was a very lively meeting. The programme was<br>\ncomprised of one invited talk, by Yves Bertot, Inria, France as<br>\nwell as seven regular contributions, whose abstracts and<br>\npresentations may be found in the workshop's webpage.</p>\n<p>Now the proceedings are being planned, intending to collect full<br>\nversions of the contributed papers, as well as new contributions.<br>\nThe contributions' range of topics is diverse, according to ThEdu's<br>\nscope, and this is a call for papers, open to everyone, also those<br>\nwho did not participate in the workshop. All papers will undergo<br>\nreviewing according to the EPTCS standards.</p>\n<p>ThEdu'23 Scope:</p>\n<p>Computer Theorem Proving is becoming a paradigm as well as a<br>\n   technological base for a new generation of educational software in<br>\n   science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This volume of<br>\n   EPTCS intends to bring together experts in automated deduction with<br>\n   experts in education in order to further clarify the shape of the<br>\n   new software generation and to discuss existing systems.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include:</p>\n<p>* methods of automated deduction applied to checking students' input;<br>\n    * methods of automated deduction applied to prove post-conditions<br>\n       for particular problem solutions;<br>\n    * combinations of deduction and computation enabling systems to<br>\n       propose next steps;<br>\n    * automated provers specific for dynamic geometry systems;<br>\n    * proof and proving in mathematics education.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>* Submission (Full Papers): 22 October 2023<br>\n    * Notification of acceptance: 26 November 2023<br>\n    * Revised papers due: 5 January 2024</p>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<p>We welcome submission of full papers (12--20 pages) presenting<br>\n   original unpublished work which is not being submitted for<br>\n   publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>All contributions will be reviewed (at least three blind reviews) to<br>\n   meet the high standards of EPTCS.</p>\n<p>The author should comply with the EPTCS's \"instructions for authors\"<br>\n   (<a href=\"http://info.eptcs.org/\">http://info.eptcs.org/</a>), and accept the \"Non-exclusive license to <br>\ndistribute\"<br>\n   (<a href=\"http://copyright.eptcs.org/\">http://copyright.eptcs.org/</a>) and use the EPTCS's \"LaTeX Style\"<br>\n   (<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org/\">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>)</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted via EasyChair,<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu23\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu23</a>.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Francisco Botana, University of Vigo at Pontevedra, Spain<br>\n   David Cerna, Johannes Kepler University, Austria<br>\n   João Marcos, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil<br>\n   Filip Maric, University of Belgrade, Serbia<br>\n   Julien Narboux, University of Strasbourg, France (co-chair)<br>\n   Adolfo Neto, Federal University of Technology – Parana, Brazil<br>\n   Walther Neuper, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria (co-chair)<br>\n   Pedro Quaresma, University of Coimbra, Portugal (co-chair)<br>\n   Joana Teles, University of Coimbra, Portugal<br>\n   Vanda Santos, University of Aveiro, Portugal<br>\n   Anders Schlichtkrull, Aalborg University, Denmark<br>\n   M.
