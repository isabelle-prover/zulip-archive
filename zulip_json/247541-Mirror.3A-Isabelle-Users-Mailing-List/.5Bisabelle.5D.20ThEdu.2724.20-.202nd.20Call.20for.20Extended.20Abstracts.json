The workshop brings<br>\n   together experts in automated deduction with experts in education in<br>\n   order to further clarify the shape of a new software generation and<br>\n   to discuss existing systems.</p>\n<p>Invited Speaker<br>\n   Jeremy Avigad, Carnegie Mellon University, TBA</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>* Extended Abstracts: 10 April 2024<br>\n  * Author Notification: 8 May 2024<br>\n  * Workshop Day: 2 July 2024</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include:</p>\n<p>* interactive and automated theorem provers designed or adapted<br>\n    for education;</p>\n<p>* methods of automated deduction applied to checking students' input;<br>\n  * combinations of deduction and computation enabling systems to<br>\n    propose next step guidance;</p>\n<p>* combination of symbolic artificial intelligence and machine<br>\n    learning for the teaching of proof and proving;</p>\n<p>* design of libraries of statements and/or formal proofs for use<br>\n    in educational systems;</p>\n<p>* graphical user interfaces for theorem proving in the classroom;<br>\n  * specific systems integrated in educational components such as<br>\n    dynamic geometry software, automatic provers providing readable<br>\n    output or explicit counter examples, etc.;</p>\n<p>* the role of logic and formal systems in the didactic of proof<br>\n    and proving in mathematics education;</p>\n<p>* experience reports about the use of automatic or interactive<br>\n    theorem provers for teaching.</p>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<p>We welcome submission of extended abstracts and demonstration<br>\n   proposals presenting original unpublished work which is not been<br>\n   submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>All accepted extended abstracts and demonstrations will be presented<br>\n   at the workshop. Abstracts will be made available online.</p>\n<p>Extended abstracts and demonstration proposals should be submitted<br>\n   via easychair,<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu24\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu24</a><br>\nformatted according to<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip\">http://www.easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip</a><br>\nExtended abstracts and demonstration proposals should be 5-10 pages<br>\n   in length and are to be submitted in PDF format.</p>\n<p>At least one of the authors of each accepted extended<br>\n   abstract/demonstration proposal is expected to attend THedu'24 and<br>\n   presents their extended abstract/demonstration.</p>\n<p>Program Committee (tentative)</p>\n<p>David Cerna, Johannes Kepler University, Austria<br>\n   Joao Marcos, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil<br>\n   Filip Maric, University of Belgrade, Serbia<br>\n   Julien Narboux, University of Strasbourg, France, (co-chair)<br>\n   Walther Neuper,  Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria (co-chair)<br>\n   Pedro Quaresma, University of Coimbra, Portugal (co-chair)<br>\n   Philppe R.
