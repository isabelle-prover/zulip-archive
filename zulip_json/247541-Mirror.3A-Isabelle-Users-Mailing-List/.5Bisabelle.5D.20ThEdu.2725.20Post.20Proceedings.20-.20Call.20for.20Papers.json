It was a very lively meeting. The programme was comprised of one invited talk, by Vesna Marinković, University of Belgrade, Serbia, as well as four regular contributions, whose abstracts and presentations may be found on the workshop's webpage.</p>\n<p>Now the proceedings are being planned, intending to collect full versions of the contributed papers, as well as new contributions.</p>\n<p>The contributions' range of topics is diverse, according to ThEdu's scope, and this is a call for papers, open to everyone, also those who did not participate in the workshop. All papers will undergo review according to the EPTCS standards.</p>\n<p>ThEdu'25 Scope:</p>\n<p>Computer Theorem Proving is becoming a paradigm as well as a technological base for a new generation of educational software in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This volume of EPTCS intends to bring together experts in automated deduction with experts in education in order to further clarify the shape of the new software generation and to discuss existing systems.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>interactive and automated theorem provers designed or adapted for education;</li>\n<li>methods of automated deduction applied to checking students' input;</li>\n<li>combinations of deduction and computation enabling systems to propose next step guidance;</li>\n<li>combinations of symbolic artificial intelligence and machine learning for the teaching of proof and proving;</li>\n<li>design of libraries of statements and/or formal proofs for use in educational systems;</li>\n<li>graphical user interfaces for theorem proving in the classroom;</li>\n<li>\n<p>specific systems integrated in educational components such as dynamic geometry software, automatic provers providing readable output or<br>\nexplicit counterexamples, etc.;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the role of logic and formal systems in the didactics of proof and proving in mathematics education;</p>\n</li>\n<li>experience reports about the use of automatic or interactive theorem provers for teaching;</li>\n<li>evaluation of the impact of intelligent tutoring systems for proof and proving;</li>\n<li>tools for educational activities in logic and formal methods.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Dates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission (full papers): 15 January 2026</li>\n<li>Notification of acceptance: 15 February 2026</li>\n<li>Revised papers due: 1 March 2026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission:</p>\n<p>We welcome submission of full papers (12-20 pages) presenting original unpublished work that is not being submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>All contributions will be reviewed (at least three blind reviews) to meet the high standards of EPTCS.</p>\n<p>The author should comply with the EPTCS's \"instructions for authors\" (<br>\n<a href=\"https://info.eptcs.org/\">https://info.eptcs.org/</a><br>\n), and accept the \"Non-exclusive license to distribute\" (<br>\n<a href=\"https://copyright.eptcs.org/\">https://copyright.eptcs.org/</a><br>\n) and use the EPTCS's \"LaTeX<br>\nStyle\" (<br>\n<a href=\"https://style.eptcs.org/\">https://style.eptcs.org/</a><br>\n)</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted via EasyChair:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=thedu25postproc\">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=thedu25postproc</a></p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>Julien Narboux, Université Paris Cité, France<br>\nWalther Neuper, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria<br>\nJoão Marcos, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil<br>\nJim Portegies, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands<br>\nPedro Quaresma, University of Coimbra, Portugal<br>\nVanda Santos, CIDTFF/CISUC, Portugal<br>\nAnders Schlichtkrull, Aalborg University, Denmark<br>\nWolfgang Schreiner, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria<br>\nM.
