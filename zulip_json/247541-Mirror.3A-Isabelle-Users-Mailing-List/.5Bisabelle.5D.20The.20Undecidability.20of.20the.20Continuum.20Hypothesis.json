We plan to submit this library <br>\nto the AFP once we finish the review of the formalization.</p>\n<p>For those who are interested, it is based on the ctm approach to <br>\nforcing. You can find more information at <br>\n<a href=\"https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/forcing/\">https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/forcing/</a> <br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/forcing/\">https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/forcing/</a>&gt;, including links to the <br>\nrepository and slides from a recent presentation on the consistency of ¬CH.</p>\n<p>This project was done by Emmanuel Gunther, Miguel Pagano, Matías <br>\nSteinberg, and myself.</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>On behalf of the team,</p>\n<p>Pedro Sánchez Terraf<br>\nCIEM-FAMAF — Universidad Nacional de Córdoba<br>\n<a href=\"http://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro\">cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro\">https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro</a>&gt;</p>",

Let me be the first to congratulate you and your <br>\nteam on this.</p>\n<p>I don't know anything about set theory, but even I know what a cool <br>\nresult this is and I'm very happy that we will soon have it in the AFP. <br>\nI'm sure I speak for all of us when I say that we are looking forward to <br>\nyour AFP submission and your paper and presentation at whatever venue <br>\nyou will publish this!</p>\n<p>Also note that this is one of Freek Wiedijk's 100 problems [1], so as <br>\nsoon as your material is all in the AFP, we can notify him to update his <br>\nlist. With this, Isabelle will finally pull into a well-deserved first <br>\nplace ahead of HOL Light. Not that it matters very much, but I can't <br>\nresist engaging in some silly pointless competitiveness every once in a <br>\nwhile. :)</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/\">https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/</a></p>",
