The claim was that I could<br>\n    write this initial claim about duality as a small theorem:<br>\n    image.png</p>\n<p>On Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at 11:22 AM John F. Hughes<br>\n    &lt;<a href=\"mailto:jfh@cs.brown.edu\">jfh@cs.brown.edu</a>&gt; wrote:</p>\n<p>I need a little setup to ask this question. I'll try to make<br>\n        it brief:</p>\n<p>In projective geometry, there are four basic axioms, P1 ...<br>\n        P4, for a projective plane. P1, for instance, says that given<br>\n        two distinct points, there's a unique line containing both.<br>\n        P2 says that given two distinct lines, there's at least one<br>\n        point that lies on both. A short proof using P1 shows that P2<br>\n        can be strengthened to say that given two distinct lines,<br>\n        there's a <em>unique</em> point lying on both.</p>\n<p>We can swap the words \"point\" and \"line\" and the phrases<br>\n        \"lies on\" and \"contains\" in any statement about a projective<br>\n        plane to get a so-called \"dual\" statement. So P2 is the dual<br>\n        to P1. As it happens, the duals to P3 and P4 are also true in<br>\n        any projective plane, so if we have a set Pts of point and<br>\n        Lns of lines, and a 'liesOn' predicate which together<br>\n        constitute a projective plane Pi,  then the set Lns, the set<br>\n        Pts, and 'contains' /also/ constitute a projective plane, the<br>\n        'dual' plane, called Pi*. I've got a locale, \"pplane\" that<br>\n        takes a set of points, a set of lines, and a 'liesOn'<br>\n        relation, so this can be stated as<br>\n        theorem</p>\n<p>This also means that any theorem about projective planes also<br>\n        has a 'dual' theorem, gotten by replacing \"point\" with \"line\"<br>\n        and vice-version, and doing the same for \"lies on\" and<br>\n        \"contains\". Because the duals of the axioms are also facts,<br>\n        we get a conclusion that if some theorem S is true for all<br>\n        projective planes, then so is the dual statement.</p>\n<p>Hartshorne's little book about projective geometry says it<br>\n        like this (please ignore the mention of P5):<br>\n        image.png<br>\n        More important is the corollary:<br>\n        image.png</p>\n<p>My question is this: is it possible to formulate such a<br>\n        theorem in Isabelle? The statement of the corollary could<br>\n        actually be strengthened to say that the /proof/ of S*<br>\n        consists of simply dualizing the proof of S (i.e., swap<br>\n        point/line, etc., in every fact in that proof).</p>\n<p>I haven't, in my wanderings through Isabelle, seen anything<br>\n        that seems to do this kind of introspection, i.e., that<br>\n        treats an Isabelle proof or statement as an object that can<br>\n        be transformed/acted on by various functions, etc. Then<br>\n        again, I may simply be looking in the wrong places. I'd<br>\n        appreciate any suggestions, *or *reasons why this sort of<br>\n        thing cannot be done.<br>\n        --John</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/fMB2w8Royb6wsQxBPQC84q-Y/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/YM-ZUXWAC5zA3RqmwzE4TGmy/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/0Hzuw49Opl5wVEY2s9OxVPRP/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/fMB2w8Royb6wsQxBPQC84q-Y/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"556x144\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/14278/fMB2w8Royb6wsQxBPQC84q-Y/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/YM-ZUXWAC5zA3RqmwzE4TGmy/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"539x93\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/14278/YM-ZUXWAC5zA3RqmwzE4TGmy/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/0Hzuw49Opl5wVEY2s9OxVPRP/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"538x181\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/14278/0Hzuw49Opl5wVEY2s9OxVPRP/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
