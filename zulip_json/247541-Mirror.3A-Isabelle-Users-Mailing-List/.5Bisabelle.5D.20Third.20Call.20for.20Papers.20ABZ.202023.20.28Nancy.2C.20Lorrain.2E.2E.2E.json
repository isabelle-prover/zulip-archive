The conference <br>\naims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research <br>\ncommunities around different formal methods.</p>\n<p>The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008,<br>\nwhere the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint<br>\nevent. In the following years other formal methods were added,<br>\ne.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and<br>\nTLA + in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016<br>\nconferences in Linz, Austria and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was<br>\ndecided to name the conference \"ABZ: International Conference on<br>\nRigorous State Based Methods\", to stress the openness for further<br>\nstate-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful<br>\ndiscussions between representatives of the individual methods in the<br>\npast, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research<br>\ncommunity: the creation of reliable and safe software.  ABZ2020 and<br>\nABZ2021 were the two first new entitled conferences planned in Ulm but<br>\nvirtually organised.</p>\n<p>ABZ 2023 will have a main conference track, a case study track, <br>\ntutorials and workshops.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Main ABZ Track</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Contributions are solicited on all aspects of the theory and <br>\napplications of ASMs, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, Z and other state-based rigour <br>\napproaches in software/hardware engineering, including the development <br>\nof tools and industrial applications. The program spans from theoretical <br>\nand methodological foundations to practical applications, emphasizing <br>\nsystem engineering methods and tools that are distinguished by <br>\nmathematical rigor and have proved to be industrially viable. The main <br>\ngoal of the conference is to contribute to the integration of accurate <br>\nstate- and machine-based system development methods, clarifying their <br>\ncommonalities and differences to better understand how to combine <br>\ndifferent approaches for accomplishing the various tasks in modeling, <br>\nexperimental validation, mathematical verification of reliable <br>\nhigh-quality hardware/software systems. Although organized to host <br>\nseveral formal methods in a single event, editorial control of the joint <br>\nconference is vested in one integrated program committee.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Case Study Track</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As successfully practiced since ABZ 2014, the 10th edition of ABZ will <br>\nagain include special sessions dedicated to an industrial case study.  <br>\nWe explicitly invite you to also submit contributions to case studies <br>\nfrom previous conferences, which substantially extend the solutions <br>\npresented there in one aspect or another. Possible enhancements could be <br>\nnew proof techniques, more elegant modeling, generation, verification, <br>\nor validation of executable code, etc.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://abz2023.loria.fr/case-study\">https://abz2023.loria.fr/case-study</a> for a detailed description of <br>\nthe new case study and links to the previous ones.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Workshop and Tutorial Proposals</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Workshops and tutorials will be associated with the main event ABZ. <br>\nProposals are solicited in areas related to the conference topics.</p>\n<p>A workshop proposal should contain the title of the workshop, a short <br>\ndescription of the scientific content, the names and brief CVs of the <br>\nworkshop organizers, the intended PC for the workshop, the duration of <br>\nthe workshop, and the expected number of participants.</p>\n<p>A tutorial proposal should contain the title of the tutorial, a short <br>\ndescription of the scientific content, the names and brief CVs of the <br>\ntutorial presenters and the duration.</p>\n<p>Please submit your proposals to dominique dot mery at <a href=\"http://loria.fr\">loria.fr</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions:  <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=abz2023\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=abz2023</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Four kinds of contributions are invited:</p>\n<p>*    Full Research papers: full papers of not more than 16 pages in LNCS <br>\nformat, which have to be original, unpublished and not submitted elsewhere.</p>\n<p>*   Short presentations of work in progress, and tool demonstrations.An <br>\nextended abstract of not more than 6 pages is expected and will be reviewed.</p>\n<p>*    Application in industry papers: reporting on work or experiences on <br>\nthe application of state based formal methods in industry. An extended <br>\nabstract of not more than 8 pages is expected and will be reviewed. It <br>\nis also an interesting option for industrial practitioners who sometimes <br>\nface too many constraints to prepare a full paper.</p>\n<p>*    Answers to case study papers: full papers of not more than 16<br>\n    pages in LNCS format reporting on the experiments conducted with<br>\n     any of the state based techniques in the scope of ABZ 2023. We<br>\n     also expect a link to a webpage, where the produced models can be<br>\n     downloaded.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contribution to doctoral symposium:This is an excellent opportunity <br>\nfor PhD students to present their ongoing work and receive valuable <br>\nfeedback from the ABZ community. Please submit a short paper of no more <br>\nthan 4 pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accepted papers will appear in the Springer LNCS proceedings.  The <br>\ndeadlines for the different kinds of contributions see above.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Organization</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Conference Chairs:<br>\nUwe Glässer (CoChair), Simon Fraser University, Canada<br>\nDominique Méry (CoChair), Université de Lorraine &amp; LORIA, France</p>\n<p>Case Study Chairs:<br>\nJosé Creissac Campos, Departamento de Informática - Universidade do <br>\nMinho, Portugal.<br>\nPhilippe Palanque, Interactive Critical Systems - IRIT-  Univ.
