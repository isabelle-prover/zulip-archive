I have already<br>\nprovided a brief overview of this work in the following post on the mailing<br>\nlist:<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2021-January/msg00002.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2021-January/msg00002.html</a>.<br>\nHowever, today I decided to make a significant part of this (ongoing) work<br>\navailable publicly: <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/category-theory-for-zfc-in-hol\">https://gitlab.com/category-theory-for-zfc-in-hol</a>.<br>\nPlease note that this post is merely a project announcement about a work in<br>\nprogress.</p>\n<p>Remarks:</p>\n<p>- If you would like to build this development, you will also need to<br>\n   download and build the following prerequisite:<br>\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/user9716869/Isabelle-Complement-Library\">https://gitlab.com/user9716869/Isabelle-Complement-Library</a>. However, the<br>\n   formal proof documents should be readily available from the repositories.</p>\n<p>- I always welcome any form of contributions: reviews, objective<br>\n   criticism, general advice, corrections, further material, etc.</p>\n<p>- I cannot emphasize more that the repositories present a snapshot of an<br>\n   ongoing development, not a completed work. Thus, please do not judge this<br>\n   work too harshly on a variety of rough spots and dark corners that you may<br>\n   encounter, if you decide to take a close look at this development.</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nMikhail Chekhov</p>",
