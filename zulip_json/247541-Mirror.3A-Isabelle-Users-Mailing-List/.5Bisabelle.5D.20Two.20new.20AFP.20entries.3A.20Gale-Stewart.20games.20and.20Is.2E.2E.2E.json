This property is now known as the Gale Stewart <br>\nTheorem. While the original paper shows some additional theorems as well, we only <br>\nformalize this main result, but do so in a somewhat general way. We formalize games of a <br>\nfixed arbitrary length, including infinite length, using co-inductive lists, and show that <br>\ndefensive strategies exist unless the other player is winning. For closed games, defensive <br>\nstrategies are winning for the closed player, proving that such games are determined. For <br>\nfinite games, which are a special case in our formalisation, all games are closed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/GaleStewart_Games.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/GaleStewart_Games.html</a></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Isabelle's Metalogic: Formalization and Proof Checker<br>\nby Tobias Nipkow and Simon Ro√ükopf</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this entry we formalize Isabelle's metalogic in Isabelle/HOL. Furthermore, we define a <br>\nlanguage of proof terms and an executable proof checker and prove its soundness wrt. the <br>\nmetalogic. The formalization is intentionally kept close to the Isabelle <br>\nimplementation(for example using de Brujin indices) to enable easy integration of <br>\ngenerated code with the Isabelle system without a complicated translation layer. The <br>\nformalization is described in our CADE 28 paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12224.pdf].</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Metalogic_ProofChecker.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Metalogic_ProofChecker.html</a></p>\n<p>Andreas</p>",
