Unification is<br>\nconcerned with the problem of identifying terms, finding solutions for<br>\nequations, or making formulas equivalent. It is a fundamental process<br>\nused in a number of fields of computer science, including automated<br>\nreasoning, term rewriting, logic programming, natural language<br>\nprocessing, program analysis, types, etc.</p>\n<p>The International Workshop on Unification (UNIF) is a yearly forum for<br>\nresearchers in unification theory and related fields to meet old and<br>\nnew colleagues, to present recent (even unfinished) work, and to<br>\ndiscuss new ideas and trends. It is also a good opportunity for young<br>\nresearchers and scientists working in related areas to get an overview<br>\nof the current state of the art in unification theory.</p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:</p>\n<p>* syntactic and equational unification<br>\n  * matching<br>\n  * constraint solving<br>\n  * unification in modal, temporal, and description logics<br>\n  * narrowing<br>\n  * disunification<br>\n  * anti-unification<br>\n  * semi-unification<br>\n  * higher-order unification<br>\n  * complexity issues<br>\n  * implementation techniques<br>\n  * applications</p>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Short papers or extended abstracts, up to 5 pages in EasyChair style,<br>\nshould be submitted electronically as PDF files through the EasyChair<br>\nsubmission site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2023\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2023</a></p>\n<p>Abstracts will be evaluated by the Program Committee regarding their<br>\nsignificance for the workshop. Accepted abstracts will be presented at<br>\nthe workshop and included in the informal proceedings of the workshop,<br>\navailable in electronic form.  Based on the number and quality of<br>\nsubmissions we will decide whether to organize a special journal<br>\nissue.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>* Paper Submission:                  April 21, 2023<br>\n  * Author notification:                 May 26, 2023<br>\n  * Final version:                       June 9, 2023<br>\n  * UNIF 2023:                           July 2, 2023</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Mauricio Ayala-Rincon (Universidade de Brasilia)<br>\nDeepak Kapur (UNM, Albuquerque)</p>",
