Unification is<br>\nconcerned with the problem of making two given terms equal, either<br>\nsyntactically or modulo an equational theory. It is a fundamental<br>\nprocess used in various areas of computer science, including automated<br>\nreasoning, term rewriting, logic programming, natural language<br>\nprocessing, program analysis, knowledge representation, types, etc.</p>\n<p>The International Workshop on Unification (UNIF) is a forum for<br>\nresearchers in unification theory and related fields to present recent<br>\n(even unfinished) work, and to discuss new ideas and trends. It is also<br>\na good opportunity for students, young researchers and scientists working<br>\nin related areas to get an overview of the current state of the art in<br>\nunification theory.</p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>syntactic and equational unification algorithms</li>\n<li>matching and constraint solving</li>\n<li>higher-order unification</li>\n<li>unification in modal, temporal, and description logics</li>\n<li>admissibility of inference rules</li>\n<li>narrowing</li>\n<li>disunification</li>\n<li>anti-unification</li>\n<li>complexity issues  </li>\n<li>combination methods</li>\n<li>implementation techniques</li>\n<li>applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Short papers or extended abstracts, up to 5 pages in EasyChair style,<br>\nshould be submitted electronically as PDF files through the EasyChair<br>\nsubmission site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2024\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2024</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2024\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2024</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Abstracts will be evaluated by the Program Committee regarding their<br>\nsignificance for the workshop. We allow submissions of work presented/<br>\nsubmitted in/to another conference.</p>\n<p>Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop and included in<br>\nthe informal proceedings of the workshop, available in electronic form<br>\non the Web page of UNIF 2024. At least one of the authors should register<br>\nfor the workshop.</p>\n<p>Based on the number and quality of submissions we will decide whether to<br>\norganize a special journal issue.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper submission:               April 25, 2024 (EXTENDED)</li>\n<li>Author notification:               May 23, 2024</li>\n<li>Camera-ready version:        June 7, 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All dates above are ‘Anywhere on Earth’ (23:59 UTC-12).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UNIF 2024:                         July 2, 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>George Metcalfe (University of Bern)</li>\n<li>Daniele Nantes-Sobrinho (Universidade de Brasília)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/-WbGqaWwOHXBnpoc1oV_7iAX/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
