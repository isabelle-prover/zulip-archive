Unification is<br>\nconcerned with the problem of making two given terms equal, either<br>\nsyntactically or modulo an equational theory. It is a fundamental<br>\nprocess used in various areas of computer science, including automated<br>\nreasoning, term rewriting, logic programming, natural language<br>\nprocessing, program analysis, knowledge representation, types, etc.</p>\n<p>The International Workshop on Unification (UNIF) is a forum for<br>\nresearchers in unification theory and related fields to present recent<br>\n(even unfinished) work, and to discuss new ideas and trends. It is also<br>\na good opportunity for students, young researchers and scientists working<br>\nin related areas to get an overview of the current state of the art in<br>\nunification theory.</p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:<br>\n   * syntactic and equational unification algorithms<br>\n   * matching and constraint solving<br>\n   * higher-order unification<br>\n   * unification in modal, temporal, and description logics<br>\n   * admissibility of inference rules<br>\n   * narrowing<br>\n   * disunification<br>\n   * anti-unification<br>\n   * complexity issues<br>\n   * combination methods<br>\n   * implementation techniques<br>\n   * applications</p>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Short papers or extended abstracts, up to 5 pages in EasyChair style,<br>\nshould be submitted electronically as PDF files through the EasyChair<br>\nsubmission site:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2025\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2025</a></p>\n<p>Abstracts will be evaluated by the Program Committee regarding their<br>\nsignificance for the workshop. We allow submissions of work presented/<br>\nsubmitted in/to another conference.</p>\n<p>Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop and included in<br>\nthe informal proceedings of the workshop, available in electronic form<br>\non the Web page of UNIF 2025. At least one of the authors should register<br>\nfor the workshop.</p>\n<p>Based on the number and quality of submissions we will decide whether to<br>\norganize a special journal issue.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>* Paper submission:           May 7, 2025 (AoE)<br>\n   * Author notification:        May 29, 2025 (AoE)<br>\n   * Camera-ready version:       June 13, 2025 (AoE)<br>\n   * UNIF 2025:                  July 14, 2025</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>To be announced.</p>",
