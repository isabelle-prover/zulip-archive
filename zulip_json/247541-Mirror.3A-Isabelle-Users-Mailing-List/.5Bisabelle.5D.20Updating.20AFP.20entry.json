In that case you cannot change it because entries in the release version <br>\nare frozen. Once we move it over to the development version, it sounds like it <br>\nwill need adjustment. In that case we (the AFP editors) may leave that work to <br>\nyou - you should get an email from the system that your AFP entry did not build.</p>\n<p>Tobias</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>--<br>\nPedro Sánchez Terraf<br>\nCIEM-FAMAF — Universidad Nacional de Córdoba<br>\n<a href=\"http://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/home_en\">cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/home_en</a> <br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/home_en.html\">https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~pedro/home_en.html</a>&gt;<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/Dz4l5T6Bu_vBZMXl5Kzj_xmX/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
