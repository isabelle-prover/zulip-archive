We have <br>\naccumulated a bit too much complexity, but in the end everything should fit <br>\ntogether properly --- on all platforms.</p>\n<p>Some weeks ago, I did make some attempts to rebuild our bundled version <br>\nVSCode, but failed: the cross-build for Windows on Linux stopped working <br>\nshortly after our version 1.70.1. It is unclear if this is accidental or <br>\nintentional: there is plenty of time to investigate, and nothing is \"broken\" <br>\nin the meantime, because the bundled version works fine (nobody has reported <br>\nproblems so far).</p>\n<p>Concerning the motivation(s) to patch VSCode, here is a list in decreasing <br>\norder of importance:</p>\n<p>1) Support for Isabelle text encoding as a mapping from Latex-style names <br>\nto Unicode points.</p>\n<p>2) Support for Isabelle fonts that fit precisely for the Isabelle text <br>\nencoding and use high-quality glyphs from LaTeX.</p>\n<p>3) Robust system integration: Everything should work on the spot, without <br>\nself-assembly or tinkering.</p>\n<p>4) Provide side-entries to access the bundled components of VSCode <br>\nseparately: Electron / Chromium / Node.js (see also <br>\n<a href=\"https://files.sketis.net/Isabelle_Workshop_2022/Isabelle_2022_paper_7.pdf\">https://files.sketis.net/Isabelle_Workshop_2022/Isabelle_2022_paper_7.pdf</a>)</p>\n<p>More will come over time, as Isabelle/VSCode becomes a more serious contender <br>\nof Isabelle/jEdit, not just an experiment on alternative PIDE front-ends.</p>\n<p>Of course, almost everything could be done differently.

For example, the well-known text book on addictive software <br>\ndesign (from 2014) <a href=\"https://www.nirandfar.com/hooked\">https://www.nirandfar.com/hooked</a> says, that the \"IKEA <br>\nprinciple\" of self-assembly is important to make users feel attached to <br>\n\"their\" product that they have struggled to put together themselves.</p>\n<p>I've dismissed that already in 2009, even using the same name \"IKEA principle\" <br>\nas something to be avoided.
