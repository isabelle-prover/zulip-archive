Climate modeling, weather prediction, drug<br>\ndiscovery, the design of buildings, vehicles, and aircraft,<br>\nsimulations of astrophysical phenomena, and prediction of seismic<br>\nactivity are some of the many applications. Verification of such<br>\nsoftware presents numerous challenges, e.g.: the programs are large,<br>\ncomplex, and utilize multiple CPU and GPU concurrency interfaces;<br>\nprecise reasoning about real or floating-point operations is often<br>\nrequired; there is often no oracle; and correctness may require<br>\nreasoning about deep mathematical concepts such as convergence and<br>\nstability. This workshop will focus on verification techniques that<br>\naddress these challenges, including approaches based on deductive<br>\nreasoning, model checking, symbolic execution, abstract<br>\ninterpretation, and static analysis.</p>\n<p>The workshop will take place as part of ETAPS 2025, on Sunday, May 4,<br>\n2025, at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. We aim to bring<br>\ntogether researchers from both the scientific computing and the<br>\nsoftware verification communities. Through invited talks and<br>\npresentations of peer-reviewed papers, participants will learn about<br>\nthe correctness challenges developers face, as well as a variety of<br>\nverification approaches for tackling those challenges. We are<br>\ninterested in all aspects of the verification problem for scientific<br>\nsoftware, including, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>ways to specify scientific software</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>reasoning about mathematical concepts realized in software,<br>\nincluding linear algebra, differential equations, convergence,<br>\nstability, and order of accuracy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>effective verification techniques for programs that use MPI,<br>\nOpenMP, CUDA, or other CPU or GPU concurrency interfaces used in<br>\nscientific computing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>precise reasoning about floating-point computations</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>techniques to reason about discretization in time and space, such<br>\nas discrete grids and adaptive mesh refinement</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>case studies applying verification tools to scientific software</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>methods to decompose verification problems for scientific<br>\nprograms, such as function contracts.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please see the workshop web site <a href=\"https://vsl.cis.udel.edu/vss2025/\">https://vsl.cis.udel.edu/vss2025/</a> for<br>\nsubmission details.</p>\n<p>Invited Speaker: Andrew Appel, Princeton Univ.</p>\n<p>Workshop Organizers:</p>\n<p>Ganesh Gopalakrishnan, University of Utah, <a href=\"mailto:ganesh@cs.utah.edu\">ganesh@cs.utah.edu</a><br>\nStephen Siegel, University of Delaware, <a href=\"mailto:siegel@udel.edu\">siegel@udel.edu</a></p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>Alastair Donaldson, Imperial College London, UK<br>\nCindy Rubio-González, University of California Davis, US<br>\nDorra Ben Khalifa, ENAC, FR<br>\nErika Ábrahám, RWTH Aachen University, DE<br>\nIgnacio Laguna, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, US<br>\nJean-Baptiste Jeannin, University of Michigan, US<br>\nKristin Rozier, Iowa State University, US<br>\nMarieke Huisman, University of Twente, NL<br>\nPaul Hovland, Argonne National Laboratory, US<br>\nSamuel Pollard, Sandia National Laboratories, US<br>\nSylvie Boldo, INRIA, FR</p>",
