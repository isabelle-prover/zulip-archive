The International Conference on Verified Software: Theories, Tools and Experiments (VSTTE) is the main forum for advancing the initiative. VSTTE brings together experts spanning the spectrum of software verification in order to foster international collaboration on the critical research challenges. The theoretical work includes semantic foundations and logics for specification and verification, and verification algorithms and methodologies. The tools cover specification and annotation languages, program analyzers, model checkers, interactive verifiers and proof checkers, automated theorem provers and SAT/SMT solvers, and integrated verification environments. The experimental work drives the research agenda for theory and tools by taking on significant specification/verification exercises covering hardware, operating systems, compilers, computer security, parallel computing, and cyber-physical systems.<br>\nCall for papers and work-in-progress presentations<br>\nVSTTE 2025 welcomes submissions describing significant advances in the production of verified software, i.e. software that has been proved to meet its functional specifications. Submissions of theoretical, practical, and experimental contributions are equally encouraged, including those that focus on specific problems or problem domains. We are especially interested in submissions describing large-scale verification efforts that involve collaboration, theory unification, tool integration, and formalized domain knowledge. We also welcome papers describing novel experiments and case studies evaluating verification techniques and technologies.<br>\nIn addition to regular papers, we welcome submissions on in-progress verified software projects to a “work-in-progress (presentation-only)” track. Work-in-progress contributions will not appear in the post-proceedings of the conference. Submissions describing work of interest to the software verification community, but that could not be accepted for publication in the conference proceedings, may be invited to the “work-in-progress (presentation-only)” track, on a case-by-case basis.<br>\nTopics of interest for this conference include, but are not limited to, requirements modeling, specification languages, specification/verification/certification case studies, formal calculi, software design methods, automatic code generation, refinement methodologies, compositional analysis, verification tools (e.g., static analysis, dynamic analysis, model checking, theorem proving, satisfiability), tool integration, benchmarks, challenge problems, and integrated verification environments.<br>\nSubmissions<br>\nVSTTE 2025 accepts both long (limited to 16 pages, excluding references) and short (limited to 10 pages, excluding references) paper submissions. Short submissions also cover “verification pearls” describing an elegant proof or proof technique. Submitted research papers and system descriptions must be original and not submitted for publication elsewhere.<br>\nPapers may be submitted via EasyChair at the VSTTE 2025 conference submission page&lt;<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vstte25\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vstte25</a>&gt;. The use of LaTeX and the Springer LNCS class files&lt;<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>&gt; is strongly encouraged. Submissions that are not in the proper format or are too long will not be considered.<br>\nAccepted regular-track papers will be included in the post-conference proceedings of VSTTE 2025, which will be published as a LNCS volume by Springer-Verlag. Authors of those papers will have to transfer copyright of their contribution to Springer-Verlag.<br>\nImportant Dates</p>\n<p>*<br>\nAbstract submission: July 14th AoE<br>\n  *<br>\nPaper submission: July 18th AoE<br>\n  *<br>\nNotification of acceptance: Aug 31th (AoE)<br>\n  *<br>\nFinal pre-conference paper submission: September 26th (AoE)<br>\n  *<br>\nConference: October 6th-7th<br>\n  *<br>\nCamera-ready for papers included in post-conference proceedings: TBA</p>\n<p>Invited speakers</p>\n<p>*<br>\nCaroline Trippel&lt;<a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/people/trippel/\">https://cs.stanford.edu/people/trippel/</a>&gt; (Stanford University)<br>\n  *<br>\nGrant Passmore&lt;<a href=\"https://www.imandra.ai/about\">https://www.imandra.ai/about</a>&gt; (Imandra)</p>\n<p>Invited tutorial speakers</p>\n<p>*<br>\nPierre-Yves Strub&lt;<a href=\"https://www.strub.nu/\">https://www.strub.nu/</a>&gt; (PQShield)</p>\n<p>Chairs<br>\nSteering Committee</p>\n<p>*<br>\nSupratik Chakraborty&lt;<a href=\"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~supratik/\">https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~supratik/</a>&gt; (IIT Bombay, India)<br>\n  *<br>\nNatarajan Shankar&lt;<a href=\"https://www.csl.sri.com/~shankar/\">https://www.csl.sri.com/~shankar/</a>&gt; (SRI International)</p>\n<p>Program Chairs</p>\n<p>*<br>\nClément Pit-Claudel&lt;<a href=\"https://pit-claudel.fr/clement/\">https://pit-claudel.fr/clement/</a>&gt; (EPFL)<br>\n  *<br>\nKatherine Kosaian&lt;<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/katherinekosaian\">https://sites.google.com/view/katherinekosaian</a>&gt; (University of Iowa)</p>",
