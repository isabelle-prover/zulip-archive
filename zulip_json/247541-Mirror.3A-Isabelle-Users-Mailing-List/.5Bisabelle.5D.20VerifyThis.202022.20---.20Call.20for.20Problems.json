Previous<br>\ncompetitions in the series have been held at FoVeOOS 2011, FM 2012,<br>\nDagstuhl (April 2014), and ETAPS 2015—2021. </p>\n<p>To extend the problem pool and tend better to the needs of the<br>\nparticipants, we are soliciting verification problems for the<br>\ncompetition:</p>\n<p>A problem should contain an informal statement of the algorithm to be<br>\nimplemented (optionally with complete or partial pseudo code) and the<br>\nrequirement(s) to be verified.<br>\nA problem should be suitable for a 60—90 minute time slot.<br>\nSubmission of reference solutions is strongly encouraged.<br>\nProblems with an inherent language- or tool-specific bias should be<br>\nclearly identified as such.<br>\nProblems that contain several subproblems or other means of difficulty<br>\nscaling are especially welcome.<br>\nThe organizers reserve the right (but no obligation) to use the<br>\nproblems in the competition, either as submitted or with modifications.<br>\nSubmissions from (potential) competition participants are allowed.</p>\n<p>Problems from previous competitions can be seen at the archive.</p>\n<p>Please send submissions via email to <a href=\"mailto:verifythis@googlegroups.com\">verifythis@googlegroups.com</a> by<br>\nJanuary 31, 2022.</p>\n<p>The most suitable submission for competition will receive a prize.</p>",
