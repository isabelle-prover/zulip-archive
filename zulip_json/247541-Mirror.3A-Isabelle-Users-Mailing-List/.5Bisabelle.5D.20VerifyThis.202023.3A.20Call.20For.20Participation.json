It is the 11th event in the VerifyThis<br>\ncompetition series. Information on previous events and participants can be<br>\nfound at: <a href=\"http://verifythis.ethz.ch\">http://verifythis.ethz.ch</a>  </p>\n<p>The aims of the competition are:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>to bring together those interested in formal verification, and to provide<br>\nan engaging, hands-on, and fun opportunity for discussion, and  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to evaluate the usability of logic-based program verification tools in a<br>\ncontrolled experiment that could be easily repeated by others.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The competition will offer a number of challenges presented in natural<br>\nlanguage and pseudo code. Participants have to formalize the requirements,<br>\nimplement a solution, and formally verify the implementation for adherence<br>\nto the specification.  </p>\n<p>There are no restrictions on the programming language and verification<br>\ntechnology used. The correctness properties posed in problems will have the<br>\ninput-output behaviour of programs in focus. Solutions will be judged for<br>\ncorrectness, completeness and elegance.  </p>\n<p>PARTICIPATION  </p>\n<p>Participation is open for anybody interested. Teams of up to two people are<br>\nallowed. VerifyThis will be held at ETAPS 2023 in Paris, each challenge will<br>\nbe given 90 minutes. More details and a full program will be announced on<br>\nthe website.  </p>\n<p>We particularly encourage participation of:  </p>\n<p>\\- people from under-represented communities  <br>\n\\- student teams (this includes PhD students)  <br>\n\\- non-developer teams using a tool someone else developed  <br>\n\\- several teams using the same tool  </p>\n<h2>GRANTS</h2>\n<p>The competition has funds for a limited number of registration grants,<br>\nsponsored by Amazon AWS. Grants will cover the registration costs for ETAPS.<br>\nTo apply for a grant, fill out the relevant section of the registration form<br>\nand, if you are a student, have your supervisor send a brief letter of<br>\nsupport to the following address: <a href=\"mailto:verifythis@googlegroups.com\">verifythis@googlegroups.com</a>  </p>\n<h2>PRIZES</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our sponsors, VerifyThis typically offer team prizes such as the<br>\nbest overall team, the most distinguished tool features and the best student<br>\nteam.
