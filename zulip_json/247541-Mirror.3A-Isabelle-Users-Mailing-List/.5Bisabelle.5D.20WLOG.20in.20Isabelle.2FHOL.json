I don't remember in detail how the WLOG tactic works, <br>\nbut I think it should be quite feasible to do something like this in <br>\nIsabelle, perhaps even with an Eisbach method.</p>\n<p>I think I also remember that HOL Light's WLOG reminded me a bit of the <br>\ntransfer method in Isabelle, so perhaps one could even realise it using <br>\nthat (not sure if it would actually save work though).</p>\n<p>As for the Analysis library, I fear there is no actual documentation of <br>\nthat. There have been ideas to make one for a long time, but it we all <br>\nnever really found the time to do that. However, what we at least did <br>\nwas to tag important theorems and definitions with an \"important\" tag, <br>\nso you can try searching the library for that to find out what's there. <br>\nThere's also a way to generate a PDF document containing all the <br>\nimportant definitions/theorems (which had several hundred pages if I <br>\nrecall correctly).</p>\n<p>There are some documents explaning particular aspects of the library, <br>\ne.g. the PDF on type classes and filters (which are crucial for <br>\ntopological concepts like limits and open sets, but also e..g <br>\nderivatives) or the documentation for the real_asymp method (which <br>\nautomates real asymptotics). I would just suggest that if you have <br>\nconcrete questions about something, just ask.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",

Sometime (e.g., when you want <br>\nto make use of symmetries), you need to make some of the variables in <br>\nthe theorem general. Add <em>generalizing x1 x2 ...</em> for this. (This <br>\naffects the proof obligation for the wlog-command.) And finally, <br>\nassumptions (using the assume command) you made will vanish, unless you <br>\nmark them explicitly as something you want to keep (*keeping assmname1 <br>\nassmname2 ...*). This is because sometimes dropping some assumptions <br>\nwhile introducing others wlog can make the proof obligation simpler. <br>\nNotice also that in the state window of Isabelle, the wlog-command <br>\noutputs some additional helpful information for the proof obligation proof.</p>\n<p>I'm happy to hear any feedback (also about the ML-interna and the <br>\nrealization of the structured command). If it is something that seems <br>\nfeasible to me, I can then incorporate it in the AFP submission when I <br>\nmake one.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",

But I think it is <br>\nstill somewhat confusing because \"for\" usually binds names locally for a <br>\ncommand in Isabelle convention. (I.e., whenever I have a \"for x\", I <br>\ncould just replace all the x's in the command by y's, and I would get <br>\nthe more or less the same effect. But the \"generalizing\" refers to <br>\nexisting variables (like arbitrary: in the induction command), and you <br>\ncannot change them unless you change the variable names also /before and <br>\nafter/ the wlog command.)</p>\n<p>Using \"from\" is problematic for two reasons:</p>\n<p>* The technical reason is that \"from xxx\" does not remember the name<br>\n    \"xxx\", only the term of that fact, while the wlog-command needs to<br>\n    know the name of the fact. (In order to make the fact available<br>\n    again under the same name.)  It's possible to heuristically figure<br>\n    out which fact it might have been from the term, but that's a bit of<br>\n    a hack.</p>\n<p>* And I also feel that \"from\" does not capture what is happening here.<br>\n    \"from xxx\" usually means \"make xxx available for the proof of the<br>\n    following theorem\", so you would expect the proof of the wlog to<br>\n    become /easier/ with more theorems in the from. However, the keeping<br>\n    says which assumptions should still be available /after/ the wlog.<br>\n    Adding more facts in \"keeping\" makes the proof of the wlog itself<br>\n    /harder!/</p>\n<p>But I'm definitely open for ideas for better names. (I tried using the <br>\nexisting keywords such as \"for\" etc., but I ended up with something I <br>\ncould hardly understand myself. The current words aren't optimal but <br>\ndefinitely better than what I had before in terms of understandability.)</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",
