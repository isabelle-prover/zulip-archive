The  workshop   also  provides  a  ground  for<br>\ncross-fertilization of ideas from the different communities interested<br>\nin termination (e.g., working on computational mechanisms, programming<br>\nlanguages,  software  engineering,   constraint  solving,  etc.).  The<br>\nfriendly  atmosphere  enables  fruitful  exchanges  leading  to  joint<br>\nresearch and subsequent publications.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>- submission:          June 25, 2025<br>\n   - notification:        July 16, 2025<br>\n   - early registration:  July 23, 2025<br>\n   - final version:       August 6, 2025<br>\n   - workshop:            September 3-4, 2025</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>The 20th International Workshop on Termination  welcomes contributions<br>\non all aspects of  termination.  In particular,  papers  investigating<br>\napplications  of  termination  (for example  in  complexity  analysis,<br>\nprogram  analysis  and   transformation,   theorem  proving,   program<br>\ncorrectness,  modeling  computational systems, etc.) are very welcome.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<p>- termination and complexity analysis in any domain (lambda<br>\n     calculus, declarative programming, rewriting, transition systems,<br>\n     probabilistic programs, etc.)</p>\n<p>- abstraction methods in termination analysis<br>\n   - certification of termination and complexity proofs<br>\n   - challenging termination problems<br>\n   - comparison and classification of termination methods<br>\n   - implementation of termination and complexity methods<br>\n   - non-termination analysis<br>\n   - normalization and infinitary normalization<br>\n   - operational termination of logic-based systems<br>\n   - ordinal notation and subrecursive hierarchies<br>\n   - SAT, SMT, and constraint solving for (non-)termination analysis<br>\n   - scalability and modularity of termination methods<br>\n   - well-founded relations and well-quasi-orders</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>\n<p>Submissions  are  short  papers/extended abstracts  which  should  not<br>\nexceed 5 pages.  There will be no formal reviewing.  In particular, we<br>\nwelcome  short  versions  of  recently  published articles and  papers<br>\nsubmitted  elsewhere.  The  program  committee  checks  relevance  and<br>\nprovides additional feedback for each submission.  The accepted papers<br>\nwill be made available electronically before the workshop.</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission page that<br>\nwill be announced here  (at beginning of June).
