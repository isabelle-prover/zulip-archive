This also<br>\nworks on collaborative sites like Overleaf.<br>\nThe webpage includes a few examples and some useful LaTeX code to accompany<br>\nthe tool.</p>\n<p>I have used the tool for several papers myself, and so have others, but the<br>\nparsing of the exported LaTeX is ad-hoc, so the output can still be<br>\nimperfect at times.<br>\nI hope the tool may be of use to you.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAsta</p>",
