Two attempts are made with a 2s delay if Isabelle does not process the request immediately.</p>\n<p>This makes Isabelle behave as a \"normal\" MacOS application (drag and drop of files on the application icon, only one running instance even if opened several times, handling of opening .thy files).</p>\n<p>I developed this mainly to handle \"file://\" references to .thy file in the LaTeX slides of my courses. It also happens to be very handy when double-clicking .thy files.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is welcome!</p>\n<p>Frédéric</p>\n<p>Frédéric Boulanger<br>\nCentraleSupélec - Département Informatique  Laboratoire Méthodes Formelles (LMF)<br>\n3 rue Joliot-Curie, 91192 Gif-sur-Yvette cedex  Bât. 650 - 1 rue Raimond Castaing, 91190 Gif-sur-Yvette<br>\n+33 [0]1 69 85 14 84</p>",
