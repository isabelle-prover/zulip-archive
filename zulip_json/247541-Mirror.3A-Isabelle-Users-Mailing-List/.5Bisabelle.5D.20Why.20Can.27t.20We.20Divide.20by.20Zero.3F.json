Mathematicians would think<br>\nit's absurd to debate about them since they can be understood in about<br>\nthree seconds.</p>\n<p>However, dividing by zero actually has a new meaning and reveals a vast<br>\nworld. When it comes to dividing by zero, there is another interpretation.<br>\nThis is the new meaning of division by zero.</p>\n<p>These definitions and meanings are guaranteed by the three golden rules of<br>\ndivision by zero, and their usefulness extends to all areas of mathematics.</p>\n<p>In fact, the division by zero is inherently obvious from the meaning of<br>\nzero itself. The sense of zero encompasses meanings like nothingness,<br>\nabsence, inability, standard, and so on.</p>\n<p>To divide by zero means not dividing at all. Thus, there is no number to be<br>\nallocated, resulting in zero.</p>\n<p>Today marks the 11th anniversary of the birth of 1/0 = 0/0 = 0.</p>\n<p>When contemplating the answer to the question \"What is 100/0?\", we realized<br>\nthat the result was self-evident from the formula we had been studying<br>\nwithout recognition. Everything was obvious, not in three seconds, but<br>\ninstantaneously.</p>\n<p>2025.2.2 7:24; 2025.2.2 17:12</p>\n<p>Please kindly look at the simple essentials:</p>\n<p>On Division by Zero Calculus With 8 Figures</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ameblo.jp\">https://ameblo.jp</a></p>\n<p>2025.3.21.9:16</p>",
