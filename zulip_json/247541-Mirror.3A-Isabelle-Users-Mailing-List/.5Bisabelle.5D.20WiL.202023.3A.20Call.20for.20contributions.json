Its main purpose is to promote the excellent<br>\nresearch done by women, with the ultimate goal of increasing their<br>\nvisibility and representation in the community. Our aim is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>provide a platform for female researchers to share their work and<br>\nachievements;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>increase the feelings of community and belonging, especially among<br>\njunior faculty, post-docs and students through positive interactions<br>\nwith peers and more established faculty;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>establish new connections and collaborations;</p>\n</li>\n<li>foster a welcoming culture of mutual support and growth within the<br>\nlogic research community.<br>\nWe believe these aspects will benefit women working in logic and computer<br>\nscience, particularly early-career researchers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previous versions of Women in Logic (Reykjavík 2017, Oxford 2018, <br>\nVancouver 2019, Paris 2020, Rome 2021, and Haifa 2022) were very successful <br>\nin showcasing women's work and as catalysts for a recognition of the need <br>\nfor change in the community.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to: automata theory, <br>\nautomated deduction, categorical models and logics, concurrency <br>\nand distributed computation, constraint programming, constructive <br>\nmathematics, database theory, decision procedures, description logics, <br>\ndomain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects of program analysis, <br>\nformal methods, foundations of computability, games and logic, <br>\nhigher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic, <br>\nlogic in artificial intelligence, logic programming, logical aspects <br>\nof bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational complexity, <br>\nlogical aspects of quantum computation, logical frameworks, logics <br>\nof programs, modal and temporal logics, model checking, probabilistic <br>\nsystems, process calculi, programming language semantics, proof theory, <br>\nreal-time systems, reasoning about security and privacy, rewriting, <br>\ntype systems and type theory, and verification.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sandra Alves (Universidade de Porto, Portugal)</li>\n<li>Marie Kerjean (CNRS, Université Sorbonne Paris Nord)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\nAbstract submission deadline: April 30, 2023<br>\nNotification: May 19, 2023<br>\nFunding application: see the website<br>\nContribution for informal proceedings: June 25, 2023<br>\nWorkshop: July 1, 2023</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>\nAbstracts should be written in English (1-2 pages), and prepared<br>\nusing the Easychair style (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors\">https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors</a>).</p>\n<p>The abstracts should be uploaded to the WiL 2023 Easychair page<br>\nas a PDF file (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=wil2023\">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=wil2023</a>)<br>\nbefore the submission deadline on April 30, 2023, anywhere on Earth.</p>\n<p>FUNDING<br>\nDue to the generous support of our sponsors, we have limited funding available <br>\nfor speakers and other participants.
