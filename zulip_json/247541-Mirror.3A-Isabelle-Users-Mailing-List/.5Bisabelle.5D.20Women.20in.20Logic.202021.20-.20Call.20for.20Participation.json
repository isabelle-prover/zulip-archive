Its main purpose is to promote the excellent<br>\nresearch done by women, with the ultimate goal of increasing their<br>\nvisibility and representation in the community. Our aim is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>provide a platform for female researchers to share their work and<br>\nachievements;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>increase the feelings of community and belonging, especially among<br>\njunior faculty, post-docs and students through positive interactions<br>\nwith peers and more established faculty;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>establish new connections and collaborations;</p>\n</li>\n<li>foster a welcoming culture of mutual support and growth within the<br>\nlogic research community.<br>\nWe believe these aspects will benefit women working in logic and computer<br>\nscience, particularly early-career researchers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previous versions of Women in Logic (Reykjavík, Iceland 2017,<br>\nOxford, UK 2018, Vancouver, Canada 2019, and Paris, France 2020) <br>\nwere very successful in showcasing women's work and as catalysts for a <br>\nrecognition of the need for change in the community.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to: automata<br>\ntheory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,<br>\nconcurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,<br>\nconstructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,<br>\ndescription logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects<br>\nof program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,<br>\ngames and logic, higher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi,<br>\nlinear logic, logic in artificial intelligence, logic programming,<br>\nlogical aspects of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational<br>\ncomplexity, logical aspects of quantum computation, logical<br>\nframeworks, logics of programs, modal and temporal logics, model<br>\nchecking, probabilistic systems, process calculi, programming language<br>\nsemantics, proof theory, real-time systems, reasoning about security<br>\nand privacy, rewriting, type systems and type theory, and<br>\nverification.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>\nSimona Ronchi Della Rocca<br>\nRineke Verbrugge</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\nAbstract submission deadline: April 30, 2021<br>\nNotification: May 28, 2021<br>\nWorkshop: June 27, 2021</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>\nAbstracts should be written in English (1-2 pages),<br>\nand prepared using the Easychair style (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors\">https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors\">https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors</a>&gt;).</p>\n<p>The abstracts should be uploaded to the WiL 2021 Easychair page<br>\nas a PDF file (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2021\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2021</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2021\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2021</a>&gt;)<br>\nbefore the submission deadline on April 30, 2021, anywhere on Earth.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZING AND PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sandra Alves (Co-chair, University of Porto)</li>\n<li>Agata Ciabattoni (TU Wien) </li>\n<li>Amy Felty (University of Ottawa)</li>\n<li>Maribel Fernández (King's College London)</li>\n<li>Helle Hansen (University of Groningen)</li>\n<li>Delia Kesner (Université de Paris)</li>\n<li>Sandra Kiefer (Co-chair, RWTH Aachen University) </li>\n<li>Koko Muroya (RIMS Kyoto University)</li>\n<li>Daniele Nantes (University of Brasília)</li>\n<li>Aybüke Özgün (ILLC - University of Amsterdam)</li>\n<li>Valeria de Paiva (Topos Institute)</li>\n<li>Ana Sokolova (Co-chair, University of Salzburg)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>women-in-logic mailing list -- <a href=\"mailto:women-in-logic@lists.rwth-aachen.de\">women-in-logic@lists.rwth-aachen.de</a> &lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:women-in-logic@lists.rwth-aachen.de\">women-in-logic@lists.rwth-aachen.de</a>&gt;<br>\nTo unsubscribe send an email to <a href=\"mailto:women-in-logic-leave@lists.rwth-aachen.de\">women-in-logic-leave@lists.rwth-aachen.de</a> &lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:women-in-logic-leave@lists.rwth-aachen.de\">women-in-logic-leave@lists.rwth-aachen.de</a>&gt;</p>",
