Its main purpose is to promote the excellent<br>\nresearch done by women, with the ultimate goal of increasing their<br>\nvisibility and representation in the community. Our aim is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>provide a platform for female researchers to share their work and<br>\nachievements;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>increase the feelings of community and belonging, especially among<br>\njunior faculty, post-docs, and students through positive interactions<br>\nwith peers and more established faculty;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>establish new connections and collaborations;</p>\n</li>\n<li>foster a welcoming culture of mutual support and growth within the<br>\nlogic research community.<br>\nWe believe these aspects will benefit women working in logic and computer<br>\nscience, particularly early-career researchers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previous versions of Women in Logic (Reykjavík 2017, Oxford 2018,<br>\nVancouver 2019, Paris 2020, and Rome 2021) were very successful<br>\nin showcasing women's work and as catalysts for a recognition<br>\nof the need for change in the community.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to: automata<br>\ntheory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,<br>\nconcurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,<br>\nconstructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,<br>\ndescription logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects<br>\nof program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,<br>\ngames and logic, higher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi,<br>\nlinear logic, logic in artificial intelligence, logic programming,<br>\nlogical aspects of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational<br>\ncomplexity, logical aspects of quantum computation, logical<br>\nframeworks, logics of programs, modal and temporal logics, model<br>\nchecking, probabilistic systems, process calculi, programming language<br>\nsemantics, proof theory, real-time systems, reasoning about security<br>\nand privacy, rewriting, type systems and type theory, and<br>\nverification.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dana Fisman (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev)</li>\n<li>Delia Kesner (IRIF - Université de Paris)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\nAbstract submission deadline: May 29, 2022<br>\nNotification: June 17, 2022<br>\nContribution for Informal Proceedings: June 29, 2022<br>\nWorkshop: July 31, 2022</p>\n<p>ORGANIZING AND PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maria Aloni (University of Amsterdam)</li>\n<li>Sandra Alves (Co-chair, University of Porto)</li>\n<li>Lourdes Del Carmen González Huesca (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México)</li>\n<li>Amy Felty (University of Ottawa)</li>\n<li>Sandra Kiefer (Co-chair, Max Planck Institute for Software Systems)</li>\n<li>Daniele Nantes (Co-chair, University of Brasília/ Imperial College London)</li>\n<li>Valeria de Paiva  (Topos Institute)</li>\n<li>Elaine Pimentel (University College London)</li>\n<li>Simona Ronchi Della Rocca (Università di Torino)</li>\n<li>Renate A.
