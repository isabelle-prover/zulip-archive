[The course has its roots in a series of<br>\nlectures I was giving over the years, starting at the ETH in 2005].</p>\n<p>It has both a theoretic track presented as an animated slide-set <br>\nwith accompanying podcast and a series of practical lab courses <br>\n(“TP”’s). The theoretical part attempts to establish links to theoretical<br>\nfoundations taught in parallel classes (lambda-calculus, semantic) at <br>\nthe MPRI, as far as this vis possible in a 5-units course …<br>\nA part from the title, all material is in English ...</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lri.fr/~wolff/teach-material/2020-2021/M2-CSMR/index.html\">https://www.lri.fr/~wolff/teach-material/2020-2021/M2-CSMR/index.html</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://www.lri.fr/~wolff/teach-material/2020-2021/M2-CSMR/index.html\">https://www.lri.fr/~wolff/teach-material/2020-2021/M2-CSMR/index.html</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>All comments welcome!</p>\n<p>Burkhart</p>",
