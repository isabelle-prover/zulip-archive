The NEWS section on<br>\n\"Inner syntax --- the term language\" has a lot of details and fine points. The <br>\nbig picture probably needs to be explored experimentally: we have now a quite <br>\ndifferent situation for term syntax, many decades after its initial introduction.</p>\n<p>Your question about \"turn off syntax\" is answered by the many syntax bundles <br>\nthat are now in the library. Here is an example for set enumeration:</p>\n<p>notepad<br>\nbegin<br>\n   let ?test = \"{x, y, z}\"<br>\n   include no set_enumeration_syntax<br>\n   term ?test<br>\nend</p>\n<p>Note that in a context that includes no set_enumeration_syntax, there is no <br>\nway to read that notation, which explains my auxiliary term abbreviation ?test <br>\nabove: first read with syntax, then print without syntax.</p>\n<p>I would normally explore the substructure of terms more directly via <br>\nC-hover-mouse (or only hover-mouse in Output). This provides a lot of clues, <br>\nwithout suppressing notation. There are also new hyperlinks, e.g. from the { } <br>\nbraces to Set.insert.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
