The unsurprising conclusion: if it has seen a reasobaly simple proof <br>\nof the thing you ask for, it will give a good approximation. Usually not a <br>\ncompletely well-formed proof, but not a joke either. A good starting point for <br>\nstudent homework solutions. It will not come up with anything original but might <br>\nbecome a good search engine. Here is a simple example:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Q: Where can I find an Isabelle proof of reverse(reverse xs) = xs</p>\n<p>A: You can find a proof of the statement \"reverse(reverse xs) = xs\" in the <br>\nstandard library of the theorem prover Isabelle. This proof can be found in the <br>\ntheory file \"List.thy\", which is part of the standard distribution of Isabelle.</p>\n<p>In this theory file, the statement can be proven as a lemma using the following <br>\nproof script:</p>\n<p>lemma \"reverse (reverse xs) = xs\"<br>\n   by (induction xs) auto</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The interesting aspect is, that in List.thy \"reverse\" is actually called \"rev\" <br>\nand the proof looks like this:</p>\n<p>lemma rev_rev_ident [simp]: \"rev (rev xs) = xs\"<br>\nby (induct xs) auto</p>\n<p>It must have seen enough proofs of this standard lemma to make the connection.</p>\n<p>Tobias<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/BtJ5Quo1xvMrHezamPKQKm-B/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
