It aspires<br>\nto be a<br>\nlively environment for presenting the latest research results, and other<br>\ncontributions.</p>\n<p>This year, TFP will take place in-person at the University of Southern<br>\nDenmark,<br>\nin Odense, Denmark. It is co-located with the Trends in Functional<br>\nProgramming<br>\nin Education (TFPIE) workshop, which will take on the day before the<br>\nmain<br>\nsymposium.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that TFP has several submission deadlines. The first,<br>\n13th<br>\nNovember, is for authors who wish to have their full paper reviewed<br>\nprior to the<br>\nsymposium. Papers that are accepted in this way must also be presented<br>\nat the<br>\nsymposium. The second, 11th December, is for authors who wish to present<br>\ntheir<br>\nwork or work-in-progress at the symposium first without submitting to<br>\nthe full<br>\nreview process for publication. These authors can then take into account<br>\nfeedback received at the symposium and submit a full paper for review by<br>\nthe<br>\nthird deadline, 19th February.</p>\n<h2>Scope</h2>\n<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various<br>\nroutes. As<br>\npart of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the<br>\nfollowing five<br>\npaper categories. High-quality submissions are solicited in any of these<br>\ncategories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research Papers: Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work</li>\n<li>Position Papers: On what new trends should or should not be</li>\n<li>Project Papers: Descriptions of recently started new projects</li>\n<li>Evaluation Papers: What lessons can be drawn from a finished project</li>\n<li>Overview Papers: Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted for publication<br>\nto any<br>\nother forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming:<br>\ntheoretical, implementation-oriented, or experience-oriented.<br>\nApplications of<br>\nfunctional programming techniques to other languages are also within the<br>\nscope<br>\nof the symposium.</p>\n<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing</li>\n<li>Functional programming in the cloud</li>\n<li>High performance functional computing</li>\n<li>Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs</li>\n<li>Dependently typed functional programming</li>\n<li>Validation and verification of functional programs</li>\n<li>Debugging and profiling for functional languages</li>\n<li>Functional programming in different application areas:<br>\n     security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded<br>\nsystems,<br>\n     global computing, grids, etc.</li>\n<li>Interoperability with imperative programming languages</li>\n<li>Novel memory management techniques</li>\n<li>Program analysis and transformation techniques</li>\n<li>Empirical performance studies</li>\n<li>Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages</li>\n<li>(Embedded) domain specific languages</li>\n<li>New implementation strategies</li>\n<li>Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are in doubt on whether your paper is within the scope of TFP,<br>\nplease<br>\ncontact the programme chair, Casper Bach.</p>\n<h2>Best Paper Awards</h2>\n<p>TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.</p>\n<p>First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the<br>\nbest<br>\noverall paper accepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.</p>\n<p>Second, each year TFP also awards a prize for the best student paper.<br>\nTFP<br>\ntraditionally pays special attention to research students, acknowledging<br>\nthat<br>\nstudents are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student<br>\npaper is<br>\none for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of<br>\nstudents,<br>\nthe students are the paper's first authors, and a student would present<br>\nthe<br>\npaper.</p>\n<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the<br>\nbest paper<br>\nhappens to be a student paper, then that paper will receive both prizes.</p>\n<h2>Instructions to Authors</h2>\n<p>Submission is via HotCRP:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tfp26.hotcrp.com/\">https://tfp26.hotcrp.com/</a></p>\n<p>Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally<br>\nreviewed either before or after the Symposium. Further, pre-symposium<br>\nsubmissions may either be full (earlier deadline) or draft papers (later<br>\ndeadline). See below for more details.</p>\n<p>Submission is single-blind.</p>\n<p>Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the chair).</p>\n<p>Accepted papers from the pre-symposium and post-symposium formal review<br>\nwill<br>\nappear in a formal proceedings, published by Springer.</p>\n<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For<br>\nmore<br>\ninformation about formatting please consult the Springer LNCS Guidelines<br>\nweb<br>\nsite<br>\n(<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a><br>\n).</p>\n<h3>Pre-symposium formal review</h3>\n<p>Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted<br>\nbefore<br>\nthe early deadline and will receive their reviews and notification of<br>\nacceptance<br>\nfor both presentation and publication before the symposium. A paper that<br>\nhas<br>\nbeen rejected for publication but accepted for presentation may be<br>\nrevised and<br>\nresubmitted for the post-symposium formal review.</p>\n<h3>Post-symposium formal review</h3>\n<p>Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance<br>\nfor<br>\npresentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers will be invited<br>\nto submit<br>\nrevised papers based on the feedback received at the symposium. A<br>\npost-symposium<br>\nrefereeing process will then select a subset of these papers for formal<br>\npublication.</p>\n<h3>Paper categories</h3>\n<p>Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as<br>\nextended<br>\nabstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (up to 20 pages). The<br>\nsubmission must clearly indicate which category it belongs to: research,<br>\nposition, project, evaluation, or overview paper. It should also<br>\nindicate which<br>\nauthors are research students, and whether the main author(s) are<br>\nstudents. A<br>\ndraft paper for which all authors are students will receive additional<br>\nfeedback<br>\nby one of the PC members shortly after the symposium has taken place.</p>\n<h2>Organizing Committee</h2>\n<p>| Casper Bach      | University of Southern Denmark, DK | Programme<br>\nChair          |<br>\n| Jeremy Gibbons   | University of Oxford               | General Chair<br>\n           |<br>\n| Peter Achten     | Radboud University Nijmegen, NL    | Publicity<br>\nChair          |<br>\n| Marco T.
