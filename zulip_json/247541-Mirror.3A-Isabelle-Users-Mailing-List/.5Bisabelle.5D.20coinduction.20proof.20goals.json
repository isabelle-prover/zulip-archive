So it's either leN or leS.</p>\n<p>To show that \"le (min n m) n\" was formed by leN, I need to find an x such that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>min n m = N (first argument of le)</li>\n<li>n = x (second argument of le)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This makes sense.</p>\n<p>I'm a bit confused by the second case, which is to show that \"le (min n m) n\"<br>\nwas formed by leS.</p>\n<p>It makes sense that I need to find an x and y such that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>min n m = S x (first argument of le)</li>\n<li>n = S y (second argument of le)</li>\n<li>le x y (assumption of leS)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But I'm missing where<br>\n   exists x' y'. x = min x' y' /\\ x = x'<br>\ncame from.</p>\n<p>Is it the coinduction hypothesis?</p>\n<p>And also as a related question, I've been reading<br>\n<a href=\"https://xavierleroy.org/CdF/2018-2019/9.pdf\">https://xavierleroy.org/CdF/2018-2019/9.pdf</a>. Page 16 discusses the coinduction<br>\nprinciple. Those slides are based on Coq, but the concepts are relevant to<br>\nhelping me understand coinduction and the following question.</p>\n<p>From page 16, I'm trying to map the coinduction principle to the proof<br>\nobligation that Isabelle generates.</p>\n<p>What is the P(n) for \"le (min n m) n\"? The slides don't explicitly mention<br>\nanything about the coinduction hypothesis either.</p>\n<p>Can somebody help me connect the dots, please?</p>\n<p>Thank you,<br>\nAmarin</p>",
