You can find it at the usual place <br>\n(urls are the same)!</p>\n<p>We'll consolidate author affiliations (email addresses, homepages) to <br>\nremove near-duplicates, and there will likely be some tuning and <br>\ntweaking in the coming weeks and months. But feel free to point out <br>\nproblems and post suggestions for improvements, if you have any!</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Fabian</p>",

The problem <br>\nwas fixed when we followed Jakub Kądziołka's suggestion, on Zulip (here: <br>\n<a href=\"#narrow/stream/238552-Beginner-Questions/topic/afp/near/240305960\">https://isabelle.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238552-Beginner-Questions/topic/afp/near/240305960</a>) <br>\nto append \"/thys\" to the path to the AFP in the <br>\n\"~/.isabelle/etc/components\" file.</p>\n<p>I don't know if this is just a documentation problem to fix on the <br>\nwebsite, or if the issue lies with the \"isabelle components -u <br>\npath/to/afp\" command for windows (on linux, I never had a problem with <br>\nit), or if my student made a mistake somewhere during the process, but <br>\nit could be worth mentioning this issue and its fix in the Help section.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\n   Sophie<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/v81-0nvYaAw_031Sf1IucQKD/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
