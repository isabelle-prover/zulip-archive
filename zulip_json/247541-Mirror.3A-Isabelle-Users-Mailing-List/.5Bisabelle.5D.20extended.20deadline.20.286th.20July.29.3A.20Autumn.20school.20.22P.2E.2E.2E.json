Its aim is to bring together<br>\nyoung researchers in the fields of Foundations of Mathematics,<br>\nComputer Science and Philosophy.</p>\n<p>=== SCOPE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Predicative Foundations</li>\n<li>Constructive Mathematics and Type Theory</li>\n<li>Computation in Higher Types</li>\n<li>Extraction of Programs from Proofs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>=== COURSES</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ulrich Berger (Swansea): Program extraction in higher-order logic</li>\n<li>\n<p>Roberto Giuntini (Cagliari): From Sharp to Unsharp: Exploring the <br>\nFrontiers of Quantum Logic</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hajime Ishihara (Toho-University, Ota City): Uniform Spaces and <br>\nIntegration Theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Klaus Mainzer (Munich): From Proof and Computation to AI</p>\n</li>\n<li>Dirk Pattinson (Canberra): Proof Systems for non-momnotone Modal Logics</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hideki Tsuiki (Kyoto): Extracting nondeterministic programs from <br>\nproofs (slot 1) Fractals and coinduction (slots 2 and 3)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Richard Zach (Calgary): Introduction to the Epsilon-Calculus</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>=== WORKING GROUPS</p>\n<p>There will be an opportunity to form ad-hoc groups working on specific<br>\nprojects, but also to discuss in more general terms the vision of<br>\nconstructing correct programs from proofs.</p>\n<p>=== HOW TO GET THERE</p>\n<p>The default arrival time is Sunday afternoon, and departure time<br>\nSaturday after breakfast. There are frequent suburban trains (line S8)<br>\nfrom the airport and downtown Munich to Herrsching. From the train<br>\nstation in Herrsching one can walk to the school site; see its website<br>\nfor directions. There is also a bus connection.</p>\n<p>=== APPLICATIONS</p>\n<p>Graduate or PhD students and young postdoctoral researches are invited<br>\nto apply. Applications (e.g. a self-introduction including research<br>\ninterests and motivation) should be sent to</p>\n<p>Valentin Herrmann &lt;herrmann+pc25@math.lmu.de&gt;.<br>\n(The email address is literally just \"herrmann+pc25@math.lmu.de\". The <br>\n\"+\" carries no special meaning.)</p>\n<p>Students are required to provide a letter of recommendation, preferably<br>\nfrom the thesis adviser.</p>\n<p>Deadline for applications: <strong>June 23, 2025</strong>.</p>\n<p>Applicants will be notified by July 11, 2025.</p>\n<p>=== FINANCIAL SUPPORT</p>\n<p>The workshop is supported by the Udo Keller Stiftung (Hamburg).<br>\nSuccessful applicants with funding problems may apply for financial<br>\nsupport covering accommodation including meals for the days of the<br>\nautumn school (ca. 145 Euro per day).</p>\n<p>Klaus Mainzer<br>\nPeter Schuster<br>\nHelmut Schwichtenberg</p>",
