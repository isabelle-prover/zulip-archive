        "content": "<p>From: Manuel Eberl &lt;<a href=\"mailto:manuel@pruvisto.org\">manuel@pruvisto.org</a>&gt;<br>\nThere's a lot about finite (or rather countable-support) distributions <br>\nunder the name of \"Probability Mass Functions\" (PMFs). Just look at a <br>\nfew AFP entries that use them, e.g. the ones in the \"Randomizsed <br>\nAlgorithms\" category: <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/topics/computer-science/algorithms/randomized/\">https://www.isa-afp.org/topics/computer-science/algorithms/randomized/</a></p>\n<p>Feel free to ask on the mailing list or me privately if you have any <br>\nspecific questions about it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And in general, when should I build on existing libraries and when <br>\nshould I better build something from scratch?<br>\nAs a general rule I'd say if there is an existing library, try to use <br>\nthat. Only build something from scratch if there is nothing in the <br>\nlibrary or the thing in the library is really unsuitable for what you <br>\nare doing. Even in that case it is a good idea to make a \"compatibility <br>\nlayer\" between your new thing and the old thing in the library to allow <br>\ntransferring results between the two.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
