It does look like the goals are actually the same, apart from the fact that some variables are \"orange\" (i.e. fixed in Isar proof steps) in the failed version whereas they're \"blue\" (i.e. fixed at the lemma statement) in the other.</p>\n<p>The good news is, \"auto\" in the successful proof can be replaced by \"simp\" followed by \"clarify\" followed by \"simp\", with the final simp doing the important work. The simplifier trace can be activated with using [[simp_trace]]. If you then copy the traces from the successful and failed attempts into other files, you can diff them, and see that roughly halfway through the successful proof the simplifier applies a rule called ECMP.fitEnvPar, whereas in the failed attempt the system applied an anonymous rule about \"trans (_ || _)\".</p>\n<p>I don't really know what's going on. There is a difference between \"blue\" and \"orange\" variables internally, which might have an impact on term ordering, which the simplifier uses for some things. It's possible this leads to a different outcome in a situation where it has two rules and either of them can apply.</p>\n<p>Maybe if you look at the simp traces, you can figure out what's happened. Sometimes you need to control the simplifier when it has a choice, e.g. by temporarily deleting some rules.</p>\n<p>Good luck,<br>\n    Thomas.</p>",
