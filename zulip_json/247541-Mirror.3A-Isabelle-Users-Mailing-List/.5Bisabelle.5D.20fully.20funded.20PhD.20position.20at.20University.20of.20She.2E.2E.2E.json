The PhD project is titled<br>\n\"Formal Specification and Verification of the Safe Interaction between<br>\nHumans and Industrial Robots\" and will be supervised by myself (more<br>\nabout me at <a href=\"https://www.andreipopescu.uk/\">https://www.andreipopescu.uk/</a>) and some experts in<br>\nindustrial robots from Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research<br>\nCentre (AMRC, <a href=\"https://www.amrc.co.uk/\">https://www.amrc.co.uk/</a>).</p>\n<p>The position is for 42 months, is fully funded from EPSRC, and has no<br>\nteaching obligations attached. The two constraints are that it is<br>\nrestricted to UK and EU students only, and has to start by 8 February<br>\n2021. Taking into account the Covid-19 pandemic, there may be the<br>\nopportunity to start the PhD remotely and arrive in Sheffield at a<br>\nlater time, when it is safe to travel.</p>\n<p>More details are shown at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/formal-specification-and-verification-of-the-safe-interaction-between-humans-and-industrial-robots/?p127388\">https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/formal-specification-and-verification-of-the-safe-interaction-between-humans-and-industrial-robots/?p127388</a></p>\n<p>I am also happy to answer any questions by email (<a href=\"mailto:a.popescu@sheffield.ac.uk\">a.popescu@sheffield.ac.uk</a>).</p>\n<p>Please disseminate to potentially interested people.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nAndrei</p>",
