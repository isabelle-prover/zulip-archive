For instance, if I place my<br>\ncursor just at the end of the \"value\" line, I see this:<br>\n[image: image.png]<br>\ni.e., the value that I wanted to compute.<br>\nMoving up to the end of the previous line, I see this:<br>\n[image: image.png]<br>\nwhich is telling me that the recursive function \"rev\" has been successfully<br>\ndefined, and that the recursion it defines actually is guaranteed to<br>\nterminate.</p>\n<p>You might also want to remove a double-quote somewhere and see what<br>\nappears, or change \"list\" to \"lst\" somewhere, deliberately breaking the<br>\n'proof document', just to get a feel for which error messages can appear,<br>\nand how the 'constant update' thing feels.</p>\n<p>When your cursor was just past the 'end' line, nothing new had been done or<br>\nproduced, so there was no output showing.</p>\n<p>You'd think that this sort of thing would be right there in a 'tutorial on<br>\nusing Isabelle for the first time\" somewhere on the project home page, but<br>\nit wasn't there when I started about 5 years ago. I began writing a<br>\ndocument about this for my class; it's for the 2018 or 2019 version, but it<br>\nmay prove to be better than nothing.</p>\n<p>Pro tip: if you had typed in your entire document (as I did) rather than<br>\nloading it from disk or copy-pasting from the text, you'd have seen lots of<br>\nresponses as you were typing, and you'd have gotten a start on the whole \"<br>\n<em>when</em> do I have to use double-quotes and how do I get to the point where<br>\nthat seems natural?\" thing. I strongly recommend typing in examples until<br>\nyou're really confident that you've learned all that you can from doing so.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/72UACQSRI_CcLWYaY094Im0v/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/CbwHWXJgnpVdhg9Ym42klzBs/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/NNumgkWmkE8ojdY7foAFy5cb/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/72UACQSRI_CcLWYaY094Im0v/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/72UACQSRI_CcLWYaY094Im0v/image.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/CbwHWXJgnpVdhg9Ym42klzBs/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/CbwHWXJgnpVdhg9Ym42klzBs/image.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/NNumgkWmkE8ojdY7foAFy5cb/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/NNumgkWmkE8ojdY7foAFy5cb/image.png\"></a></div>",
