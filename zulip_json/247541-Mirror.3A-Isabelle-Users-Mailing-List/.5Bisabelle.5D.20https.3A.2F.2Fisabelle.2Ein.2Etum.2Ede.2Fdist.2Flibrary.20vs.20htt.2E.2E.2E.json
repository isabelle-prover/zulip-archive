Is it a permanent link in <br>\nsome bibtex database? Or is it just an end-user who wants to browse the HTML <br>\nlibrary?</p>\n<p>In the latter case, Isabelle2025-RC3 now provides this (cf. NEWS):</p>\n<p>\"\"\"<br>\n<strong>* Isabelle/jEdit Prover IDE </strong>*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Action isabelle.browser_info or menu \"Plugins / Isabelle / Browse HTML<br>\nLibrary\" opens a web browser on the HTML library that is distributed<br>\nwith Isabelle (if available, see $ISABELLE_HOME/lib/browser_info.db).<br>\n\"\"\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus the browsed data is always the correct one, by construction of <br>\nAdmin/build_release.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
