The general approach to Isabelle <br>\ncommand-line tools is demonstrated in Isabelle2024/src/Tools/Demo/.</p>\n<p>This is really for batch-mode systems tools, interaction works differently: <br>\ne.g. see the Isabelle server that is explained in the \"system\" manual (chapter <br>\n4). The Server also has more direct access in Isabelle/Scala via the Headless <br>\nmodule. It might also turn out that it is better to stay within the regular <br>\nIsabelle/PIDE setup of one Isabelle/Scala process connected to one Isabelle/ML <br>\nprocess.</p>\n<p>There are many possibilities. Can you describe your project and requirements a <br>\nbit?</p>\n<p>Generally note that Isabelle is a very complex system, and it deviates from <br>\nwhat is usually done elsewhere quite often. Sometimes people try to apply <br>\nforce to put Isabelle into a form of their liking, but this will not work out <br>\nwell in the end. Applications better work <em>with</em> the Isabelle system platform, <br>\nrather than against it.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
