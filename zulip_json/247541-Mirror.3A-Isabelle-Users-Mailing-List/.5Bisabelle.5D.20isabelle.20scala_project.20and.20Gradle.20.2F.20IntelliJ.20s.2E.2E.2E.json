So far, there was<br>\nnever any feedback like \"I've tried it, and it is great\", or \"... it lacks<br>\nimportant aspects like supporting a user-defined project\".</p>\n<p>I somehow guess that most Isabelle tool developers find IntelliJ IDEA too<br>\nscary. Or there might be other reasons that are kept secret and thus there is<br>\nno way to address them.</p>\n<p>I also guess that people who want to combine Isabelle with other tools often<br>\nstart with the mindset \"python + vi\" as the development environment --- but<br>\nthat is really external to Isabelle, and will make things more complicated<br>\nthan necessary.</p>\n<p>So this is an encouragement to try out IntelliJ IDEA + \"isabelle<br>\nscala_project\" + maybe some symlinks in the Gradle project to your own sources<br>\n-- like I did for the Scala part of Isabelle/Naproche recently.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
