I am quite surprised that there is no lemma allowing to<br>\nfreely convert between the two (or, at least, I couldn't find it).</p>\n<p>I'd therefore like to suggest the following addition:</p>\n<p>lemma list_all_iff_forall_set [iff]:<br>\n  \"list_all P xs ⟷ (∀x. x ∈ set xs ⟶ P x)\"<br>\n  by (induction xs) auto</p>\n<p>Kind regards,<br>\nJakub Kądziołka</p>",
