It<br>\nis based on a plain shell script, instead of fancy binaries that nobody<br>\nunderstands --- especially after some years later: Apple is changing things<br>\noccasionally in obscure ways.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the real-time delays in your Apple script look a bit strange for<br>\nsomething that is supposed to be based on well-defined events.</p>\n<p>If you can tell me how to have the shell script application accept the<br>\nfile-open event, I can improve on that in a conservative manner.</p>\n<p>Note that drag-and-drop of text files on the running editor works properly,<br>\nbut that is a different mechanism.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
