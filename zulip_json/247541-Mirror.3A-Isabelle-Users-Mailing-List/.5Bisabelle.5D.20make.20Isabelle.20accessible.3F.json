However, accessibility seems in reach, because<br>\nIsabelle/jEdit could use theJava Access Bridge [1] and Isabelle/VSCode<br>\ncould benefit from respective accessibility features [2]. And there are<br>\nplans for further development [3,4], which could be in line with<br>\nestablishing accessibility.</p>\n<p>Is there somebody in the community, who would be interested to<br>\ncollaborate with IIS [5] in investigating possibilities to make Isabelle<br>\naccessible eventually?</p>\n<p>Walther</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/accessbridge/2.0.2/introduction.htm\">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/accessbridge/2.0.2/introduction.htm</a><br>\n[2] <a href=\"https://vscode-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editor/accessibility/\">https://vscode-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editor/accessibility/</a><br>\n[3] Makarius Wenzel, Interaction with Formal Mathematical Documents in<br>\nIsabelle/PIDE, 2019. §3.Aims and Approaches of Isabelle/PIDE.<br>\n[4] Makarius Wenzel, Further Scaling of Isabelle Technology, 2018.<br>\n§3.3.Browsing: client-server applications.<br>\n[5] <a href=\"https://www.jku.at/institut-integriert-studieren/\">https://www.jku.at/institut-integriert-studieren/</a></p>",
