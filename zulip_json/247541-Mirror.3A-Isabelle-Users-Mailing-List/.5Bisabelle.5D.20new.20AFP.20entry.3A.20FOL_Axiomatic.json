The proof system is based on System Q1 by Smullyan and the completeness proof follows his textbook \"First-Order Logic\" (Springer-Verlag 1968). The completeness proof is in the Henkin style where a consistent set is extended to a maximal consistent set using Lindenbaum's construction and Henkin witnesses are added during the construction to ensure saturation as well. The resulting set is a Hintikka set which, by the model existence theorem, is satisfiable in the Herbrand universe.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/FOL_Axiomatic.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/FOL_Axiomatic.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
