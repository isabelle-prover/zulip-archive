In this work, we verify an<br>\nalgorithm to factor all real and complex polynomials whose coefficients are<br>\nalgebraic. The existence of such an algorithm proves in a constructive way that<br>\nthe set of complex algebraic numbers is algebraically closed. Internally, the<br>\nalgorithm is based on resultants of multivariate polynomials and an<br>\napproximation algorithm using interval arithmetic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Factor_Algebraic_Polynomial.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Factor_Algebraic_Polynomial.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
