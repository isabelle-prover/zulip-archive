Brucker </p>\n<p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common format for exchanging data, based on a collection of key/value-pairs (the JSON objects) and lists. Its syntax is inspired by JavaScript with the aim of being easy to read and write for humans and easy to parse and generate for machines. Despite its origin in the JavaScript world, JSON is language-independent and many programming languages support working with JSON-encoded data. This makes JSON an interesting format for exchanging data with Isabelle/HOL. This AFP entry provides a JSON-like import-expert format for both Isabelle/ML and Isabelle/HOL.</p>",
