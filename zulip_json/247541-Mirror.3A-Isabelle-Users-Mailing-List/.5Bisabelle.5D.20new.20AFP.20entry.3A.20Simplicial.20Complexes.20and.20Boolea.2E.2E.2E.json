A.<br>\nScoville. We also take advantage of the AFP representation of ROBDD<br>\n(Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams) to compute the ROBDD<br>\nrepresentation of a given simplicial complex (by means of the<br>\nisomorphism to Boolean functions). Some examples of simplicial<br>\ncomplexes and associated Boolean functions are also presented.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Simplicial_complexes_and_boolean_functions.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Simplicial_complexes_and_boolean_functions.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
