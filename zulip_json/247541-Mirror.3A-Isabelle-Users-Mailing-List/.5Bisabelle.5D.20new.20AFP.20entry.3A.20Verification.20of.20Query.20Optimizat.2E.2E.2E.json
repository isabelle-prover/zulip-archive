Furthermore, it implements the join ordering algorithm IKKBZ using these definitions. It verifies the correctness of these definitions and proves that IKKBZ produces an optimal solution within a restricted solution space.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Query_Optimization.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Query_Optimization.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
