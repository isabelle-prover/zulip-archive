CRYSTALS-KYBER is a key encapsulation mechanism in lattice-based post-quantum cryptography. This entry formalizes the key generation, encryption and decryption algorithms and shows that the algorithm decodes correctly under a highly probable assumption ((1-δ)-correctness). Moreover, the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) in the case of Kyber and the convolution theorem thereon is formalized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Looks impressive in its own right. It’s also yet another application of the big Berlekamp and Zassenhaus development.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
