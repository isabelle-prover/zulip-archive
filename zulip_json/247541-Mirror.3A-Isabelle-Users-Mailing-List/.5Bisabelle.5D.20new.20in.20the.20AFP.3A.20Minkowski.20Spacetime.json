Many results are proven here that cannot be found in Schutz, either preceding the theorem they are needed for, or within their own thematic section.</p>\n<p>It's not at the top of the AFP webpage because it was submitted at the end of July and somehow overlooked, for which my apologies. The direct URL is <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Schutz_Spacetime.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Schutz_Spacetime.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
