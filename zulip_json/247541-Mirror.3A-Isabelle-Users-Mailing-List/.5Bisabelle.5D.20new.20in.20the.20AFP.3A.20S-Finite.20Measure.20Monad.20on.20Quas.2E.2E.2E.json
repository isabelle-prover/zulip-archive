This entry is a formalization of the s-finite measure monad and related notions, including s-finite measures, s-finite kernels, and a proof automation for quasi-Borel spaces which is an extension of our previous entry Quasi-Borel Spaces [1]. We also implement several examples of probabilistic programs in previous works and prove their property. This work is a part of the work by Hirata, Minamide, and Sato, Semantic Foundations of Higher-Order Probabilistic Programs in Isabelle/HOL presented at the 14th Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP2023).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/S_Finite_Measure_Monad.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/S_Finite_Measure_Monad.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Quasi_Borel_Spaces.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Quasi_Borel_Spaces.html</a></p>",
