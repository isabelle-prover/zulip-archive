A separable complete metrizable topological space is called a polish space and a measurable space generated from a polish space is called a standard Borel space. We formalize the notion of standard Borel spaces by establishing set-based metric spaces, and then prove (a variant of) the Borel isomorphism theorem. The theorem states that a standard Borel spaces is either a countable discrete space or isomorphic to R.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Standard_Borel_Spaces.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Standard_Borel_Spaces.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
