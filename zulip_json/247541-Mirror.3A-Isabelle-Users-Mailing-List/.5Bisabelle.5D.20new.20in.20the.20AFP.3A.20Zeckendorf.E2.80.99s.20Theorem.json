The theorem states that every positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of one or more non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. The proof formalises one given by Gerrit Lekkerkerker, who seems to have discovered this result first.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Zeckendorf.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Zeckendorf.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
