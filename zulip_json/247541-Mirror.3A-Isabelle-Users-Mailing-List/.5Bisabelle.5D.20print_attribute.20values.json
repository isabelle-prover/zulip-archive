I tried looking into Pure and how it defines print_simpset but it didn’t seem obvious from within attrib.ML.</p>\n<p>The use case is that I am trying to create various lists of named_theorems attributes in order to control (as much as possible) the proof of a VDM theorem translated to Isabelle. In most cases, it’s a matter of specific simplifications over the “right” set, which is determined by the VDM to Isabelle translation process.     </p>\n<p>Is there any reference (or suggestion) on how to construct (and inspect) such lists? </p>\n<p>Many thanks,<br>\nLeo</p>",
