For example, the following will <br>\nthrow an Exception when isabelle build is used (curiously, the <br>\ninteractive session works just fine, despite the fact that <br>\nquick_and_dirty is always active there):</p>\n<p>|fun ex :: \"'a ⇒ nat\" where \"ex _ = 0\" theorem ex_const: \"ex 5 = ex 7\" <br>\nby auto ML ‹ exception E; if (Thm_Deps.has_skip_proof [@{thm ex_const}]) <br>\nthen raise E else () ›|</p>\n<p>I though that while the oracle would be present from the point of the <br>\nsession graph where quick_and_dirty was enabled, proofs that do not use <br>\nit would not have it as a dependency. Am i mistaken?</p>\n<p>Also, is there a reason why headless build and interactive session <br>\ndiverge here?</p>\n<p>Fabian</p>",
