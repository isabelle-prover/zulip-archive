Quickcheck had some regression tests but none covering nested types. It took quite some time (until 2016?) before anybody pointed out the breakage on the mailing list, and it has been hanging on my TODO list (and my conscience) ever since then.</p>\n<p>I'll move it to the top of my TODO list, but it's a quite daunting task that will take a good chunk of free time to concentrate. I can't promise I'll find the time to do it in the coming 2-3 months.</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
