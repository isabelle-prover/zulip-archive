Some highlights:</p>\n<p>* It enables fine-grained interactions (e.g., you can do pattern<br>\n    matching and similar operations on individual terms in the Scala<br>\n    application as if they were Scala types, but also apply Isabelle<br>\n    operations (e.g., simplification) on it, transparently).<br>\n    This means you can use it to build applications that reason about<br>\n    math and use the existing Isabelle theories/tools for some<br>\n    operations. (Such as the theorem prover qrhl-tool<br>\n    &lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/dominique-unruh/qrhl-tool\">https://github.com/dominique-unruh/qrhl-tool</a>&gt;.)</p>\n<p>* It is extensible: besides built in support for Isabelle objects such<br>\n    as terms, contexts, theorems, ..., one can easily add support for<br>\n    new types and operations without changing the library itself.</p>\n<p>* Garbage collection is supported: Isabelle values can be garbage<br>\n    collected when they are released in Scala.</p>\n<p>* Speed: on my computer, the round-trip time for simple operations is<br>\n    0.03ms, compared to ~20ms which seemed to be the round-trip time of<br>\n    the PIDE-based libisabelle.</p>\n<p>* It is supposed to be a replacement of the discontinued libisabelle<br>\n    &lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/larsrh/libisabelle\">https://github.com/larsrh/libisabelle</a>&gt; by Lars Hupel.</p>\n<p>You can find more information in the README <br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/dominique-unruh/scala-isabelle/blob/master/README.md\">https://github.com/dominique-unruh/scala-isabelle/blob/master/README.md</a>&gt;.</p>\n<p>Or ask me anything (especially if you are wondering whether <br>\nscala-isabelle is useful for your project or has specific features), <br>\ne.g., in the Gitter chat <br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://gitter.im/dominique-unruh/scala-isabelle\">https://gitter.im/dominique-unruh/scala-isabelle</a>&gt; or by email.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",
