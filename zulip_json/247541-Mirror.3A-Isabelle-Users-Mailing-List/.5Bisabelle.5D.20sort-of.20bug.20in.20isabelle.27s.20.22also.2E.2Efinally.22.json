But it's highly misleading -- it looks like I've proved {} ⊇ {1} as a subgoal.</p>\n<p>I think what's happening is that the \"...\" is being bound to the right-hand side of the previous line _after_ the abbreviation \"{1,2} ⊇ {}\" has been expanded to \"{} ⊆ {1,2}\". In other words, \"...\" is standing for {1,2}, not {}.</p>\n<p>This is very confusing for the user. Can it be fixed so that the \"...\" is always bound to the right-hand side of the previous line _before_ any abbreviations are expanded?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nJohn</p>",
