I've tried something like</p>\n<p>context algloc begin<br>\nsublocale sigloc \"Sig AA\"<br>\nend</p>\n<p>but I don't think that works the way I would like it to work, as AA is treated just as a variable then. I don't want to do just</p>\n<p>locale algloc = sigloc + <br>\n  fixes AA :: \"'a algebra\" </p>\n<p>because then algloc takes two parameters (S and AA)  instead of just one (AA). Is there an easy/standard way to do this?</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Steven</p>",

But it does not immediately help with my problem, unfortunately. Actually, I was mistaken in my earlier description of the problem, the sublocale instantiation works as I would want it to work, but the syntax of the super locale definition is not automatically transferred to the sub locale, which led to my confusion (see picture below). The syntax transfer does also not work with Richard's syntax.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to transfer the syntax of definitions automatically?</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Steven<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/NQxfnNAQIn4CG3gZ0TVaBf8w/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/NQxfnNAQIn4CG3gZ0TVaBf8w/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/NQxfnNAQIn4CG3gZ0TVaBf8w/image.png\"></a></div>",

Although, it would be nice to have the option to override that for special cases, for example if the syntax</p>\n<p>locale B = A \"k*3\" for k :: nat</p>\n<p>is used which Richard proposed, then I would expect syntax inheritance.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Steven</p>",
