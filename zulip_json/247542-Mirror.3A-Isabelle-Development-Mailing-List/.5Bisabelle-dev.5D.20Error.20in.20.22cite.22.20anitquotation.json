Moreover, we can eventually make an HTML <br>\npresentation of the bibliography, e.g. with the bib2xhtml tool that is already <br>\nbundled with Isabelle.</p>\n<p>Presently, bib2xhtml is only used for HTML preview of .bib files in <br>\nIsabelle/jEdit. To see that, open e.g. $ISABELLE_HOME/src/Doc/manual.bib and <br>\nthen invoke the action isabelle.preview (e.g. via the menu Plugins / Isabelle <br>\n/ Show preview in browser).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I didn’t even know we had an antiquotation “cite”, so any clues what to do would be welcome.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are some recent NEWS here: <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/source/isabelle/browse/default/NEWS;1e31ddcab45$24\">https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/source/isabelle/browse/default/NEWS;1e31ddcab45$24</a></p>\n<p>The regular documentation is in isar-ref for the antiquotation \"cite\" (e.g. <br>\nsee the index).</p>\n<p>I did not announce the recent changes to cite so far, because I am still not <br>\nfinished with it: there are always some new surprises.</p>\n<p>The reason, why I've revisited all this is interactive document preparation in <br>\nIsabelle/jEdit. It allows to omit theories from the document, but this could <br>\nleave the bibliography empty and bibtex would complain.</p>\n<p>So now in Isabelle/34219d664854, citations for excluded theories are taken <br>\nfrom unprocessed source and turned into \\nocite commands. This works, because <br>\nthe notation \\&lt;^cite&gt;CARTOUCHE is easily detected, even without formal <br>\nchecking of the theory.</p>\n<p>This approach could be pushed one step further: instead of latex + bibtex + <br>\nlatex on the whole document to produce the initial root.aux + root.bbl, it <br>\ncould be done on the empty template with \\nocite commands. Then a final latex <br>\nrun on the document together with the generated root.aux/bbl would be <br>\nsufficient (but page references would require one more latex run).</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>\n<hr>\n<p>isabelle-dev mailing list<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:isabelle-dev@in.tum.de\">isabelle-dev@in.tum.de</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://mailman46.in.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/isabelle-dev\">https://mailman46.in.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/isabelle-dev</a></p>",
