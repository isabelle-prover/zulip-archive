I only<br>\nhave the name of the fact but not its proper representation for<br>\nSledgehammer fact_override. I tried to look at what the parser does but<br>\ncannot decipher its behaviour. Therefore I would greatly appreciate a<br>\nsuccinct function that does the transformation specified above.</p>\n<p>Many thanks,<br>\nAlbert</p>",
