There is new material in Grothendieck_Schemes and I’ve prepared additional material for a pending submission. The question is what to do with all this.</p>\n<p>One idea would be to put it all into Clemens’ original development, but that can’t be right because was his experiment on the formalisation of a particular textbook (by Jacobson). But would it be right to make a copy of this AFP entry and just keep adding to it over time? This also is not normal for the AFP. Or should it be added directly to the distribution?</p>\n<p>Having a new copy would also make it easier to make changes to suit further developments. In particular, Clemens overloads the / symbol to denote division on groups, which could be irritating in contexts where people need real division.</p>\n<p>Thoughts would be welcome!</p>\n<p>Larry</p>\n<hr>\n<p>isabelle-dev mailing list<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:isabelle-dev@in.tum.de\">isabelle-dev@in.tum.de</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://mailman46.in.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/isabelle-dev\">https://mailman46.in.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/isabelle-dev</a></p>",
