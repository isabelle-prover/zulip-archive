        "content": "<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href=\"mailto:makarius@sketis.net\">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>\nI am now ready to answer some questions (both explicit and implicit ones).</p>\n<p>(1) Isabelle/jEdit appears to \"hang\": this is because the CTT session already <br>\ncontains the example (there used to be separate sessions CTT and CTT-ex many <br>\nyears ago). We used to have a minimalistic PIDE error message \"Cannot update <br>\nfinished theory\", but that was lost in 2019 (changeset cceb10dcc9f9).</p>\n<p>I have amended that as follows:</p>\n<p>changeset:   76046:507c65cc4332<br>\nuser:        wenzelm<br>\ndate:        Sat Sep 03 17:20:35 2022 +0200<br>\nfiles:       src/Pure/PIDE/resources.ML src/Pure/PIDE/resources.scala<br>\ndescription:<br>\nback to more traditional import_name (reverting cceb10dcc9f9), e.g. relevant <br>\nfor \"isabelle jedit -l CTT src/CTT/ex/Elimination.thy\" to produce proper error <br>\n\"Cannot update finished theory CTT.Elimination\";</p>\n<p>I have also added a few more changes to the tension of logical theory names <br>\n(e.g. HOL-Library.Multiset) vs. file-system path names more robust, for example:</p>\n<p>changeset:   76050:f1dc3d9d5164<br>\nuser:        wenzelm<br>\ndate:        Sat Sep 03 22:25:22 2022 +0200<br>\nfiles:       src/Pure/PIDE/resources.ML src/Pure/PIDE/resources.scala<br>\ndescription:<br>\ncheck imports more strictly, e.g. reject \".../Pure\" or \".../HOL-Library.Multiset\";</p>\n<p>In the next round of refinements (after the release), I will make finished <br>\ntheories load their PIDE markup from the build database and display that. <br>\nMoreover there should be better GUI feedback about the status of read-only <br>\nbrowsing of already loaded theories vs. editable theories.</p>\n<p>(2) Schematic goals and main goal state. In the depths of time, goal states <br>\nwere directly shown to the user, notably the main conclusion (as a reminder on <br>\nthe TTY and to see the current instantiation). This came out of use, because <br>\nit was a waste of screen space and time to print it. The option show_main_goal <br>\nis still there to get this old behaviour, but it is a bit ugly, because the <br>\ngoal package treats the main goal as private property that is not shown to <br>\nusers: it may contain funny markers and auxiliary goals to ensure that <br>\nschematic goal instances can be determined reliably.</p>\n<p>It is still possible to enable show_main_goal for a theory context, e.g. <br>\nHOL-Prolog.HOHH at this point in history <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/source/isabelle/browse/default/src/HOL/Prolog/HOHH.thy;922e3f9251a$13\">https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/source/isabelle/browse/default/src/HOL/Prolog/HOHH.thy;922e3f9251a$13</a> <br>\n(from 08-Sep-2022). Applications of HOL-Prolog will then show the full goal <br>\nstate as in 1989.</p>\n<p>I have discontinued this nostalgic mode only 1h later:</p>\n<p>changeset:   76094:4dec713d3bc9<br>\nuser:        wenzelm<br>\ndate:        Thu Sep 08 22:59:21 2022 +0200<br>\nfiles:       src/HOL/Prolog/HOHH.thy<br>\ndescription:<br>\ngive up show_main_goal (despite 922e3f9251ac): show_goal_inst is sufficient, <br>\neven for final results;</p>\n<p>For CTT it is up to you: either use the new \"goal instantiation\" display, <br>\nwhich is there by default, or enable the old show_main_goal option in theory CTT.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>\n<hr>\n<p>isabelle-dev mailing list<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:isabelle-dev@in.tum.de\">isabelle-dev@in.tum.de</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://mailman46.in.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/isabelle-dev\">https://mailman46.in.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/isabelle-dev</a></p>",
