It started out as <br>\na universal and uniform 16-bit character sets many decades ago (UCS-2), but is <br>\nnow a conglomerate of many add-ons and adhoc complexity, in order to <br>\napproximate text representation for every language on the planet (including <br>\nmathematics).</p>\n<p>The problem here is that the script \"𝒜\" was introduced much later than \"ℬ\": <br>\nthus it requires 2 16-bit characters instead of just 1. Many Java (or <br>\nJavaScript) programs will usually get it wrong, because they work with type <br>\nChar (\"character\") instead of Int (codepoint).</p>\n<p>This complexity (and failure) of Unicode is avoided in Isabelle by using a <br>\nmore stable and uniform notion of \"Isabelle symbols\". The Isabelle/jEdit <br>\nfront-end uses \"poor-man's rendering of Isabelle symbols in Unicode\". Thus the <br>\nunderlying jEdit text editor may get things wrong occasionally: it would be <br>\nbetter to work natively with Isabelle symbols everywhere.</p>\n<p>Here are some snippets to illustrate the situation:</p>\n<p>(<em>Isabelle/ML symbols: good</em>)<br>\nML ‹Symbol.explode \"𝒜_def ℬ_def\" |&gt; map (fn s =&gt; (s, Symbol.is_letter s))›</p>\n<p>(<em>Isabelle/Scala symbols or UTF-16 codepoints: good</em>)<br>\nSymbol.explode(\"𝒜_def ℬ_def\").map(s =&gt; (s, Symbol.is_letter(s)))</p>\n<p>(<em>Java UTF-16 codepoints: good</em>)<br>\nCodepoint.iterator(\"𝒜_def ℬ_def\").toList.map(c =&gt; (c, Character.isLetter(c)))</p>\n<p>(<em>Java UCS-2 characters: bad</em>)<br>\n\"𝒜_def ℬ_def\".toList.map(c =&gt; (c, Character.isLetter(c)))</p>\n<p>The first one is for the Isabelle/jEdit document buffer, within a formal <br>\ntheory context. The other ones are for the Console/Scala REPL: here you may <br>\nnotice that the Java GUI component cannot display the \"𝒜\" anymore, after it <br>\ngot chopped up into 2 characters.</p>\n<p>I am already used to post tickets to the average Java project, in order to <br>\nmake such fine-points more correct. But for jEdit we have a certain status-quo <br>\nthat won't move much.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>\n<hr>\n<p>isabelle-dev mailing list<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:isabelle-dev@in.tum.de\">isabelle-dev@in.tum.de</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://mailman46.in.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/isabelle-dev\">https://mailman46.in.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/isabelle-dev</a></p>",
