Right <br>\nnow it looks like an unfinished private experiment that has escaped into the <br>\npublic repository.</p>\n<p>Concerning Isabelle components in general, there are some explanations in <br>\nAdmin/components/PLATFORMS. Without proper multi-platform support, components <br>\nrarely make any sense. \"Works for me on Linux\" is not sufficient.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we now have the de-facto quality standard to assemble components as <br>\n(semi)automated and repeatable process in Isabelle/Scala. See the many <br>\nexisting tools \"isabelle component_XYZ\".</p>\n<p>Since this is all a lot of work and requires great care, we have de-facto <br>\nconverged to a situation where I am the main provider and maintainer of all <br>\ncomponents.</p>\n<p>As a minimum there should be a proper discussion about the need and purpose of <br>\na particular component. The decision to support a particular external project, <br>\nby inclusion in the Isabelle space, should never be taken lightly.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>\n<hr>\n<p>isabelle-dev mailing list<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:isabelle-dev@in.tum.de\">isabelle-dev@in.tum.de</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://mailman46.in.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/isabelle-dev\">https://mailman46.in.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/isabelle-dev</a></p>",
