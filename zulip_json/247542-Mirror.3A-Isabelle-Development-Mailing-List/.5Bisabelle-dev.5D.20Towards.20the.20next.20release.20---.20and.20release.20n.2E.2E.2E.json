(I always try to shorten the<br>\ninterval a bit, but rarely manage.)</p>\n<p>The overall plan is like this:</p>\n<p>* Sun 03-Oct-2021: rough RC0 as \"preview\"</p>\n<p>* 01-Nov-2021: official RC1</p>\n<p>* total of 4-6 RCs for consolidation</p>\n<p>* final immutable release before 15-Dec-2021</p>\n<p>The remaining question right now is if we want to venture at a change of the<br>\nrelease naming scheme. According to the existing scheme, it would be<br>\n\"Isabelle2021-1 (December 2021)\". Afterwards there would be \"Isabelle2022<br>\n(October 2022)\".</p>\n<p>Some decades ago, Larry treated the year like a major version number, with<br>\noccasional bumps added via -1, -2, -3. E.g. see the long and successful series<br>\nof Isabelle94-n, even with a few releases lost in time and space:<br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/download_past.html\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/download_past.html</a></p>\n<p>After 2011, this scheme no longer made any sense: So many great things were<br>\nalready present in the Isabelle corpus, that made it hard to justify a major<br>\nrelease number increase again. So instead of being stuck with 2011<br>\nindefinitely (which was after addition of PIDE), and merely have variations<br>\n2011-1, 2011-2, 2011-3, 2011-4, ..., we followed a modified scheme where the<br>\nyear is always that of the calender and tags -1, -2 distinguish multiple<br>\nreleases per year.</p>\n<p>[3 releases actually did happen in 2013, because Isabelle2013-1 (November<br>\n2013) had serious problems in PIDE that had to be addressed in Isabelle2013-2<br>\n(December 2013). Like in the Roman Empire or the Habsburg Empire, a \"3 Emporer<br>\nyear\" is actually something very bad, and to be avoided at all cost.]</p>\n<p>In summary we could venture at a slight reform as follows:</p>\n<p>* Releases are always named after the calender year + month of final<br>\nappearance, lets say \"Isabelle2021-Dec\" for the coming release: Following the<br>\nnaming scheme for months \"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\",<br>\n\"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\" that is used in other places of Isabelle<br>\nalready. An alternative is to spell out the month, e.g. Isabelle2021-December.</p>\n<p>* This year + month scheme would continue uniformly in the future,<br>\nindependently of the number of releases per year. So after \"Isabelle2021-Dec\"<br>\nwould come something like \"Isabelle2022-Oct\".</p>\n<p>* The explanatory add-on like \"(December 2021)\" disappears, being now<br>\nredundant. IIRC correctly, I had proposed this to Larry on the occasion of<br>\n\"Isabelle94-7 (November 1996)\" to make it look a bit less confusing to our<br>\ngrowing user community.</p>\n<p>How is the feeling for this idea after so much text, which only scratches many<br>\ndelicate points of our long history?</p>\n<p>What name should it be?</p>\n<p>Isabelle2021-1 (December 2021)<br>\n   Isabelle2021-Dec<br>\n   Isabelle2021-December</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>\n<hr>\n<p>isabelle-dev mailing list<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:isabelle-dev@in.tum.de\">isabelle-dev@in.tum.de</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://mailman46.in.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/isabelle-dev\">https://mailman46.in.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/isabelle-dev</a></p>",

I think it would help to explicitly state the actual deficits that <br>\nshould/could be addressed. Based on that, it would be easier to evaluate <br>\nand compare suggestions for new schemes.</p>\n<p>Here is what I can think of.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>There is an asymmetry between the first and second release in a given <br>\nyear (e.g. Isabelle2021 vs Isabelle2021-1).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To an uninitiated user, it may not be entirely clear which one of is <br>\nthe most recent (e.g. Isabelle2021-1 may be wrongly interpreted as some <br>\nkind of prerelease).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Out of Makarius's suggestions, I personally like the fact that the three <br>\nletter months always lead to versions having the same number of <br>\ncharacters, which also imply that they have same physical length in <br>\nmonospace fonts. Using month numbers would also share this <br>\ncharacteristic (e.g. Isabelle2021-12 or Isabelle2021.12).</p>\n<p>However, one advantage of the current scheme is its fine granularity. <br>\nThree emperors in a year are certainly to be avoided at all cost, but it <br>\ncannot be excluded entirely. The naming scheme should have a solution in <br>\nsuch situation. What would happen if a critical bug was discovered in <br>\nIsabelle2021-Dec? An lengthy solution would be to use ISO 8601 dates <br>\n(e.g. Isabelle2021-12-01) but is aesthetically disputable.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nMartin<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/DipGC1PwKYMXRCy563wvdm5B/OpenPGP_0x58AE985FE188789A.asc\">OpenPGP_0x58AE985FE188789A.asc</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/Vb0cDxjposUIPk8dKuEaFf0l/OpenPGP_signature\">OpenPGP_signature</a></p>",
