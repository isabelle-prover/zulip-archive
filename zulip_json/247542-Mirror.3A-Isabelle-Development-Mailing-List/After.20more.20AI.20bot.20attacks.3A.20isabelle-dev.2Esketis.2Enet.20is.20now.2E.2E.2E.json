We are presently losing that.</p>\n<p>* For development use, the main purpose of <a href=\"http://isabelle-dev.sketis.net\">isabelle-dev.sketis.net</a> is to <br>\nbrowse the history. I've also seen IntelliJ IDEA being used for that, or a <br>\ndifferent high-end Mercurial client. One happy day that functionality will <br>\nbecome part of the regular Prover IDE.</p>\n<p>* To access particular Isabelle versions (e.g. for automated clones) it is <br>\nbetter to use a regular hgweb service. The traditional one is <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle</a> but that has seen various technical <br>\nproblems recently. I am now more often using the clone <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle\">https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle</a></p>\n<p>Hgweb does not suffer much from bad AI bots: the performance for Python + Rust <br>\n(hg) is better than PHP + MySQL (Phorge). It is still a waste of energy, and <br>\nthe planet would be in better shape without all this AI non-sense.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
