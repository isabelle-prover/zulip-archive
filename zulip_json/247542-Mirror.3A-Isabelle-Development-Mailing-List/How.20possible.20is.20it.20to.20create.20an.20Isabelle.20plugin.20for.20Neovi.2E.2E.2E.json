According to a blog post (<a href=\"https://whonore.github.io/src/projects/coqtail.html\">https://whonore.github.io/src/projects/coqtail.html</a>), Coqtail uses Coq's XML protocol to function, which is well documented here (<a href=\"https://github.com/rocq-prover/rocq/blob/master/dev/doc/xml-protocol.md\">https://github.com/rocq-prover/rocq/blob/master/dev/doc/xml-protocol.md</a>). As far as I know, there isn't much documentation on how to communicate with Isabelle/PIDE, though I believe that the way to do it would be through XML, as I see some use of the XML protocol in the Isabelle code I downloaded. I can't really tell if what I want to do is possible without significant changes to Isabelle itself, so I'm asking for the opinion of somebody who knows what they are doing.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading this, hope you have a great day.</p>",
