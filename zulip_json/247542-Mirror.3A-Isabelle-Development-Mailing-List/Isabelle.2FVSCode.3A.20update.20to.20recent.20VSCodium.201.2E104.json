Note that some Linux<br>\nsystems (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04) require special file permissions to run<br>\n\"isabelle vscode\" or \"isabelle electron\" like this:<p>cd .../vscodium-1.104.06131/x86_64-linux<br>\n   sudo chown root:root chrome-sandbox<br>\n   sudo chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This refers to Isabelle/de5f468de460.</p>\n<p>That is the result of struggling for approx. 2 weeks with the convoluted build <br>\nprocess for VSCode (or rather VSCodium). Until vscodium-1.70.1 from Aug-2022 <br>\nit was possible to build all platforms on Linux, even the native Windows <br>\nversion. Now it is necessary to use a native platform with native build tools: <br>\nthis is mildly annoying for macOS, and very challenging for Windows. It <br>\nrequires full Visual Studio C++ with strange add-on libraries, a Python <br>\ninstallation for Windows, and a carefully crafted Msys2 environment.</p>\n<p>Thus even the dreaded \"node-gyp rebuild node-pty\" works eventually: resulting <br>\nin Unix-style Terminal experience in VSCode, on all platforms.</p>\n<p>I could tell more stories from the depths of the VSCode + Electron + Node.js <br>\nenvironment. To continue this much further we shall require substantial <br>\nresources eventually.</p>\n<p>For now, I will merely brush up Isabelle/VSCode a little bit for the coming <br>\nrelease, integrating the last 2-3 student projects properly.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
