See the blog entry <br>\n<a href=\"https://sketis.net/2025/release-candidates-for-isabelle2025-1\">https://sketis.net/2025/release-candidates-for-isabelle2025-1</a> for <br>\ndocumentation of the ongoing release process.</p>\n<p>Approx. 4 weeks before the first release candidate, there is now an informal <br>\nsnapshot for early experimentation: <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2025-1-RC0\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2025-1-RC0</a></p>\n<p>This opens a window of opportunity to provide feedback, until the final <br>\nrelease becomes unchangeable (approx. 15-Dec-2025). As usual, feedback <br>\nmessages should use a proper Subject line and not just a clone of this <br>\nannouncement.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
