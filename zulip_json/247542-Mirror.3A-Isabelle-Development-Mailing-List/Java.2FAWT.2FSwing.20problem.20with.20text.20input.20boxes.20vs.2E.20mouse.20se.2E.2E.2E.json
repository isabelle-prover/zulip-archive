This often happens, after selecting all text with the mouse from<br>\n   the ∗‹right›.</p>\n<p>❙‹Workaround:› Select text with the mouse from the ∗‹left›, or use regular<br>\n   keyboard shortcuts like ▩‹C+a› or ▩‹S+HOME›.</p>\n<p>Despite a lot of time spent on investigations, I can do nothing about it. The <br>\nproblem belongs to the OpenJDK project. Here are notable tickets:</p>\n<p>* <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8325052\">https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8325052</a> (Jan-2024,closed)<br>\n   * <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8319880\">https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8319880</a> (Nov-2023, open)</p>\n<p>We can merely wait a few more years, until they finally close that.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the problem can be even seen in IntelliJ IDEA, despite all its <br>\nambitious add-ons to the GUI, and so many Java experts using it every day.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
