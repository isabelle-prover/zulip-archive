That is non-optional.</p>\n<p>In addition, a brief summary with time (range), name(s), optional affiliation <br>\nmay be added to CONTRIBUTORS. That is optional: Sometimes there are reasons to <br>\nemphasize contributions, and sometimes there are reasons not to.</p>\n<p>As usual, I will be busy in the coming weeks to sort out pending discussions <br>\nthat are relevant to the release.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
