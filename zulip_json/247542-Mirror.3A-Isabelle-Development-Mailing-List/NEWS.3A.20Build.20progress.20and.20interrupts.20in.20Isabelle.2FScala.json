It<br>\nwas broken since Isabelle2022: Scala interpreter thread became<br>\ninoperative afterwards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Console/Scala: more robust Scala_Console.Progress with local output<br>\nand interrupt handling (using thread interrupt, e.g. via \"Stop\" button).<br>\nFor example:</p>\n<p>val progress = new Scala_Console.Progress(verbose = true)<br>\n Build.build_logic(PIDE.options, \"FOL\", progress = progress)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>* System </strong>*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Isabelle/Scala operations Build.build(), Build.build_logic() etc.<br>\nalready include progress.interrupt_handler for the main loop. It is no<br>\nlonger required as a separate wrapper for command-line tools etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Isabelle/Scala operation Progress.interrupt_handler is now more<br>\nspecific for different instances of class Progress, with mixins<br>\nProgress.Local_Interrupts (for thread interrupts) and<br>\nProgress.Global_Interrupts (for thread interrupts and process signals).<br>\nThe latter is included in class Console_Progress, which is typically<br>\nused for a single command-line tool that is directly connected to the<br>\nsystem shell and its signals (e.g. CTRL-C). The default (new Progress)<br>\ndoes not change interrupt handling at all. Subtle INCOMPATIBILITY in<br>\nvery rare situations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This refers to Isabelle/174c4514438c.</p>\n<p>It is the result of several rounds of refinements in this area. Many years <br>\nago, class Progress was rather primitive: <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/8a4bd05c1735/src/Pure/System/progress.scala\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/8a4bd05c1735/src/Pure/System/progress.scala</a></p>\n<p>Now it serves as an umbrella for many variants on message output and interrupt <br>\nhandling. That required some reworking, which is hopefully sufficient for now, <br>\nalthough I can anticipate further refinements in the future.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
