This is only a device for migration <br>\nand will vanish sooner or later.</p>\n<p>It is anyway very unlikely that this is actually needed – during the <br>\nmigration of existing theories it turned out that most code equations <br>\nare declared in »natural« order anyway, which now fits perfectly to the <br>\nclarified semantics.</p>\n<p>Florian</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/JSlrxIQ4est9ktqcstwoHO-4/OpenPGP_0xA707172232CFA4E9.asc\">OpenPGP_0xA707172232CFA4E9.asc</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/A4vqQHaMXuVw7LCHNpIxYOhZ/OpenPGP_signature.asc\">OpenPGP_signature.asc</a></p>",
