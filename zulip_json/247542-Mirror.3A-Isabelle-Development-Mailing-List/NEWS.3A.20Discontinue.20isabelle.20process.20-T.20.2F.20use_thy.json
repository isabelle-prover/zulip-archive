The proper<br>\nway to process individual theories under program control is via<br>\n\"isabelle process_theories\". INCOMPATIBILITY.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This refers to Isabelle/7505b5e592b1.</p>\n<p>It needs to be understood in the context of the new \"isabelle <br>\nprocess_theories\", which is adjacent in the NEWS and provides a proper <br>\nIsabelle/Scala context for the Isabelle/ML process.</p>\n<p>At some point after the Isabelle2025-1 release, I will revisit the remaining <br>\nThy_Info.use_theories, which is the ML entry point for \"isabelle build\". <br>\nWithout the assumption of being a sequential ML toplevel operation, it can be <br>\ndone more efficiently, e.g. commit presentation hooks when a theory is <br>\nfinished, and delete its intermediate states on the spot (instead of at the <br>\nend of the build 'theories' section).</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
