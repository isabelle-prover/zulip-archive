Plain text files are opened in the editor, but PDFs<br>\nrequire a suitable VSCode extension (e.g. \"vscode-pdf\" from the<br>\nmarketplace).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Output panels for Isabelle Symbols and Sledgehammer, which imitate<br>\nIsabelle/jEdit dockables to some extent.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This refers to Isabelle/b42e2dd962a8, but the starting point was 486e094b676c: <br>\napprox. 12 days and 150 changesets earlier.</p>\n<p>This integrates the Bachelor project by Diana Korchmar, LMU München. The <br>\nproject was intended as an experiment to see if/how Isabelle/VSCode could <br>\neventually catch up with Isabelle/jEdit. My conclusion: we need a quite <br>\ndifferent approach; imitating existing Scala/Swing GUIs with untyped/unscoped <br>\nHTML/JS/CSS is not going to work --- it leads to unmaintainable self-forks.</p>\n<p>There are also fundamental limitations of the underlying VSCode: Electron = <br>\nNode.js + Chromium. That might all be considered \"popular\" and \"modern\", but <br>\nit actually feels very archaic to me (funny scripting languages and <br>\ncooperative multitasking from the early 1980s).</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
