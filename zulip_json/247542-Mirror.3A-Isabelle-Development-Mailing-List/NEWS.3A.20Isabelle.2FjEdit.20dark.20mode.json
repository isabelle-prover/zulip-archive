The panels for \"Global Options\" and \"Plugin Options /<br>\nIsabelle / Rendering\" operate on options according to the current Swing<br>\nlook &amp; feel, e.g. on \"view.fgColor.dark\" in dark mode vs. \"view.fgColor\"<br>\nin non-dark mode.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This refers to Isabelle/f7007ebfb556.
