This was broken in<br>\nIsabelle2025-1: Isar commands were considered interactive due to the<br>\ndefault option \"show_results=true\". Proper behaviour could be recovered<br>\nin Isabelle2025-1 via \"isabelle build -o show_results=false\", but it is<br>\nbetter to use Isabelle2025-2. Both approaches result in minor changes of<br>\nresult messages stored in session build databases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>* Isabelle/jEdit Prover IDE </strong>*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Console/Scala: proper treatment of interrupts via \"Stop\" button. It<br>\nwas broken since Isabelle2022: Scala interpreter thread became<br>\ninoperative afterwards.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This refers to Isabelle/89701cf1768e.</p>\n<p>The release website requires some time to be fully updated, including all <br>\nmirrors. Afterwards, I will make a proper announcement on isabelle-users.</p>\n<p>The plan for Isabelle2026 (October 2026) remains unchanged: <br>\n<a href=\"https://sketis.net/2025/plan-for-isabelle2026-october-2026\">https://sketis.net/2025/plan-for-isabelle2026-october-2026</a> --- thus we have <br>\nsufficient distance to the Christmas vacation.</p>\n<p>The last time we've had the awkward situation to have one release supersede <br>\nanother was Isabelle2013-2: <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013-2/dist/Isabelle2013-2/NEWS\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013-2/dist/Isabelle2013-2/NEWS</a> --- <br>\nthere were many more posthoc changes, and I was really worried about the <br>\noverall state of affairs.</p>\n<p>We have recovered from that pretty well in 2014/2015 by removing old system <br>\nvariations that no longer had a purpose (TTY REPL and Proof General Emacs), <br>\nand by relying more on Isabelle/Scala than the somewhat accidental <br>\noperating-system environment.</p>\n<p>Abstractly, the same idea is still relevant: this time it will be the removal <br>\nof the remains of ML-toplevel build (use_thy), together with odd historic <br>\noptions like \"interactive mode\" for Isar commands. Regular system options are <br>\nsufficient (module Options in Isabelle/ML and Isabelle/Scala).</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
