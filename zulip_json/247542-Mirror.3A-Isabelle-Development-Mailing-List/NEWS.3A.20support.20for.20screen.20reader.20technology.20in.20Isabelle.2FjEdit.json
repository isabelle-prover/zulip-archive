Tested with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NVDA (Windows), see <a href=\"https://www.nvaccess.org\">https://www.nvaccess.org</a></li>\n<li>JAWS (Windows), see <a href=\"https://support.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS\">https://support.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS</a></li>\n<li>VoiceOver (macOS), builtin Command-F5</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This refers to Isabelle/d83e23a67e9c. The most relevant source file is here <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle/file/d83e23a67e9c/src/Tools/jEdit/src/jedit_accessible.scala\">https://isabelle.sketis.net/repos/isabelle/file/d83e23a67e9c/src/Tools/jEdit/src/jedit_accessible.scala</a> <br>\n--- plus a few patches on the jEdit code base.</p>\n<p>It is an initial result of an ongoing project (from Sep-2025 to Sep-2026) with <br>\nJohannes Kepler University Linz, which is about Isabelle/MAWEN, an accessible <br>\nlearning environment for mathematics.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, we had initial attempts with Isabelle/VSCode: it was first <br>\nsuccessful (by mere luck) and later stopped working due to arbitrary changes <br>\nto the very dynamic code base of VSCode. We did not want to make ourselves <br>\ndepend on such a \"super cool\" project, so we revisited the ancient JAAPI for <br>\nJava/Swing instead. Hardly anybody knows about, but it turned out pretty clean <br>\nand straightforward to use. Each of the different screen readers requires some <br>\nminor tinkering to make it work smoothly.</p>\n<p>As usual for Java/Swing, the \"proof of existence\" is provided by IntelliJ <br>\nIDEA, which is both a major Java IDE and a major Swing application. IntelliJ <br>\nworks quite well with screen readers, as if that could be to be expected by <br>\ndefault --- but it is actually quite unusual.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
