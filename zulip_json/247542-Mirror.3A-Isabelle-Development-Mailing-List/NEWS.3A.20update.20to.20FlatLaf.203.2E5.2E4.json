The<br>\nlatter is missing for arm64-linux, so old 2.6 is used on that platform:<br>\nthis may lead to minor differences in GUI appearance and behaviour.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Due to the update of FlatLaf, x86_64-linux with Wayland window manager<br>\n(e.g. standard Ubuntu) now renders submenus like \"File / Recent Files\"<br>\nproperly. On arm64-linux an old problem of FlatLaf persists, but it is<br>\npossible to use WaylandEnable=false in /etc/gdm3/custom.conf and reboot.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This refers to Isabelle/5be1b4354638.</p>\n<p>I've had this on my TODO list for a long time, desparately waiting for a <br>\nproper arm64-linux version: the problem is actually one of the Gradle build <br>\ntool behind it. Now I've found that the above Wayland window manager problem <br>\ndisappears by updating FlatLaf. Apparently we have very few users of standard <br>\nUbuntu, so it rarely showed up in practice, and was only reported once (where <br>\nI could not reproduce it on the spot).</p>\n<p>Normally I would not make such a critical last-minute change just before RC1, <br>\nbut the guy behind FlatLaf (Karl Tauber from MÃ¼nchen-Brunnthal) usually <br>\ndelivers very solid releases without regressions.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
