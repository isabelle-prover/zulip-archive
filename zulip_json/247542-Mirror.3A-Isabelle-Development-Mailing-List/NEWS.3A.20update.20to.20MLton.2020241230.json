Windows<br>\nand Linux ARM remain unsupported, as before.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This refers to Isabelle/f178475f274d.</p>\n<p>MLton is important for code generation from HOL to Standard ML. In the past <br>\n2-3 years, the release situation did not look good, but just a few weeks ago, <br>\nsomeone has published up-to-date builds for recent OS / HW.
