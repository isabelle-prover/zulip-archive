Example: \"isabelle jedit -l HOL src/HOL/Nat.thy\" for theory<br>\n\"HOL.Nat\" in session \"HOL\". This information is read-only: editing<br>\ntheory sources in the editor will invalidate formal markup, and replace<br>\nit by an error message. Output messages depend on system options<br>\n\"show_results\" (default true) and \"show_states\" (default false),<br>\nprovided at build-time for the underlying session database.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>* Isabelle/VSCode Prover IDE </strong>*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The command-line tool \"isabelle vscode\" builds its underlying logic<br>\nsession before starting the VSCodium editor and its Isabelle language<br>\nserver. Thus build progress, errors, and interrupts work more robustly<br>\nvia the regular console.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The command-line tool \"isabelle vscode\" supports new options -D and -J<br>\nto configure the underlying Java process of \"isabelle vscode_server\",<br>\nusing the settings variable \"VSCODE_JAVA_OPTIONS\" as initial value to be<br>\naugmented. This is analogous to \"JEDIT_JAVA_OPTIONS\", but without<br>\n\"JEDIT_JAVA_SYSTEM_OPTIONS\"; regular \"ISABELLE_JAVA_SYSTEM_OPTIONS\" will<br>\nbe used instead of \"VSCODE_JAVA_SYSTEM_OPTIONS\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update to recent VSCode 1.105 / VSCodium 1.105.17075 (September 2025),<br>\nElectron 37.6.0, Chromium 138.0.7204.251, and Node.js 22.19.0. Note that<br>\nsome Linux systems (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04) require special file permissions<br>\nto run \"isabelle vscode\" or \"isabelle electron\" like this:</p>\n<p>cd .../vscodium-1.105.17075/x86_64-linux<br>\n   sudo chown root:root chrome-sandbox<br>\n   sudo chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This refers to Isabelle/1bbd2dc9b80e.</p>\n<p>It is mostly the end of the many Isabelle/VSCode changes for this release --- <br>\nwe could have spent our time in better ways, but I had promised a few people <br>\nto integrate things better and make a few improvements.</p>\n<p>Further remarks:</p>\n<p>* Loading theory \"HOL.List\" from the session image into the editor model <br>\nnow works. There was a Java stack overflow that was hard to spot in VSCode <br>\nOutput panel. I've addressed it in Isabelle/3673f8ce8f54.</p>\n<p>* vscodium-1.105.17075 is the \"latest\" version from that derivative project <br>\nof the official MicroSoft code base. Unless there are genuine problems with it <br>\nthere will be no further update for this Isabelle release: with so many <br>\nreleases of VSCode per year, every one will be outdated quickly, and the value <br>\nof new \"latest\" versions is somewhat diminished. (Building it on all platforms <br>\ntakes hours.)</p>\n<p>* The odd problem with file permissions on Ubuntu 24.04 has disappeared <br>\nlater on, e.g. in Ubuntu 25.10.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
