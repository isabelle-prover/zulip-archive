Thus the same download worked on both platforms, but on ARM it <br>\nrequired Rosetta 2, which is going to disappear after macOS 26.</p>\n<p>Concerning Intel, I have now invested 360 EUR into a refurbished Mac Mini 2018 <br>\n(i3 with 4 cores, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD). The 2018 line is the last one using <br>\nIntel CPUs, it supports macOS 12, 13, 14, 15, but not macOS 26. See also <br>\n<a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/specs/mac-mini-core-i3-3.6-late-2018-specs.html\">https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/specs/mac-mini-core-i3-3.6-late-2018-specs.html</a> <br>\nfor details.</p>\n<p>Thus we can easily continue x86_64-darwin for Isabelle contrib executables, as <br>\nlong as we have macOS 12..15 as our active baseline. There are many years <br>\nahead, until the upper end macOS 15 will have to be discontinued. Only <br>\nafterwards, our support for macOS will be for ARM exclusively. Note that I <br>\nwill soon discontinue macOS 12 and move to macOS 13, because it helps to <br>\nprovide uniform VSCodium and GHC/stack executables.</p>\n<p>Concerning pure arm64-darwin support, there is still a lot of homework to do <br>\nconcerning external provers and solvers. When that is done, we can split the <br>\nIsabelle application bundle into x86_64-darwin vs. arm64-darwin. That will <br>\nmark the beginning of the \"macos\" vs. \"macos_arm\" era, following the \"linux\" <br>\nvs. \"linux_arm\" from some years ago. (It will be many more years, until <br>\nwindows_arm might become relevant.)</p>\n<p>I would like to see macos_arm already for Isabelle2026 (October 2026), but it <br>\nis probably more realistic for a subsequent Isabelle release in 2027. Note <br>\nthat when macOS 27 hits the end-user market, people can no longer run Isabelle <br>\nwith all its add-on tools.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
