The plan says 03-Nov-2025, but it might turn out 1-2 <br>\ndays later (not more).</p>\n<p>It is now high time to wrap-up and actually finish things --- instead of <br>\nadding new things. Afterwards we will have a few weeks to polish everything, <br>\nbut the final release needs to be shipped before the Christmas vacation <br>\n(approx. 20-Dec-2025 until 12-Jan-2026). That is a hard deadline that cannot <br>\nbe postponed.</p>\n<p>This is particularly relevant for AFP.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
