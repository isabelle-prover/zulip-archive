(These are things that are not strictly necessary <br>\nto turn RC2 into a proper stable release eventually.)</p>\n<p>From long years of experience as release manager, that is caused by having &gt; <br>\n2 weeks of \"uncertainty\" on the status of isabelle-dev: Is it before or after <br>\nthe release? How does it relate to afp-devel? Shall I push now or much later?</p>\n<p>We cannot change that situation for now, but I am hoping for next time, which <br>\nmeans that the Isabelle release schedule is properly aligned with AFP <br>\nbeforehand --- it will save a lot of time for both of us.</p>\n<p>Right now, I will merely apply the specification of the \"before-vs-after <br>\nrelease point\" semantically to current isabelle-dev vs. isabelle-release, with <br>\nthe side-condition that the persistent history is not messed up unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>Thus the feature additions by Tobias shortly after RC2 are included by <br>\naccident, because they are already on isabelle-release: 58fc6856e31a <br>\nconcerning HOL-Library.While, 65734c8badd5 concerning newly introduced <br>\nHOL-Library.Time_Functions. Obscure corners of HOL-Library are not main HOL, <br>\nafter all.</p>\n<p>Other changes and feature additions by Martin and Jasmin on main HOL <br>\n(concerning cvc5 and metis) are not included: 764bc386d7dc etc. and a12a78878d4a.</p>\n<p>The fork-point for the release shall be:</p>\n<p>changeset:   83654:52cd371a36dd<br>\nuser:        wenzelm<br>\ndate:        Wed Nov 26 20:00:47 2025 +0100<br>\nfiles:       Admin/Mercurial/mercurial-6.1.4-hgweb.patch<br>\ndescription:<br>\nadhoc patch for hgweb.wsgi: provide \"hg clone\" via HTTP without suffering from <br>\nDenial-of-Service attacks on website content (e.g. by Non-Intelligent Agents);</p>\n<p>I will write a formal posting later today, to explain the status of the <br>\ndifferent repositories, as usual. In particular, changes for the release need <br>\nto be sent to me via email, and <em>not</em> pushed onto isabelle-dev at the same time.</p>\n<p>We are already late in the release process, and the year is approaching its <br>\nend. I hope to be able to publish the final and ultimate release until <br>\n17-Dec-2025, still within the plan that was published some months ago: <br>\n<a href=\"https://sketis.net/2025/plan-for-isabelle2025-1-december-2025\">https://sketis.net/2025/plan-for-isabelle2025-1-december-2025</a></p>\n<p>Here is also a notable quotation from that post:</p>\n<p>\"\"\"<br>\nImportant: Contributors need to have things ready for RC1 or RC2.
