Java LTS updates are usually <br>\nrock-solid: I can't remember a problem with it in recent years.</p>\n<p>Note that Java 21 LTS is actually the old LTS branch, while Java 25 LTS is <br>\nalready available since Sep-2025.</p>\n<p>It might become relevant for Isabelle2026 (October 2025), but it also requires <br>\nand update of Scala: We are presently lagging behind there, due to some <br>\nproblems, notably with the Java Accessibility API that has become relevant to <br>\nuse. The Scala guys have addressed my ticket for the scalac compiler already, <br>\nbut the result has not been published yet.</p>\n<p>I have also updated the cluster build manager to use Isabelle/661bf743296f <br>\nwith jdk-21.0.10. We did have another out-of-memory kill in the pipeline, but <br>\nthis is independent of Java versions. We need to sort out overly ambitious <br>\nJava heap usage on our side.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
