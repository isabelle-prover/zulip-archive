It also quite sensibly removes the default simprule going from x + iy to Complex x y. Nevertheless, when doing algebraic calculations, the Complex x y form is the practical choice.</p>\n<p>The commit msg is \"avoid the Complex constructor, use the more natural Re/Im view; moved csqrt to Complex”. </p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
