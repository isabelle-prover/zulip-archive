Basically the formalized version of <a href=\"https://math.andrej.com/2019/09/09/on-complete-ordered-fields/\">this</a>. I will use this in formalizing the <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eudoxus+real+number\">Eudoxus reals</a>, which is an alternative construction of the real numbers which only uses integers as building blocks (skipping the rationals). Thanks in advance!</p>",

I would be happy to find a good source with the proof of the fact you are asking about as well especially to see the role of the Axiom of Choice in it. Please post here if you find one.</p>",
