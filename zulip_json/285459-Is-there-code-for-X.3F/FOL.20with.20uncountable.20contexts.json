I've been playing around with trying to formalize some model theory and uncountable contexts show up semi-frequently once you get to more advanced model theory. Looking around, though, it seems like most of the libraries end up hard coding natural-indexed variables. (I've also tried to write this myself, but I think it's a bit beyond my ability to do robustly at the moment.)</p>",
