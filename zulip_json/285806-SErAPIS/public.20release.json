For tips on how to construct effective queries, please see Section 3 of the user guide.<br>\nNote that there are 6 different methods to experiment with.</p>\n<p>SErAPIS is also a platform for conducting research in novel methods to search Isabelle collections and machine learning in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>We kindly ask that you help us with our research by providing us with feedback on the relevance of SErAPIS search results to your searches.<br>\nGiving us feedback is optional but very easy to do (see Section 4 of the user guide).</p>\n<p>Your feedback will help us:</p>\n<p>(i)   build data-sets for Isabelle search and machine learning,<br>\n(ii)  develop new search algorithms for Isabelle collections and;<br>\n(iii) develop machine learning methods for aiding the construction of proofs in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>All data collected is anonymised.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>Yiannos Stathopoulos <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"229056\">@Yiannos</span>   and Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki.</p>",

We weren't aware of this--luckily the names are not the same, though  very similar. Hopefully there won't be any confusion as the Coq project is not a search engine.  In our case, SErAPIS  stands for \"Search Engine  by  the Alexandria Project  for ISabelle\"   and it is an intended pun referring to the deity \"Serapis\"  (see e.g. wiki) once worshipped in Alexandria--which is the name of our ERC project--inspired by the Library of Alexandria in Egypt, since we are working with libraries  of formal proofs :)    <a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/Grants/Alexandria/\">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/Grants/Alexandria/</a></p>",
