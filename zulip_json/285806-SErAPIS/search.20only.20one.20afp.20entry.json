I suggest you type this in the \"keywords\" , that should do the trick.  In particular I just tried searching with only \"nominal2\" in the keywords and it returns a bunch of results from the AFP from Nominal2.Nominal2_Abs, Nominal2.Nominal2_Base... If you want to make this more specific, you can try adding more keywords. Does this help?</p>",
