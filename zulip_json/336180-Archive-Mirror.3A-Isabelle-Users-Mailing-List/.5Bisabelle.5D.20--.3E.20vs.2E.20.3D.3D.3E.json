However, can a HOL<br>\nformula containing --&gt; be proved as one with ==&gt; instead? It seems it<br>\ndoesn't make much difference as impI replaces --&gt; by ==&gt;. My feeling is that<br>\nit's not safe to replace --&gt; with ==&gt;, but what really are the issues?</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nSteve</p>",

On the<br>\nother hand, \"--&gt;\" has type \"bool =&gt; bool =&gt; bool\", with \"bool\" being<br>\nthe type of HOL formulae.</p>\n<p>The types \"bool\" and \"prop\" are related by a special constant<br>\n\"Trueprop :: bool =&gt; prop\", which you can think of as the<br>\n\"is-a-true-HOL-formula\" predicate in the logical framework.<br>\nOccurrences of \"Trueprop\" are automatically inserted by Isabelle's<br>\nparser just where they are needed, and hidden by the pretty-printer;<br>\nhowever you are free to write them explicitly if you want to.</p>\n<p>Here's the precise sense in which --&gt; and ==&gt; are equivalent: For any<br>\nP, Q :: bool, \"Trueprop (P --&gt; Q)\" and \"Trueprop P ==&gt; Trueprop Q\" are<br>\nlogically equivalent as propositions. This means that replacing \"--&gt;\"<br>\nwith \"==&gt;\" should preserve the meaning of your theorems. But as Larry<br>\npoints out, within HOL formulae only \"--&gt;\" can be used; only the<br>\noutermost \"--&gt;\" (next to an invisible \"Trueprop\") can be replaced with<br>\n\"==&gt;\".</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brian</li>\n</ul>",
