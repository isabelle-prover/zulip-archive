Indeed, to any point (p,q), except (0,2),<br>\non the union of the following two tangent circles (from a topological point<br>\nof view this is a lemniscate)</p>\n<p>(x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 1, (x+1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 1</p>\n<p>we can associate a unique point f(p,q) defined as the intersection between<br>\nthe circle x^2 + (y-2)^2 = 4 and the ray from (0,2) to (p,q). Let g(u,v) be<br>\nthe stereographic projection projection from x^2 + (y-2)^2 = 4 to the<br>\nx-axis, considering (0, 4) as its north pole. Then, the composition<br>\ng(f(p,q)) is a homeomorphism from the union of the two small circles (x-1)^2</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(y-2)^2 = 1, (x+1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 1 (the topological lemniscate) to the<br>\nx-axis if and only if we assume that 1/0 = 0. Otherwise, g(f(p,q)) will<br>\nhave a singularity at (0,2).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if 1/0 = 0 was introduced in some proof assistants without deep<br>\nreasons, <em>a posteriori</em> it could be useful when considering mathematical<br>\nmodels where large numbers are like small numbers in some sense (large and<br>\nsmall with respect to absolute value). So, it induces a genuine<br>\nmathematical intuition motivated despite its origin as just a formal<br>\nsimplification.<br>\nJosé M.</p>",
