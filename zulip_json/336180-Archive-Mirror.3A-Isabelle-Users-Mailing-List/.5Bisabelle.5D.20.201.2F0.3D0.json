Of course, with<br>\nthis lemniscate of Bernoulli you can simulate the real line, just ignoring<br>\nthe issue with 1/0, but as Voevodsky pointed out, there are several<br>\nconnections between topology and type theory. Sometimes the \"defects\" of a<br>\ntype system are just indicators of a deep topological meaning, but more<br>\nresearch is needed before to reach a conclusion. For a traditional<br>\nmathematician, continuity is the best criterion to justify a definition:<br>\n\"nature doesn't jump\"as Leibniz said. If 1/0 = 0, then a mathematician<br>\ncould imagine that as a result the limit of a continuous process.<br>\nJosé M.</p>",
