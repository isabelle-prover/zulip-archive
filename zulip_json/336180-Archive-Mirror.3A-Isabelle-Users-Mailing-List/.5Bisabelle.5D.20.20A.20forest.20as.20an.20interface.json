I think that there are<br>\ntwo to ways to prove a theorem in Isabelle:</p>\n<p>(a) To copy the proof from a textbook (or a paper) in a linear way, i.e.,<br>\nto implement lemma by lemma in the same order as they appear in a textbook.</p>\n<p>(b) To write the statement of the theorem. To prove it using some lemmas,<br>\nassumed to be true by means of \"sorry\", guaranteeing that the complexity of<br>\neach lemma is strictly inferior to the complexity of the target theorem<br>\n(this is the art of doing mathematics). To repeat the same procedure to<br>\neach lemma.</p>\n<p>In my case, I prefer the approach (b), because one of my goals is to prove<br>\nthe theorems for myself as a personal challenge, without regarding<br>\ntextbooks. This is also the approach of every mathematician for doing<br>\nresearch. So, it would be nice to navigate the thy-file as an oriented<br>\nforest (in a graph theoretical sense): there is an arrow from lemma A to<br>\nlemma B if lemma A is used in the proof of lemma B. I guess that such a<br>\nforest is in the mind of any creative mathematician, because linear<br>\nthinking like in (a) seems to be artificial in order to make a scientific<br>\ndiscovery.</p>\n<p>Reference to graph-theoretic forests:<br>\n<a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Forest.html\">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Forest.html</a></p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nJosé M.</p>",
