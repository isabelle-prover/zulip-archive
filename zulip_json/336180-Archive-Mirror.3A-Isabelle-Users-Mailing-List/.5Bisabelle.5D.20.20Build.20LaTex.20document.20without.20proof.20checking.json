Diekmann\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:diekmann@in.tum.de\">diekmann@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>\nHello,</p>\n<p>I am creating a pdf document from my isabelle theory, using 'isabelle<br>\nmake -B' to rebuild the pdf document. Unfortunately, this takes very<br>\nlong. Is it possible (during development) to disable the proof<br>\nchecking? Most of my text in the <em>.thy files is enclosed in text {</em> *}<br>\nblocks. I make heavy use of 'thm' to refer to the definitions.<br>\nUnfortunately using 'usedir -D' and working on the generated *.tex files<br>\nis not an option. It would be great to see how changes in the *.thy file<br>\nend up in the resulting pdf.</p>\n<p>Best Regards<br>\nCornelius Diekmann</p>",
