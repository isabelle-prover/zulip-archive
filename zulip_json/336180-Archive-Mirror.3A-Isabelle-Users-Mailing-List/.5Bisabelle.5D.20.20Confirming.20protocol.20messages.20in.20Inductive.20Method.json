Basically, it is a restatement of the transaction, <br>\nfollowed<br>\nby an acknowledgement bit. Therefore, given the transaction is defined <br>\nby its<br>\noriginator name and a number (representing the transaction itself), the<br>\nevents go like this, where some preconditions are omitted:</p>\n<p>(* This rule refers to smartphone *)<br>\n| DT4: \"[evs4 \\in sdaptrans; legalUse(Smartphone A); A != Server; ...]<br>\n   ==&gt; Shows (Smartphone A) A {Agent A, Number T} # evs4 \\in sdaptrans\"</p>\n<p>(* This rule refers to the user *)<br>\n| DT5: \"[evs5 ∈ sdaptrans; legalUse(Smartphone A);<br>\n         Says A Server {Agent A, Number T} \\in set evs5;<br>\n         ...<br>\n         Shows (Smartphone A) A {Agent A, Number T} \\in set evs5]<br>\n   ==&gt; Inputs A (Smartphone A) {Agent A, Number T, Confirmation} # evs5 <br>\n\\in sdaptrans\"</p>\n<p>The Confirmation message is defined as follows:</p>\n<p>abbreviation<br>\n   Confirmation :: msg where \"Confirmation ≡ (Number 1)\"</p>\n<p>I am not pretty sure if this is a good approach. At some lemmas, I got <br>\nsome<br>\nsubgoals trying to replace the confirmation number by the transaction <br>\nnumber, as<br>\nif the Spy was faking the message. For me, the ideal approach would be <br>\nthat the<br>\nConfirmation part would be an immutable bit, not relying in a value, but <br>\nI do<br>\nnot know how to properly do that. I looked at some other protocols<br>\nformalization, but I couldn't find some valuable hint.</p>\n<p>I am open to any ideas. Thanks in advance.</p>\n<p>Ps: I'd like to thanks Larry Paulson for answering my previous <br>\nquestions. The<br>\nreplies were quite useful.</p>\n<p>-<br>\nFelipe Rodopoulos<br>\nGrad. student @ University of Brasília, Brazil</p>",
