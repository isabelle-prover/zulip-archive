It is interesting that<br>\nWindows has now become another platform for Linux. It generally looks<br>\nfine, but there are some restrictions:</p>\n<p>- there is no GUI environment, only a bash command-line<br>\n  - I did not manage to run x86-linux executables, only x86_64-linux<br>\n(this is relevant for poly)</p>\n<p>For z3, I had to install libgomp1, but it still produced error code 110<br>\nas above.</p>\n<p>I have also made a quick experiment with Z3 4.6.0<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases\">https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases</a> -- it does not crash, but causes<br>\nother problems, e.g. in ~~/src/HOL/SMT_Examples/SMT_Tests.thy like<br>\n\"Unsupported: trans*\" and many timeouts.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
