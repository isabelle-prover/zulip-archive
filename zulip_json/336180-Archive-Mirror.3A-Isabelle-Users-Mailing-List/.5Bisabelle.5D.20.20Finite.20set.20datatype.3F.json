The theory <br>\nis problably not yet extremely polished, but it is already<br>\nuseful for us. The theory is in </p>\n<p>~HOL/Quotient_Examples/FSet.thy</p>\n<p>(I am using the latest snapshot, but it also should be<br>\npart of the latest stable release).</p>\n<p>Below is a short theory which supplies all facts that are <br>\nneeded to make this type work with nominal. It might need<br>\na few adjustments if you work with \"old\" nominal.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nChristian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/9stTegDZwqAKuL90LY8_bHii/Nominal2_FSet.thy\">Nominal2_FSet.thy</a></p>",
