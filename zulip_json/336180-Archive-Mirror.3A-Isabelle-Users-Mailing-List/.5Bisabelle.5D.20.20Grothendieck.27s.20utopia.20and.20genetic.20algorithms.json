This is extremely hard to by hand.<br>\nNevertheless, if we consider a population of theorems (with their own<br>\nproofs) and we assume that Theorem X eats Theorem Y if Theorem Y can be<br>\nobtained from theorem X in a trivial way (sledgehammer [timeout = 2000])<br>\nthen, after a large battler, only the more general theorems will survive<br>\nand the theory will be a set of trivial consequences of these theorems.<br>\nThen the theory can be automatically reconstructed in such a way that the<br>\nproof of each theorem will be a trivial consequence of the set of more<br>\ngeneral theorems (maybe there will be some non-trivial interdependence<br>\namong the more general theorems). I think that such a process can be<br>\nimproved adding mutations and other features from genetic algorithms.</p>\n<p>I do not know if such a Grothendieckization of Isabelle will have some<br>\npractical advantage.</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,</p>\n<p>Jose M.</p>",
