I imagine such an Olympiad<br>\nas many high school students in a room, in front of their computers, trying<br>\nto mechanize the proof of a hard theorem from elementary mathematics that<br>\nis written on a blackboard, e.g., a theorem due to Erdos or Ramanujan. To<br>\nuse papers to write the arguments is forbidden: the proof should go from<br>\ntheir brain to Isabelle in a direct way. The first student who finishes the<br>\nproof win (this can be checked in an automatic).</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nJosé M.</p>",
