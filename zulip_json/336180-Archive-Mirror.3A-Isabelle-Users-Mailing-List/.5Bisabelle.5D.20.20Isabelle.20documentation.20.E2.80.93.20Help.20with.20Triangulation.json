Then, prove your<br>\ntheorem assuming that the lemmas are true. After that, repeat the same<br>\nprocess to each one of your lemmas.</p>\n<p>(5) Drink as much coffee as you medical doctor allows you. Sleep 20 minutes<br>\nafter drinking the coffee and before beginning to write in Isabelle. This<br>\nwill amplify your focus (there are scientific evidence of coffee naps):<br>\n<a href=\"https://blog.bulletproof.com/coffee-naps-bulletproof-power-nap/\">https://blog.bulletproof.com/coffee-naps-bulletproof-power-nap/</a></p>\n<p>(6) Do one activity at time (the human brain is not multitask). Do lo<br>\nlisten music while you are coding.</p>\n<p>Well, I hope that these advices will help people. Isabelle as easy learn as<br>\npossible, what is hard is mathematics itself, and of course, its formal<br>\nverification in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nJose M.</p>",
