I have two suggestions for<br>\nimprovements, and one item which could be worth thinking about:</p>\n<p>1) Sometimes I define inductive predicates using \"_\" instead of<br>\ninventing a bogus variable name. When writing an inductive proof, I<br>\nusually do the same thing:</p>\n<p>case (rec_comb Γ t css name Γ' cs u u' env _ rhs val)</p>\n<p>The \"proof outline\" however will invent a funny name, like \"uu\". Is it<br>\npossible to also print \"_\" here? In my opinion it's much nicer to<br>\nexplicitly state that a variable doesn't matter than to use a somehow<br>\nmodified internal name.</p>\n<p>2) Is it possible for the blue \"i\" icon in the gutter to disappear when<br>\na proof body already exists? As it stands it is easily mistaken for a<br>\nhint given by \"Auto Quickcheck\" or \"Auto Solve Direct\".</p>\n<p>3) I would assume that the mechanism is general enough to allow skeleton<br>\ngeneration for arbitrary initial methods. I'm mainly thinking about the<br>\n\"standard\" method here, but of course, this may also apply to others.</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nLars</p>",
