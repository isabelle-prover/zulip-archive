Each object is relatively simple.<br>\nThese objects were constructed by a computer program; now I want to prove<br>\nthat the result of the program is correct.<br>\nMy plan is</p>\n<p>1. to define 2 million objects.<br>\n  2. to prove properties of every object (that is I need 2 million lemmas).<br>\nEach lemma has &lt;=500 steps, each step is relatively simple. That is, I need<br>\napprox. 500*2mln = 1billion simple steps.<br>\nI'm going to generate the proofs for all that lemmas by another computer<br>\nprograms.</p>\n<p>Has anybody worked with specifications of this size?<br>\nIs it practical to conduct a proof of this size in Isabelle/HOL? If yes,<br>\ncan you recommend how to organize the proof? If no, can you suggest other<br>\nverification tools?</p>\n<p>My experiments show that it is impractical to define a set of 2 million<br>\nobjects in Isabelle/HOL (Isabelle allocates a lot of memory and the<br>\ncomputation time is large).<br>\nI found that many small-size definitions are easier to handle than one<br>\nlarge definition. E.g. I was able to define 20 000 sets a1,...,a20000<br>\ncontaining 100 elements and then define 200 sets b1,...,b200 (each being a<br>\nunion of 100 sets a_{100<em>i+1},...,a_{100</em>i+200}), and finally define a set<br>\nC as a union of b1,...,b200. But for aesthetic reasons I don't like it.<br>\nMoreover, given the speed of Isabelle, I'm not sure that proofs of 2<br>\nmillion lemmas can be conducted in a reasonable time (say, less than two<br>\nmonths).</p>\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n<p>Stanislav.</p>",
