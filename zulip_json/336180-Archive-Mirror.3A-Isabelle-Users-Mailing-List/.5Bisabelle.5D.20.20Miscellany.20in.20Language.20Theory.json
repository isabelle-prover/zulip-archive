After reading the tutorial \"Defining Recursive<br>\nFunctions in Isabelle/HOL\" I reformulated my definitions and I proved some<br>\nclassical theorems.</p>\n<p>For me it was a nice exercise in order to remember the theory of formal<br>\nlanguages. Nevertheless, I do not know if my results are already in some<br>\nlibrary in Isabelle/HOL. If this is the case, I would prefer to use the<br>\nlibrary. This constructive approach will allow me to do both computations<br>\nand proof in Isabelle. Before, I did the computations in SAGE.</p>\n<p>My algorithmic definition of Dyck paths:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/josephcmac/Folklore-and-miscellaneous-results-in-language-theory/blob/master/DyckPathsDef.thy\">https://github.com/josephcmac/Folklore-and-miscellaneous-results-in-language-theory/blob/master/DyckPathsDef.thy</a></p>\n<p>The classical results that I proved (exercises in any course of<br>\nintroduction to formal languages):<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/josephcmac/Folklore-and-miscellaneous-results-in-language-theory/blob/master/DyckPathsCharacterization1.thy\">https://github.com/josephcmac/Folklore-and-miscellaneous-results-in-language-theory/blob/master/DyckPathsCharacterization1.thy</a></p>\n<p>Thank you for the previous suggestions.
