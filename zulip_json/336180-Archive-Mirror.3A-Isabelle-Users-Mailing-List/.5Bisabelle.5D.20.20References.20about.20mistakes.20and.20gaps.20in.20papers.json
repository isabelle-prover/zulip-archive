The reviewer was interested in the fact that this mistake was found using a proof assistant (Isabelle). So, for the final version of this note I would like to include a list of papers whose gaps or mistakes where only discovered by means of a proof assistant. I will appreciate any reference. Thank you in advance.<br>\nJose M.</p>",
