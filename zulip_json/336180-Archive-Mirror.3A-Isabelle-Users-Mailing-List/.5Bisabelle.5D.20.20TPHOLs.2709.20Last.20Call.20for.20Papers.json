The conference will be held on 17 - 20 August<br>\n2009 in Munich. As in previous years, the formal proceedings of<br>\nTPHOLs will appear as a volume of LNCS.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission:              8 March 2009<br>\nAuthor notification:     4 May 2009<br>\nCamera-ready papers due: 5 June 2009</p>\n<p>Website for submissions<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tphols2009\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tphols2009</a></p>\n<p>Submission for the emerging<br>\ntrends section:          11 May 2009</p>\n<p>Conference:              17 - 20 August 2009</p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The program committee welcomes submissions on all aspects of theorem<br>\nproving in higher order logics, on related topics in theorem proving<br>\nand verification, and on relevant applications. The topics include, but<br>\nare not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p>Specification and verification of hardware: microprocessors, memory<br>\n  systems, buses, pipelines, etc; formal semantics of hardware design<br>\n  languages; synthesis; formal design flows.</p>\n<p>Specification and verification of software: program verification,<br>\n  refinement, and synthesis for functional, declarative and imperative<br>\n  languages; formal semantics of programming languages; compiler and<br>\n  operating system verification; proof carrying code.</p>\n<p>Industrial application of theorem provers.</p>\n<p>Formalization of mathematical theories.</p>\n<p>Advances in theorem prover technology: proof automation and decision<br>\n  procedures, induction, combination of deductive and algorithmic<br>\n  approaches, incorporation of theorem provers into larger systems,<br>\n  combination of theorem provers with other provers and tools.</p>\n<p>Other topics, including: user interfaces for theorem provers;  <br>\ndevelopment<br>\n  and extension of higher order logics.</p>\n<p>Proof Pearls: concise and elegant presentations of interesting  <br>\nexamples.</p>\n<p>Relevant research involving interactive first-order systems, such as  <br>\nACL2<br>\nand Mizar, is also welcome. All authors are reminded that their work<br>\nshould  be presented in a way that users of other systems can  <br>\nunderstand.</p>\n<p>Papers should be no more than 16 pages in length and are to be submitted<br>\nin PDF format. Submissions must describe original unpublished work not<br>\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere. They must conform to the LNCS style<br>\npreferably using LaTeX2e. The proceedings are to be published as a  <br>\nvolume<br>\nin the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series and will be available to<br>\nparticipants at the conference.</p>\n<p>Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their paper at the<br>\nconference.</p>\n<p>As has been custom in previous years there will be an emerging trends<br>\nsection. Submissions under this section will not be formally  <br>\nrefereed, but<br>\ntheir content and relevance will be reviewed. Those submissions accepted<br>\nwill be published in a technical report of the TU München, which will  <br>\nalso<br>\nbe available at the conference. Authors of accepted papers in this  <br>\nsection<br>\nare expected to present a brief outline of their work at the conference<br>\nand to prepare a poster for display at the conference venue.</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>David Basin      ETH Zurich<br>\nJohn Harrison    Intel<br>\nWolfram Schulte  Microsoft Research</p>\n<p>Programme Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thorsten Altenkirch        Nottingham University<br>\nDavid Aspinall             Edinburgh University<br>\nJeremy Avigad              Carnegie Mellon University<br>\nGilles Barthe              IMDEA<br>\nChristoph Benzmüller       Saarland University<br>\nPeter Dybjer               Chalmers University<br>\nJean-Christophe Filliâtre  CNRS<br>\nGeorges Gonthier           Microsoft Research<br>\nMike Gordon                Cambridge University<br>\nJim Grundy                 Intel<br>\nReiner Hähnle              Chalmers University<br>\nJoe Hurd                   Galois<br>\nGerwin Klein               NICTA<br>\nXavier Leroy               INRIA<br>\nPete Manolios              Northeastern University<br>\nCésar Muñoz                National Institute of Aerospace<br>\nTobias Nipkow (co-chair)   TU München<br>\nMichael Norrish            NICTA<br>\nSam Owre                   SRI International<br>\nLarry Paulson              Cambridge University<br>\nFrank Pfenning             Carnegie Mellon University<br>\nRandy Pollack              Edinburgh University<br>\nSofiène Tahar              Concordia University<br>\nLaurent Théry              INRIA<br>\nChristian Urban (co-chair) TU München<br>\nFreek Wiedijk              Radboud University Nijmegen</p>\n<p>Affiliated Events</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Workshop on Programming Languages for Mechanized Mathematics<br>\n   Systems (PLMMS)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Coq Users Meeting</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Isabelle Developers Workshop</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organizers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Stefan Berghofer<br>\nTobias Nipkow<br>\nChristian Urban<br>\nMakarius Wenzel</p>",
