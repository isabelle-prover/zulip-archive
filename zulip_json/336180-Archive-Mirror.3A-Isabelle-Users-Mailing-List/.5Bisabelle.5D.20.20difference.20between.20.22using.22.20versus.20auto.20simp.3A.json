If you use \"using\", then Isar will <br>\nadd the lemma to the context, but will fix the type<br>\nvariables in the theorem. That usually makes the<br>\nlemma useless. On the other hand, if you add the lemma <br>\nvia \"simp\" or \"auto simp\" then the lemma is under the <br>\ncontrol, so to say, of the automatic tool,  which will <br>\nfind the right type-instantiation of the lemma.  </p>\n<p>Because of Isabelle's limited type-language the problem<br>\nwith fixing type-variables cannot easily be circumvented, <br>\nif at all. I also stumbled over this problem recently.</p>\n<p>So the rule of thumb is, do not use \"using\" with<br>\nlemmas having polymorphic type. For consistency, <br>\n\"using\" should perhaps only be used with local facts, <br>\nnot with lemmas at all. But I am also guilty of violating <br>\nthis rule all the time.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nChristian</p>\n<p>Jeremy Siek writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've noticed that on a few occasions, referencing a lemma with<br>\na \"using\" followed by auto didn't work, whereas adding the<br>\nlemma to the simp set via \"auto simp:\" did work.<br>\nAre there some general rules of thumb regarding when to use<br>\nwhich?</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nJeremy</p>\n<p>-- </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Jeremy Siek &lt;<a href=\"mailto:jeremy.siek@colorado.edu\">jeremy.siek@colorado.edu</a>&gt;<br>\n<a href=\"http://ecee.colorado.edu/~siek/\">http://ecee.colorado.edu/~siek/</a><br>\nAssistant Professor<br>\nDept. of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering<br>\nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder</p>\n</blockquote>",
