Therefore inductive, <br>\ndatatype and other tools provide an \"*.inducts\" rule. This<br>\nrule is essentially the projection of the \"*.induct\" rule.<br>\n(So no need to state the rule using conjunctions.)  With this <br>\nthe induct method can more easily figure out which induction <br>\nto perform. There used to be an example theory in the Isabelle <br>\ndistribution which explains all bells and whistles of the <br>\ninduct-method, but I cannot find it at the moment. Maybe others <br>\ncan point to it. Below is a theory that should work in your example.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nChristian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/5IbQaJaushIq494xdCFVdcre/Ribbons.thy\">Ribbons.thy</a></p>",
