        "content": "<p>From: José Manuel Rodriguez Caballero &lt;<a href=\"mailto:josephcmac@gmail.com\">josephcmac@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>\nThank you for the complete proof of this identity, I will do reverse<br>\nengineering in order to express more non-trivial identities in the same<br>\nway. With respect to the statement:</p>\n<p>« Now, there is probably some connection between convergence these power<br>\nseries as analytic functions in the complex plane and the convergence, but<br>\nI am not sure about this and we don't have it in Isabelle yet anyway.<br>\nPerhaps you know more about this than I do. »</p>\n<p>I would like to sketch how a proof of this identity can be done in Isabelle<br>\nwhen a library about analytic functions in the complex plane will be ready.<br>\nSo, this example could be a good test of for that library.</p>\n<p>Ingredients of the library:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If individual terms of a uniformly converging series are continuous,<br>\nthen the the series is continuous in the same domaine:<br>\n<a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UniformConvergence.html\">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UniformConvergence.html</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Weierstrass M-Test: <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WeierstrassM-Test.html\">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WeierstrassM-Test.html</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Identity theorem (for analytic functions):<br>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theorem\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theorem</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Informal proof.</p>\n<p>Let f(z) := (1-z)(1+z)(1+z^2)(1+z^4)(1+z^8)(1+z^16)…(1+z^(2^n))…</p>\n<p>Substituting we have f(0) = 1.</p>\n<p>In virtue of Weierstrass M-test, f(z) is uniformly convergent on a<br>\nneighbourhood of the origine z = 0. So, f(z) is continuous on this<br>\nneighbourhood.</p>\n<p>Applying 1-z^2 = (1-z)(1+z), we obtain the functional equation</p>\n<p>f(z^2) = f(z),</p>\n<p>for any z in the domain of f(z). It follows by complete induction that, for<br>\nany positive integer n,</p>\n<p>f(z) = f(z^(2^n)),</p>\n<p>By continuity at z = 0, we have that</p>\n<p>f(z) = lim f(z) = lim f(z^(2^n)) = f(lim z^(2^n)) = f(0) = 1,</p>\n<p>provided that |z| &lt; 1. We can choose a sequence of such values of z<br>\nconverging to z = 0. In virtue of the above mentioned Identity Theorem, we<br>\nconclude that f(z) = 1 for any complex number z in the domain of definition<br>\nof f(z).<br>\nqed.</p>\n<p>This way of proving this identity, avoiding formal manipulations, is<br>\ntypical of XIX century, in particular of Lejeune Dirichlet and his student<br>\nBernhard Riemann, who were « lazy » enough to change computations for ideas.</p>\n<p>Jose M.</p>\n<p>Message: 5</p>",
