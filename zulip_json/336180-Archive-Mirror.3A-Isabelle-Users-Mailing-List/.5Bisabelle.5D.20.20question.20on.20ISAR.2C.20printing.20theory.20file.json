I have the following <br>\nquestions:</p>\n<p>1) The following is an extract from my theory file and partial output in <br>\nProofGeneral<br>\n (the lines in the script file have been prefixed by #):</p>\n<p>#case A</p>\n<p>goal (show, 1 subgoal)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A ==&gt; B --&gt; C</li>\n</ol>\n<p>#assume \"A\"<br>\n#assume \"B\"<br>\n#show \"U\"</p>\n<p>when I replace U with \"C\", \"B --&gt; C\" or \"B ==&gt; B --&gt; C\" an error is <br>\ngenerated. What should<br>\nthe form of U be in order to not generate an error?</p>\n<p>2) Suppose my theory file is mydoc.thy. Because I am using ProofGeneral<br>\nthe theory file is full of terms \\&lt;forall&gt; \\&lt;exists&gt; etc..</p>\n<p>Is there a simple way of generating a dvi/pdf file to obtain a printable<br>\nversion of my proof script with the proper symbols?</p>\n<p>Thanks for any help.</p>\n<p>Revantha Ramanayake.</p>",
