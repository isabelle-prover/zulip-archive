Are there any libraries<br>\nout there that have already laid the groundwork for \"arrow-oriented\" proofs?</p>\n<p>EXPLANATION/DETAIL:<br>\nIf it helps to make my scope clearer, let me list the books that I'm using:</p>\n<p>- Conceptual<br>\nMathematics&lt;<a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/logic-categories-and-sets/conceptual-mathematics-first-introduction-categories-2nd-edition\">http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/logic-categories-and-sets/conceptual-mathematics-first-introduction-categories-2nd-edition</a>&gt;<br>\nby<br>\n   Bill Lawvere and Stephen Schanuel</p>\n<p>- Algebra: Chapter<br>\n0&lt;<a href=\"http://www.math.fsu.edu/~aluffi/mainhtmls/pubs.html#Chapter0\">http://www.math.fsu.edu/~aluffi/mainhtmls/pubs.html#Chapter0</a>&gt; by<br>\n   Paolo Aluffi</p>\n<p>- Arrows, Structures, and Functors: The Categorical<br>\nImperative&lt;<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Arrows_structures_and_functors.html?id=2txQAAAAMAAJ\">http://books.google.com/books/about/Arrows_structures_and_functors.html?id=2txQAAAAMAAJ</a>&gt;<br>\nby<br>\n   Michael Arbib and Ernest Manes</p>\n<p>- Topoi: the Categorial Analysis of<br>\nLogic&lt;<a href=\"http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;idno=gold010\">http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;idno=gold010</a>&gt;<br>\nby<br>\n   Robert Goldblatt</p>\n<p>I'm aware of the two Category Theory AFP entries (Greg<br>\nO'Keefe's&lt;<a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Category.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Category.shtml</a>&gt;<br>\n and Alexander Katovsky's&lt;<a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Category2.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Category2.shtml</a>&gt;),<br>\nbut although I'm not _familiar_ with their details, they appear to go<br>\ndeeper into Category Theory than I need right now. At the very least, it's<br>\nnot yet clear to me what parts of their theories are \"general-purpose\".</p>\n<p>In the hopes of ensuring that my goals are clear, let me also provide some<br>\nrepresentative exercises that I'd like to solve using Isabelle/Isar.</p>\n<p>- Prove that for every function $f : A -&gt; B$ with $A$ non-empty, there<br>\n   exists a 'choice function' $g : B -&gt; A$ such that $f . g . f = f$. In<br>\n   axiomatic set theory this is an acceptable form of the 'axiom of choice'<br>\n<em>Arbib &amp; Manes, Exercise 1.1.2</em></p>\n<p>- A finite set $A$ has an even number of elements iff (i.e. if and only<br>\n   if) there is an involution on $A$ with <em>no fixed points</em>; $A$ has an odd<br>\n   number of elements iff there is an involution on $A$ with just <em>one</em> fixed<br>\n   point.<br>\n<em>Lawvere &amp; Schanuel, Exercise III.3</em></p>\n<p>- Prove that final [i.e., terminal] objects are unique up to isomorphism.<br>\n<em>Aluffi, Exercise I.5.3</em></p>\n<p>- The disjoint union is a coproduct in the the category of sets.<br>\n<em>Aluffi, Proposition I.5.6</em></p>\n<p>- Any map $p$ which is an equalizer of some pair of maps is itself a<br>\n   monomorphism<br>\n<em>Lawvere &amp; Schanuel, Exercise 27.6</em></p>\n<p>- Prove that a category with initial and terminal objects has 'zero<br>\n   maps' if and only if an initial object is isomorphic to a terminal object.<br>\n<em>Lawvere &amp; Schanuel, Exercise 26.2</em></p>\n<p>- [Prove that] every group is the group of isomorphisms of a groupoid.<br>\n   In particular, every group is the group of automorphisms of some object in<br>\n   some category.<br>\n<em>Aluffi, Exercise II.1.1</em></p>\n<p>It's not that I have no idea how to approach these; I'd just like to know<br>\nif I'm \"reinventing the wheel\".</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n--Josh Tilles</p>",
