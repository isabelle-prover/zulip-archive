Equally, much tool development needs doing before<br>\nlarge scale textbook mathematics is feasibly formalizable: large scale<br>\nlibraries, search, cooperative working (like a WIKI).  Much to do in<br>\nautomation, decision procedures, ...  Even syntax notations in<br>\nexisting tools are inadequate for really large scale formalization.<br>\nFoundations: as Larry said, HOL <em>suffices</em> to formalize immense chunks<br>\nof mathematics, but that doesn't mean that it is the right choice.<br>\nHOL (as we know it) could use more polymorphism.  HOL suffices, but is<br>\nnot convenient, when you want to do induction over the height of<br>\nderivations of some inductively defined relation.  Modularity in HOL<br>\nis (at best) second class.  Binding: nominal Isabelle is a great tool,<br>\nbut I wouldn't say that formalization of binding is a done deal.  And<br>\nso forth.  Many of these suggestions offer possibilities for<br>\ncollaboration, such as Flyspeck.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nRandy<br>\n--<br>\nLawrence Paulson writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think it depends on whether you adopt the proposal in its extreme  <br>\nform or in a limited form.
