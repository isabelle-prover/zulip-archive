This can make the larger theorem being<br>\nworked on unprovable.</p>\n<p>For example, consider the following snippet:</p>\n<p>(* Silly lemma to generate a flex-flex pair. *)<br>\n    schematic_lemma \"!!x y a b. (1 = 1) &amp; f ((x = y) = (a = b)) = ?P x y a b\"<br>\n      apply (subst (1 3) eq_commute)<br>\n      apply (rule conjI)<br>\n       (* Two subgoals exist; only the second involves schematics. *)<br>\n       apply blast</p>\n<p>In Isabelle2013 the \"apply blast\" would leave the flex-flex constraints<br>\nunchanged. In Isabelle2013-1 and Isabelle2013-2, the constraint<br>\ndisappears. In more complex proofs, this can make finishing the proof<br>\nimpossible.</p>\n<p>Is this behaviour of Isabelle2013-1/2 expected, or is it a regression?</p>\n<p>(I don't have a good grasp on the finer points of higher order<br>\nunification and flex-flex constraints, so please forgive me if I am<br>\nusing incorrect terminology.)</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nDavid</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
