It seems like I need Main (instead of Pure) to use them. Is<br>\nthat true? In the positive case, what can I do to use this features<br>\nwithout using Main. The problem is that I use Sequents.thy which is<br>\nproblematics to mix with Main.</p>",

If you have set up your logic correctly--and I admit that we  <br>\ndon't provide much documentation for people who set up new logics-- <br>\nthen the entire Isar proof language should be available to you.  <br>\nHowever, tactics like \"blast\", \"simp\" and \"auto\" rely upon specific  <br>\ninference rules being present in your logic. They need to be set up  <br>\nseparately for each logic. I'd be surprised if \"blast\" or \"auto\" can  <br>\nbe got working at all on top of a sequent-based logic, although a  <br>\nvery crude blast-like tactic is available.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
