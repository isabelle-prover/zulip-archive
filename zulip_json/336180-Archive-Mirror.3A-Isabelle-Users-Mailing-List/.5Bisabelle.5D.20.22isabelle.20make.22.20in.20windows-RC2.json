This problem is known for a long time, and <br>\nwill only be solved when the \"make\" tool is discontinued. In the past, it <br>\nwas not so critical, because real Unix users never have spaces in their <br>\ndirectory names.  Now we support Mac OS X and Windows fully, so this needs <br>\nmore attention.</p>\n<p>You have various possibilities for workarounds right now:</p>\n<p>* Ensure that $ISABELLE_HOME does not contain spaces, by moving the<br>\n     Isabelle distribution to a different place.</p>\n<p>* Try hard to use only relative directory names in the IsaMakefile;<br>\n     this might work for user projects, but not for the Isabelle<br>\n     distribution itself.</p>\n<p>* Produce a build script manually, without make.  Plain \"isabelle<br>\n     usedir\" with suitable options will do the job -- this odd dependency<br>\n     management is not really required for small sessions anyway.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

Otherwise, you will just be off-loading  the use of make to users and the build system will be less useful.  If you are worried about different versions of make behaving differently, can't you just package make yourself (just as you do Java etc)?</p>\n<p>Michael</p>",
