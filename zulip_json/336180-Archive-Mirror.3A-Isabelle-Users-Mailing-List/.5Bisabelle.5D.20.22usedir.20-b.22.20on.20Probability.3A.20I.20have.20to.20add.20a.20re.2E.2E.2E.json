There's no real <br>\nproblem here.</p>\n<p>However, I'll make a request here, and give some details below.</p>\n<p>It would be nice if \"~~/src/HOL/Probability/Borel_Space.thy\" had the import<br>\n     \"~~/src/HOL/Multivariate_Analysis/Multivariate_Analysis\",<br>\ninstead of simply \"Multivariate_Analysis\".</p>\n<p>There's no problem for me, it's that if I tell someone to build <br>\nProbability using \"usedir -b\" and its ROOT.ML, then I also have to tell <br>\nthem to edit Borel_Space.thy, and it seems bad principle to tell someone <br>\nto edit a distribution file in the installation folder.</p>\n<p>I suppose there's a way to create an IsaMakeFile to specify the <br>\ndependencies, but I don't know how to do that yet, it's probably more <br>\ncomplicated, 9 out 10 other sessions I built with \"usedir -b\" don't <br>\nreturn errors, and there are other files in HOL/Probability that import <br>\nfiles from Multivariate_Analysis using a relative path.</p>\n<p>Anyway, here's what led to this request.</p>\n<p>I wanted to look at <br>\nHOL/Multivariate_Analysis/Topology_Euclidean_Space.thy, which is about <br>\n5800 lines. It brought jEdit and i3p to their speedwise knees; both <br>\nbecame unresponsive, and I have an Intel i3 with 8Gbytes of ram.</p>\n<p>Being in the infantile stages, I thought about abandoning Isabelle, then <br>\nI thought about buying an i7 notebook, and then I built the heap for <br>\nMultivariate_Analysis and used it as my logic, which solved my need for <br>\npractical speed.</p>\n<p>In fact, in jEdit, I can now load two big files from <br>\nMultivariate_Analysis, and it'll work on proving both files in its spare <br>\ntime without becoming unresponsive.</p>\n<p>One thing leads to another.</p>\n<p>I made a ROOT.ML composed of the ROOT.MLs from Library, <br>\nOld_Number_Theory, Algebra, Lattice, Matrix, Multivariate_Analysis, NSA, <br>\nNumber_Theory, Probability, and ZF.</p>\n<p>My ROOT.ML gets one error in the build using the command,<br>\n     isabelle usedir -b HOL HOL_LibOntAlgLatMatMvNsaNtPrbZf.</p>\n<p>To get it to build, I have to edit Borel_Space.thy as explained above.</p>\n<p>Below, I've included the contents of my ROOT.ML.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nJames</p>\n<p>(* From ~~/src/HOL/Library/ROOT.ML *)<br>\nuse_thys [<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Library/Library\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Library/List_Cset\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Library/List_Prefix\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Library/List_lexord\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Library/Sublist_Order\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Library/Product_Lattice\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Library/Code_Char_chr\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Library/Code_Char_ord\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Library/Code_Integer\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Library/Efficient_Nat\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Library/Executable_Set\"(<em>, \"Code_Prolog\"</em>)<br>\n];</p>\n<p>(* From ~~/src/HOL/Old_Number_Theory/ROOT.ML *)<br>\nuse_thys [<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Old_Number_Theory/Fib\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Old_Number_Theory/Factorization\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Old_Number_Theory/Chinese\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Old_Number_Theory/WilsonRuss\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Old_Number_Theory/WilsonBij\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Old_Number_Theory/Quadratic_Reciprocity\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Old_Number_Theory/Primes\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Old_Number_Theory/Pocklington\"<br>\n];</p>\n<p>(* From ~~/src/HOL/Algebra/ROOT.ML *)<br>\nuse_thys [<br>\n   (<strong>* New development, based on explicit structures </strong>*)<br>\n   (* Groups *)<br>\n     \"~~/src/HOL/Algebra/FiniteProduct\",      (* Product operator for <br>\ncommutative groups *)<br>\n     \"~~/src/HOL/Algebra/Sylow\",              (* Sylow's theorem *)<br>\n     \"~~/src/HOL/Algebra/Bij\",                (* Automorphism Groups *)<br>\n   (* Rings *)<br>\n     \"~~/src/HOL/Algebra/Divisibility\",       (* Rings *)<br>\n     \"~~/src/HOL/Algebra/IntRing\",            (* Ideals and residue <br>\nclasses *)<br>\n     \"~~/src/HOL/Algebra/UnivPoly\",            (* Polynomials *)<br>\n   (<strong>* Old development, based on axiomatic type classes </strong>*)<br>\n     \"~~/src/HOL/Algebra/abstract/Abstract\",  (<em>The ring theory</em>)<br>\n     \"~~/src/HOL/Algebra/poly/Polynomial\"     (<em>The full theory</em>)<br>\n];</p>\n<p>(* From ~~/src/HOL/Lattice/ROOT.ML *)<br>\nuse_thys [<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Lattice/CompleteLattice\"<br>\n  ];</p>\n<p>(* From ~~/src/HOL/Matrix/ROOT.ML *)<br>\nuse_thys [<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Matrix/Cplex\"<br>\n  ];</p>\n<p>(* From ~~/src/HOL/Multivariate_Analysis/ROOT.ML *)<br>\nuse_thys [<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Multivariate_Analysis/Multivariate_Analysis\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Multivariate_Analysis/Determinants\"<br>\n];</p>\n<p>(* From ~~/src/HOL/NSA/ROOT.ML *)<br>\nuse_thys [<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/NSA/Hypercomplex\"<br>\n];</p>\n<p>(* From ~~/src/HOL/Number_Theory/ROOT.ML *)<br>\nuse_thys [<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Number_Theory/Number_Theory\"<br>\n];</p>\n<p>(* From ~~/src/HOL/Probability/ROOT.ML *)<br>\nuse_thys [<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/Probability/Probability\"<br>\n];</p>\n<p>(* From ~~/src/HOL/ZF/ROOT.ML *)<br>\nuse_thys [<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/ZF/MainZF\",<br>\n   \"~~/src/HOL/ZF/Games\"<br>\n];</p>",

If you can't know something's true, at least you can know sometimes that it's not true. Who wants to spend their life trying to prove something true when it's not true? And, I suppose, false, when it's not false. It's nice to know when it's useless to try and work out the details, because there are no details that can ever be worked out.</p>\n<p>--James</p>",
