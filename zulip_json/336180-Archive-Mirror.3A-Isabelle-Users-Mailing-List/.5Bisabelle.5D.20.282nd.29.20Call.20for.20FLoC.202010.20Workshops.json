ITP 2010<br>\nwill also be part of the FLoC combination of conferences and<br>\nworkshops, to be held in Edinburgh in July 2010.</p>\n<p>FLoC has now issued a call for workshops (as attached) and importantly:</p>\n<p>Each workshop proposal must indicate one sponsoring conference among<br>\n    the participating conferences.</p>\n<p>Submissions will be handled via Easychair</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc10cfw\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc10cfw</a></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------</p>\n<p>NOTE ALSO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The term \"workshop\" should not be construed narrowly: feel free to<br>\n   propose tutorials, tool demonstrations, competitions, survey talks,<br>\n   etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FLoC do not want to handle workshops that do not run for<br>\n   non-integral numbers of days.  However, ITP will try to combine<br>\n   half-day applications to make things fit into whole numbers.  So, if<br>\n   you feel you only want half a day, let me know, and apply anyway.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am happy to discuss possible workshop applications in advance if<br>\nthere is anything that is unclear.</p>\n<p>Michael.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/IgjKyFe6Pg-WP373yn3l8Hcy/FLoC10.CFW.txt\">FLoC10.CFW.txt</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/9356WEUl5TANo4luozniX5xd/FLoC10.CFW.html\">FLoC10.CFW.html</a></p>",
