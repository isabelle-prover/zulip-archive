There are hardly any interesting <br>\nchanges from Isabelle2012-RC2 to official Isabelle2012.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From RC1 to RC2 quite a few things were going on for Windows in <br>\nparticular.  You were one of the few people giving any feedback on the <br>\nrelease candidates, and I turned your experience report into some changes <br>\nthat might be relevant here.  Before the release I was assuming that you <br>\nwould follow further RC steps, and interpreted no news as good news.  So <br>\nmaybe we should finish that now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are two things between Isabelle2012-RC1 and Isabelle2012-RC2 that <br>\nlook relevant to your observation.</p>\n<p>(1) The Windows installer (7zip with some init.bat) does a \"rebaseall\"<br>\n       on all executables.  This is meant to prevent Cygwin exe crashes as<br>\n       you have seen, but it might have an adverse effect as well.</p>\n<p>To get a version of Isabelle2012 that is not \"rebased\" automatically<br>\n       you can use the Cygwin-Terminal of a version you have already<br>\n       and download and unpack the following:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2012_bundle_x86-cygwin.tar.gz\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2012_bundle_x86-cygwin.tar.gz</a></p>\n<p>It is important to use Cygwin/GNU tar to unpack it into a place<br>\n       where you will later find it without Cygwin.  Then you <em>exit</em> the<br>\n       auxiliary Cygwin-Terminal and start the newly unpacked<br>\n       Isabelle2012/Isabelle.exe or its Cygwin-Terminal from there.</p>\n<p>(2) Some accident with perl signals and the poly process.  It was<br>\n       motivated by your initial encounter with Isabelle2012-RC1 where the<br>\n       antivirus had deleted the executable, but the error was quite<br>\n       implicit.  I had \"fixed\" that in a way that was causing problems in<br>\n       other cases later, and maybe even your IsaMakefile now.</p>\n<p>The following change from the post-Isabelle2012 period could<br>\n       improve the situation again:</p>\n<p>--- a/lib/scripts/run-polyml    Wed Jan 19 21:00:16 2011 +0100<br>\n+++ b/lib/scripts/run-polyml    Fri May 25 17:14:14 2012 +0200<br>\n@@ -74,7 +74,7 @@<br>\n  fi</p>\n<p>\"$ISABELLE_HOME/lib/scripts/feeder\" -p -h \"$MLTEXT\" -t \"$MLEXIT\" $FEEDER_OPTS | \\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>{ read FPID; \"$POLY\" -q $ML_OPTIONS; RC=\"$?\"; kill -HUP \"$FPID\"; exit \"$RC\"; }</li>\n<li>{ read FPID; \"$POLY\" -q $ML_OPTIONS; RC=\"$?\"; kill -TERM \"$FPID\"; exit \"$RC\"; }<br>\n  RC=\"$?\"<p>Which means it is just \"kill -TERM\" instead of \"kill -HUP\" in the<br>\n     feeder script that is wrapped around poly.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
