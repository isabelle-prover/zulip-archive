One use<br>\nof comments in inner code is to comment out parts of a formula, e.g.<br>\n\"foo &lt;--&gt; (* A /\\ *) B /\\ C\". I believe that ⌦‹...› is the right<br>\nreplacement here. However, when using the latter, only the ⌦ symbol is<br>\nhighlighted in Isabelle/jEdit, making it hard to read the formula. In<br>\ncontrast, with (* ... *) comments, the whole comment is highlighted in<br>\nred.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to highlight the whole ⌦‹...› comment in Isabelle/jEdit?</p>\n<p>The same remark applies to ― ‹...› (though one could argue that putting<br>\ncomments in the middle of a line is bad style).</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Bertram</p>",
