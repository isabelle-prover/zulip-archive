Coalgebra is developing into a<br>\nfield of its own interest presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a<br>\ngrowing field of applications and interactions with various other<br>\nfields such as reactive and interactive system theory, object oriented<br>\nand concurrent programming, formal system specification, modal logic,<br>\ndynamical systems, control systems, category theory, algebra,<br>\nanalysis, etc. The aim of the workshop is to bring together<br>\nresearchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its<br>\napplications.</p>\n<p>The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and<br>\n      categorical approaches);<br>\n      coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for<br>\n      programming languages, dynamical systems, etc.);<br>\n      coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;<br>\n      coalgebras and data types;<br>\n      (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras<br>\n      (with bisimulations or invariants);<br>\n      coalgebras and algebras;<br>\n      coalgebraic specification and verification;<br>\n      coalgebras and (modal) logic;<br>\n      coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and<br>\nhybrid systems).</p>\n<p>The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing<br>\nwork, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.</p>\n<p>Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,<br>\nAmsterdam, Berlin, Genova, Grenoble, Warsaw and Barcelona. The<br>\nproceedings appeared as Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer<br>\nScience (ENTCS) Volumes 11,19, 33, 41, 65.1, 82.1 and 106. You can get<br>\nan idea of the types of papers presented at the meeting by looking at<br>\nthe tables of contents of the ENTCS volumes from those workshops ENTCS</p>\n<p>Location</p>\n<p>CMCS 2006 will be held in Vienna on March 25-27, 2006. It will be a<br>\nsatellite workshop of ETAPS 2006, the European Joint Conferences on<br>\nTheory and Practice of Software.</p>\n<p>Programme Committee</p>\n<p>John Power (chair,Edinburgh), Luis Barbosa (Minho), Neil Ghani<br>\n(Nottingham), H. Peter Gumm (Marburg), Marina Lenisa (Udine), Stefan<br>\nMilius (Braunschweig), Larry Moss (Bloomington), Jan Rutten<br>\n(Amsterdam), Hendrik Tews (Dresden), Tarmo Uustalu (Tallinn), Hiroshi<br>\nWatanabe (Osaka).</p>\n<p>Keynote Speaker:       Peter O'Hearn (Queen Mary, University of London)</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers:      Corina Cirstea (University of Southampton)<br>\n                       Alexander Kurz (University of Leicester)</p>\n<p>Submissions</p>\n<p>Two sorts of submissions will be possible this year:</p>\n<p>Papers to be evaluated by the programme committee for inclusion in the<br>\nENTCS proceedings:</p>\n<p>These papers must be written using ENTCS style files and be of length<br>\nno greater than 20 pages. They must contain original contributions, be<br>\nclearly written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison<br>\nwith related work. If a submission describes software, software tools,<br>\nor their use, it should include all source code that is needed to<br>\nreproduce the results but is not publicly available. If the additional<br>\nmaterial exceeds 5 MB, URL's of publicly available sites should be<br>\nprovided in the paper.</p>\n<p>Short contributions:</p>\n<p>These will not be published but will be compiled into a technical<br>\nreport of the University of Nottingham. They should be no more than<br>\ntwo pages and may describe work in progress, summarise work submitted<br>\nto a conference or workshop elsewhere, or in some other way appeal to<br>\nthe CMCS audience.</p>\n<p>Both sorts of submission should be submitted in postscript or pdf form<br>\nas attachments to an email to <a href=\"mailto:cmcs06@cs.nott.ac.uk\">cmcs06@cs.nott.ac.uk</a>.  The email should<br>\ninclude the title, corresponding author, and, for the first kind of<br>\nsubmission, a text-only one-page abstract.</p>\n<p>After the workshop, we expect to produce a journal proceedings of<br>\nextended versions of selected papers to appear in Theoretical Computer<br>\nScience.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>Deadline for submission of regular papers:     January 8, 2006.<br>\n Notification of acceptance of regular papers:  February 6, 2006.<br>\n Final version for the preliminary proceedings: February 13, 2006.</p>\n<p>Deadline for submission of short contributions:      February 28, 2006.<br>\n Notification of acceptance of short contributions:   March 6, 2006.</p>\n<p>For more information, please write to <a href=\"mailto:cmcs06@cs.nott.ac.uk\">cmcs06@cs.nott.ac.uk</a>.</p>",
