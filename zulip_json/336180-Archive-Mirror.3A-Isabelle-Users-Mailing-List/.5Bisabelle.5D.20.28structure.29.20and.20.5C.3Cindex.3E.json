        "content": "<p>From: Clemens Ballarin &lt;<a href=\"mailto:ballarin@in.tum.de\">ballarin@in.tum.de</a>&gt;<br>\nHi Benedikt,</p>\n<p>The structure mechanism was designed for use with algebraic structures represented by record types.  It has come out of fashion because records make it hard to compose structures from other structures.  For example, the construction of ring from additive and multiplicative monoid in HOL-Algebra is painful: the set of theorems for the additive monoid is duplicated manually.</p>\n<p>The structure mechanism works as follows: an operation of a structure, such as multiplication in a group G, takes the structure record as an argument: mult G x y.  The \\&lt;index&gt; token marks parameters implicit.  In the context of a locale the structure parameter is inserted for the \\&lt;index&gt; parameter of the operation (if it is omitted).  That is, in locale group with parameter G (structure), mult x y is expanded to mult G x y.  This allows for concise syntax.</p>\n<p>At the time, the structure mechanism also provided a convenient means for adding derived operations to structures.  In the meantime, definitions in locale contexts have become available, making an approach without records (and structure parameters) feasible.  For examples, see my recent paper on the semantics of locales [1] and a study on formalising groups and rings [2].  Either approach may be suitable.  If you end up having algebraic structures with many parameters, records may be of advantage.  Otherwise, the additional flexibility gained by avoiding records is a plus.</p>\n<p>Clemens</p>\n<p>[1] Clemens Ballarin. Locales: a module system for mathematical theories.
