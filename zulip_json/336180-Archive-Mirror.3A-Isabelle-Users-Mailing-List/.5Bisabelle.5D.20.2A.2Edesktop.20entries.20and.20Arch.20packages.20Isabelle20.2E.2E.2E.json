While Gentoo supports slotting (i.e. multiple<br>\nversions installed at once), only a few packages are slotted, and also<br>\nthe slots might be too wide for certain uses (e.g. jdks are slotted by<br>\n5,6,7,... and not by minor version). Furthermore, depending on the<br>\npackage, consumers might not work with multiple versions of a dependency<br>\ninstalled (cf slotting boost).</p>\n<p>The same holds for configurations: A too restricted dependency (most<br>\nnotable: needing to have a feature disabled) will quickly result in trouble.</p>\n<p>So while Gentoo supports all those thing in theory, it would probably<br>\nnot work out in practice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>René<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ilYtNdZLIAYMMdQP17k1WB73/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></li>\n</ul>",

(This is out of necessity since no Linux version is really <br>\nstable these days.)</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the Coq guys are presently discussing similar packaging <br>\nquestions on the Coq-club thread \"Package managing\", e.g. see <br>\n<a href=\"https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/coq-club/2013-10/msg00096.html\">https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/coq-club/2013-10/msg00096.html</a> -- the <br>\nidea seems to be to delegate to OCaml package management (and thus become <br>\nsubject to a particular INRIA-centric programming language world).</p>\n<p>For Isabelle2013 and Isabelle2013-1-RC1 this privatized package management <br>\nis done in the weakest-possible sense: Isabelle \"components\" are bundled <br>\nwith the one big application that you get from the Isabelle website. <br>\nThere are no variants nor dependencies just one piece to be shipped, which <br>\nhappens to be composed from a selection of parts according to the <br>\nspecification in etc/components.</p>\n<p>This tends to require a bit more disk space than necessary, but even just <br>\none HOL image is already quite substantial compared to basic things like <br>\nPoly/ML or ATPs for Sledgehammer.  Of course, JDK dwarfs everything else<br>\nand is as usual a problem on its own.</p>\n<p>Using Isabelle professionally over some time, several GBs of disk space <br>\ncan be easily filled with further heap images for the Isabelle <br>\ndistribution, AFP, or other projects.  This outperforms even JDK, despite <br>\nrecent attempts of Oracle to inflate it again.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
