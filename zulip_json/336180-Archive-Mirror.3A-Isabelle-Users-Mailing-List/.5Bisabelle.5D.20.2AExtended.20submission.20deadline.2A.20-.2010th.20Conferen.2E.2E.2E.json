Separate  communities  have  developed  to<br>\ninvestigate  and build  computer based  systems for  computer algebra,<br>\nautomated deduction, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user<br>\ninterfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their<br>\nintegration  can   lead  to   synergies  offering   significant  added<br>\nvalue.  The  Conference  on Intelligent  Computer  Mathematics  (CICM)<br>\noffers a  venue for discussing  and developing solutions to  the great<br>\nchallenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.</p>\n<p>CICM has been held annually as a joint meeting since 2008, co-locating<br>\nrelated   conferences  and   workshops  to   advance  work   in  these<br>\nsubjects. Previous  meetings have been  held in Birmingham  (UK 2008),<br>\nGrand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France 2010), Bertinoro (Italy 2011),<br>\nBremen (Germany  2012), Bath (UK  2013), Coimbra (Portugal  2014), <br>\nWashington DC (USA 2015) and Bialystok (Poland 2016).</p>\n<p>This  is a  call for  papers  for CICM  2017,  which will  be held  in<br>\nEdinburgh, Scotland, July 17-21, 2017. CICM 2017 also invites work-in-<br>\nprogress papers.</p>\n<p>The principal tracks of the conference will be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Track: Calculemus (chair: Matthew England)<br>\n  All topics in the intersection of computer algebra systems and<br>\n  automated reasoning systems including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automated theorem proving in computer algebra systems.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Computer algebra and symbolic computation in theorem proving<br>\n  systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for<br>\n  computer mathematics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies and applications that involve a mix of computation<br>\n  and reasoning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies in formalization of mathematical theories that include<br>\n  non-trivial computations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Representation of mathematics in computer algebra systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint<br>\n  languages, and modeling languages for mathematical assistant systems.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track: Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML) (chair: Olaf Teschke)<br>\n  All topics related to the  formation of a Global Digital Mathematics<br>\n  Library (GDML) network, ranging from experiences from existing DMLs,<br>\n  policies and standards facilitating interoperability, to development<br>\n  and   integration   of   new  techniques   for   content   creation,<br>\n  preservation, enhancement and retrieval of the corpus, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>DML creation and maintenance (content aggregation, validation,<br>\n  curation, enhancement).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DML architecture and representations (organization, workflows,<br>\n  policies, standards).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DML access and applications (retrieval, interfaces, interoperability).</p>\n</li>\n<li>DML collections and systems (experiences from various existing DMLs).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track: Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM) (chair: Florian Rabe)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Knowledge representation using, e.g., formal logics, computational<br>\n  systems, narrative document formats, or databases</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Solutions to create, store, disseminate, discover, or manipulate<br>\n  mathematical knowledge</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Corpora of knowledge inlcuding documents, theories, theorems, proofs,<br>\n  models, algorithms, exercises, or examples</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Methods, systems, frameworks, case studies, challenges, benchmarks,<br>\n  or applications for mathematical knowledge</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Comparisons, evaluations, or integrations of MKM solutions</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track: Systems &amp; Projects (chair: Osman Hasan)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Systems: Stand-alone; plugins, libraries, or extensions of<br>\n  existing systems; or integrations of existing systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data: Formalizations; harvests or new processing of existing data;<br>\n  or case studies, test cases, or benchmark suites for systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Projects: finished, ongoing or new</p>\n</li>\n<li>Survey papers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track: Doctoral Programme (chair: TBD)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The overall programme is organized by the General Program Chair Herman<br>\nGeuvers.
