But <br>\nas Larry told, it is everything in the JCS paper (page 19). Other <br>\ninteresting reading is Giampaolo's thesis.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is that you first get rid of the existential <br>\nquantification applying the introduction rules (this is basic theorem <br>\nproving strategy). This leaves you with two sub-goals.</p>\n<p>The second you eliminate directly, because it is the empty trace. Just <br>\ngive the inductive definition to the empty trace and voil√†. To the other <br>\nsub-goal, as the name of the lemma proposes it is the possibility, so <br>\nyou should give then the path to reach this possible state.</p>\n<p>The 6 sub-goals produced, are basically the path construction to reach <br>\nthe state in the lemma. The you just apply the possibility, it will lead <br>\nyou to the proof by Isabelle's reasoner.</p>\n<p>Jean</p>\n<p>Lawrence Paulson escreveu:</p>",
