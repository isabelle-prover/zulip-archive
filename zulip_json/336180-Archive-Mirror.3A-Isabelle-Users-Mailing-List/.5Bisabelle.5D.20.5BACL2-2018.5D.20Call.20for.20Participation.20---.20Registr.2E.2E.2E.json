ACL2 is an industrial-strength<br>\nautomated reasoning system, the latest in the Boyer-Moore family of<br>\ntheorem provers.  The 2005 ACM Software System Award was awarded to<br>\nBoyer, Kaufmann, and Moore for their work in ACL2 and the other<br>\ntheorem provers in the Boyer-Moore family.</p>\n<p>ACL2-2018 is a two-day workshop to be held in Austin, Texas, USA, on<br>\nNovember 5-6, 2018.  It is the 15th in the series of ACL2 workshops,<br>\nwhich occur approximately every 18 months.  The workshop will feature<br>\ntechnical papers, keynote talks, and rump sessions discussing ongoing<br>\nresearch.</p>\n<p>See the website</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html\">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html</a> &lt;<a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html\">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>for further information including registration, organization, venue,<br>\nsponsors, and a list of accepted papers.</p>\n<p>Please see the following link<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html#lodging\">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html#lodging</a> &lt;<a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html#lodging\">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html#lodging</a>&gt;<br>\nfor information about lodging options near the workshop venue.</p>",
