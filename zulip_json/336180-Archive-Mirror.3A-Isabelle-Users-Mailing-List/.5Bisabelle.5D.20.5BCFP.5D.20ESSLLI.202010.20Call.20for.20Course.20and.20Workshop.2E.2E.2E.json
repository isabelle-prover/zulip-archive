The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface <br>\nbetween linguistics, logic and computation. ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and advanced courses, as well as workshops, <br>\ncovering a wide variety of topics within the three areas of interest: Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic and <br>\nComputation. Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to 500 students from Europe and elsewhere. The <br>\nschool has developed into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested in the <br>\ninterdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information. <br>\nFor more information, visit the FoLLI website, as well as ESSLLI2009 website: <a href=\"http://esslli2009.labri.fr/\">http://esslli2009.labri.fr/</a>. </p>\n<p>The ESSLLI 2010 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational, introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the <br>\n22nd annual Summer School on important topics of active research in the broad interdisciplinary area connecting logic, linguistics, <br>\ncomputer science, and the cognitive sciences, structured within the 3 traditional ESSLLI streams:</p>\n<p>-Language and Computation <br>\n-Language and Logic <br>\n-Logic and Computation <br>\nWe also welcome proposals that do not exactly fit one of these categories. </p>\n<p>PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: All proposals should be submitted, using a prescribed form that will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010 <br>\nwebsite <a href=\"http://www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010\">www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010</a>, through EasyChair on <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2010\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2010</a>, not later than</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong><strong> Monday, September 7, 2009 </strong><strong>*</strong> </p>\n<p>Proposers must hold PhD or equivalent degrees and should follow the guidelines below while preparing their submissions; proposals that <br>\ndo not conform with these guidelines may not be considered. </p>\n<p>GUIDELINES FOR COURSE AND WORKSHOP PROPOSALS: </p>\n<p>ALL COURSES: Courses are given over one week (Monday-Friday) and consist of five 90 minutes sessions, one per day. Course <br>\nproposals should give a brief overview of the topic and a tentative content and structure of the course, as well as state the courses <br>\nobjectives and clearly specify prerequisites, if any. Lecturers who want to offer a long, two-week course, should submit two independent <br>\none-week courses (for example an introductory course in the first week of ESSLLI, and a more advanced course during the second). The <br>\nESSLLI program committee has the right to select only one of the two proposed courses. </p>\n<p>TIMETABLE FOR COURSE PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:</p>\n<p>Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline</p>\n<p>Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline</p>\n<p>Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course material by the ESSLLI2010 local organizers </p>\n<p>FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: These are strictly elementary courses not assuming any background knowledge. They are intended for <br>\npeople who wish to get acquainted with the problems and techniques of areas new to them. Ideally, they should allow researchers from <br>\nother fields to acquire the key competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary <br>\nresearch community. Foundational courses should require no special prerequisites, but may presuppose some experience with scientific <br>\nmethods and general appreciation of the field of the course. </p>\n<p>INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to the activities of the Summer School. They are intended to provide an <br>\nintroduction to the (interdisciplinary) field for students, young researchers, and other non-specialists, and to equip them with a good <br>\nunderstanding of the course field's basic methods and techniques. Such courses should enable experienced researchers from other fields <br>\nto acquire the key competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary research <br>\ncommunity. Introductory courses in, for instance, Language and Computation, can build on some knowledge of the component fields; e.g., <br>\nan introductory course in computational linguistics should address an audience which is familiar with the basics of linguistics and <br>\ncomputation. Proposals for introductory courses should indicate the level of the course as compared to standard texts in the area (if any). </p>\n<p>ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of advanced Masters or PhD students. Proposals for <br>\nadvanced courses should specify the prerequisites in detail. </p>\n<p>WORKSHOPS: Workshops run over one week and consist of five 90-minutes sessions, one per day. The aim of the workshops is to <br>\nprovide a forum for advanced Ph.D. students and other researchers to present and discuss their work. Workshops should have a well <br>\ndefined theme, and workshop organizers should be specialists in the theme of the workshop. The proposals for workshops should justify <br>\nthe choice of topic, give an estimate of the number of attendants and expected submissions, and provide a list of at least 15 potential <br>\nsubmitters working in the field of the workshop. The organizers are required to give a general introduction to the theme during the first <br>\nsession of the workshop. They are also responsible for the organization and program of the workshop including inviting the submission of <br>\npapers, reviewing, expenses of invited speakers, etc. In particular, each workshop organizer will be responsible for sending out a Call for <br>\nPapers for the workshop and to organize the selection of the submissions by the deadlines specified below. The call for workshop <br>\nsubmissions must make it clear that the workshop is open to all members of the ESSLLI community and should indicate that all workshop <br>\ncontributors must register for the Summer School. </p>\n<p>TIMETABLE FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS:</p>\n<p>Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline</p>\n<p>Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline</p>\n<p>Nov 02, 2009: Deadline for submission of the Calls for Papers to ESSLLI2010 PC chair</p>\n<p>Nov 09, 2009: Workshop organizers send out First Call for Papers</p>\n<p>Jan 25, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Second Call for Papers</p>\n<p>Mar 08, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Third Call for Papers </p>\n<p>Apr 12, 2010: Suggested deadline for submissions to the workshops </p>\n<p>May 24, 2010: Suggested deadline for notification of workshop contributors</p>\n<p>Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for submission of camera-ready copy of workshop proceedings to the ESSLLI2010 Local Organizers. </p>\n<p>Notice that workshop speakers will be required to register for the Summer School; however, they will be able to register at a reduced rate <br>\nto be determined by the Local Organizers. </p>\n<p>FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS: A form for submitting course and workshop proposals will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010 website <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010\">www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010</a>. </p>\n<p>The proposers are required to submit the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name(s) of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s), at most two per course or workshop </li>\n<li>Contact addresses, homepages, phones, and fax numbers (if available), of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s); </li>\n<li>Title of proposed course/workshop; </li>\n<li>Type (workshop, foundational, introductory, or advanced course) </li>\n<li>Stream (one of: Language &amp; Computation, Language &amp; Logic, Logic &amp; Computation) </li>\n<li>\n<p>Description (in at most 300 words, provide justification, relevance to ESSLLI, proposed contents and structure of the courses, resp. <br>\n  expected participation in the workshops) </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>External funding (whether the proposers will be able to obtain external funding for travel and accommodation expenses) </p>\n</li>\n<li>Further particulars (any further information that is required by the above guidelines should be included here; in particular, course <br>\n  objectives and prerequisites, as well as the lecturers teaching experience relevant to the proposed course, and generally in the <br>\n  interdisciplinary field scope of ESSLLI.) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>FINANCIAL ASPECTS: Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers should be aware that all teaching and organizing at the summer <br>\nschools is done on a voluntary basis in order to keep the participants fees as low as possible. Lecturers and organizers are not paid for <br>\ntheir contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation (up to fixed maximum amounts, that will be communicated to the <br>\nlecturers upon notification). It should be stressed that while proposals from all over the world are welcomed, the School cannot guarantee <br>\nfull reimbursement of travel costs, especially from destinations outside Europe. Please note that in case a course or workshop is to be <br>\ntaught/organized by two lecturers, a lump sum will be reimbursed to cover travel and accommodation expenses for one lecturer; the <br>\nsplitting of that sum is up to the lecturers. </p>\n<p>The local organizers would highly appreciate it if, whenever possible, lecturers and workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover <br>\ntravel and accommodation expenses, as that would help us keep the cost of attending ESSLLI2010 lower. </p>\n<p>ESSLLI 2010 PROGRAM COMMITTEE: </p>\n<p>Chair: Valentin Goranko (Technical Univ. of Denmark) </p>\n<p>Area Specialists: </p>\n<p>Language and Computation: <br>\nWalter Daelemans (Univ. of Antwerp) <br>\nSabine Schulte im Walde (Univ. of Stuttgart) </p>\n<p>Language and Logic: <br>\nYoad Winter (Utrecht Univ.) <br>\nRaffaella Bernardi (Free Univ. of Bozen-Bolzano) </p>\n<p>Logic and Computation: <br>\nAnuj Dawar (Univ. of Cambridge) <br>\nKen Shan (State Univ. of New Jersey, Rutgers) </p>\n<p>ESSLLI 2010 Program Committee dedicated email account: <a href=\"mailto:esslli2010@gmail.com\">esslli2010@gmail.com</a> </p>\n<p>ESSLLI 2010 ORGANIZING COMMITTEE: </p>\n<p>Chair: Vincent Hendricks (University of Cope<br>\n[message truncated]</p>",
