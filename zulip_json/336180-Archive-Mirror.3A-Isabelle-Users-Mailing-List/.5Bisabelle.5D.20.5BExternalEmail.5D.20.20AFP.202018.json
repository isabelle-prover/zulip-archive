All of this is built in a very high-level style using Dirichlet series. The proof of the non-vanishing follows a very short and elegant proof by Newman, which we attempt to reproduce faithfully in a similar level of abstraction in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>This also leads to a relatively short proof of Dirichlet’s Theorem, which states that, if h and n are coprime, there are infinitely many primes p with p ≡ h (mod n).</p>\n<p>Apologies to Manuel!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
