Indeed, everything depends upon the topological interpretation of<br>\nthe \"real numbers\" that we are using:</p>\n<p>- 1/0 is undefined if we are conceiving the real numbers as a line;<br>\n   - 1/0 is infinity if we are conceiving the real numbers as a circle;<br>\n   - 1/0 is 0 if we are conceiving the real numbers as the lemniscate of<br>\n   Bernoulli (identifying zero and infinity).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From a local point of view, real numbers are like a segment (with the<br>\nexception of the singularity at zero in the case of the lemniscate of<br>\nBernoulli), but from a global point of view \"only God knows\", because no<br>\nhuman being has never seen the real numbers as a whole. So, I'm open to the<br>\nthree above-mentioned possibilities. I think that to consider that the<br>\n\"real numbers\" are by definition a line is a kind of Cartesian dogmatism.<br>\nIn the case 1/0 = 0, a small neighbourhood of zero includes both very small<br>\nnumbers and very large numbers, e.g., ice-cream has a bad taste either when<br>\nit has almost no sugar or it has too much sugar. A similar idea holds in<br>\nhight dimension, e.g., complex numbers, quaternions, octonions, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nJosé M.</p>",

There is a short discussion of that at the end of <a href=\"http://isarmathlib.org/Field_ZF.html\">http://isarmathlib.org/Field_ZF.html</a> .The situation is similar in Metamath  (see <a href=\"http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/ndmfv.html\">http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/ndmfv.html</a>) so I would say this is quite standard in ZFC formalizations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kind regards<br>\nSlawomir Kolodynski<br>\n<a href=\"http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/isarmathlib\">http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/isarmathlib</a> Library of Formalized Mathematics for Isabelle/Isar (ZF Logic)</p>",
