(Note that the server where I put our whole <br>\nformalisation will be offline until tomorrow morning.)</p>\n<p>In the last case of the case distinction, I would like to infer the fact <br>\nI call pred_is_component.  I need this to continue with the proof.</p>\n<p>Now I have been unable to infer pred_is_component directly.  But I made <br>\nit work with a detour via in_range.  (So, don't worry, my proof works â€“ <br>\nit's just not _nice_.)</p>\n<p>And when I define in_range as \"i : {1..n}\" instead \"1 &lt;= i /\\ i &lt;= n\", <br>\neven that doesn't work.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Christoph<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/EPqqBCR78HCJ3uy1DY-z-011/in_range.thy\">in_range.thy</a></p>",
