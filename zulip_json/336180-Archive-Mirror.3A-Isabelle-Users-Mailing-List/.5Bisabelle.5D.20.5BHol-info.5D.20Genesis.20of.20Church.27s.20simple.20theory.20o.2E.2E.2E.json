It is a bare bones implementation of <br>\nthe logic, and is designed to be highly trustworthy and robust.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.proof-technologies.com/holzero.html\">http://www.proof-technologies.com/holzero.html</a></p>\n<p>It can be used to create simple natural deduction proofs, but is mainly <br>\nintended as a proof checker to replay (via some proof recording <br>\nmechanism) formal proofs performed on other systems.  It has <br>\nsuccessfully replayed two quarters of the Flyspeck Project, for example, <br>\nthat were originally performed in HOL Light in 1.4 billion primitive <br>\ninference steps.  Another intended role is a pedagogical example of a <br>\nbasic HOL system, with a simple coding style and lots of code comments <br>\nexplaining what is going on, which also helps trustworthiness.</p>\n<p>Mark Adams.</p>",
