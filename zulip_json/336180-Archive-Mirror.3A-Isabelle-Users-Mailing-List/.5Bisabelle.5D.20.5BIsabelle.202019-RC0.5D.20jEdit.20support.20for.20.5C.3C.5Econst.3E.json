But <br>\n\\const does not work for getting \\&lt;^const&gt;. (Note: the \\&lt;^const&gt; <br>\nantiquotation accepts cartouches, but only when the constant is not <br>\npolymorphic. E.g., \\&lt;^const&gt;&lt;bla&gt; works, \\&lt;^const&gt;&lt;blu(int)&gt; does not, <br>\n@{const bla} and @{const blu(int)} both work.)</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",

Right now that duality of syntax is<br>\nstill considered normal, but I find it myself more and more awkward to<br>\nwork with the old @{name ARGS ...} form (e.g. for @{thm}, @{lemma},<br>\n@{cite}). In principle that could be eliminated by internalizing the<br>\nformer syntax into a single cartouche argument, while keeping the old<br>\nsyntax inside -- it is probably better to make slight reforms on syntax<br>\nat the same time.</p>\n<p>Specifically for @{const name(type)} I would say we need proper inner<br>\nsyntax for such type application to polymorphic constants. This would<br>\nhelp many applications within the regular term language. It is merely a<br>\nmatter to find funny parentheses that can be rendered in LaTeX and some<br>\nfree TrueType font: we can then add that to our infinite store of<br>\nIsabelle symbols and provide glyphs in the Isabelle fonts. (That is<br>\ndefinitely for a release after Isabelle2019.)</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
