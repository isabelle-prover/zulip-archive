I really find them useful. <br>\nUnfortunately, they are not yet right for induction proofs with several goals. Here's a <br>\nsmall example:</p>\n<p>lemma<br>\n   fixes xs :: \"'a list\"<br>\n   shows \"xs = xs\" \"xs @ xs = xs @ xs\"<br>\nproof(induction xs)</p>\n<p>The suggested proof outline is</p>\n<p>case Nil<br>\n   then show ?thesis sorry<br>\nnext<br>\n   case (Cons a xs)<br>\n   then show ?thesis sorry<br>\nqed</p>\n<p>There are two things wrong here. First, ?thesis is not a term abbreviation in the <br>\ninduction proof, so I get a corresponding error there. Second, the sub-cases are missing.</p>\n<p>I would have expected an outline like the following:</p>\n<p>case Nil<br>\n   { case 1<br>\n     then show ?case sorry<br>\n   next<br>\n     case 2<br>\n     then show ?case sorry<br>\n   }<br>\nnext<br>\n   case (Cons a xs)<br>\n   { case 1<br>\n     then show ?case sorry<br>\n   next<br>\n     case 2<br>\n     then show ?case sorry<br>\n   }<br>\nqed</p>\n<p>Are you aware of the problem?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
