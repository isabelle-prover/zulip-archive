(Specifically, that means that theories in XXX itself are<br>\nnot prebuilt.)</p>\n<p>Additionally there is the -A option. My first thought was that this is to<br>\nbe used in the following situation: I have a more complex project<br>\ninvolving, say, two sessions <em>XXX=HOL+...</em> and <em>YYY=XXX+...</em> Without -R,-A,<br>\nI would have to run *jedit -l HOL *to be able edit theories in both<br>\nsessions. With <em>jedit -R XXX</em>, the theories from other sessions in YYY<br>\nwould not be prebuilt. With <em>jedit -R YYY</em>, the theories from XXX would be<br>\nprebuilt and therefore cannot be edited. So I thought that is what *jedit<br>\n-R YYY -A XXX* would be for. I had expected/hoped that this would not build<br>\nthe theories in sessions XXX and YYY, only the theories from other<br>\nsessions. Unfortunately, this is not what <em>-A</em> does, the sessions from XXX<br>\nare still prebuilt (it just changes where in the session graph they are<br>\nincluded).</p>\n<p>What is the intended use case of <em>-A</em>? And is there a combination of<br>\noptions that achieves what I had thought it was for (i.e., not prebuild any<br>\ntheories from XXX and YYY, but all included theories from other sessions)?</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",

It is in the context of a tool that uses<br>\nIsabelle in the backend (<a href=\"https://github.com/dominique-unruh/qrhl-tool/\">https://github.com/dominique-unruh/qrhl-tool/</a>) via<br>\nlibisabelle, and the binary distribution would only contain one of the<br>\nsessions, but the sources contains other session with, e.g., tests.</p>\n<p>* Is it feasible to compose adhoc session definitions in</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/ROOT for the purpose of certain development situations?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes. That is what I have been doing (and what still works with<br>\nIsabelle2018).<br>\nSo there is no big problem, I just had hoped that the new -R,-A switches<br>\nwould allow me to avoid this.<br>\nThe disadvantage is that this ROOT needs to be added on every system that I<br>\nuse, but that's not a big problem.<br>\nSo if the current switches don't solve that, it's no problem.<br>\nI just wanted to check because they seemed to address a similar use case.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",
