In addition, still in the<br>\ndomain of verification, there is an increasing interest to automate set<br>\ntheory<br>\n(which is known to be a difficult problem), with some concrete realizations,<br>\nsuch as mp (the \"main prover\" of Atelier B) or Muscadet (an automated<br>\ntheorem<br>\nprover for natural deduction, which gives some good performances in set<br>\ntheory). Sets are also the main features of some programming languages like<br>\nthe former SetL language or the more recent {log} language (pronounced as<br>\nsetlog).</p>\n<p>The workshop aims at bringing together researchers interested in set theory,<br>\nespecially to design tools for dealing with set theory, such as interactive<br>\nor<br>\nautomated theorem provers, proof checkers, theories for general purpose<br>\nproof<br>\ntools, constraint solvers, programming languages etc. These tools may be<br>\ndedicated or general purpose tools. Contributions by theoreticians working<br>\non<br>\nset theories or fragments of set theories in the aim of designing concrete<br>\ntools, and by practitioners using set-based tools are both welcome. We are<br>\nalso interested by contributions providing some comparisons between set<br>\nmodeling techniques and other formalisms, such as type theory (and variants)<br>\nfor instance. Finally, regarding the domains of application, we mainly<br>\nexpect<br>\ncontributions in the framework of formal methods, but not exhaustively, and<br>\ncontributions reporting formalizations of mathematics using set theory for<br>\nexample could be of interest for this workshop as well.</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of set theory and<br>\ncorresponding tools.
