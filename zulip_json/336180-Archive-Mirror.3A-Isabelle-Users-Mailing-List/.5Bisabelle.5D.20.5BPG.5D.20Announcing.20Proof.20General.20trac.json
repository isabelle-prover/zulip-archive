Even if the developers don't have time to fix them  <br>\nthemselves, perhaps others will be able to help or suggest  <br>\nworkarounds.  It's a frustration that users sometimes complain to one  <br>\nanother about problems and put up with them, but never report them to  <br>\nthe developers.</p>\n<p>I don't open source projects can ever expect all users to be bug  <br>\nreporters, but with a small-ish user community spread across many  <br>\ndifferent prover systems, operating systems and emacs versions, it  <br>\nwould help if a larger than usual percentage of PG users could be.</p>\n<p>This list is small and quiet: please pass the message on to other PG  <br>\nusers.</p>\n<p>Many thanks!</p>\n<p>- David</p>\n<hr>\n<p>ProofGeneral mailing list<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:ProofGeneral@inf.ed.ac.uk\">ProofGeneral@inf.ed.ac.uk</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://lists.inf.ed.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/proofgeneral\">http://lists.inf.ed.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/proofgeneral</a></p>",
