This could be changed easy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is there a way to activate output of the readable proof in Isar format from the command line ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No. The goal of this setup, as you can guess, was to participate in the CASC competition. But since 2015 or 2016, CASC requires proof output in TSTP format (as opposed to just the status \"theorem\" or not), and I've never bothered trying to have Isabelle output proofs for CASC. Instead, I worked on a HO ATP, an effort that paid off at the latest CASC:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tptp.org/CASC/J10/WWWFiles/DivisionSummary1.html\">http://www.tptp.org/CASC/J10/WWWFiles/DivisionSummary1.html</a> &lt;<a href=\"http://www.tptp.org/CASC/J10/WWWFiles/DivisionSummary1.html\">http://www.tptp.org/CASC/J10/WWWFiles/DivisionSummary1.html</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>(First row, \"Zipperpin\" = \"Zipperposition\").</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have seen another script called tptp_sledgehammer, what is the difference ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sledgehammer only calls Sledgehammer. Isabelle also calls \"auto\", \"blast\", etc.</p>\n<p>These tools are very crude. I'll look into the bit rot issue and come back to you, but for the rest I'm afraid you're on your own. I'd gladly accept and apply patches though and can explain the code (there isn't much).</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",

The trick is to remove the two invocations of the function \"freeze_problem_consts\", which were an unnecessary hack that had a minor impact on the success rate but that no longer works after some reforms in local theories. You can try to amend the file locally or wait for the next version.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your report.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
