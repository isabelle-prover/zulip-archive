It aspires to be a lively <br>\nenvironment<br>\nfor presenting the latest research results, and other contributions (see <br>\nbelow at scope).</p>\n<p>Please be aware that TFP uses two distinct rounds of submissions (see <br>\nbelow at submission<br>\ndetails).</p>\n<p>TFP 2019 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming <br>\nevents. TFP 2019<br>\nwill be accompanied by the International Workshop on Trends in <br>\nFunctional Programming<br>\nin Education (TFPIE), which will take place on June 11.</p>\n<p>== Invited Speakers ==</p>\n<p>TFP 2019 is pleased to announce keynote talks by the following two <br>\ninvited speakers:</p>\n<p>Nikhil Swamy, Microsoft Research: Structuring the Verification of <br>\nImperative Programs with<br>\n                                   Functional Programming</p>\n<p>Frank Wood, University of British Columbia: Probabilistic Programming</p>\n<p>TFPIE 2019 is pleased to have the following invited speaker:</p>\n<p>Gregor Kiczales: Functional Programming at the Core of a High Throughput <br>\nSoftware<br>\n                  Engineering Curriculum</p>\n<p>== Scope ==</p>\n<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various <br>\nroutes. As part of<br>\nthe Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the following five <br>\narticle<br>\ncategories. High-quality articles are solicited in any of these categories:</p>\n<p>Research Articles:<br>\n         Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work<br>\n     Position Articles:<br>\n         On what new trends should or should not be<br>\n     Project Articles:<br>\n         Descriptions of recently started new projects<br>\n     Evaluation Articles:<br>\n         What lessons can be drawn from a finished project<br>\n     Overview Articles:<br>\n         Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</p>\n<p>Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for <br>\npublication to any<br>\nother forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming: <br>\ntheoretical,<br>\nimplementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. Applications of <br>\nfunctional programming<br>\ntechniques to other languages are also within the scope of the symposium.</p>\n<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing<br>\n     Functional programming in the cloud<br>\n     High performance functional computing<br>\n     Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs<br>\n     Dependently typed functional programming<br>\n     Validation and verification of functional programs<br>\n     Debugging and profiling for functional languages<br>\n     Functional programming in different application areas:<br>\n     security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded<br>\n     systems, global computing, grids, etc.<br>\n     Interoperability with imperative programming languages<br>\n     Novel memory management techniques<br>\n     Program analysis and transformation techniques<br>\n     Empirical performance studies<br>\n     Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages<br>\n     (Embedded) domain specific languages<br>\n     New implementation strategies<br>\n     Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</p>\n<p>If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of TFP, <br>\nplease contact<br>\nthe TFP 2019 program chairs, William J. Bowman and Ron Garcia.</p>\n<p>== Best Paper Awards ==</p>\n<p>To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper <br>\naccepted for<br>\nthe formal proceedings.</p>\n<p>TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students, <br>\nacknowledging that<br>\nstudents are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student <br>\npaper is one<br>\nfor which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of <br>\nstudents, the students<br>\nare listed as first authors, and a student would present the paper. A <br>\nprize for the<br>\nbest student paper is awarded each year.</p>\n<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the <br>\nbest paper happens<br>\nto be a student paper, that paper will then receive both prizes.</p>\n<p>== Instructions to Author ==</p>\n<p>Papers must be submitted at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2019\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2019</a></p>\n<p>Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally <br>\nreviewed either<br>\nbefore or after the Symposium.</p>\n<p>== Pre-symposium formal review ==</p>\n<p>Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted <br>\nbefore an early<br>\ndeadline and receive their reviews and notification of acceptance for <br>\nboth presentation<br>\nand publication before the symposium. A paper that has been rejected in <br>\nthis process may<br>\nstill be accepted for presentation at the symposium, but will not be <br>\nconsidered for the<br>\npost-symposium formal review.</p>\n<p>== Post-symposium formal review ==</p>\n<p>Papers submitted for post-symposium review (draft papers) will receive <br>\nminimal reviews and<br>\nnotification of acceptance for presentation at the symposium. Authors of <br>\ndraft papers will<br>\nbe invited to submit revised papers based on the feedback received at <br>\nthe symposium. A<br>\npost-symposium refereeing process will then select a subset of these <br>\narticles for formal<br>\npublication.</p>\n<p>== Paper categories ==</p>\n<p>There are two types of submission, each of which can be submitted either <br>\nfor pre-symposium<br>\nor post-symposium review:</p>\n<p>Extended abstracts. Extended abstracts are 4 to 10 pages in length.<br>\n     Full papers.        Full papers are up to 20 pages in length.</p>\n<p>Each submission also belongs to a category:<br>\n     research<br>\n     position<br>\n     project<br>\n     evaluation<br>\n     overview paper</p>\n<p>Each submission should clearly indicate to which category it belongs.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a draft paper submission—of either type (extended abstract <br>\nor full paper) and<br>\nany category—can be considered a student paper. A student paper is one <br>\nfor which primary<br>\nauthors are research students and the majority of the work described was <br>\ncarried out by the<br>\nstudents. The submission should indicate that it is a student paper.</p>\n<p>Student papers will receive additional feedback from the PC shortly <br>\nafter the symposium has<br>\ntaken place and before the post-symposium submission deadline. Feedback <br>\nis only provided for<br>\naccepted student papers, i.e., papers submitted for presentation and <br>\npost-symposium formal<br>\nreview that are accepted for presentation. If a student paper is <br>\nrejected for presentation,<br>\nthen it receives no further feedback and cannot be submitted for <br>\npost-symposium review.</p>\n<p>== Format ==</p>\n<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For <br>\nmore information<br>\nabout formatting please consult the Springer LNCS web site <br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/lncs\">http://www.springer.com/lncs</a>).</p>\n<p>== Program Committee ==</p>\n<p>Program Co-chairs<br>\nWilliam J.
