It aspires <br>\nto be<br>\na lively environment for presenting the latest research results, and other<br>\ncontributions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>TFP is moving to new winter dates, to provide an FP forum in between the<br>\n   annual ICFP events.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TFP offers a supportive reviewing process designed to help less <br>\nexperienced<br>\n   authors succeed, with two rounds of review, both before and after the<br>\n   symposium itself. Authors have an opportunity to address reviewers' <br>\nconcerns<br>\n   before final decisions on publication in the proceedings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TFP offers two \"best paper\" awards, the John McCarthy award for best <br>\npaper,<br>\n   and the David Turner award for best student paper.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This year we are particularly excited to co-locate with Lambda Days in<br>\n   beautiful Krakow. Lambda Days is a vibrant developer conference with <br>\nhundreds<br>\n   of attendees and a lively programme of talks on functional <br>\nprogramming in<br>\n   practice. TFP will be held in the same venue, and participants will <br>\nbe able<br>\n   to session-hop between the two events.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission deadline for pre-symposium review:   15th November,    2019  <br>\n-- passed --<br>\nSubmission deadline for draft papers:           10th January,     2020  <br>\n-- passed --<br>\nRegistration (regular):                         2nd February,    2020<br>\nRegistration (late):                            13th February,    2020<br>\nSymposium dates:                                13-14th February, 2020</p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://tfp2020.org\">tfp2020.org</a> for more information.</p>",
