Areas<br>\n of application include verification of software and computer<br>\n systems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its<br>\n required inference engines, and system diagnosis. The conference<br>\n brings together researchers interested in all aspects - theoretical<br>\n foundations, implementation techniques, systems development and<br>\n applications - of the mechanization of reasoning with tableaux and<br>\n related methods.</p>\n<p>CONFERENCE PROGRAMME</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://tableaux2005.uni-koblenz.de/programme.html\">http://tableaux2005.uni-koblenz.de/programme.html</a> for a description of<br>\n the scientific programme.</p>\n<p>TABLEAUX 2005 is part of the International Conference Summer Koblenz 2005.<br>\n See <a href=\"http://www.uni-koblenz.de/ag-ki/confsummer.html\">http://www.uni-koblenz.de/ag-ki/confsummer.html</a></p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<p>Ian Horrocks<br>\n University of Manchester<br>\n DESCRIPTION LOGICS IN ONTOLOGY APPLICATIONS</p>\n<p>Diego Calvanese<br>\n Free University of Bolzano/Bozen<br>\n QUERY PROCESSING IN PEER-TO-PEER SYSTEMS: AN EPISTEMIC LOGIC</p>\n<p>Hans-Jürgen Ohlbach<br>\n Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich<br>\n AUTOMATED REASONING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SEMANTIC WEB</p>\n<p>Erik Rosenthal<br>\n University of New Haven<br>\n FORMAL VERSUS RIGOROUS MATHEMATICS: HOW TO GET YOUR PAPERS PUBLISHED</p>\n<p>TUTORIALS</p>\n<p>For tutorial abstracts, see <a href=\"http://tableaux2005.uni-koblenz.de/tutorials\">http://tableaux2005.uni-koblenz.de/tutorials</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Instance Based Methods<br>\n   by Peter Baumgartner and Gernot Stenz</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analytic Systems and Dialogue Games<br>\n   by Chris Fermüller</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tutorial on Agda<br>\n   by Marcin Benke</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CONFERENCE AND PROGRAM COMMITTEE CHAIR</p>\n<p>Bernhard Beckert, University of Koblenz, Germany</p>\n<p>LOCATION</p>\n<p>The 2000-year-old town of Koblenz is situated in the picturesque<br>\n landscape of the Rhine and Moselle and surrounded by four low<br>\n mountain ranges. In 2002 the UNESCO ranked the upper Middle Rhine<br>\n valley one of the most beautiful and oldest man-made landscapes,<br>\n among the world cultural heritages.  The chain of castles and<br>\n palaces along the steep slopes, where the famous Rhine wines are<br>\n grown, stretches from Koblenz to the legendary Loreley and continues<br>\n to the cities of Rüdesheim and Bingen.</p>\n<p>ACCOMMODATION</p>\n<p>There are pre-reserved hotel room contingents for participants of TABLEAUX<br>\n 2005 (see <a href=\"http://tableaux2005.uni-koblenz.de/hotels.html\">http://tableaux2005.uni-koblenz.de/hotels.html</a>). Reservations for<br>\n rooms in these contingents can only be made until July 31, 2005. Due to the<br>\n very limited number of available hotel rooms in Koblenz in September, we<br>\n highly recommend room booking as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>REGISTRATION</p>\n<p>To register, please fill in the registration form available at<br>\n<a href=\"http://tableaux2005.uni-koblenz.de/registration.html\">http://tableaux2005.uni-koblenz.de/registration.html</a><br>\n Early registration ends July 31st, 2005.</p>\n<p>SCHOLARSHIPS</p>\n<p>TABLEAUX 2005 will support a limited number of attendees that<br>\n otherwise cannot afford coming to Koblenz by providing a scholarship<br>\n to cover (part of) their travel expenses and/or the conference fee. We<br>\n welcome applications from everyone who has a particular interest in<br>\n attending Tableaux (preference will be given to authors of accepted<br>\n Tableaux 2005 papers) and who has a need for support. The deadline for<br>\n applications is Friday, 15 July 2005.
