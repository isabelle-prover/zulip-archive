What kind of intro/elim rules do I get from <br>\na lemma \"A = B\". More importantly, is it safe to declare a rule as [iff] <br>\n(e.g., if I had two different characterizations of A, namely B and C, <br>\nwould it be safe to add [iff]: \"A = B\" and [iff]: \"A = C\" or does it <br>\ndepend on the weather afterwards, whether automation does still what I <br>\nwant)?</p>\n<p>best regards</p>\n<p>chris</p>",
