Users can actually <br>\nbecome quite interested in foundational features, and find uses for <br>\nlow-level features that they are given access to. And once momentum <br>\nbuilds for features to be eliminated in a software product, it's can be <br>\nhard to stop, so it pays to complain early.</p>\n<p>The quotes below from the dev list provide some context. I'll make this <br>\na short comment, in case nothing more is required.</p>\n<p>I care about the operator \"==\", and over the months, Makarius has made a <br>\nnumber of comments deemphasizing it, and the comments below indicate <br>\nsomething similar. I don't see how \"==\" could be gotten rid of from <br>\nIsar, but what do I know?</p>\n<p>The operator \"==\" will forever be an Isar operator, won't it? It's not <br>\ngoing away, is it? No reply is necessary if it's not going away. I would <br>\nappreciate a reply if it's going away, so I can become irate now.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nGB</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mailmanbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/pipermail/isabelle-dev/2013-September/004527.html\">https://mailmanbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/pipermail/isabelle-dev/2013-September/004527.html</a></p>",
