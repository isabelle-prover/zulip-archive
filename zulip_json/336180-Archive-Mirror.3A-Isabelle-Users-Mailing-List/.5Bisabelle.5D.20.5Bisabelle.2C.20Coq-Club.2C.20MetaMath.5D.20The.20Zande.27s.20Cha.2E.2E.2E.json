These<br>\npostulates seem to be contradictory from the point of view of traditional<br>\nmathematics.</p>\n<p>I think that it will be interesting to think about this problem from the<br>\nperspective of a proof assistant, trying to mechanize these religions<br>\npostulates in a consistent way. Maybe someone reading this post will solve<br>\nthis anthropologic mystery and to publish a paper with the solution<br>\n(anthropologists will be interested in this new information).
