He is survived by his wife of 38 years Avra Cohn and by his sons <br>\nKatriel and Reuben. He'll be greatly missed by his family and friends, but <br>\nequally by the academic community of which he was such a long-standing pillar. <br>\nThere will be a memorial service in Cambridge in due course to celebrate his life.</p>\n<p>Please do forward this message to any mailing lists or people that you think <br>\nwould like to know.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAvra, Reuben and Katriel<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/Iy87VC4g7hDCrfMU9Cc0h684/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
