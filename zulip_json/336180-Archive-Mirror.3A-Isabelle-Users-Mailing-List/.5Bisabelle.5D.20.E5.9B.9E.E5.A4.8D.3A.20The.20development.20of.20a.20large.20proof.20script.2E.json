And I would appreciate if <em>all</em> <br>\ncorresponding discussion would go through the isabelle mailing list <br>\n(instead of private email to me or others). This way, answers will be <br>\narchived and can be referenced later if similar questions arise again.</p>\n<p>Having said that -- at least for me -- reminders about pending threads <br>\non the mailing list will not speed up my answering. When I have time to <br>\nread and think about a question <em>and</em> come up with an answer I deem <br>\nuseful, I will respond. Not before ;)</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",
