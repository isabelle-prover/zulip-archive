They do it simply for convenience and not for any deep reason. The point is that many laws involving division will then hold unconditionally, an example being (a<em>b)/(c</em>d) = (a/c)*(b/d).</p>\n<p>Another example of domain extension is that the finite sum operator yields 0 if given an infinite index set. (This has nothing to do with the sum of an infinite series, which is a limit.) Again there is no deep reason, it is simply that some simple identities involving finite summation can be proved without requiring the index set to be finite.</p>\n<p>The technique of extending the domains of functions to simplify theorem proving goes back at least to the 1970s and the Boyer/Moore prover.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
