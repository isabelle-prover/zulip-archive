Confluence relates to many topics of rewriting (completion,<br>\nmodularity, termination, commutation, etc.) and had been investigated<br>\nin many formalisms of rewriting such as first-order rewriting,<br>\nlambda-calculi, higher-order rewriting, constraint rewriting,<br>\nconditional rewriting, etc. Recently there is a renewed interest in<br>\nconfluence research, resulting in new techniques, tool support,<br>\nconfluence competition, and certification as well as in new<br>\napplications. The scope of the workshop is all these aspects of<br>\nconfluence and related topics.  The goal of the workshop is to provide<br>\na forum for researchers interested in the topic of confluence to<br>\nexchange and share new developments in the field. The workshop will<br>\nenable discussion on theoretical results, new problems, applications,<br>\nimplementations and benchmarks, and share the current state-of-the-art<br>\non the development of confluence tools.  The workshop is collocated<br>\nwith CADE-25. Previous editions of the workshop were held in Nagoya<br>\n(2012), Eindhoven (2013) and Vienna (2014).  During the workshop the<br>\n4th Confluence Competition (CoCo 2015) takes place.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>\n<p>* submission          May  15, 2015<br>\n  * notification        June 12, 2015<br>\n  * final version       July 3, 2015<br>\n  * workshop            August 2, 2015</p>\n<p>TOPICS:<br>\nSpecific topics of interest include:</p>\n<p>* confluence and related properties (unique normal forms, commutation,<br>\n    ground confluence)</p>\n<p>* completion<br>\n  * critical pair criteria<br>\n  * decidability issues<br>\n  * complexity issues<br>\n  * system descriptions<br>\n  * certification<br>\n  * applications of confluence</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS:</p>\n<p>* TBA</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE:</p>\n<p>*  Takahito Aoto (Tohoku University), co-chair<br>\n  *  Mauricio Ayala Rincon (Universidade de Brasilia)<br>\n  *  Karl Gmeiner (UAS Technikum Wien)<br>\n  *  Samuel Mimram (ª±cole Polytechnique)<br>\n  *  Haruhiko Sato (Hokkaido University)<br>\n  *  Christian Sternagel (Universtity of Innsbruck)<br>\n  *  Ashish Tiwari (SRI International - Menlo Park, CA), co-chair</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION:<br>\nWe solicit short papers or extended abstracts of at most five pages.<br>\nThere will be no formal reviewing.
