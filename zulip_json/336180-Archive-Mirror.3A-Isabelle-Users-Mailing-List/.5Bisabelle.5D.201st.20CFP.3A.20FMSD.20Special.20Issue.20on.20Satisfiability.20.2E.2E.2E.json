These two ingredients together make SMT techniques well-suited<br>\nfor use in larger automated reasoning and formal verification efforts.</p>\n<p>(See also the SMT-LIB page <a href=\"http://www.smtlib.org/\">http://www.smtlib.org/</a>, and the page of the<br>\nannual SMT Workshop <a href=\"http://www.smt-workshop.org/\">http://www.smt-workshop.org/</a>)</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>The goal of the special issue is to survey recent developments in the<br>\nSMT field. Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Novel general SMT techniques</li>\n<li>New decision procedures and new theories of interest</li>\n<li>Construction of models, proofs, interpolants, etc.</li>\n<li>Techniques for handling quantifiers</li>\n<li>Combinations of decision procedures</li>\n<li>Novel implementation techniques</li>\n<li>Benchmarks and evaluation methodologies</li>\n<li>Formats for new theories, and developments in SMT-LIB</li>\n<li>Applications and case studies</li>\n<li>Theoretical results</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>This special issue welcomes original high-quality contributions that<br>\nhave been neither published in nor submitted to any journals or refereed<br>\nconferences. Extended versions of conference papers should include at<br>\nleast 30% of new material.</p>\n<p>All submissions should be written in terms understandable by general<br>\nreaders of the journal. To simplify the publication process, there will<br>\nbe a two step selection process. Authors willing to submit to this<br>\nspecial issues are asked to send an abstract (of at most 1 page)<br>\ndescribing the intended contribution. We will then select most promising<br>\nabstracts and will ask the authors to submit a full version. The full<br>\nversion of all submissions will be refereed according to FMSD standards,<br>\nas described at FMSD web page (see below). Note that acceptance of the<br>\nabstract does not guarantee acceptance of the full version. The guest<br>\neditors reserve the right to invite further relevant papers, including<br>\nextended versions of papers that appeared at recent workshops or<br>\nconferences.</p>\n<p>Abstracts should be submitted via email to the guest editors.<br>\nManuscripts should be submitted in LaTeX according to FMSD's author<br>\nguidelines. Please use Springer's LaTeX macro package and choose the<br>\nformatting option \"smallcondensed\". Submissions should not exceed 30<br>\npages. FMSD LaTeX style file can be obtained at the journal web page<br>\n(see below).</p>\n<p>ABOUT FMSD</p>\n<p>Formal Methods in System Design reports on the latest formal methods for<br>\ndesigning, implementing, and validating the correctness of hardware<br>\n(VLSI) and software systems. Readers will find high quality, original<br>\npapers describing all aspects of research and development. Contributions<br>\nto the journal serve its goal of developing an important and highly<br>\nuseful collection of commonly applicable formal methods that will<br>\nstrongly influence future design environments and design methods.
