Since 1997, ICFEM has been<br>\nserving as an international forum for researchers and practitioners who<br>\nhave been seriously applying formal methods to practical applications.<br>\nResearchers and practitioners, from industry, academia, and government, are<br>\nencouraged to attend, and to help advance the state of the art. We are<br>\ninterested in work that has been incorporated into real production systems,<br>\nand in theoretical work that promises to bring practical and tangible<br>\nbenefit.</p>\n<p>ICFEM 2012 will be hosted by National Institute of Advanced Industrial<br>\nScience and Technology (AIST) and Japan Advanced Institute of Science and<br>\nTechnology (JAIST), which will be held in Kyoto, JAPAN. Kyoto is the<br>\nancient capital of JAPAN, where you can find  many historical sites which<br>\nhave been designated as World Heritage there. We are looking forward to<br>\nyour submissions.</p>\n<p>AREA AND TOPICS</p>\n<p>Submissions related to the following principal themes are encouraged, but<br>\nany topics relevant to the field of formal methods and their practical<br>\napplications will also be considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstraction and refinement</li>\n<li>Formal specification and modelling</li>\n<li>Software verification</li>\n<li>Program analysis</li>\n<li>Software model checking</li>\n<li>Formal approaches to software testing</li>\n<li>Formal methods for object and component systems</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal methods for cloud computing/robotics/cyber-physical systems/<br>\n  medical devices/aeronautics/railway</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal methods for self-* systems </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal methods for software safety, security, reliability and<br>\ndependability</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experiments involving verified systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal methods used in certifying products under international standards<br>\n(ISO 26262, IEC 61508, etc)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal model-based development and code generation</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION</p>\n<p>Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be<br>\nconcurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be<br>\njudged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field, technical<br>\nand presentation quality, and relevance to the conference. The proceedings<br>\nwill be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.</p>\n<p>Papers should be written in English and not exceed 16 pages in LNCS format<br>\n(see <a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a> for details).
