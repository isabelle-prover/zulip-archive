The research project focuses on the<br>\nfollowing topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Design of a flexible framework for information-flow security specification</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formalization of the framework in the Isabelle proof assistant</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integration of interactive formal verification<br>\n   with language-based analysis tools to obtain holistic security guarantees</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application of the above to obtain the end-to-end verification of a<br>\n   realistic web-based system: an (EasyChair-like) conference management system</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For our current results see <a href=\"http://www4.in.tum.de/~popescua/pdf/CAV2014.pdf\">http://www4.in.tum.de/~popescua/pdf/CAV2014.pdf</a><br>\nMore details can be provided on request.</p>\n<p>The candidate must hold a PhD in computer science or mathematics and have a<br>\ntrack record of original research published in good conferences and<br>\njournals. Mathematical maturity, as well as experience with verification and<br>\nanalysis tools (in particular, proof assistants) are both very welcome.</p>\n<p>The intended start date is February 2015 but can be negotiated.</p>\n<p>Interested candidates should send a CV, list of publications and a brief<br>\nstatement of research interests to Tobias Nipkow (nipkow at in tum de) and<br>\nAndrei Popescu (a.popescu at mdx ac uk).<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/oOKO7nSrx4110wYBWRGOMM4e/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
