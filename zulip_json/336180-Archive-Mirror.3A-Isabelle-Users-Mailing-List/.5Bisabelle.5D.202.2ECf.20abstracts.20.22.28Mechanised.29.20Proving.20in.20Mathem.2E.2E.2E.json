The proposal is backed by increasing interest in technology<br>\nintegration in education to support proofs as well as the applications of<br>\nTP. The completion of the TP-based proof of the Kepler Conjecture was<br>\nannounced on August 10th, 2014.</p>\n<p>TP is reliably grounded on formal calculus — whereas proof is not taught<br>\nas a formal calculus in general academic education. Rather, students adopt<br>\nthe habits of their academic environment and copy the way of proving from<br>\ntheir academic teachers. Evidently this results in a lack of confidence<br>\nfor most students and in a lack of control of what they are doing. High-<br>\nschool seems affected by these academic traditions such, that proof is<br>\nconsidered too comprehensive for most students in spite of curricula<br>\nexplicitly mentioning mathematical proof.</p>\n<p>The Minisymposion presents experiences from courses supported by technology<br>\napplications in relation to proving and TP technology at academia and at<br>\nhigh-school throughout Europe. A major point of discussion will be the<br>\nissue to narrow the gap between high-school math and academic mathematics<br>\nin Science, Technology and Engineering (STEM) education. In particular,<br>\nthe (planned/envisioned) use of existing TP software systems in an<br>\neducational setting or concrete plans for (future/desired) educational<br>\nTP software systems should be demonstrated with the aim to get a common<br>\nview on the requirements for such systems that would make them widely<br>\naccepted teaching tools.</p>\n<p>This minisymposion is motivated by the hope that bottom-up approaches in<br>\nlocal cooperation might be more successful than pretentious top-down<br>\napproaches to the sensible, but important topic. For preparing discussions<br>\nwe invite submission of abstracts (at most 3 pages) on topics including,<br>\nbut not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Demonstration of tools supporting proofs and using TP technology,<br>\n   i.e. tools which generate assumptions, which interactively or<br>\n   automatically perform proofs, which systematically generate proof<br>\n   obligations, which use TP for checking user input, etc.<br>\n   (... called \"TP-based\" software in the sequel)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experiences from academic courses of various kinds using TP-based<br>\n   software --- probably including feature requests for future<br>\n   development of such software</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of mathematics and mathematical activities which might<br>\n   specifically take advantage from support by TP-based software</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mathematical concepts and (TP-based) technology specifically<br>\n   relevant for software support in teaching and learning to prove</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experiences from initiatives and activities filling the gap between<br>\n   school and university --- and their relation to TP-based technology.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Dates:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>7.
