Nice to see that it supports the same<br>\nUnicode symbol Tab completions as the main editor window.</p>\n<p>However it took me a while that the GUI counterpart of</p>\n<p>find_theorems \"...\"</p>\n<p>is to enter \"...\" (including the quotes!) into the GUI input form,<br>\nwhereas I would have expected that I can simply enter ... without the<br>\nquotes.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Christoph</p>",
