Although open to the general public<br>\nthey addressed in the past primarily the British and the German<br>\ncommunities, respectively. At the occasion of the Vienna Summer of Logic<br>\nthe two series will have a joint event in Vienna as an IJCAR workshop. In<br>\nthe spirit of the two series there will be no formal proceedings and we try<br>\nto maintain the informal open atmosphere of the two series. We welcome in<br>\nparticular research students to present their work. We solicit for all work<br>\nrelated to automated reasoning and its applications. We are particularly<br>\ninterested in work-in-progress and the presentation of half-baked ideas.</p>\n<p>As in the previous years, we aim to bring together researchers from all<br>\nareas of automated reasoning in order to foster links among researchers<br>\nfrom various disciplines; among theoreticians, implementers and users<br>\nalike, and among international communities, this year not just the British<br>\nand German communities.</p>\n<p>TOPICS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:</p>\n<p>- Theorem proving in classical and non-classical logics<br>\n   - Interactive theorem proving, logical frameworks, proof assistants,<br>\n     proof-planning</p>\n<p>- Reasoning methods<br>\n      o Saturation-based, instantiation-based, tableau, SAT<br>\n      o Equational reasoning, unification<br>\n      o Constraint satisfaction<br>\n      o Decision procedures, SMT<br>\n      o Combining reasoning systems<br>\n      o Non-monotonic reasoning, commonsense reasoning,<br>\n      o Abduction, induction<br>\n      o Model checking, model generation, explanation</p>\n<p>- Formal methods to specifying, deriving, transforming<br>\n     and verifying computer systems, requirements and software</p>\n<p>- Logic-based knowledge representation and reasoning:<br>\n      o Ontology engineering and reasoning<br>\n      o Domain specific reasoning (spatial, temporal, epistemic,agents, etc)</p>\n<p>- Logic and functional programming, deductive databases<br>\n   - Implementation issues and empirical results, demos<br>\n   - Practical experiences and applications of automated reasoning</p>\n<p>For each accepted abstract we expect that one of the authors gives a short<br>\nplenary presentation as well as a poster presentation at the<br>\nworkshop. Authors of accepted presentations will have a chance to revise<br>\ntheir submissions.</p>\n<p>Suggestions for a panel session should include a list of potential<br>\npanellists in addition to the topic and to a statement of relevance. These<br>\nsuggestions should also be submitted via the same EasyChair route.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>Submission of Abstracts/panel proposals    1 May 2014<br>\nNotification of Acceptance                15 May 2014<br>\nFinal Version                             20 May 2014<br>\nWorkshop                              23-24 July 2014</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>We invite the submission of two-page abstracts for poster presentations as<br>\nwell as for suggestions for panel sessions. The two-page abstracts in pdf<br>\nformat should be submitted via EasyChair at<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arwdt2014\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arwdt2014</a>, following the format<br>\nprovided at <a href=\"http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mmk/events/ARW-DT2014/\">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mmk/events/ARW-DT2014/</a>.</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE (some more may be added):</p>\n<p>- Serge Autexier (DFKI)<br>\n    - Bernhard Beckert (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology)<br>\n    - Christoph Benzmueller (Freie Universitaet Berlin)<br>\n    - Alexander Bolotov (University of Westminster) - chair<br>\n    - Simon Colton (Computing, Goldsmiths College, Univ of London)<br>\n    - Louise Dennis (University of Liverpool)<br>\n    - Clare Dixon (University of Liverpool)<br>\n    - Jacques Fleuriot (University of Edinburgh)<br>\n    - Ulrich Furbach (University of Koblenz)<br>\n    - Juergen Giesl (RWTH Aachen)<br>\n    - Ullrich Hustadt (University of Liverpool)<br>\n    - Dieter Hutter (DFKI GmbH)<br>\n    - Reiner Haehnle (Technical University of Darmstadt)<br>\n    - Mateja Jamnik (University of Cambridge)<br>\n    - Manfred Kerber (University of Birmingham) - chair<br>\n    - Ekaterina Komendantskaya (School of Computing, University of Dundee)<br>\n    - Sebastian Rudolph (Technische Universitaet Dresden)<br>\n    - Renate A.
