While most systems concerned with <br>\nprogram verification deal with loops by loop invariants<br>\nor induction hypotheses that have to be provided by a<br>\nhuman, a number of interesting alternative approaches <br>\nhave emerged. Especially promising breakthroughs are <br>\ntecniques based on Groebner bases, quantifier elimination, <br>\nand algorithmic combinatorics, which can be used<br>\nin conjunction with model checking, theorem proving, static<br>\nanalysis and abstract interpretation.</p>\n<p>This special issue is related to the topics of the <br>\nworkshop WING'09 (<a href=\"http://mtc.epfl.ch/events/WING09/\">http://mtc.epfl.ch/events/WING09/</a>):<br>\nWorkshop on Invariant Generation,<br>\nwhich took place as a sattelite event of ETAPS 2009,<br>\nin York, March 28, 2009.<br>\nIt will  be published by Elsevier within the <br>\nJournal of Symbolic Computation.</p>\n<p>Both participants of the WING'09 workshop and other <br>\nauthors are invited to submit contributions.</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This special issue focuses on advanced techniques for proving <br>\nproperties of programs with loops or recursion.</p>\n<p>Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program analysis and verification</li>\n<li>Inductive Assertion Generation</li>\n<li>Inductive Proofs for Reasoning about Loops</li>\n<li>Applications to Assertion Generation using the following tools:<ul>\n<li>Abstract Interpretation,</li>\n<li>Static Analysis,</li>\n<li>Model Checking,</li>\n<li>Theorem Proving,</li>\n<li>Algebraic Techniques</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tools for inductive assertion generation and verification</li>\n<li>Alternative techniques for reasoning about loops</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This special issue welcomes original high-quality contributions <br>\nthat have been neither published in nor submitted to any journals <br>\nor refereed conferences.  Submissions will be peer-reviewed using <br>\nthe standard refereeing procedure of the Journal of Symbolic Computation.</p>\n<p>Authors of papers presented at the WING'09 workshop are welcome to<br>\nsubmit extended and revised versions of their papers.
