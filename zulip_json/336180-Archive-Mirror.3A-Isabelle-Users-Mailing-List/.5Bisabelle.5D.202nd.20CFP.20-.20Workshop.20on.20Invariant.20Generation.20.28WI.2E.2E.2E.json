A key impediment has been the overhead<br>\nassociated with providing and debugging auxiliary invariant<br>\nannotations. As the design and implementation of reliable<br>\nsoftware remains an important issue, any progress in this area<br>\nwill be of utmost importance for future developments in IT.</p>\n<p>The logically deep parts of the code are characterized by<br>\n(nested) loops or recursions. For these parts, formal program<br>\nverification is an appropriate tool. One of its biggest<br>\nchallenges is automated discovery of inductive assertions,<br>\nleading to verification of safety and security properties of<br>\nprograms.</p>\n<p>The increasing power of automated theorem proving and computer<br>\nalgebra has opened new perspectives for computer aided program<br>\nverification; in particular for the automatic generation of<br>\ninductive assertions in order to reason about loops and<br>\nrecursion. Especially promising breakthroughs are invariant<br>\ngeneration techniques by Groebner bases, quantifier<br>\nelimination, and algorithmic combinatorics, which can be used<br>\nin conjunction with model checking, theorem proving, static<br>\nanalysis and abstract interpretation.</p>\n<p>Scope</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers from several<br>\nfields of abstract interpretation, computational logic and<br>\ncomputer algebra to support reasoning about loops, in<br>\nparticular, by using algorithmic combinatorics,<br>\nnarrowing/widening techniques, static analysis, polynomial<br>\nalgebra, quantifier elimination and model checking.</p>\n<p>We encourage submissions presenting work in progress, tools<br>\nunder development, as well as research of PhD students, such<br>\nthat the workshop can become a forum for active dialog between<br>\nthe groups involved in this new research area.</p>\n<p>Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program analysis and verification</li>\n<li>Inductive Assertion Generation</li>\n<li>Inductive Proofs for Reasoning about Loops</li>\n<li>Applications to Assertion Generation using the following tools:<ul>\n<li>Abstract Interpretation,</li>\n<li>Static Analysis,</li>\n<li>Model Checking,</li>\n<li>Theorem Proving,</li>\n<li>Algebraic Techniques</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tools for inductive assertion generation and verification</li>\n<li>Alternative techniques for reasoning about loops</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keynote Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Leonardo de Moura (Microsoft Research, USA)<br>\nAndrey Rybalchenko (MPI Saarbruecken, Germany)</p>\n<p>Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Program Chairs:</p>\n<p>Andrew Ireland (Heriot-Watt University, UK)<br>\nLaura Kovacs (EPFL, Switzerland)</p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>Nikolaj Bjorner (Microsoft Research, USA)<br>\nMartin Giese (University of Oslo, Norway)<br>\nReiner Haehnle (Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden)<br>\nPaul Jackson (University of Edinburgh, UK)<br>\nJens  Knoop (Technical University of Vienna, Austria)<br>\nFrancesco Logozzo (Microsoft Research, USA)<br>\nWolfgang Schreiner (RISC-Linz, Austria)<br>\nHelmut Veith (Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany)<br>\nAndrei Voronkov (Manchester University, UK)<br>\nThomas Wies (EPFL, Switzerland)</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>January 12, 2009: Submission deadline<br>\nFebruary 16, 2009: Notification of acceptance<br>\nMarch 1, 2009: Camera-ready copy deadline<br>\nMarch 22-23, 2009: WING 2009 in York, UK</p>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission is via</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wing09\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wing09</a></p>\n<p>Please submit research reports up to 15 pages in PDF,<br>\nconforming to the format produced by LaTeX using the<br>\neasychair.cls class file of EasyChair.<br>\nThe class style may be downloaded at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip\">http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip</a></p>\n<p>Publication</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the programme committee.<br>\nAccepted contributions will be published in archived electronic notes,<br>\nas an EasyChair collection volume.</p>\n<p>Journal publication of the post-workshop proceedings volume<br>\nis under discussion.</p>",
