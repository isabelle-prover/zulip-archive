Test and Proof seem to be<br>\ncontradictory techniques: if you have proved your program, it's<br>\nfruitless to comb it for bugs; and if you are testing it, that is surely<br>\na sign that you have given up on any hope to prove its correctness.<br>\nAccordingly, proofs and tests have, since the onset of software<br>\nengineering research, been pursued by distinct communities.</p>\n<p>However, the development of both approaches lead to the discovery of<br>\ncommon issues and to the realization that each may need the other. The<br>\nemergence of model checking has been one of the first signs that<br>\ncontradiction may yield to complementarity. Further evidence give<br>\ntest data generation techniques from models or programs boil down to<br>\nconstraint resolution techniques for relatively large formula; the<br>\nadvent of powerful SMT solvers have therefore powered new testing<br>\ntechniques.  Finally, since formal, proof-based verification is costly,<br>\ntesting invariants and background theories can be helpful to detect<br>\nerrors early and to improve cost effectivity.  Summing up, in the past<br>\nfew years an increasing number of research efforts have encountered the<br>\nneed for combining proofs and tests, dropping earlier dogmatic views of<br>\nincompatibility and taking instead the best of what each of these<br>\nsoftware engineering domains has to offer.</p>\n<p>The TAP conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners<br>\nworking in the converging fields of testing and proving, and will offer<br>\na generous allocation of panels and informal discussions.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include (other topics related to TAP are welcome):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Transfer of concepts from testing to proving (e.g., coverage criteria)<br>\n  and from proving to testing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Program proving with the aid of testing techniques</p>\n</li>\n<li>Verification and testing techniques combining proofs and tests</li>\n<li>\n<p>Generation of test data, oracles, or preambles by deductive<br>\n  techniques such as: theorem proving, model checking, symbolic<br>\n  execution, constraint logic programming</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Model-based testing and verification</p>\n</li>\n<li>Generation of specifications by deduction</li>\n<li>Automatic bug finding</li>\n<li>Formal frameworks</li>\n<li>Tool descriptions and experience reports</li>\n<li>Case studies combining tests and proofs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Abstract submission: February 04, 2011<br>\nPaper submission: February 11, 2011<br>\nNotification: March 14, 2011<br>\nCamera ready version: March 28, 2011<br>\nTAP conference: June 30 - July 01, 2011<br>\nTOOLS conferences (TOOLS, ICMT, SC, TAP): June 27 - July 01, 2011<br>\nConference Chairs: Yuri Gurevich, Bertrand Meyer<br>\nProgram Chairs: Martin Gogolla, Burkhart Wolff<br>\nPublication Chair: Gordon Fraser<br>\nWeb Chair: Lars Hamann</p>\n<p>Program Committee (to be finalized; acceptance for few names pending):<br>\n  Nazareno Aguirre, Bernhard K.
