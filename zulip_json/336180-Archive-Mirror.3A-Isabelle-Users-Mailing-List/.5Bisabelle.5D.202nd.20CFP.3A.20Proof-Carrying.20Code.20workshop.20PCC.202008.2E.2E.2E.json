It provides a practical framework for<br>\nindependent assurance of program behaviour; especially where source code<br>\nis not available, or the code author and user are unknown to each other.</p>\n<p>The workshop will address theoretical foundations of proof-carrying code<br>\nas well as practical examples and work on alternative application<br>\ndomains.  Here \"proof\" is construed broadly, to include not just<br>\nmathematical derivations but any formal evidence that supports the<br>\nstatic analysis of programs.  That is, evidence about an intrinsic<br>\nproperty of code and its behaviour that can be independently checked by<br>\nany user, intermediary, or third party.  These manifest guarantees mean<br>\nthat PCC raises trust in the code itself, distinct from and<br>\ncomplementary to any existing trust in the creator of the code, the<br>\nprocess used to produce it, or its distributor.</p>\n<p>Topics include:</p>\n<p>* PCC addressing properties of safety, security, and correctness<br>\n       such as: Memory safety, information flow, declassification,<br>\n       resource management, access control, protocol enforcement,<br>\n       functional correctness.</p>\n<p>* Examples of PCC in application domains, including but not limited<br>\n       to: Mobile code, mobile devices, operating systems, grid<br>\n       computing, peer-to-peer computing, active networks, embedded<br>\n       systems, cloud computing, databases, e-Science.</p>\n<p>* Probabilistically-checkable proofs, zero-knowledge proofs,<br>\n       proof-on-demand.</p>\n<p>* Trust and policy frameworks; supporting modular and extensible<br>\n       systems; compositionality in code and proofs.</p>\n<p>* Certifying compilation, proof-transforming compilation, certified<br>\n       verifiers.</p>\n<p>* Logics and notions of certificate specific to proof-carrying<br>\n       frameworks.</p>\n<p>PCC 2008 follows on from the successful 2006 workshop in Seattle<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~abc/PCC-Workshop.html\">http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~abc/PCC-Workshop.html</a></p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<p>* Thomas Jensen, IRISA Rennes / CNRS<br>\n     * Zhong Shao, Yale University</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>* Paper submission:     2  May 2008  [extended]<br>\n     * Author notification: 23  May 2008<br>\n     * Final versions:       7 June 2008<br>\n     * Workshop:            22 June 2008</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>Papers should be in the form of a PDF file using the ENTCS style<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.entcs.org\">http://www.entcs.org</a>) and must not exceed 15 pages.
