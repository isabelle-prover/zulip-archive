However, many techniques are working under restrictive<br>\nassumptions which are invalidated by complex embedded systems<br>\nsoftware such as operating system kernels, low-level device drivers or<br>\nmicrocontroller code.</p>\n<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and<br>\ndevelopers from both academia and industry, who are facing real<br>\nsoftware and real problems to find real, applicable solutions. By<br>\n\"real\" we mean problems such as time-to-market or reliability that the<br>\nindustry is facing. A real solution is one that is applicable to the<br>\nproblem in industry and not one that only applies to an abstract,<br>\nacademic toy version of it. This forum discusses software analysis <br>\nand development techniques and tools; it will serves as a<br>\nplatform to discuss open problems and future challenges in dealing<br>\nwith existing and upcoming systems level code.</p>\n<p>Topics include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>model checking</li>\n<li>automated and interactive theorem proving</li>\n<li>static analysis</li>\n<li>automated testing</li>\n<li>model-driven development</li>\n<li>embedded systems development</li>\n<li>programming languages</li>\n<li>verifying compilers</li>\n<li>software certification</li>\n<li>software tools</li>\n<li>experience reports</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Interested speakers should submit their paper (at most 9 pages, 8.5\" x<br>\n11\", including figures, tables, and references, formatted in two<br>\ncolumns, using 10 point type on 12 point (single-spaced) leading, with<br>\nthe text block being no more than 6.5\" wide by 9\" deep) to<br>\n<a href=\"https://papers.usenix.org/hotcrp/ssv10/\">https://papers.usenix.org/hotcrp/ssv10/</a> by June 4th 2010 Samoan time.<br>\nAll papers will be subject to peer review under conference standards.<br>\nExperience reports and papers on work in progress are welcome as long as<br>\nthere is a clear contribution.
