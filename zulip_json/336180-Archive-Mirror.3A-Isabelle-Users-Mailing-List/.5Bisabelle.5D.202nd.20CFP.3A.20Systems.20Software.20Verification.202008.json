However, many techniques are working under restrictive<br>\nassumptions which are invalidated by complex (embedded) system<br>\nsoftware such as operating system kernels, low-level device drivers or<br>\nmicrocontroller code.</p>\n<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and<br>\ndevelopers from both academia and industry, who are facing real<br>\nsoftware and real problems to find real, applicable solutions. By<br>\n\"real\" we mean problems such as time-to-market or reliability that the<br>\nindustry is facing and is trying to fix in software that is deployed<br>\nin the market place. A real solution is one that is applicable to the<br>\nproblem in industry and not one that only applies to an abstract,<br>\nacademic toy version of it. This forum will discuss software<br>\nanalysis/development techniques and tools; it will also serve as a<br>\nplatform to discuss open problems and future challenges in dealing<br>\nwith existing and upcoming system code.</p>\n<p>Topics include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<p>* model checking<br>\n     * automated and interactive theorem proving<br>\n     * static analysis<br>\n     * automated testing<br>\n     * model-driven development<br>\n     * embedded systems development<br>\n     * programming languages<br>\n     * verifying compilers<br>\n     * software certification<br>\n     * software tools<br>\n     * experience reports</p>\n<p>Interested speakers should submit their paper (max 15 pages, ENTCS<br>\nstyle) to <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/SSV08/\">http://www.easychair.org/SSV08/</a> by Oct 19 2007, 23:59h<br>\nSamoan time.
