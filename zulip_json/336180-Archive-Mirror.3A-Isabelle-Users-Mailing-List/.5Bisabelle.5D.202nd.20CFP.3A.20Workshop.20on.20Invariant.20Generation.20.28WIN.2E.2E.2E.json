However, the design <br>\nand implementation of reliable software still is an <br>\nimportant issue and any progress in this area will be <br>\nof utmost importance for the future development of IT.</p>\n<p>The logically deep parts of the code are characterized <br>\nby (nested) loops or recursions. For these parts, formal<br>\nprogram verification is an appropriate tool. One of its <br>\nbiggest challenges is the automated discovery of inductive <br>\nassertions, leading to the discovery of safety and <br>\nsecurity properties of programs.</p>\n<p>Scope</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers from <br>\nseveral fields of abstract interpretation, computational <br>\nlogic and computer algebra to support reasoning about loops,<br>\nin particular by using algorithmic  combinatorics, <br>\nnarrowing/widening techniques, static analysis, polynomial <br>\nalgebra, quantifier elimination and model checking. </p>\n<p>We encourage submissions presenting work in progress, tools<br>\nunder development, as well as research of PhD students, <br>\nsuch that the workshop can become a forum for active dialog<br>\nbetween the groups involved in this new research area.</p>\n<p>Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program analysis and verification</li>\n<li>Inductive Assertion Generation</li>\n<li>Inductive Proofs for Reasoning about Loops</li>\n<li>Applications to Assertion Generation using the following tools:<ul>\n<li>Abstract Interpretation,</li>\n<li>Static Analysis,</li>\n<li>Model Checking, </li>\n<li>Theorem Proving,</li>\n<li>Algebraic Techniques</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tools for inductive assertion generation and verification</li>\n<li>Alternative techniques for reasoning about loops</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keynote Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>John Harrison (Intel Corporation, USA)<br>\nReiner Hahnle (Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden) <br>\nDeepak Kapur  (University of New Mexico, USA)</p>\n<p>Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>General Chair: <br>\nBruno Buchberger (RISC, Austria)</p>\n<p>Program Chairs:<br>\nTudor Jebelean (RISC, Austria)<br>\nMartin Giese (RISC, Austria)</p>\n<p>Local Chair: <br>\nLaura Kovacs (RISC, Austria)</p>\n<p>Program Committee:<br>\nNikolaj S.
