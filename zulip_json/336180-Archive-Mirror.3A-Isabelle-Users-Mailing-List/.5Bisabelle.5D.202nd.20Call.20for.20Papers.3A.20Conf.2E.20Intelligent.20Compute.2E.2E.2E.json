The  Conferences on  Intelligent  Computer Mathematics  (CICM)<br>\noffer a venue for discussing these areas and their synergy.</p>\n<p>CICM has been held annually  as a joint meeting since 2008, colocating<br>\nrelated conferences  and workshops to advance work  in these subjects.<br>\nPrevious meetings have been held in Birmingham (U.K. 2008), Grand Bend<br>\n(Canada  2009), Paris  (France 2010),  Bertinoro (Italy  2011), Bremen<br>\n(Germany 2012) and Bath (U.K. 2013).</p>\n<p>This is  a call for papers  for CICM 2014,  which will be held  at the<br>\nUniversity   of  Coimbra,   7-11   July  2014,   following  the   10th<br>\nInternational Workshop on Automated Deduction in Geometry.</p>\n<p>The principal tracks of the conference will be:</p>\n<p>Calculemus (Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning)<br>\n  Chair: James Davenport</p>\n<p>DML (Digital Mathematical Libraries)<br>\n  Chair: Petr Sojka</p>\n<p>MKM (Mathematical Knowledge Management)<br>\n  Chair: Josef Urban</p>\n<p>Systems and Projects<br>\n  Chair: Alan Sexton</p>\n<p>The local  arrangements will be coordinated by  the Local Arrangements<br>\nChair,   Pedro  Quaresma  (U.

Calculemus  is a series  of conferences dedicated  to the<br>\nintegration  of  computer  algebra   systems  (CAS)  and  systems  for<br>\nmechanised  reasoning  like   interactive  proof  assistants  (PA)  or<br>\nautomated theorem  provers (ATP).  Currently,  symbolic computation is<br>\ndivided into several (more  or less) independent branches: traditional<br>\nones  (e.g., computer  algebra and  mechanised reasoning)  as  well as<br>\nnewly emerging ones (on  user interfaces, knowledge management, theory<br>\nexploration, etc.) The main concern  of the Calculemus community is to<br>\nbring these  developments together in order to  facilitate the theory,<br>\ndesign,  and  implementation   of  integrated  mathematical  assistant<br>\nsystems  that  will  be  used routinely  by  mathematicians,  computer<br>\nscientists and  all others who need  computer-supported mathematics in<br>\ntheir every day business.</p>\n<p>All  topics  in  the  intersection  of computer  algebra  systems  and<br>\nautomated  reasoning systems  are  of interest  for Calculemus.
