The<br>\nInternet has simplified the distributed development, review, and<br>\nimprovement of large proofs, theories, libraries, and knowledge<br>\nrepositories, also giving rise to all kinds of collaboratively developed<br>\nmathematical learning resources. Examples include the PlanetMath free<br>\nencyclopedia, the Polymath collaborative collaborative proof development<br>\nefforts, and also large collaboratively developed formal libraries.<br>\nInteractive computer assistance, semantic representation, and linking<br>\nwith other datasets on the Semantic Web are becoming very interesting<br>\naspects of collaborative mathematical developments. The ITP 2011<br>\nMathWikis workshop aims to bring together developers and major users of<br>\nmathematical wikis and collaborative and social tools for mathematics.</p>\n<p>TOPICS include but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* wikis and blogs for informal, semantic, semiformal, and formal<br>\nmathematical knowledge;</p>\n<p>* general techniques and tools for online collaborative mathematics;<br>\n   * tools for collaboratively producing, presenting, publishing, and<br>\ninteracting with online mathematics;</p>\n<p>* automation and computer-human interaction aspects of mathematical<br>\nwikis;</p>\n<p>* practical experiences, usability aspects, feasibility studies;<br>\n   * evaluation of existing tools and experiments;<br>\n   * requirements, user scenarios and goals.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit a short<br>\n(2-10 pages) abstract via EasyChair. Submissions will be refereed by the<br>\nprogram committee, which will select a balanced program of high-quality<br>\ncontributions.</p>\n<p>Submissions should be in standard-conforming Postscript or PDF.</p>\n<p>To submit a paper, go to the EasyChair MathWikis page<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mathwikis11\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mathwikis11</a>) and follow the<br>\ninstructions there.</p>\n<p>FINAL VERSIONS</p>\n<p>Final versions should be prepared in LaTeX using the easychair.cls class<br>\nfile (<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip\">http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip</a>).
