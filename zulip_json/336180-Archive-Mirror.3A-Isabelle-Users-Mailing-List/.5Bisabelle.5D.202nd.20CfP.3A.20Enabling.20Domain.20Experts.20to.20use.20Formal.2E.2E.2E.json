In the past even mis-represented units of<br>\nmeasurements caused fatal ENGINEERING disasters.  In ECONOMICS, the<br>\nsubtlety of issues involved in good auction design may have led to low<br>\nrevenues in auctions of public goods such as the 3G radio spectra.<br>\nSimilarly, banks' value-at-risk (VaR) models – the leading method of<br>\nfinancial risk measurement – are too large and change too quickly to be<br>\nthoroughly vetted by hand, the current state of the art; in the London<br>\nWhale incident of 2012, JP Morgan claimed that its exposures were $67mn<br>\nunder one of its VaR models, and $129 under another one.  Verifying a<br>\nmodel's properties requires formally specifying them; for VaR models, any<br>\nwork would have to start with this most basic step, as regulators' current<br>\ndesiderata are subjective and ambiguous.</p>\n<p>We believe that these problems can be addressed by representing the<br>\nknowledge underlying such models and mechanisms in a formal, explicit,<br>\nmachine-verifiable way.  Contemporary computer science offers a wide<br>\nchoice of knowledge representation languages well supported by<br>\nverification tools.  Such tools have been successfully applied, e.g., for<br>\nverifying software that controls commuter rail or payment systems (cf. the<br>\nsymposium homepage for further background).  Still, DOMAIN EXPERTS without<br>\na strong computer science background find it challenging to choose the<br>\nright tools and to use them.  This symposium aims at investigating ways to<br>\nsupport them.  Some problems can be addressed now, others will bring new<br>\nchallenges to computer science.</p>\n<p>TOPICS of interest include:</p>\n<p>* for DOMAIN EXPERTS: what problems in application domains could benefit<br>\n     from better verification and knowledge management facilities?<br>\n     Possible fields include:</p>\n<p>* Example 1 (economics):<br>\n       auctions, VaR, trading algorithms, market design</p>\n<p>* Example 2 (engineering):<br>\n       system interoperability, manufacturing processes, product <br>\nclassification</p>\n<p>* for COMPUTER SCIENTISTS: how to provide the right knowledge management<br>\n     and verification tools to domain experts without a computer science<br>\n     background?</p>\n<p>* wikis and blogs for informal, semantic, semiformal, and formal<br>\n       mathematical knowledge;</p>\n<p>* general techniques and tools for online collaborative mathematics;<br>\n     * tools for collaboratively producing, presenting, publishing, and<br>\n       interacting with online mathematics;</p>\n<p>* automation and computer-human interaction aspects of mathematical<br>\n       wikis;</p>\n<p>* ontologies and knowledge bases designed to support knowledge<br>\n       management and verification in application domains;</p>\n<p>* practical experiences, usability aspects, feasibility studies;<br>\n     * evaluation of existing tools and experiments;<br>\n     * requirements, user scenarios and goals.</p>\n<p>THE SYMPOSIUM is designed to bring domain experts and formalisers into<br>\nclose and fruitful contact with each other: domain experts will be able to<br>\npresent their fields and problems to formalisers; formalisers will be<br>\nexposed to new and challenging problem areas. We will combine talks and<br>\nhands-on sessions to ensure close interaction among participants from both<br>\nsides.</p>\n<p>World-class economists will offer dedicated HANDS-ON SESSIONS (to be<br>\nconfirmed) on the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Market design and matching problems (Utku Ünver, Boston College): These<br>\ninclude matching students to schools, interns to hospitals, and kidney<br>\ndonors to recipients.  See the documentation for the 2012 Nobel Memorial<br>\nPrize in Economic Sciences for more background information<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2012/\">http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2012/</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auctions (Peter Cramton, University of Maryland): Peter works on<br>\nauctions for ICANN (the ‘knock out’ domain name auctions), Ofcom UK (4G<br>\nspectrum auction), the UK Department of the Environment and Climate<br>\nChange, and others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finance (to be announced): It is currently impossible for regulators to<br>\nproperly inspect either risk management models, or algorithmic trading<br>\nplatforms.  To what extent can techniques from mechanised reasoning<br>\nautomate some of the inspection process?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS (TWO STAGES)</p>\n<p>We run a two-stage submission process:</p>\n<p>Stage 1: PROBLEM &amp; TOOL (\"NAIL &amp; HAMMER\") DESCRIPTIONS<br>\n          to be reviewed and matched with each other</p>\n<p>Stage 2: REGULAR EXTENDED ABSTRACTS<br>\n          normal conference-like peer review</p>\n<p>Accepted submissions from both stages will be included in the symposium<br>\nproceedings (see below).</p>\n<p>In Stage 1 (by 10 December) we solicit …</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>from DOMAIN EXPERTS: descriptions of canonical models and problems in<br>\n   their domain that might benefit from better verification and knowledge<br>\n   management facilities.  Descriptions should focus on aspects of these<br>\n   models that domain users find particularly problematic, and suspect<br>\n   might be aided by formalisation tools</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>from COMPUTER SCIENTISTS: descriptions of formalisation, verification<br>\n   and knowledge management tools, with an emphasis on how they could be<br>\n   applied in a concrete real-world setting, or tailored to such application<br>\n   domains.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stage 1 submissions should have 2 to 4 pages and may be summaries of<br>\nearlier publications on relevant problems and tools, focused to a target<br>\naudience of computer scientists or domain experts, respectively.</p>\n<p>The symposium chairs, assisted by the PC members, will review and<br>\ninitially publish commented versions of the Stage 1 submissions on the<br>\nsymposium homepage, to provide orientation for Stage 2.  Should matching<br>\nproblems and tools be identified, we will notify the respective authors.</p>\n<p>In Stage 2 (by 14 January) we solicit regular submissions on any of the<br>\nTOPICS outlined initially.  We prefer submissions that specifically<br>\naddress topics identified in Stage 1; for a tool description paper, this<br>\ncould, e.g., be done by motivating the tool with a Stage 1 problem, and<br>\nsketching how the tool could, or will, be applied in this domain.  Each<br>\nsubmission will be refereed by three PC members on average.  Submissions<br>\nwill be judged based on the PC's views of the likelihood of contributing<br>\nto a better matching of hammers (formalisation and verification tools) to<br>\nnails (domain problems).</p>\n<p>At this stage we accept PDF submissions in any layout but count 1200 words<br>\nas one page for fair comparison.  We invite research and position papers,<br>\nas well as tool and system descriptions, from 3 to 10 pages.  Besides PDFs<br>\nwe invite the submission of formalised knowledge representations with<br>\nhuman-readable annotations.</p>\n<p>To submit a paper, please go to the Do-Form EasyChair page<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=doform2013\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=doform2013</a>) and follow the<br>\ninstructions there.</p>\n<p>FINAL VERSIONS</p>\n<p>Final versions should be prepared in LaTeX according to the AISB<br>\nformatting guidelines linked from the symposium homepage.  For the final<br>\nversion, non-PDF submissions should be accompanied by a PDF abstract of 2<br>\nto 4 pages.  Electronic proceedings (with an ISBN) will be made available<br>\nto the convention delegates on a memory stick, and on the AISB website.</p>\n<p>Given a sufficient number of high-quality submissions, we will invite<br>\nauthors to submit revised and extended versions to a SPECIAL ISSUE of a<br>\nrelevant JOURNAL.  (E.g., co-chair Manfred Kerber is on the editorial<br>\nboard of Mathematics in Computer Science.)</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>* Pre-Submission (Stage 1): 10 December 2012<br>\n    * Stage 1 Submissions and Comments online: 14 December 2012<br>\n    * Regular Submission (Stage 2): 14 January 2013<br>\n    * Notification: 11 February 2013<br>\n    * Final versions due: 4 March 2013<br>\n    * Symposium: 2-5 April 2013 (days to be fixed)</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>1.
