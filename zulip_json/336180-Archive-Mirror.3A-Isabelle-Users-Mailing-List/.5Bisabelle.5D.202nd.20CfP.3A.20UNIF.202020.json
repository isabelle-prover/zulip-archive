Unification is<br>\nconcerned with the problem of making two terms equal, finding solutions<br>\nfor equations or making formulas equivalent. It is a fundamental process<br>\nused in a number of fields of computer science, including automated<br>\nreasoning, term rewriting, logic programming, natural language<br>\nprocessing, program analysis, types, etc. Traditionally, the scope of<br>\nthe UNIF workshops has covered the topic of unification in a broad<br>\nsense. Topics of interest to this forum include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>- Unification algorithms, calculi and implementations</p>\n<p>- Equational unification and unification modulo theories</p>\n<p>- Admissibility of Inference Rules</p>\n<p>- Unification in modal, fuzzy, temporal and description logics</p>\n<p>- Anti-unification/generalization</p>\n<p>- Semi-unification</p>\n<p>- Narrowing</p>\n<p>- Formalization of unification</p>\n<p>- Matching Problems</p>\n<p>- Applications</p>\n<p>- Unification in Special Theories</p>\n<p>- Higher-Order Unification</p>\n<p>- Combination problems</p>\n<p>- Constraint Solving</p>\n<p>- Disunification</p>\n<p>- Complexity Issues</p>\n<p>- Type Checking and reconstruction</p>\n<p>The International Workshop on Unification (UNIF) is a yearly forum for<br>\nresearchers in unification theory and related fields to meet old and new<br>\ncolleagues, to present recent (even unfinished) work, and to discuss new<br>\nideas and trends. It is also a good opportunity for young researchers<br>\nand scientists working in related areas to get an overview of the state<br>\nof the art in unification theory.</p>\n<p>The 34th International Workshop on Unification is part of \"Paris Nord<br>\nSummer of LoVe 2020\", a joint event on LOgic and VErification at<br>\nUniversité Paris 13, made of Petri Nets 2020, IJCAR 2020, FSCD 2020, and<br>\nover 20 satellite events. UNIF 2020 will be a satellite workshop of The<br>\nInternational Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR 2020).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>** Submission Instructions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Following the tradition of UNIF, we call for submissions of abstracts (5<br>\npages) in EasyChair style, to be submitted electronically as PDF through<br>\nthe EasyChair submission site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2020\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2020</a></p>\n<p>Abstracts will be evaluated by the Programme Committee (if necessary<br>\nwith support from external reviewers) regarding their significance for<br>\nthe workshop. We will allow work presented/submitted in/to another<br>\nconference.</p>\n<p>Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop and included in the<br>\ninformal proceedings of the workshop, available in electronic form as a<br>\ntechnical report in the RISC-Linz Report Series from the Research<br>\nInstitute for Symbolic Computation, Johannes Kepler University.</p>\n<p>Based on the number and quality of submissions we will decide whether to<br>\norganize a special journal issue.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>** Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission of titles and abstracts: April 13, 2020</p>\n<p>Submission of full paper:  April 20, 2020</p>\n<p>Author notification: May 25, 2020</p>\n<p>Camera-ready papers: June 8, 2020</p>\n<p>UNIF 2020: June 29, 2020 (online format)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>** Invited Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Stéphanie Delaune (CNRS, IRISA)</p>\n<p>Manfred Schmidt-Schauß (Goethe-University Frankfurt)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>** Program Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Mauricio Ayala-Rincon (Universidade de Brasilía)</p>\n<p>Franz Baader (TU Dresden)</p>\n<p>Alexander Baumgartner (University of Chile)</p>\n<p>Evelyne Contejean (LRI, CNRS, Univ Paris-Sud, Orsay)</p>\n<p>Daniel Dougherty (Worcester Polytechnic Institute)</p>\n<p>Besik Dundua (Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University)</p>\n<p>Serdar Erbatur (University of Texas at Dallas)</p>\n<p>Santiago Escobar (Universitat Politècnica de València)</p>\n<p>Maribel Fernandez (King's College London)</p>\n<p>Silvio Ghilardi (Università degli Studi di Milano)</p>\n<p>Pascual Julian-Iranzo (University of Castilla-La Mancha)</p>\n<p>Temur Kutsia (RISC, Johannes Kepler University Linz) co-chair</p>\n<p>Jordi Levy (IIIA - CSIC)</p>\n<p>Christopher Lynch (Clarkson University)</p>\n<p>Andrew M.
