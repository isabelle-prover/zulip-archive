It aspires to be a lively environment for<br>\npresenting the latest research results, and other contributions (see<br>\nbelow). Authors of draft papers will be invited to submit revised<br>\npapers based on the feedback receive at the symposium.  A<br>\npost-symposium refereeing process will then select a subset of these<br>\narticles for formal publication.</p>\n<p>TFP 2017 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming<br>\nevents. TFP 2017 will be accompanied by the International Workshop on<br>\nTrends in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE), which will take<br>\nplace on 22 June.</p>\n<p>The TFP symposium is the heir of the successful series of Scottish<br>\nFunctional Programming Workshops. Previous TFP symposia were held in</p>\n<p>* Edinburgh (Scotland) in 2003;<br>\n    * Munich (Germany) in 2004;<br>\n    * Tallinn (Estonia) in 2005;<br>\n    * Nottingham (UK) in 2006;<br>\n    * New York (USA) in 2007;<br>\n    * Nijmegen (The Netherlands) in 2008;<br>\n    * Komarno (Slovakia) in 2009;<br>\n    * Oklahoma (USA) in 2010;<br>\n    * Madrid (Spain) in 2011;<br>\n    * St. Andrews (UK) in 2012;<br>\n    * Provo (Utah, USA) in 2013;<br>\n    * Soesterberg (The Netherlands) in 2014;<br>\n    * Inria Sophia-Antipolis (France) in 2015;<br>\n    * and Maryland (USA) in 2016.<br>\nFor further general information about TFP please see the TFP homepage.<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.tifp.org/\">http://www.tifp.org/</a>).</p>\n<p>== SCOPE ==</p>\n<p>The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various<br>\nroutes.  As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore<br>\nidentify the following five article categories. High-quality articles<br>\nare solicited in any of these categories:</p>\n<p>Research Articles: leading-edge, previously unpublished research work<br>\nPosition Articles: on what new trends should or should not be<br>\nProject Articles: descriptions of recently started new projects<br>\nEvaluation Articles: what lessons can be drawn from a finished project<br>\nOverview Articles: summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject</p>\n<p>Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for<br>\npublication to any other forum. They may consider any aspect of<br>\nfunctional programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or<br>\nexperience-oriented.  Applications of functional programming<br>\ntechniques to other languages are also within the scope of the<br>\nsymposium.</p>\n<p>Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing<br>\n      Functional programming in the cloud<br>\n      High performance functional computing<br>\n      Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs<br>\n      Dependently typed functional programming<br>\n      Validation and verification of functional programs<br>\n      Debugging and profiling for functional languages<br>\n      Functional programming in different application areas:<br>\n        security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded<br>\n        systems, global computing, grids, etc.<br>\n      Interoperability with imperative programming languages<br>\n      Novel memory management techniques<br>\n      Program analysis and transformation techniques<br>\n      Empirical performance studies<br>\n      Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages<br>\n      (Embedded) domain specific languages<br>\n      New implementation strategies<br>\n      Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area</p>\n<p>If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of<br>\nTFP, please contact the TFP 2017 program chairs, Scott Owens and Meng Wang.</p>\n<p>== BEST PAPER AWARDS ==</p>\n<p>To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper<br>\naccepted for the formal proceedings.</p>\n<p>TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students,<br>\nacknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new<br>\nsubject trends. A student paper is one for which the authors state<br>\nthat the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are listed<br>\nas first authors, and a student would present the paper. A prize for<br>\nthe best student paper is awarded each year.</p>\n<p>In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the<br>\nbest paper happens to be a student paper, that paper will then receive<br>\nboth prizes.</p>\n<p>== PAPER SUBMISSIONS ==</p>\n<p>Acceptance of articles for presentation at the symposium is based on a<br>\nlightweight peer review process of extended abstracts (4 to 10 pages<br>\nin length) or full papers (20 pages). The submission must clearly<br>\nindicate which category it belongs to: research, position, project,<br>\nevaluation, or overview paper. It should also indicate which authors<br>\nare research students, and whether the main author(s) are students.  A<br>\ndraft paper for which ALL authors are students will receive additional<br>\nfeedback by one of the PC members shortly after the symposium has<br>\ntaken place.</p>\n<p>We use EasyChair for the refereeing process. Papers must be submitted at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp17\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp17</a></p>\n<p>Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS<br>\nstyle.
