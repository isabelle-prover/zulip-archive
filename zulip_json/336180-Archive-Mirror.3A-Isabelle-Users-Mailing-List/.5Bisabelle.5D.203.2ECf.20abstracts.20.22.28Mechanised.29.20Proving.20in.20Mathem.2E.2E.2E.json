August 2015: conference in Győr</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Aims and scope:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The minisymposion intends to discuss usability of technology <br>\napplications in education in relation to proving and primarily focuses <br>\non a specific technology, Computer Theorem Proving (TP), for education <br>\nin academia and beyond. The proposal is backed by increasing interest in <br>\ntechnology integration in education to support proofs as well as the <br>\napplications of TP. The completion of the TP-based proof of the Kepler <br>\nConjecture was announced on August 10th, 2014.</p>\n<p>TP is reliably grounded on formal calculus — whereas proof is not taught<br>\nas a formal calculus in general academic education. Rather, students <br>\nadopt the habits of their academic environment and copy the way of <br>\nproving from their academic teachers. Evidently this results in a lack <br>\nof confidence for most students and in a lack of control of what they <br>\nare doing. High-school seems affected by these academic traditions such, <br>\nthat proof is considered too comprehensive for most students in spite of <br>\ncurricula explicitly mentioning mathematical proof.</p>\n<p>The Minisymposion presents experiences from courses supported by <br>\ntechnology applications in relation to proving and TP technology at <br>\nacademia and at high-school throughout Europe. A major point of <br>\ndiscussion will be the issue to narrow the gap between high-school math <br>\nand academic mathematics in Science, Technology and Engineering (STEM) <br>\neducation. In particular, the (planned/envisioned) use of existing TP <br>\nsoftware systems in an educational setting or concrete plans for <br>\n(future/desired) educational TP software systems should be demonstrated <br>\nwith the aim to get a common view on the requirements for such systems <br>\nthat would make them widely accepted teaching tools.</p>\n<p>This minisymposion is motivated by the hope that bottom-up approaches in<br>\nlocal cooperation might be more successful than pretentious top-down<br>\napproaches to the sensible, but important topic. For preparing <br>\ndiscussions we invite submission of abstracts (at most 3 pages) on <br>\ntopics including, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Demonstration of tools supporting proofs and using TP technology,<br>\n   i.e. tools which generate assumptions, which interactively or<br>\n   automatically perform proofs, which systematically generate proof<br>\n   obligations, which use TP for checking user input, etc.<br>\n   (... called \"TP-based\" software in the sequel)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experiences from academic courses of various kinds using TP-based<br>\n   software --- probably including feature requests for future<br>\n   development of such software</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of mathematics and mathematical activities which might<br>\n   specifically take advantage from support by TP-based software</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mathematical concepts and (TP-based) technology specifically<br>\n   relevant for software support in teaching and learning to prove</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experiences from initiatives and activities filling the gap between<br>\n   school and university --- and their relation to TP-based technology.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sunbmssion:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For abstract submission (at most 3 pages) see the website<br>\n<a href=\"http://bolyai.hu/aushun15/registration.html\">http://bolyai.hu/aushun15/registration.html</a></p>\n<p>Since on the mini-symposia there will be only invited talks, <br>\ncontributors of abstracts will get an invitation in July.</p>\n<p>Hungarian-Austrian Program Committee:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Kristóf Fenyvesi, Univ.
