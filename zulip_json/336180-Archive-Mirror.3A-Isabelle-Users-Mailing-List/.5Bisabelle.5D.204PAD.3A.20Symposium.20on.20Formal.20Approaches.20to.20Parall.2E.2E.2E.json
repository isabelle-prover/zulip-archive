Submitted paper must not have been published<br>\nor simultaneously submitted elsewhere until it appears in HPCS proceedings,<br>\nin the case of acceptance, or notified otherwise. For Regular papers,<br>\nplease submit a PDF copy of your full manuscript, not to exceed 8 double-column<br>\nformatted pages per template, and include up to 6 keywords and an abstract of<br>\nno more than 400 words. Additional pages will be charged additional fee. Submission<br>\nshould include a cover page with authors' names, affiliation addresses, fax numbers,<br>\nphone numbers, and all authors email addresses. Please, indicate clearly the<br>\ncorresponding author(s) although all authors are equally responsible for the manuscript.<br>\nShort papers (up to 4 pages), poster papers and posters<br>\n(please refer to <a href=\"http://hpcs2019.cisedu.info/1-call-for-papers-and-participation/call-for-posters\">http://hpcs2019.cisedu.info/1-call-for-papers-and-participation/call-for-posters</a><br>\nfor posters submission details) will also be considered. Please specify the type of<br>\nsubmission you have. Please include page numbers on all preliminary submissions to make<br>\nit easier for reviewers to provide helpful comments. </p>\n<p>=====================================================</p>\n<p>Submit a PDF copy of your full manuscript to the symposium paper submission site at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=4pad2019\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=4pad2019</a>.</p>\n<p>=====================================================</p>\n<p>Proceedings</p>\n<p>Accepted papers will be published in the Conference proceedings. Instructions for<br>\nfinal manuscript format and requirements will be posted on the HPCS 2019 Conference<br>\nweb site. It is our intent to have the proceedings formally published in hard and soft<br>\ncopies and be available at the time of the conference. The proceedings is projected to<br>\nbe included in the IEEE or ACM Digital Library and indexed in all major indexing services<br>\naccordingly. </p>\n<p>SPECIAL ISSUE</p>\n<p>Plans are underway to have the best papers, in extended version, selected for possible<br>\npublication in a reputable journal as special issue. Detailed information will soon be<br>\nannounced and will be made available on the conference website. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, it is confirmed that after the 4PAD symposium, authors of selected papers will<br>\nbe invited to submitted extended version of their papers for possible publication in a special<br>\nissue of the Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming<br>\n(JLAMP, <a href=\"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming\">https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming</a>).  </p>\n<p>If you have any questions about paper submission or the symposium, please contact the symposium organizers.</p>",
