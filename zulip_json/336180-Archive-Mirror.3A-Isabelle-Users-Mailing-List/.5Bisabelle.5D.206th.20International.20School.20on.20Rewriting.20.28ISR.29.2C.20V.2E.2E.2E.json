It has strong links <br>\nwith mathematics, algebra, and logic, and it is the basis of <br>\nwell-known programming paradigms like functional and equational <br>\nprogramming, which are taught at the universitary level in many <br>\ncountries. In these programming paradigms and corresponding <br>\nlanguages, the notions of reduction, pattern matching, <br>\nconfluence, termination, strategy, etc., are essential. <br>\nRewriting provides a solid framework for understanding, using, <br>\nand teaching all these notions. Rewriting techniques are also <br>\nused in many other areas of software engineering (scripting, <br>\nprototyping, automated transformation of legacy systems, <br>\nrefactoring, web services, etc.) and are implemented in popular <br>\nsystems like Mathematica, Autocad, and others. Rewriting <br>\ntechniques play a relevant role in computing research, <br>\neducation, and industry.</p>\n<p>Two tracks are offered, including the lectures and the courses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Track A: for newcomers in the field, or just for people <br>\n          who want to obtain a new, updated exposure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jose Meseguer.
