Because this mechanical verification was<br>\nperformed using Isabelle (and because I've mentioned it previously on<br>\nthis list) I thought people here might be interested in a link to it:<br>\n<a href=\"http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/2315\">http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/2315</a><br>\nThe full text of the thesis is freely downloadable, as well as<br>\nsupplementary files, which include all my .thy files.</p>\n<p>As explained in the thesis, I ended up using Isabelle 2009--2, but I do<br>\nintend to update the files to work with the latest version of Isabelle,<br>\nand then submit at least some of them to AFP.</p>\n<p>Because of busyness leading up to the deposit of my thesis, and a<br>\nfour-week overseas trip in July, there are a lot of messages sent to<br>\nthis list that I haven't read (763 right now), but I think I've read all<br>\nthe ones containing the word \"geometry\".  I might try to catch up over<br>\ntime, but in the meantime, I mightn't be fully up to date, and if you<br>\nwant to draw something to my attention, it's probably best to CC it to<br>\nme, rather than assuming I'll see what you post to the list.</p>\n<p>Tim<br>\n&lt;&gt;&lt;<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/NkSxGugPEuV4rBQtSswJSBfR/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
