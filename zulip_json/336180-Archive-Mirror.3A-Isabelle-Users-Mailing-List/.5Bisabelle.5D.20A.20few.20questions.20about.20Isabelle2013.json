IS IT STAYING THERE?</p>\n<p>In Isabelle 2013, nothing has changed in regards to \\&lt;^isub&gt;, \\&lt;^isup&gt;, <br>\n\\&lt;^sub&gt;, and \\&lt;^sup&gt;. Are \\&lt;^sub&gt; and \\&lt;^sup&gt; (or something equivalent) <br>\ngoing to stay in Isar forever, or are they going away? If they're not <br>\ngoing away, I'll use them exclusively for the markup I talked about <br>\npreviously. If they're going away, I won't use them at all.</p>\n<p>Comment: The symbols tab is a nice addition. I had a THY that listed all <br>\nthe symbols, but the symbols tab is even better. Things are gettin' down <br>\nright graphical, which they already were.</p>\n<p>HOW DO I GET MY SHORTCUTS IN THE NEW JEDIT?</p>\n<p>I copied over my \".isabelle\\Isabelle2012\\jedit\\properties\" to the folder <br>\n\".isabelle\\Isabelle_11-Jan-2013\\jedit\", and it configured most <br>\neverything, but my shortcuts don't get activated. I look in the <br>\n\"properties\" file, and I see my shortcuts in there, but they aren't used <br>\nin \"Global Options / Shortcuts\".</p>\n<p>If I manually add a shortcut for an entry that's in the \"properties\" <br>\nfile, such as for</p>\n<p>+jm..markup/mu__ncx__newthm_counter_example.shortcut=A+j m n c x</p>\n<p>jEdit writes the same exact entry to the \"properties\" files.</p>\n<p>Anyone know how to get jEdit to use all my shortcuts in the \"properties\" <br>\nfile?</p>\n<p>NORTON QUARANTINES POLY.EXE</p>\n<p>Norton quarantines \"contrib\\polyml-5.5.0\\x86-cygwin\\poly.exe\", but it <br>\nstarted doing that with Isabelle 2012. With Isabelle 2013, it gives me a <br>\nerror message that it didn't give me before about not being able to find <br>\nthe file. Users in the future should be aware of that. I just <br>\nunquarantine poly.exe, and know that it's going to happen when it gets <br>\nrun for the first time on a computer on which I run Norton.</p>\n<p>SMT PROOFS DON'T RUN THAT RAN BEFORE, AND SLEDGEHAMMER WAS FIRST HAVING <br>\nPROBLEMS</p>\n<p>I saw on the developers list that SMT causes problems, so that answered <br>\nmy question about whether I should use SMT proofs. The reason I had a <br>\ncouple is because they were about 4 times faster than the metis proofs <br>\nthat were found.</p>\n<p>Sledgehammer wasn't working correctly at first. It wasn't updating the <br>\noutput window. It was possibly related to me trying to run it on the <br>\ntheorems that had the SMT proofs that didn't work anymore. At some <br>\npoint, after trying different options on different theorems, <br>\nSledgehammer started working.</p>\n<p>COMMENTS CONTENT IS PICKIER</p>\n<p>I got several errors I didn't get before for stuff that was in comments. <br>\nI found what it was that made the comments happy.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nGB</p>",

What you need is to <br>\nget in their database of legitimate programs.
