When someone contributes too much, the effects may be counterproductive. Here is a paper about it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X12002219\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X12002219</a></p>\n<p>Shared via the Google app</p>\n<p>So, the golden rule of a mailing list is: just write about the subject and do not contribute in an excessive way. After this link, I suggest to avoid any other email in the mailing list that is not about the subject Isabelle. If someone is interested in communication with the moderator, ok, just write to the moderator, not to all the members.</p>\n<p>Sincerely yours,<br>\nJosé M.</p>\n<p>Sent from my iPhone</p>",
