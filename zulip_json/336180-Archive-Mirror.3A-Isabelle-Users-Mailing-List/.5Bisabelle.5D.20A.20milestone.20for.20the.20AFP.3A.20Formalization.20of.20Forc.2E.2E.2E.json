It’s a formalisation of forcing, building on my own ZF-Constructible development from nearly two decades ago. Working in Isabelle/ZF is tough (no sledgehammer, no nitpick, not even linarith), so this is doubly impressive!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We formalize the theory of forcing in the set theory framework of Isabelle/ZF. Under the assumption of the existence of a countable transitive model of ZFC, we construct a proper generic extension and show that the latter also satisfies ZFC.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Forcing.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Forcing.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
