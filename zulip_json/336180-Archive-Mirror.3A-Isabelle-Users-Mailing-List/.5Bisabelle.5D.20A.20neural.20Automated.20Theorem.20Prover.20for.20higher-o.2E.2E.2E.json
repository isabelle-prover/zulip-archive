For<br>\nIsabelle, check the recent work (Pamper) of Yutaka Nagashima. For neural<br>\nattempts, Sarah Loos is working on a neural system similar to TacticToe for<br>\nHOL Light (probably unpublished yet, but maybe there are some slides from<br>\nthe AITP conference - check there for more).</p>\n<p>In the FOL ATP world there is a neural guided E prover by Sarah et al.,<br>\nENIGMA by Jan Jakubuv et al., and rlCoP (reinforcement learning connection<br>\nprover) by Cezary Kaliszyk et al.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nJosef</p>",
