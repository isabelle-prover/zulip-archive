Hence I hope that in the<br>\nlong run bit and word types and operations can take place in two<br>\ntheories in HOL-Library, which HOL-Word that just builds upon; we will<br>\nsee which applications then still need full HOL-Word.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ZzVePB5PrKnLB91GUKEkko9s/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",

In fact the primary purpose of the reorganization was to<br>\nunderstand what the fundamental concepts are and group the material<br>\naccordingly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m also happy to help with testing later changes and be involved in the content evolution of HOL-Word.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My aim is to leave HOL-Word.Word more or less »as it is«, but basing it<br>\non newly emerging theories; this would allow to gradually find out which<br>\nparts of HOL-Word.Word are obsolete for particular applications without<br>\nendangering those that still need it.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/K4RdL7MUtGdQgWZ3xvzYa4dC/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
