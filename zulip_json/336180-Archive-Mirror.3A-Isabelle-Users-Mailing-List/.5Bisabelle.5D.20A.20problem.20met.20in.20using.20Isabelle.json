Whenever I write some now definition or add some code to current file, Isabelle hangs and stops compilation, and after a pretty long time, it then continuous to work. I have never met such problem before for the previous version of Isabelle/HOL. What should I do for solving this problem?</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nShuling Wang</p>",
