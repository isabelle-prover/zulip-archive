Although this is important, it will not stop the exponential growth of the pandemic. Notice that the number of medical doctors is at most constant (it decrease each time a medical doctor gets ill). Hence, it will be inevitable that the number of patients will be a lot larger than the number of medical doctors available.</p>\n<p>My approach to this problem, from a computational perspective, is to provide parallel medical diagnosis and treatment to the population. Which technology is better in order to archive this goal? A proof assistant? Artificial Intelligence? Probabilistic programming? The answer is: better to have something than nothing.</p>\n<p>In order to avoid self-medication, the people who distribute the medication could use the software in order to check if someone needs the medication or not.</p>\n<p>Of course, if such software or library will be created, it needs to be supervised by a medical doctor.</p>\n<p>Kind regards,<br>\nJosé M.</p>",

First, I would like to describe the crisis and then I will explain how proof assistants could be useful in order to solve some of the problems, but not all.</p>\n<p>Description of the problem. A highly contagious virus produces an overload in the health system because there are a lot more patients than medical doctors (the number of patients increases in an exponential way, whereas more and more medical doctors become patients). Consequently, there are many patients who have no access to a medical doctor or even if they have access to the medical doctor it is during a brief period of time and the diagnosis/treatment is so quickly that there is a high probability of human mistake. The diagnosis/treatment is not just to decide whether or not a patient has COVID-19, but also to know what to do concerning the interaction between the COVID-19 and the medical history of the patient, among other technicalities.</p>\n<p>Proposal for a partial solution: To develop a user-friendly library in Isabelle in order to allow the user to introduce the parameters of his/her physiological data, e.g., temperature, blood pressure, the result of a blood test, in order to be able to make a computer-generated diagnosis. The diagnosis will be a series of lemmas about the probability of some medical condition and the treatment will be a series of lemmas about the probability that some treatment will be correct for this patient. Such a project should be developed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of computer scientists, statisticians and, more important, professional medical doctors (they are the ones that will decide whether or not the library could be used in patients, without them, the project should not be done).</p>\n<p>Toy model example.</p>\n<p>Parameters:<br>\nTemperature = x, blood preassure = y, blood test 1 = u, blood test 2 = v<br>\n(* delete the letter and write the values of the parameters * )</p>\n<p>lemma diagnosis1: The probability that the patient has the illness A is more than 95%.<br>\nsorry (* delete \"sorry\" and write \"sledgehammer\" * )</p>\n<p>lemma treatment1: The probability that the patient need to take medicament B is more than 95%.<br>\nsorry (* delete \"sorry\" and write \"sledgehammer\" * )</p>\n<p>Personally, I am not interested in being part of such a problem, because my current research takes all my time. Nevertheless, I think that this approach may be helpful for public health in case of situations like the one described above. Even after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, to have such a library to the disposal of the public may be useful in case another pandemic appears.</p>\n<p>Sincerely yours,<br>\nJosé M.</p>",
