(Note that the scope of the<br>\nexistential quantifier extends all the way to the end of the formula.)</p>\n<p>ax2 is actually a theorem (for any functions h and g, regardless of<br>\nax1).  Proof: simply choose some x that is <em>not</em> a strict global maximum<br>\nof h, then the implication becomes vacuously true.</p>\n<p>So you're trying to show that g has a root, provided that h has a strict<br>\nglobal maximum.  Well, it's no surprise you can't find a proof ...</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nTjark</p>",
