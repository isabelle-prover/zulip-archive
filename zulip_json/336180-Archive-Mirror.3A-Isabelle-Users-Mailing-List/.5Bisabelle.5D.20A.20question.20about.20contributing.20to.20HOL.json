I have read the section \"Publish contributions as an<br>\nexternal\" on the Isabelle community wiki (<br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community/Publish_contributions_as_an_external\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/community/Publish_contributions_as_an_external</a>).<br>\nI am also aware of the mailing list <a href=\"mailto:isabelle-dev@in.tum.de\">isabelle-dev@in.tum.de</a>. However, this<br>\nis a general question about the possibility of a contribution being<br>\nconsidered, given certain specific circumstances. Thus, I believe that it<br>\nmay be more useful to this mailing list, rather than <a href=\"mailto:isabelle-dev@in.tum.de\">isabelle-dev@in.tum.de</a>.<br>\nOtherwise, of course, please suggest to forward it to <a href=\"mailto:isabelle-dev@in.tum.de\">isabelle-dev@in.tum.de</a><br>\n.</p>\n<p>My primary concern is that I am not affiliated with an academic group or a<br>\ncompany that works with Isabelle/HOL on a regular basis. I have an<br>\nimpression that all of the existing contributions to HOL were made by<br>\npeople who are, somehow, officially affiliated with the Isabelle community.<br>\nThus, I would like to assess whether or not my contributions would be<br>\nconsidered on this basis. Of course, I am also aware of the existence of<br>\nthe AFP. However, I believe, some of the theorems that I would like to<br>\npropose naturally extend some of the theories that are already available in<br>\nHOL and, most likely, are not suitable to be published as an independent<br>\nAFP library.</p>\n<p>To be more specific, I would like to provide several examples of the<br>\ncontributions that I would like to propose.  At the moment, HOL-Algebra<br>\ncontains the theory IntRing.thy that contains the lemmas \"ZFact_zero:<br>\n\"carrier (ZFact 0) = (‚ãÉa. {{a}})\"\" and \"ZFact_one: \"carrier (ZFact 1) =<br>\n{UNIV}\"\". However, it does not seem to contain a lemma that could describe<br>\nthe carrier of a more general quotient ring \"ZFact (m::int)\" (e.g. \"0 &lt; m<br>\n‚üπ carrier (ZFact m) = {X. ‚àÉn ‚àà {0..&lt;m}. X = {x. m dvd (x - n)}}\"). Also, I<br>\nwas not able to find a relatively standard textbook theorem that<br>\ncharacterises a cyclic group in terms of the quotient group \"add_monoid<br>\n(ZFact m)\" (e.g. \"finite (carrier G) ‚üπ order G = m ‚üπ ‚àÉa ‚àà carrier G.<br>\ncarrier G = {a[^]i | i::int. i ‚àà UNIV} ‚üπ add_monoid (ZFact m) ‚âÖ G\"). Some<br>\nof the potential contributions are not independent theorems, but minor<br>\nextensions of the existing lemmas in \"HOL\", e.g. lemma \"ord_dvd_pow_eq_1\"<br>\nin \"Algebra-Multiplicative_Group\" shows that  \"finite (carrier G)\", \"a ‚àà<br>\ncarrier G\" and \"a [^] k = ùü≠\" together imply \"ord a dvd k\", where \"k\" is of<br>\nthe type \"nat\". However, this lemma holds even if \"k\" is any number of the<br>\ntype \"int\" (the existing proof would need to be amended to take into<br>\naccount the negative values of k).</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n<p>(I would prefer not to disclose my contact details publicly for the reasons<br>\nof privacy and as a measure against spam)</p>",

For<br>\ninstance, we already have one of the mentioned theorems you were looking<br>\nfor: it is the lemma mod_ring from the theory Int_Ring (note the underline)<br>\nstated as</p>\n<p>lemma (in int_ring) mod_ring:</p>\n<p>assumes \"a ‚àà carrier R - { ùü¨ }\"</p>\n<p>shows \"carrier (R Quot (PIdl a)) = (Œªi.

We also have a theory called Multiplicative_Group_Revised where I<br>\nstarted an analogous development of Multiplicative_Group but more concise<br>\nsince it reuses previous developments from cycles and permutations.</p>\n<p>Other than that, there are theories on algebraic numbers, field extensions<br>\nand division of polynomials. Our most impressive result is the existence of<br>\nthe algebraic closure of a field.

I am glad that it is potentially possible for me<br>\nto make contributions to HOL. However, of course, given that potentially<br>\nanyone can make a contribution, it would be nice if there was a<br>\nwell-established process for making contributions.</p>\n<p>To Paulo Em√≠lio de Vilhena,</p>\n<p>Thank you for your response and for providing the link to the repository<br>\nGaloisCVC4. I have several questions about the repository:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I would like to confirm that, while the main purpose of the project<br>\nGaloisCVC4 is the development of Galois Theory in the context of<br>\nHOL-Algebra, you are also making changes to HOL-Algebra that are not<br>\ndirectly related to the main line of the development of the project<br>\nGaloisCVC4, i.e. you may consider adding to the repository any established<br>\nresults from algebra or making minor amendments/extensions of the existing<br>\ntheorems that do not contribute to the main line of the development.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Furthermore, I would like to understand if your intention is to<br>\nintegrate GaloisCVC4 with HOL-Algebra or publish it in the context of the<br>\nAFP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Also, I would like to understand if you intend to discontinue the work<br>\non the project after a certain deadline or after you achieve certain<br>\nmilestones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If my understanding of the dual purpose (see clause 1) of the project<br>\nGaloisCVC4 is correct, would you, potentially, accept pull requests from<br>\nexternal contributors?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, thank you for pointing out the existence of the (Isabelle)<br>\ngeneralisation of the proof of the characterisation of the carrier of Z/mZ.<br>\nI only wish I knew about the existence of GaloisCVC4 earlier.</p>\n<p>To Jos√© Manuel Rodriguez Caballero,</p>\n<p>Thank you for your reply and for providing the link to your repository. It<br>\nis good to know about the existence of this repository because it seems<br>\nthat there is no mention of it in the AFP at the moment (although I cannot<br>\nbe entirely certain). The lemmas that I have mentioned in my question may<br>\nfit within the context of the repository. However, they are also very<br>\nclosely related to the existing Isabelle theories within HOL-Algebra, as<br>\nconfirmed by Paulo Em√≠lio de Vilhena, who has already proven a<br>\ngeneralisation of one of the theorems that I mentioned in my question in<br>\nthe context of an ongoing development of HOL-Algebra (unfortunately, I was<br>\nnot aware of this development before asking the question). Regardless, if<br>\npossible, I would appreciate if you could reconfirm that potentially you<br>\ncould accept pull requests from external contributors. Nevertheless, I have<br>\nto admit, that it is unlikely that I will produce any further proofs of<br>\nresults that are related to number theory in the near future.</p>\n<p>With regard to non-technical part of your answer, previously, I used a<br>\npseudonym xanonec on this mailing list. I also use it on Stack Overflow.<br>\nHowever, it seems that mailing-list-anonymous is slightly more<br>\n'professional' in some sense. Also, I am only trying to hide my real<br>\ncontact details/identity from third parties (especially spam lists/online<br>\nscam/etc). There is a good reason why there is a variety of privacy<br>\nsettings available on the websites like LinkedIn and Facebook and it is<br>\npossible to control who can see your posts/profile/personal information.<br>\nHowever, unfortunately, mailing lists do not provide such options and,<br>\nfurthermore, all posts can be found via Google. In general, I prefer the<br>\nwebsite Stack Overflow to mailing lists. However, it seems that Isabelle<br>\ncommunity is not very active on Stack Overflow, because some of the<br>\nquestions that I tried to ask there were left without a reply/comments for<br>\ndays. Nevertheless, I was able to obtain a reply to the same questions<br>\nusing this mailing list within hours.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",

While my goal was the development of Galois<br>\n   Theory, the project was actually born as an attempt from me and Martin<br>\n   Baillon to reduce the amount of changes to HOL-Algebra we were both making<br>\n   independently.<br>\n   2.</p>\n<p>The idea is to integrate the material which could be considerate as<br>\n   fundamental to any development in algebra and publish in the context of the<br>\n   AFP more specific material. We already have a big part of our material in<br>\n   the library and recent releases of Isabelle will come with some of my<br>\n   revised theories and sophisticated tricks such as Weak_Morphisms.thy.<br>\n   3.</p>\n<p>The project was the subject of an internship in the ALEXANDRIA team,<br>\n   supervised by Larry Paulson. The internship is already over and it is not<br>\n   being trivial to find time to work on the project, but I do intend to<br>\n   continue. The Galois correspondence theorem is certainly a milestone, but<br>\n   there is a lot of work to be done on the library itself. I think it‚Äôs<br>\n   preferable to progress horizontally in a proper way than to quickly prove<br>\n   profound statements in a formalism that nobody will be able to use.<br>\n   4.</p>\n<p>Contributions are welcome :) I‚Äôm quite jealous with my theories and<br>\n   proofs, I must say, but if you have well-founded contributions to make, I<br>\n   will probably accept. By well-founded I mean that it should have at least a<br>\n   minimal explanation on why such a modification would make sense. For the<br>\n   moment, there are two theories in need of revision/development that may<br>\n   interest you: Int_Ring.thy and Multiplicative_Group_Revised.thy. Int_Ring,<br>\n   because I think that talking about rings isomorphic to Z only complicate<br>\n   things and I did that to overcome a problem which does not exist anymore,<br>\n   so merging Int_Ring and IntRing is something desirable.<br>\n   Multiplicative_Group_Revised should just be continued.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I would like to thank you for your interest on the project, I hope<br>\nyou will be able to find and use what you need in GaloisCVC4.

Of course, it was not my intention to ask<br>\nwhether or not I am allowed to change or ignore any of the documented<br>\npractices for making a contribution to Isabelle/HOL. My primary concern was<br>\nwhether or not my contributions would be considered if I was to propose<br>\nthem while not working under the supervision of one of the existing regular<br>\nco-developers of Isabelle/HOL and while not being affiliated to a<br>\nresearch group that regularly works with Isabelle/HOL (at the moment,<br>\nIsabelle/HOL is merely one of my past-time hobbies). I believe that this<br>\nissue has not been documented anywhere. However, as I mentioned in my<br>\noriginal query, I formed an impression that all of the contributions to HOL<br>\nwere made by established academics in the areas of logic/formal<br>\nverification/mathematics or students working under their supervision. Thus,<br>\nI wanted to ensure that if I was going to make a proposal, it would not be<br>\nignored/rejected because of the aforementioned circumstances.</p>\n<p>As a side note, based on the replies given by Paulo Em√≠lio de Vilhena (see<br>\nbelow), if I decide to submit my contributions to the community, it is<br>\nlikely that I will try to do so indirectly through the repository<br>\nGaloisCVC4 (also, see the next section in my reply).</p>\n<p>To Makarius and Jos√© Manuel Rodriguez Caballero,</p>\n<p>I have no intention to hide my identity from the regular users of this<br>\nmailing list.

Luckily, at least, it is nearly impossible<br>\nto introduce errors/bugs in Isabelle theorems. If I will ever make an<br>\nattempt to make a contribution, then I will also make every attempt to<br>\nensure that it is either peripheral to the main line of the development or,<br>\nat least, it is very unlikely to have any negative impact on the main line<br>\nof the development. Of course, I would submit a pull request on GitHub and<br>\nyou are welcome to reject it if you decide that it is not suitable<br>\n(obviously, if you do decide to reject it, I will appreciate any<br>\nconstructive feedback).<br>\nIf there was an active issue tracker for the project, I would also be glad<br>\nto look into the problems that you would like to be solved, but you believe<br>\nthat they have a low priority (i.e. the problems that you would not want to<br>\nspend your time on). However, most certainly, I cannot guarantee my<br>\ncommitment (as I mentioned somewhere in this reply, at the moment,<br>\nIsabelle/HOL is merely one of my past-time hobbies). Thus, please do not<br>\nstart an issue tracker on my behalf :).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"I think that talking about rings isomorphic to Z only complicate<br>\nthings...\". I cannot imagine that anyone who is able to understand the<br>\ncontent of HOL-Algebra will not be able to specialise theorems in Int_Ring<br>\nto their needs. However, most certainly, it would be useful not to expect<br>\nthe users to specialise the results to Z in almost every individual library<br>\nthat uses Int_Ring (in all probability, Z would be a very common<br>\napplication of theorems in Int_Ring).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To Jos√© Manuel Rodriguez Caballero,</p>\n<p>Thank you for providing further information and for the confirmation that<br>\nyou may be able to accept pull requests.
