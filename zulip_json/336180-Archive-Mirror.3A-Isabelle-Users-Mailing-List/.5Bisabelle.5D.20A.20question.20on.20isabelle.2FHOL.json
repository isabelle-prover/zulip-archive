Now I am trying to use Isabelle/HOL in order to verify a<br>\nprotocol. I installed the proof general and other packages on linux. But any<br>\ntime I use it it shows me an error like,\" Unable to load header\" and<br>\n\"process isabelle exited abnormally with code 1\".<br>\nI searhed proof general documents and FAQ, but it couldn't help. Would you<br>\nplease guide me about the reason of this error and how I can solve it. It<br>\nwould be really kind of you as a professional to help a young student.</p>\n<p>Waiting eagerly your answer<br>\nwith all respects<br>\nMaryam Mouzarani</p>",
