The main<br>\nmechanism to vary that session context is what you see as option -d in<br>\n\"isabelle build\" or \"isabelle jedit\", or the \"dirs\" in Isabelle/Scala<br>\ninterfaces.</p>\n<p>Lets see what comes out of that, when we are finally standing there.<br>\nStay tuned and keep an eye on isabelle-dev ...</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

These did not originate in the AFP:<br>\nThey were developed outside, referencing the AFP using \"$AFP/Foo/Bar\",<br>\nas suggested in <a href=\"http://www.isa-afp.org/using.shtml\">http://www.isa-afp.org/using.shtml</a></p>\n<p>But when submitting them to the AFP, I have to change that to<br>\n\"../Foo/Bar\". From then on, when I want to merge changes from my<br>\nworking repository to the AFP and back, I have to keep changing that.</p>\n<p>An alternative would be to develop in the AFP repository, but that<br>\nfeels quite wrong.</p>\n<p>Another alternative is to add symbolic links to the used AFP entries to<br>\nthe directory above my current project. This works, but is also not<br>\nnice, as it clutters my \"projects\" directory.</p>\n<p>So I wonder: Is it not possible to device a way that allows the same<br>\ntheories to work inside the AFP and outside? Why is it that within the<br>\nAFP, $AFP cannot be set appropriately (to \"..\" if you want)?</p>\n<p>The reason for .. mentioned above is that \"it interacts correctly with<br>\nmultiple AFP installations side by side\". But would setting AFP=.., if<br>\none has to work with multiple installations, not do the same?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nJoachim<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/bQctU6ZZGz99GavQk48D7eqn/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",

But would setting AFP=.., if<br>\none has to work with multiple installations, not do the same?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately not. $AFP is set as part of the component setup in the AFP itself - so whichever AFP installation you mention last in the component initialisation setup will be the one $AFP refers to.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
