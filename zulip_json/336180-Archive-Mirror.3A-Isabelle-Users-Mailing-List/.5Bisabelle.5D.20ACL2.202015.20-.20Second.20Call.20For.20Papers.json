We invite<br>\nusers of ACL2, users of other theorem provers, and persons interested<br>\nin the applications of theorem proving technology to attend.  Keynote<br>\ntalks will be given by J Strother Moore and John O'Leary.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>Abstract submission:   May 26, 2015<br>\nPaper submission:      June  2, 2015<br>\nAuthor notification:   July 17, 2015<br>\nCamera ready:          August 17, 2015<br>\nWorkshop:              October 1-2, 2015</p>\n<p>AIMS AND SCOPE</p>\n<p>The ACL2 Workshop series is the major technical forum for users of the<br>\nACL2 theorem proving system to present research related to the ACL2<br>\ntheorem prover and its applications.  ACL2 is an industrial-strength<br>\nautomated reasoning system, the latest in the Boyer-Moore family of<br>\ntheorem provers.  The 2005 ACM Software System Award was awarded to<br>\nBoyer, Kaufmann, and Moore for their work in ACL2 and the other<br>\ntheorem provers in the Boyer-Moore family.</p>\n<p>ACL2 2015 is a two-day workshop to be held in Austin, Texas, USA, on<br>\nOctober 1-2, 2015.  It is the 13th in the series of ACL2 workshops,<br>\nwhich occur approximately every 18 months.  The workshop will feature<br>\ntechnical papers, invited talks, and rump sessions discussing ongoing<br>\nresearch.  We invite submissions of papers on any topic related to<br>\nACL2 and its applications, and we strongly encourage submissions<br>\nrelated to other theorem provers or formal methods that are of<br>\ninterest to the ACL2 community.  Suggested topics include but are not<br>\nlimited to new results in the following areas.</p>\n<p>* Software or hardware verification with ACL2<br>\n    * Formalizations of mathematics in ACL2<br>\n    * Libraries and tools for ACL2<br>\n    * User interfaces for ACL2<br>\n    * Novel uses of ACL2<br>\n    * Experiences with ACL2 in the classroom<br>\n    * Reports of and proposals for improvements of ACL2<br>\n    * Comparisons with other theorem provers<br>\n    * Comparisons with other programming or specification languages<br>\n    * Challenge problems and their solutions<br>\n    * Foundational issues related to ACL2<br>\n    * Implementations connecting ACL2 with other systems</p>\n<p>NOTE:</p>\n<p>Please see the website</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2015/index.html\">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2015/index.html</a></p>\n<p>for further information including paper submission, organization,<br>\nvenue, lodging, and eventually, registration and program information.</p>",
