ACL2 is an<br>\nindustrial-strength automated reasoning system, the latest in the<br>\nBoyer-Moore family of theorem provers.  The 2005 ACM Software System<br>\nAward was awarded to Boyer, Kaufmann, and Moore for their work in<br>\nACL2 and the other theorem provers in the Boyer-Moore family.</p>\n<p>ACL2-2018 is a two-day workshop to be held in Austin, Texas, USA, on<br>\nNovember 5-6, 2018, immediately after FMCAD<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.fmcad.org/FMCAD18\">http://www.fmcad.org/FMCAD18</a>), on the University of Texas campus.<br>\nIt is the 15th in the series of ACL2 workshops, which occur<br>\napproximately every 18 months.  The workshop will feature technical<br>\npapers as well as rump sessions that discuss ongoing research.</p>\n<p>There will be three invited keynote talks, given by:</p>\n<p>Sandip Ray, University of Florida at Gainesville<br>\nAlastair Reid, ARM<br>\nSol Swords, Centaur Technology</p>\n<p>We invite submissions of papers on any topic related to ACL2 and its<br>\napplications, and we strongly encourage submissions related to other<br>\ntheorem provers or formal methods that are of interest to the ACL2<br>\ncommunity.  Suggested topics include but are not limited to new<br>\nresults in the following areas.</p>\n<p>* Software or hardware verification with ACL2<br>\n    * Formalizations of mathematics in ACL2<br>\n    * Libraries and tools for ACL2<br>\n    * User interfaces for ACL2<br>\n    * Novel uses of ACL2<br>\n    * Experiences with ACL2 in the classroom<br>\n    * Reports of and proposals for improvements of ACL2<br>\n    * Comparisons with other theorem provers<br>\n    * Comparisons with other programming or specification languages<br>\n    * Challenge problems and their solutions<br>\n    * Foundational issues related to ACL2<br>\n    * Implementations connecting ACL2 with other systems</p>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS:</p>\n<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format.  Submissions<br>\nshould be prepared in the EPTCS templates, available from<br>\n<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org\">http://style.eptcs.org</a> &lt;<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org/\">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>&gt;, and submitted via<br>\nEasyChair.  See the ACL2 2018 website for details.</p>\n<p>The ACL2 Workshop accepts both long papers (up to sixteen pages) and<br>\nextended abstracts (up to two pages).  Both categories of papers will<br>\nrequire short abstracts to be submitted by the \"Abstract submission\"<br>\ndeadline and will be refereed by at least two members of the program<br>\ncommittee.  Accepted submissions in both categories will be included<br>\nin the final workshop proceedings, although speaking slots will be<br>\nshorter for extended abstracts.  At least one author of each accepted<br>\nsubmission must register for the workshop and give a presentation<br>\nsummarizing the paper's results.</p>\n<p>Extended abstracts should contain at least one or two references so<br>\nsomeone can pursue the abstract topic.  Like long papers, extended<br>\nabstracts must describe work that has already been done -- it is not<br>\nfor ideas for future work.  To discuss future work, we will have a<br>\nrump session, and we will later appeal for those topics.</p>\n<p>One of the main advantages of the ACL2 Workshop is that attendees are<br>\nalready knowledgeable about ACL2, its syntax, its basic commands, and<br>\nthe art of writing models in it.  So authors may assume that readers<br>\nhave this familiarity.  The workshop proceedings will be published as<br>\na volume of Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science<br>\n(EPTCS).  Long papers will be published as PDFs, and extended<br>\nabstracts will be published as HTML snippets.  Please see the EPTCS<br>\ncopyright page (<a href=\"http://copyright.eptcs.org/\">http://copyright.eptcs.org/</a>) for a discussion of<br>\nlicensing.  Please also see the EPTCS LaTeX style file and formatting<br>\ninstructions (<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org\">http://style.eptcs.org</a>).</p>\n<p>Many papers presented at the workshop will describe interactions with<br>\nthe theorem prover.  Authors of such papers are required to provide<br>\nACL2 script files (typically, ACL2 books) along with instructions for<br>\ntheir use with ACL2, unless they provide a small text file explaining<br>\nwhy supporting materials are not appropriate (e.g., for a theory<br>\npaper).  Such supporting materials should have proper licenses and<br>\ncopyrights (feel free to email the workshop chairs if you have<br>\nquestions about that).  The books should be certifiable either with<br>\ncustom instructions that are clearly provided, or by running the<br>\nfollowing shell command in the directory of your contributed books,<br>\nwhere ACL2_DIR denotes your ACL2 sources directory and ACL2 denotes a<br>\nrecent ACL2 executable.</p>\n<p>ACL2_DIR/books/build/cert.pl --acl2 ACL2 *.lisp</p>\n<p>Send the supporting materials to Matt Kaufmann,<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:kaufmann@cs.utexas.edu\">kaufmann@cs.utexas.edu</a>.</p>\n<p>For accepted papers, we will require authors to make these books<br>\navailable by adding them to the ACL2 Community Books.  (The chairs<br>\nmay assist in that process, if asked.)  The authors can expect the<br>\nreviewers to take the supporting materials into account during the<br>\nrefereeing process.</p>\n<p>The workshop will also feature ``rump sessions'', in which<br>\nparticipants can describe ongoing research related to ACL2.<br>\nProposals for rump session presentations, including a title and short<br>\nabstract, may be accepted until the workshop, but preference will<br>\nbe given to early submissions and subject to available time.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION:</p>\n<p>Chairs</p>\n<p>Shilpi Goel (Centaur Technology, Inc.)<br>\n    Matt Kaufmann (University of Texas)</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Harsh Chamarthi (General Electric)<br>\n    Alessandro Coglio (Kestrel Institute)<br>\n    Jared Davis (Apple)<br>\n    Ruben Gamboa (University of Wyoming)<br>\n    Shilpi Goel (Centaur Technology, Inc.)<br>\n    Dave Greve (Rockwell-Collins, Inc.)<br>\n    Warren Hunt (University of Texas at Austin)<br>\n    Sebastiaan Joosten (University of Twente)<br>\n    Matt Kaufmann (University of Texas)<br>\n    John O'Leary (Intel)<br>\n    Grant Passmore (Aesthetic Integration)<br>\n    David Rager (Oracle, Inc.)<br>\n    Sandip Ray (University of Florida)<br>\n    David Russinoff (ARM, Ltd.)<br>\n    Julien Schmaltz (Eindhoven University of Technology)<br>\n    Anna Slobodova (Centaur Technology, Inc.)<br>\n    Eric Smith (Kestrel Institute)<br>\n    Sol Swords (Centaur Technology, Inc.)</p>\n<p>The chairs thank Mertcan Temel for his assistance with local arrangements.</p>\n<p>NOTE:</p>\n<p>Please see the website</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html\">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html</a></p>\n<p>for further information including paper submission, organization,<br>\nvenue, lodging, and eventually, registration and program information.</p>\n<p>Note that no block of rooms is being reserved for the workshop.<br>\nPlease see the following link<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html#lodging\">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/index.html#lodging</a><br>\nfor information about lodging options near the workshop venue.</p>\n<p>HISTORICAL INFORMATION:</p>\n<p>The ACL2 Workshop series has previously published with EPTCS in 2011,<br>\n2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017.
