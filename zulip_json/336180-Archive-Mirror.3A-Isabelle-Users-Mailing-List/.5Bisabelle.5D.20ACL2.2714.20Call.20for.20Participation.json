ACL2 2014 is the eleventh in the series of ACL2<br>\nworkshops, which occur approximately every 18 months. ACL2 is an<br>\nindustrial-strength automated reasoning system, the latest in the<br>\nBoyer-Moore family of theorem provers. The 2005 ACM Software System<br>\nAward was awarded to Boyer, Kaufmann, and Moore for their work in ACL2<br>\nand the other theorem provers in the Boyer-Moore family.</p>\n<p>ACL2 2014 is a two-day workshop to be held in Vienna, Austria.<br>\nThe workshop will feature technical papers and includes two invited talks:</p>\n<p>Mike Gordon,\"Linking ACL2 and HOL: past achievements and future prospects”</p>\n<p>Magnus Myreen, \"Machine-code verification: experience of tackling<br>\nmedium-sized case studies using 'decompilation into logic’”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the workshop features rump sessions discussing ongoing<br>\nresearch. Topics include but are not limited to the<br>\nfollowing:</p>\n<p>* software or hardware verification with ACL2,<br>\n    * formalizations of mathematics in ACL2,<br>\n    * new libraries, tools, and interfaces for ACL2,<br>\n    * novel uses of ACL2,<br>\n    * experiences with ACL2 in the classroom,<br>\n    * reports of and proposals for improvements of ACL2,<br>\n    * comparisons with other theorem provers,<br>\n    * comparisons with other programming or specification languages,<br>\n    * challenge problems and their solutions,<br>\n    * foundational issues related to ACL2, and<br>\n    * implementations connecting ACL2 with other systems.</p>\n<p>The workshop will also feature ``rump sessions'', in which<br>\nparticipants can describe ongoing research related to ACL2. Proposals<br>\nfor rump session presentations, including a title and short abstract,<br>\nwill be accepted until the workshop.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION</p>\n<p>Chairs</p>\n<p>* Freek Verbeek, Open University of The Netherlands<br>\n        * Julien Schmaltz, Eindhoven University of Technology, The<br>\nNetherlands</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>* John Cowles University of Wyoming<br>\n        * Warren Hunt University of Texas at Austin<br>\n        * Matt Kaufmann University of Texas at Austin<br>\n        * Panagiotis Manolios Northeastern University<br>\n        * Magnus O.
