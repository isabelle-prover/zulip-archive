The workshop is<br>\nheld every two years. The previous editions of ADG were held in<br>\nCoimbra in 2014, Edinburgh in 2012, Munich in 2010, Shanghai in 2008,<br>\nPontevedra in 2006, Gainesville in 2004, Hagenberg in 2002, Zurich in<br>\n2000, Beijing in 1998, and Toulouse in 1996. The 11th edition, ADG<br>\n2016, will be held in Strasbourg, France, June 27 – 29, 2016.</p>\n<p>Scope:</p>\n<p>Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>polynomial algebra, invariant and coordinate-free methods,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>probabilistic, synthetic, and logic approaches, techniques for<br>\nautomated geometric reasoning from discrete mathematics,<br>\ncombinatorics, and numerics;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>symbolic and numeric methods for geometric computation, geometric<br>\nconstraint solving, automated generation/reasoning and manipulation<br>\nwith diagrams;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>design and implementation of geometry software, special-purpose<br>\ntools, automated theorem provers, experimental studies;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>applications of ADG to mechanics, geometric modelling, CAGD/CAD,<br>\ncomputer vision, robotics and education.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission Guidelines:</p>\n<p>We invite the following types of submissions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extended abstracts</li>\n<li>Full paper (maximum 20 pages)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The extended abstracts must address the following aspects explicitly.</p>\n<p>Problem: What is the problem/question/objective?<br>\nMotivation: Why do we work on the problem?
