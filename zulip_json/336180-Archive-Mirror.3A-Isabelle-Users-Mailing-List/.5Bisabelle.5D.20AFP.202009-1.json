By loading the theory DPT_SAT_Solver, the SAT solver installs itself (under the name ``dptsat'') and certain Isabelle tools like Refute will start using it automatically. This is a port of the DPT (Decision Procedure Toolkit) SAT Solver written in OCaml.</p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p>Formalizing the Logic-Automaton Connection<br>\nby Stefan Berghofer and Markus Reiter</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Presburger-Automata.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Presburger-Automata.shtml</a></p>\n<p>This work presents a formalization of a library for automata on bit strings. It forms the basis of a reflection-based decision procedure for Presburger arithmetic, which is efficiently executable thanks to Isabelle's code generator. With this work, we therefore provide a mechanized proof of a well-known connection between logic and automata theory. The formalization is also described in a publication [TPHOLs 2009].</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",
