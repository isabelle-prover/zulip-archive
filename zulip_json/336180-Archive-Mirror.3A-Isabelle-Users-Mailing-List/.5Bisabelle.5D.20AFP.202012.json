We introduce general<br>\none-step methods for numerical approximation of the solution and provide an<br>\nanalysis regarding the local and global error of one-step methods. We give<br>\nan executable specification of the Euler method to approximate the solution<br>\nof IVPs and prove an explicit bound for the global error. We use arbitrary-<br>\nprecision floating-point numbers and also handle rounding errors when we <br>\ntruncate the numbers for efficiency reasons.</p>\n<p>Well-Quasi-Orders<br>\nby Christian Sternagel (submitted 2012-04-13)</p>\n<p>Abstract:<br>\nBased on Isabelle/HOL's type class for preorders, we introduce a type class for<br>\nwell-quasi-orders (wqo) which is characterized by the absence of \"bad\" sequences<br>\n(our proofs are along the lines of the proof of Nash-Williams, from which we<br>\nalso borrow terminology). Our two main results are instantiations for the <br>\nproduct type and the list type, which (almost) directly follow from our proofs <br>\nof (1) Dickson's Lemma and (2) Higman's Lemma. More concretely:<br>\nIf the sets A and B are wqo then their Cartesian product is wqo.<br>\nIf the set A is wqo then the set of finite lists over A is wqo.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",
