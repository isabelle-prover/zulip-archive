We want them, but we need to know about them. \"Normal\" people don't have access to the repository, so the question doesn't even arise. They would send in new examples for the collection by email and we can do everything that is necessary. People who have access and could add things themselves only need to let us know about them.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",
