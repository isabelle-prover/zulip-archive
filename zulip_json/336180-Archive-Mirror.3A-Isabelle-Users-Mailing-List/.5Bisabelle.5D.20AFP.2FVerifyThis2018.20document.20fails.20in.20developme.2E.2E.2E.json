The imports in the<br>\nmain session \"VerifyThis2018\" are not qualified and thus taken from the<br>\nfile-system (after Isabelle2017): it means the theories are loaded again<br>\nand thus subject to document output.</p>\n<p>The included ROOT file shows how to resolve this. There is now only one<br>\nclearly defined session: it produces the correct document, and also<br>\nbuilds faster (because the pointless auxiliary session is gone).</p>\n<p>Here is some timing information for this example (threads=6):</p>\n<p>(old)<br>\nFinished VTcomp_Lib (0:00:35 elapsed time, 0:01:16 cpu time, factor 2.15)<br>\nFinished VerifyThis2018 (0:00:29 elapsed time, 0:01:51 cpu time, factor<br>\n3.76)</p>\n<p>(new)<br>\nFinished VerifyThis2018 (0:00:40 elapsed time, 0:02:14 cpu time, factor<br>\n3.35)</p>\n<p>We might need a more strict scheme for theory imports from other<br>\nsessions: double use of files from a different session directory should<br>\nbe ruled out. (Although I can foresee special sessions that still need<br>\nthat for historical reasons.)</p>\n<p>In addition (or as alternative) we could have a tool to analyze AFP<br>\ntelemetry information to detect situations of multiple uses of theories,<br>\nas well as waste of build time due to extraneous sessions. The data for<br>\nthat is already stored in a database, but it needs to be digested.</p>\n<p>Makarius<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/zZ0Ba2bhnkjcBp9NVfJPlqCc/ROOT\">ROOT</a></p>",
