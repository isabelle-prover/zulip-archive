This formalization, including formal specification of the standard and proofs of important properties of floating-point arithmetic, forms the foundation for verifying programs with floating-point computation. There is also a code generation setup for floats so that we can execute programs using this formalization in functional programming languages.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
