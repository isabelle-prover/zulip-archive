Such a protocol is ‘loop free’ if it never leads to routing decisions that forward packets in circles.</p>\n<p>This development mechanises an existing pen-and-paper proof of loop freedom of AODV. The protocol is modelled in the Algebra of Wireless Networks (AWN), which is the subject of an earlier paper and AFP mechanization. The proof relies on a novel compositional approach for lifting invariants to networks of nodes.</p>\n<p>We exploit the mechanization to analyse several variants of AODV and show that Isabelle/HOL can re-establish most proof obligations automatically and identify exactly the steps that are no longer valid.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
