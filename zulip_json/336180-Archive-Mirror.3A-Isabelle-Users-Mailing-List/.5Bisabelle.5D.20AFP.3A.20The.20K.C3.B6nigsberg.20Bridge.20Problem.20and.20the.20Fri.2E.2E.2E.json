Then, with our formalization of graphs, we show both necessary and sufficient conditions for Eulerian trails and circuits as well as the fact that the Königsberg Bridge Problem does not have a solution. In addition, we show the Friendship Theorem in simple graphs.</p>\n<p>[http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Koenigsberg_Friendship.shtml]</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
