I won’t repeat the abstracts here (they are rather technical), but this work represents very impressive progress in the area of computational linear algebra, including matrix operations for solving linear systems and many other applications. The authors have also taken great care, both in writing highly polished proofs and at setting up code generation yielding what appears to be impressive performance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Echelon_Form.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Echelon_Form.shtml</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/QR_Decomposition.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/QR_Decomposition.shtml</a></p>\n<p>It’s great to see work like this being done.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
