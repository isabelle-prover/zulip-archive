Previous AI4FM workshops have included a mix of industrial<br>\nand academic participants<br>\nand we anticipate attracting a similarly diverse audience.</p>\n<p>Industrial use of formal methods is certainly increasing but, in order<br>\nto make it more mainstream,<br>\nthe cost of applying formal methods, in terms of mathematical skill<br>\nlevel and development time,<br>\nmust be reduced â€” we believe that AI can help with these issues.</p>\n<p>Rigorous software development using formal methods allows the<br>\nconstruction of an accurate characterisation<br>\nof a problem domain that is firmly based on mathematics; by applying<br>\nstandard mathematical analyses, these<br>\nmethods can be used to prove that systems satisfy formal<br>\nspecifications. A recent ACM computing survey paper<br>\ndescribes over sixty industrial projects and discusses the effect<br>\nformal methods have on time, cost and quality.<br>\nIt shows that with tools backed by mature theory, formal methods are<br>\nbecoming cost effective and their use is<br>\neasier to justify, not as an academic exercise or legal requirement,<br>\nbut as part of a business case. Furthermore,<br>\nthe use of such formal methods is no longer confined to safety<br>\ncritical systems: the list of industrial partners<br>\nin the EU-funded DEPLOY project is one indication of this broader use.<br>\nMost methods tend to fit a ``posit-and-prove''<br>\nparadigm where the user posits a development step (expressed in terms<br>\nof specifications of yet-to-be-realised components)<br>\nthat has to be justified by proofs. The associated properties that<br>\nmust be verified are often called proof obligations (POs)<br>\nor verification conditions. In most cases, such proofs require<br>\nmechanical support by theorem provers.</p>\n<p>One can distinguish between automatic and interactive provers, where<br>\nthe latter are generally more expressive but require<br>\nuser interaction. AI has had a large impact on the development of<br>\nprovers. In fact, some of the first AI applications were<br>\nin theorem proving and all theorem provers now contain heuristics to<br>\nreduce the search space that can be attributed to AI.<br>\nNevertheless, theorem proving research and (pure) AI research have<br>\ndiverged and theorem proving is barely considered<br>\nto be AI-related anymore.</p>\n<p>Scope</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We encourage submissions presenting work in progress, tools under<br>\ndevelopment, and PhD projects, in order that the<br>\nworkshop can become a forum for active dialogue between the groups<br>\ninvolved in  theorem provers, formal methods and artificial intelligence.<br>\nParticular areas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The use of machine learning to support interactive theorem proving;</li>\n<li>The use of machine learning to enhance automated theorem proving;</li>\n<li>The development of search heuristics;</li>\n<li>\n<p>The us of AI for term synthesis, invariant generation, lemma<br>\ndiscovery and concept invention;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The use of AI for counter-example generation;</p>\n</li>\n<li>The use of AI to support and guide the formal modelling process;</li>\n<li>\n<p>The role of AI planning for formal systems developments, from<br>\nrequirements to the end product (including software and hardware);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The interplay between reasoning and modelling and the role of AI in<br>\nthis framework;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ontologies in the formal engineering process.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The main aim for the workshop is discussion, thus submissions<br>\ndo not need to be original. Extended versions of submissions<br>\nmay have been published previously, or submitted concurrently with<br>\nor after AI4FM 2013 to another workshop, conference or a journal.</p>\n<p>Submission is by email to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:ai4fm2013@ai4fm.org\">ai4fm2013@ai4fm.org</a></p>\n<p>Please submit an abstract up to 3 pages in a PDF format. The extended<br>\nabstracts will be handed out to all participants, and will be made into<br>\na technical report prior to the workshop.</p>\n<p>Acceptance for presentation at the workshop will be made by the<br>\norganisers based on relevance to the workshop.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission deadline: April 20, 2013<br>\nNotification of acceptance: May 01, 2013<br>\nFinal version due: May 15, 2013<br>\nWorkshop: July 22nd, 2013</p>\n<p>Organisers</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Leo Freitas (Newcastle University, UK)</li>\n<li>Gudmund Grov (Heriot-Watt University, UK)</li>\n<li>Ewen Maclean (University of Edinburgh, UK)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contact Details</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you have any queries, please email the organisers at the following<br>\nemail address:</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:ai4fm2013@ai4fm.org\">ai4fm2013@ai4fm.org</a></p>",
