Research <br>\nhas shown that with tools backed by mature theory, formal methods are <br>\nbecoming cost effective and their use is easier to justify, not as an <br>\nacademic exercise, legal requirement or niche markets -- but as part of <br>\na business case. However, while industrial use of formal methods is <br>\nincreasing, in order to make it more mainstream, the cost of applying <br>\nformal methods, in terms of mathematical skill level and development <br>\ntime, must still be reduced.
