Previous AI4FM workshops <br>\nhave included a mix of industrial and academic participants and we <br>\nanticipate attracting a similarly diverse audience. </p>\n<p>Rigorous software development using formal methods allows the construction <br>\nof an accurate characterisation of a problem domain that is firmly based <br>\non mathematics; by applying standard mathematical analyses, these methods <br>\ncan be used to prove that systems satisfy formal specifications. Research <br>\nhas shown that with tools backed by mature theory, formal methods are <br>\nbecoming cost effective and their use is easier to justify, not as an <br>\nacademic exercise, legal requirement or niche markets -- but as part of <br>\na business case. However, while industrial use of formal methods is <br>\nincreasing, in order to make it more mainstream, the cost of applying <br>\nformal methods, in terms of mathematical skill level and development <br>\ntime, must still be reduced. We believe that AI can help with these <br>\nissues.</p>\n<p>Scope</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We encourage submissions presenting work in progress, tools under<br>\ndevelopment, and PhD projects, in order that the workshop can become <br>\na forum for active dialogue between the groups involved in  automated <br>\nreasoning, formal methods and artificial intelligence.  Particular <br>\nareas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The use of AI and automated reasoning to support and guide the formal <br>\nmodelling process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The use of AI and automated reasoning in the requirement capture process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The use of AI to reuse formal models, programs and proofs.</li>\n<li>The use of machine learning to support interactive theorem proving.</li>\n<li>The use of machine learning to enhance automated theorem proving.</li>\n<li>The development of search heuristics.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The use of AI for term synthesis, invariant generation, lemma discovery <br>\nand concept invention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The use of AI for counter-example generation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The use of constraint solvers in formal methods. </li>\n<li>\n<p>The role of AI planning for formal systems developments, from requirements <br>\nto the end product (including software and hardware).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The interplay between reasoning and modelling and the role of AI in this <br>\nframework.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ontologies in the formal engineering process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Novel ideas on how to use AI (e.g. machine learning, pattern recognition) <br>\nin proof automation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use of cloud elasticity for: scalability on large scale developments, <br>\nproof/lemma exploration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Techniques for bridging the development to maintenance gap.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to continue the area of research beyond our sponsored project <br>\n(at Newcastle and Edinburgh universities), which has come to an end.<br>\nThis means we would particularly encourage the submission of position <br>\npapers on new ideas or research directions for the use of AI techniques <br>\nin the proof discovery process as well as in modelling best practices. </p>\n<p>Student grants</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks to sponsorships from FME and SICSA we can offer financial support <br>\nfor a limited number of students registering for AVoCS in the form of a <br>\nregistration fee waiver (full or partial). As this is limited, we ask the students <br>\nthat would like to take the advantage of this support to submit a short application. <br>\nThe details on how to apply will be available in due course from the AVoCS <br>\nwebpage.</p>\n<p>History</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This will be the fifth workshop in the series. Previous workshops were held at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Singapore, May 2014 @ FM (<a href=\"http://www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2014/\">www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2014/</a>)</li>\n<li>Rennes, France, July 2013 @ ITP (<a href=\"http://www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2013/\">www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2013/</a>)</li>\n<li>Schloss Dagstuhl, Germany, July 2012 (<a href=\"http://www.dagstuhl.de/12271\">www.dagstuhl.de/12271</a>)</li>\n<li>Edinburgh, UK, April 2011 (<a href=\"http://www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2011.php\">www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2011.php</a>)</li>\n<li>Newcastle, UK, May 2010 (<a href=\"http://www.ai4fm.org/ko-meeting.php\">www.ai4fm.org/ko-meeting.php</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The main aim for the workshop is discussion, thus submissions do not <br>\nneed to be original. Extended versions of submissions may have been <br>\npublished previously, or submitted concurrently with or after AI4FM <br>\n2015 to another workshop, conference or a journal.</p>\n<p>Submission is by email to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:ai4fm2015@ai4fm.org\">ai4fm2015@ai4fm.org</a></p>\n<p>Please submit an abstract up to 3 pages in a PDF format. The extended <br>\nabstracts will be handed out to all participants, and will be made <br>\ninto a technical report prior to the workshop. </p>\n<p>Acceptance for presentation at the workshop will be made by the <br>\norganisers based on relevance to the workshop.</p>\n<p>Organisers</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Leo Freitas (Newcastle University, UK)</li>\n<li>Iain Whiteside (University of Edinburgh, UK)</li>\n<li>Gudmund Grov (Heriot Watt University, UK)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contact Details</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you have any queries, please email the organisers at the following <br>\nemail address:</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:ai4fm2015@ai4fm.org\">ai4fm2015@ai4fm.org</a></p>",
