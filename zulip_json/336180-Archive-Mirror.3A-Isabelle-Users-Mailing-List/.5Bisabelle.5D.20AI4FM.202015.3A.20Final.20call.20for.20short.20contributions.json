The workshops include a mix of<br>\nindustrial and academic participants and we anticipate attracting a<br>\nsimilarly diverse audience in AI4FM 2015.</p>\n<p>We invite 3-page short contributions (extended abstracts) presenting work<br>\nin the areas of automated reasoning, formal methods and artificial<br>\nintelligence. The authors can submit work in progress, tools under<br>\ndevelopment, and PhD projects to facilitate and benefit from the active<br>\ndialog between the groups involved in these research areas.</p>\n<p>Invited speaker:</p>\n<p>J Strother Moore (<a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/\">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/</a>, University of Texas at<br>\nAustin, US) will be giving an invited talk at AI4FM 2015.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The main aim for the workshop is discussion, thus submissions do not need<br>\nto be original. Extended versions of submissions may have been published<br>\npreviously, or submitted concurrently with or after AI4FM 2015 to another<br>\nworkshop, conference or a journal. Presentations of work in progress, tools<br>\nunder development, and PhD projects are also encouraged.</p>\n<p>The scope of the workshop covers the research in automated reasoning,<br>\nformal methods and artificial intelligence. Particular topics of interest<br>\ninclude, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The use of AI and automated reasoning to support and guide the formal<br>\nmodelling process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The use of AI and automated reasoning in the requirement capture process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The use of AI to reuse formal models, programs and proofs.</li>\n<li>The use of machine learning to support interactive theorem proving.</li>\n<li>The use of machine learning to enhance automated theorem proving.</li>\n<li>The development of search heuristics.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The use of AI for term synthesis, invariant generation, lemma discovery<br>\nand concept invention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The use of AI for counter-example generation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The use of constraint solvers in formal methods.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The role of AI planning for formal systems developments, from<br>\nrequirements to the end product (including software and hardware).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The interplay between reasoning and modelling and the role of AI in this<br>\nframework.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ontologies in the formal engineering process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Novel ideas on how to use AI (e.g. machine learning, pattern<br>\nrecognition) in proof automation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use of cloud elasticity for: scalability on large scale developments,<br>\nproof/lemma exploration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Techniques for bridging the development to maintenance gap.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission is by email to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:ai4fm2015@ai4fm.org\">ai4fm2015@ai4fm.org</a></p>\n<p>Please submit an abstract up to 3 pages in a PDF format. The extended<br>\nabstracts will be handed out to all participants, and will be made into a<br>\ntechnical report prior to the workshop.</p>\n<p>Acceptance for presentation at the workshop will be made by the organisers<br>\nbased on relevance to the workshop.</p>\n<p>Student grants</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks to sponsorships from Altran, FME, and SICSA we can offer financial<br>\nsupport for a limited number of students registering for AVoCS in the form<br>\nof a registration fee waiver (full or partial, registration covers the<br>\nAI4FM workshop in addition to AVoCS). As this is limited, we ask the<br>\nstudents that would like to take the advantage of this support to submit a<br>\nshort application.</p>\n<p>The details on how to apply are available on the AVoCS website:<br>\n<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/avocs15/student-grants\">https://sites.google.com/site/avocs15/student-grants</a></p>\n<p>Organisers</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Leo Freitas (Newcastle University, UK)</li>\n<li>Andrius Velykis (Newcastle University, UK)</li>\n<li>Gudmund Grov (Heriot-Watt University, UK)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any queries, please email the organisers at the following<br>\ne-mail address:</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:ai4fm2015@ai4fm.org\">ai4fm2015@ai4fm.org</a></p>",
