The two  approaches are based  on heuristics  and on<br>\nmathematical  algorithmics, respectively. Artificial  Intelligence can<br>\nbe  applied to Symbolic  Computation and  Symbolic Computation  can be<br>\napplied  to Artificial  Intelligence. Hence,  a wealth  of challenges,<br>\nideas, theoretical insights and  results, methods and algorithms arise<br>\nin  the  interaction  of  the  two fields  and  research  communities.<br>\nAdvanced tools of software technology and system design are needed and<br>\na broad spectrum  of applications is possible by  the combined problem<br>\nsolving power of the two fields.</p>\n<p>Hence, the conference is in the center of interest and interaction for<br>\nvarious research communities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Artificial Intelligence  * Logic</li>\n<li>Symbolic Computation     * Software Technology </li>\n<li>Computer Algebra         * Semantic Web Technology</li>\n<li>Automated Reasoning      * Mathematical Knowledge Management </li>\n<li>Formal mathematics       * Computer-based Math Teaching &amp; Didactics</li>\n<li>Machine Learning         * Computer-Supported Publishing </li>\n<li>Automated Discovery      * Language and System Design </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Topics<br>\n======</p>\n<p>Topics of particular interest of the conference include:</p>\n<p>* AI in Symbolic Mathematical Computing<br>\n  * Computer Algebra Systems and Automated Theorem Provers<br>\n  * Symmetries in AI problems<br>\n  * Engineering, Industrial and Operations Research Applications<br>\n  * Foundations and Complexity of Symbolic Computation<br>\n  * Mathematical Modeling of Multi-Agent Systems<br>\n  * Implementations of Symbolic Computation Systems<br>\n  * Programming Languages for Symbolic Computation<br>\n  * Symbolic Computations for Expert Systems and Machine Learning<br>\n  * Symbolic Computation and Ontologies <br>\n  * Logic and Symbolic Computing<br>\n  * Implementation and Performance Issues<br>\n  * Intelligent Interfaces<br>\n  * Symbolic Techniques for Document Analysis</p>\n<p>Papers on  other topics  with links to  the above research  fields and<br>\ntopics will also be welcomed for consideration.</p>\n<p>Proceedings<br>\n===========</p>\n<p>The proceedings of the conference will be published as a volume in the<br>\nseries   Lecture   Notes   in   Artificial  Intelligence   (LNAI)   by<br>\nSpringer-Verlag. Accepted papers will have to be prepared in LaTeX and<br>\nformatted according to the  requirements of the Springer's LNAI series<br>\n(the    corresponding   style   files    can   be    downloaded   from<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>  and  are  the same  for<br>\nLNCS and LNAI).</p>\n<p>Submission<br>\n==========</p>\n<p>Theoretical and applied research papers on all topics within the scope<br>\nof the conference are invited.  Submitted papers (in English) must not<br>\nexceed 15 pages  in length (in the LNCS style).  The title page should<br>\ncontain the title,  author(s) with affiliation(s), e-mail address(es),<br>\nlisting of keywords  and abstract plus the topics  from the above list<br>\nto which the paper is related. The program committee (PC) will subject<br>\nall  submitted papers  to a  peer review.  Theoretical papers  will be<br>\njudged  on their  originality  and contribution  to  their field,  and<br>\napplied papers  on the importance and originality  of the application.<br>\nResults must be original and have not been published elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The web page for electronic submission is at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aisc20100\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aisc20100</a></p>\n<p>Best Paper Awards<br>\n=================</p>\n<p>Every  submission automatically  competes  for the  Best Paper  Award.<br>\nPapers  which have  been mainly  developed  by (PhD)  students can  be<br>\nmarked as student papers upon  submission to also compete for the Best<br>\nStudent Paper Award.</p>\n<p>Important Dates<br>\n===============</p>\n<p>Abstract Submission deadline:            February 19, 2010 <br>\n Submission deadline:                     February 26, 2010<br>\n Notification:                               April 18, 2010<br>\n Camera Ready Version:                       April 28, 2010<br>\n Conference:                          July 5 - July 6, 2010</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We apologize if you receive multiple copies of this email.
