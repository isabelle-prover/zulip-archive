New combinations of<br>\nAI and reasoning methods and tools deployed over large mathematical<br>\nand scientific corpora will be instrumental to this task.  The AITP<br>\nconference is the forum for discussing how to get there as soon as<br>\npossible, and the force driving the progress towards that.</p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<p>- AI and big-data methods in theorem proving and mathematics.<br>\n    - Collaboration between automated and interactive theorem proving.<br>\n    - Common-sense reasoning and reasoning in science.<br>\n    - Alignment and joint processing of formal, semi-formal,<br>\n       and informal libraries.</p>\n<p>- Methods for large-scale computer understanding of mathematics<br>\n       and science.</p>\n<p>- Combinations of linguistic/learning-based and semantic/reasoning methods .</p>\n<p>Sessions and Speakers</p>\n<p>There will be three focused sessions on AI for ATP, ITP and<br>\nmathematics, a (tutorial) session on modern AI and big-data methods,<br>\nand several sessions with contributed talks. The focused sessions will<br>\nbe based on invited talks and discussion oriented.</p>\n<p>- AI and large-theory ATP/ITP.<br>\n       Confirmed speakers: Thomas C. Hales</p>\n<p>- AI and internal guidance of ATP.<br>\n      Confirmed speakers: Robert Veroff, Stephan Schulz</p>\n<p>- AI and automated understanding of informal and semi-formal mathematics.<br>\n      Confirmed speakers: Noriko Arai, Deyan Ginev,<br>\n                                         Takuya Matsuzaki, Jiri Vyskocil</p>\n<p>- Modern AI and big-data methods (tutorials/connections to ATP/ITP/math).<br>\n      Confirmed speakers: Sean Holden, Christian Szegedy</p>\n<p>Contributed talks</p>\n<p>We solicit contributed talks. Selection of those will be based on<br>\nextended abstracts/short papers of 2 pages formatted with easychair.cls.<br>\nSubmission is via EasyChair (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aitp2016\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aitp2016</a>)<br>\nby 12 December 2015.
