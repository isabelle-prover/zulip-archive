This workshop is intended for<br>\npresentation and discussion of work in progress and the discussion of<br>\nemerging and foundational ideas. We are interested in all aspects of the<br>\napplication of logic to computer security. Applications of interest<br>\ninclude security policy, access control, security protocols, information<br>\nflow, but we are also interested in new and as yet untried applications<br>\nof logic to different areas of computer security. We are also interested<br>\nin discussion papers that raise fundamental questions and/or suggest new<br>\nlines of research in this area.  Work that has already appeared or is<br>\nunder consideration by other venues is welcome. No formal proceedings is<br>\nplanned, but accepted abstracts will be posted online.</p>\n<p>Program Committe and Organizers:</p>\n<p>Catherine Meadows, Naval Research Laboratory, USA (Workshop Organizer)<br>\nAndreas Bauer, Australian National University, Australia<br>\nHeiko Mantel,  TU Darmstadt, Germany<br>\nMike Mislove, Tulane University, USA<br>\nDusko Pavlovic, Kestrel Institute (USA) and Oxford University(UK)<br>\nLuca Vigano, University of Verona, Italy</p>",
