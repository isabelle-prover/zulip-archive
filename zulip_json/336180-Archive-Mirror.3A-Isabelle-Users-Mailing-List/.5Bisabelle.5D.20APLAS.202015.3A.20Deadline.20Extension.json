APLAS is based in Asia,<br>\nbut is an international forum that serves the worldwide programming<br>\nlanguage community.</p>\n<p>APLAS is sponsored by the  Asian Association for Foundation of<br>\nSoftware (AAFS), founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with<br>\nmany researchers from Europe and the USA. Past APLAS symposiums were<br>\nsuccessfully held in Singapore ('14), Melbourne ('13), Kyoto ('12),<br>\nKenting ('11),  Shanghai ('10),  Seoul ('09),  Bangalore ('08),<br>\nSingapore ('07),  Sydney ('06),  Tsukuba ('05),  Taipei ('04)  and<br>\nBeijing ('03) after three informal workshops. Proceedings of the past<br>\nsymposiums were published in Springer's LNCS.</p>\n<p><em>TOPICS</em><br>\nThe symposium is devoted to foundational and practical issues in<br>\nprogramming languages and systems. Papers are solicited on topics<br>\nsuch as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>semantics, logics, foundational theory</li>\n<li>design of languages, type systems and foundational calculi</li>\n<li>domain-specific languages</li>\n<li>compilers, interpreters, abstract machines</li>\n<li>program derivation, synthesis and transformation</li>\n<li>program analysis, verification, model-checking</li>\n<li>logic, constraint, probabilistic and quantum programming</li>\n<li>software security</li>\n<li>concurrency and parallelism</li>\n<li>tools and environments for programming and implementation<br>\nTopics are not limited to those discussed in previous symposiums.<br>\nPapers identifying future directions of programming and those<br>\naddressing the rapid changes of the underlying computing platforms<br>\nare especially welcome. Demonstration of systems and tools in the<br>\nscope of APLAS are welcome to the System and Tool presentations<br>\ncategory. Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic are<br>\nwelcome to consult with program chair prior to submission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>SUBMISSION</em><br>\nWe solicit submissions in two categories:<br>\na) Regular research papers</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>describing original scientific research results, including tool<br>\n   development and case studies. Regular research papers should not<br>\n   exceed 18 pages in the Springer LNCS format, including<br>\n   bibliography and figures. They should clearly identify what has<br>\n   been accomplished and why it is significant. Submissions will be<br>\n   judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness,<br>\n   originality, and clarity. In case of lack of space, proofs,<br>\n   experimental results, or any information supporting the technical<br>\n   results of the paper could be provided as an appendix or a link to<br>\n   a web page, but reviewers are not obliged to read them.<br>\nb) System and tool presentations</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>describing systems or tools that support theory, program<br>\n   construction, reasoning, or program execution in the scope of<br>\n   APLAS. System and Tool presentations are expected to be centered<br>\n   around a demonstration. The paper and the demonstration should<br>\n   identify the novelties of the tools and use motivating examples.<br>\n   System and Tool papers should not exceed 8 pages in the Springer<br>\n   LNCS format, including bibliography and figures. Submissions will<br>\n   be judged based on both the papers and the described systems or<br>\n   tools. It is highly desirable that the tools are available on the<br>\n   web.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission web page<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aplas2015\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aplas2015</a>&gt; using EasyChair.<br>\nAcceptable formats are PostScript or PDF.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for<br>\npublication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English.<br>\nThe proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer's<br>\nLNCS series. Accepted papers must be presented at the conference.</p>\n<p><em>ORGANIZERS</em><br>\nGeneral Chair:<br>\nSungwoo Park (Pohang Univ. of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Korea)</p>\n<p>Program Chair:<br>\nXinyu Feng (Univ. of Science and Technology of China, China)</p>\n<p>Program Committee:<br>\nJames Brotherston (Univ.
