We invite<br>\nextended abstracts (2-4 pages, using the EasyChair class style<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/publications/for_authors\">http://www.easychair.org/publications/for_authors</a>) in the form<br>\nof non-technical position statements aimed at prompting lively<br>\ndiscussion. The title of the workshop is indicative of the kind<br>\nof discussions we would like to encourage:</p>\n<p>Challenges: What are the next grand challenges for research on<br>\nautomated reasoning? Thereby, we refer to problems, solving<br>\nwhich would imply a significant impact (e.g., shift of focus) on<br>\nthe CADE community and beyond. Roughly ten years ago SMT was one<br>\nsuch challenge.</p>\n<p>Applications: Is automated reasoning applicable in real-world<br>\n(industrial) scenarios? Should reports on such applications be<br>\nencouraged at a venue like CADE, perhaps by means of a special<br>\ncase study paper category?</p>\n<p>Directions: Based on the grand challenges and requirements from<br>\nreal-world applications, what are the research directions the<br>\ncommunity should promote? What bridges between the different<br>\nsubcommunities of automated reasoning need to be strengthened?<br>\nWhat new communities should be included (if at all)? For<br>\nexample, following Reiner Hähnle's question in the AAR<br>\nNewsletter, is there a place at CADE for research on usable<br>\nautomated reasoning (in resemblance to the flourishing topic of<br>\nusable security)?</p>\n<p>Exemplary achievements: What are the landmark achievements of<br>\nautomated reasoning whose influence reached far beyond the CADE<br>\ncommunity itself? What can we learn from those successes when<br>\nshaping our future research?</p>\n<p>Contributions will be grouped into similar themes and authors<br>\nwill be invited to make their case within discussion panels.<br>\nAuthors will then be invited to extend their abstracts (e.g., by<br>\ntranscripts of the discussion and a summary of the discussion's<br>\noutcomes) for inclusion in an EPiC post-proceedings.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES (Anywhere on Earth):</p>\n<p>Submission deadline:       12 May 2017<br>\nNotification:              23 June 2017<br>\nWorkshop:                   6 August 2017<br>\nPost-proceedings deadline: 29 September 2017</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE:</p>\n<p>Franz Baader, TU Dresden<br>\nChristoph Benzmüller, Freie Universität Berlin<br>\nArmin Biere, Johannes Kepler University Linz<br>\nNikolaj Bjørner, Microsoft Research<br>\nJasmin Christian Blanchette, Inria Nancy &amp; Loria<br>\nMaria Paola Bonacina, Università degli Studi di Verona<br>\nPascal Fontaine, Loria, Inria, University of Lorraine<br>\nSilvio Ghilardi, Università degli Studi di Milano<br>\nMartin Giese, University of Oslo<br>\nJürgen Giesl, RWTH Aachen<br>\nAlberto Griggio, FBK-IRST<br>\nReiner Hähnle, TU Darmstadt<br>\nMarijn Heule, The University of Texas at Austin<br>\nLaura Kovács, Vienna University of Technology<br>\nAart Middeldorp, University of Innsbruck<br>\nNeil Murray, SUNY at Albany<br>\nDavid Plaisted, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<br>\nAndrei Popescu, Middlesex University London<br>\nGiles Reger, University of Manchester (co-chair)<br>\nRenate Schmidt, The University of Manchester<br>\nStephan Schulz, DHBW Stuttgart<br>\nGeoff Sutcliffe, University of Miami<br>\nCesare Tinelli, The University of Iowa<br>\nDmitriy Traytel, ETH Zürich (co-chair)<br>\nAndrei Voronkov, The University of Manchester<br>\nChristoph Weidenbach, Max Planck Institute for Informatics</p>",
