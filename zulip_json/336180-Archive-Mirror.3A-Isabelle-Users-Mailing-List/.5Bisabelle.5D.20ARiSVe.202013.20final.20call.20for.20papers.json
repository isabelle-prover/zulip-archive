Relevant topics include but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* specifics of verification-related automated reasoning tasks;<br>\n    * efficient translation of high-level verification conditions to<br>\n      logical languages of automated reasoning tools;</p>\n<p>* handling of the prover's feedback: proofs, models, answer terms;<br>\n    * logical theories of interest for program verification, decision<br>\n      procedures, integration into existing ATP and SMT systems;</p>\n<p>* combination of automated and user-assisted verification;<br>\n    * tool presentations, tool comparisons, and benchmarks;<br>\n    * experience reports on verification of complex algorithms and<br>\n      real-life software with the use of automated reasoning tools.</p>\n<p>Paper Submission and Proceedings</p>\n<p>All submissions are reviewed by the program committee. We expect<br>\n  that one author of every accepted paper will present their work at<br>\n  the workshop.</p>\n<p>Submissions are limited to 6-12 pages in the LaTeX EasyChair format<br>\n  easychair.cls (<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip\">http://www.easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip</a>).<br>\n  Technical details may be included in an appendix to be read at the<br>\n  reviewers' discretion. Tool presentation papers and experience<br>\n  reports are welcome.</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted through EasyChair,<br>\n  at <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arisve2013\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arisve2013</a><br>\n  Submissions must be in PDF format. Electronic version of proceedings<br>\n  will be freely distributed from the workshop web site.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>* Abstract submission deadline: March 8, 2013<br>\n    * Submission deadline: March 15, 2013<br>\n    * Notification: April 10, 2013<br>\n    * Camera ready versions due: May 10, 2013<br>\n    * Workshop: June 10, 2013</p>\n<p>Invited Speaker</p>\n<p>K.
