The purpose of ATVA is to promote research on<br>\ntheoretical and practical aspects of automated analysis, verification and<br>\nsynthesis in East Asia by providing a forum for interaction between the<br>\nregional and the international research communities and industry in the<br>\nfield. The first three ATVA symposia were held in 2003, 2004 and 2005 in<br>\nTaipei, and ATVA 2006 was held in Beijing.</p>\n<p>The Proceedings of ATVA 2007 will be published by Springer as a volume in<br>\nthe LNCS series. Submissions reporting original contributions are solicited<br>\nin all areas of automated verification and analysis.  Please visit the ATVA<br>\n2007 Web site for details not found in this CFP.</p>\n<p>SCOPE</p>\n<p>=====</p>\n<p>The scope of interest is intentionally kept broad; it includes :</p>\n<p>- Theory useful for providing designers with automated support for<br>\nobtaining correct software or hardware systems, including both functional<br>\nand non functional aspects, such as: theory on (timed) automata, Petri-nets,<br>\nconcurrency theory, compositionality, model-checking, automated theorem<br>\nproving, synthesis, performance analysis, correctness-by-construction<br>\nresults, infinite state systems, abstract interpretation, decidability<br>\nresults, parametric analysis or synthesis.</p>\n<p>- Applications of theory in engineering methods and particular domains and<br>\nhandling of practical problems occurring in tools, such</p>\n<p>as: analysis and verification tools, synthesis tools, reducing complexity of<br>\nverification by abstraction, improved representations, handling user level<br>\nnotations, such as UML, practice in industry applications to hardware,<br>\nsoftware or real-time and embedded systems. Case studies, illustrating the<br>\nusefulness of tools or a particular approach are also welcome.</p>\n<p>Theory papers should be motivated by practical problems and applications<br>\nshould be rooted in sound theory. Of particular interest are algorithms on<br>\none hand and methods and tools for integrating formal approaches into<br>\nindustrial practice. Special care should be taken as well to present papers<br>\nin such a way that they are accessible not only to specialists, that is,<br>\njargon need to be defined and intuitive interpretation provided for<br>\ntheories.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>===========</p>\n<p>A submitted paper must contain original contributions, clearly written in<br>\nEnglish, and include comparison with related work.  The authors are advised<br>\nto prepare their manuscripts using the LNCS style.  Each paper should be no<br>\nmore than 15 pages long and be submitted electronically via the ATVA 2007<br>\nWeb site.  Simultaneous submissions to other conferences are not allowed.</p>\n<p>ORGANISATION</p>\n<p>================</p>\n<p>GENERAL CO-CHAIRS:</p>\n<p>Teruo Higashino (Osaka Univ., Japan)</p>\n<p>Yoshio Okamura (STARC, Japan)</p>\n<p>PROGRAM CO-CHAIRS:</p>\n<p>Kedar Namjoshi (Bell Labs, USA)</p>\n<p>Tomohiro Yoneda (National Institute of Informatics, Japan)</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>=================</p>\n<p>Rajeev Alur (University of Pennsylvania)</p>\n<p>Christel Baier (University of Dresden)</p>\n<p>Jonathan Billington (University of South Australia)</p>\n<p>Sung-Deok Cha (Korea Advanced Inst. of Sci. and Techn.)</p>\n<p>Ching-Tsun Chou (Intel)</p>\n<p>Jin Song Dong (National University of Singapore)</p>\n<p>E.
