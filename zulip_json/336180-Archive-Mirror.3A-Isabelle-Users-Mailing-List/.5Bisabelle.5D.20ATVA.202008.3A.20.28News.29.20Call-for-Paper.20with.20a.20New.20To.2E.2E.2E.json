The purpose of ATVA is to promote research </p>\n<p>on theoretical and practical aspects of automated analysis, verification </p>\n<p>and synthesis in East Asia by providing a forum for interaction </p>\n<p>between the regional and the international research communities </p>\n<p>and industry in the field.  </p>\n<p>The first three ATVA symposia were held in 2003, 2004 and 2005 in Taipei.  </p>\n<p>ATVA 2006 and 2007 were held in Beijing and Tokyo.</p>\n<p>The proceedings of ATVA 2008 will be published by Springer </p>\n<p>as a volume in the LNCS series.  Submissions reporting original </p>\n<p>contributions are solicited in all areas of automated verification </p>\n<p>and analysis.  Please visit the ATVA 2008 web site for details </p>\n<p>not found in this CFP.  </p>\n<p>SCOPE</p>\n<p>=====</p>\n<p>The scope of interest is intentionally kept broad; it includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Theory useful for providing designers with automated support for </p>\n<p>obtaining correct software or hardware systems, including both </p>\n<p>functional and non functional aspects, such as: theory on  </p>\n<p>automata, Petri-nets, concurrency theory, compositionality, </p>\n<p>model-checking, automated theorem proving, synthesis, </p>\n<p>performance analysis, correctness-by-construction results, </p>\n<p>infinite state systems, abstract interpretation, </p>\n<p>decidability results, parametric analysis or synthesis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of theory in engineering methods and particular </p>\n<p>domains and handling of practical problems occurring in tools, </p>\n<p>such as: analysis and verification tools, synthesis tools, </p>\n<p>reducing complexity of verification by abstraction, improved </p>\n<p>representations, handling user level notations, such as UML, </p>\n<p>practice in industry applications to hardware, software or real-time </p>\n<p>and embedded systems. Case studies, illustrating the usefulness </p>\n<p>of tools or a particular approach are also welcome.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theory papers should be motivated by practical problems and </p>\n<p>applications should be rooted in sound theory. Of particular interest </p>\n<p>are algorithms on one hand and methods and tools for integrating </p>\n<p>formal approaches into industrial practice. Special care should </p>\n<p>be taken as well to present papers in such a way that they are </p>\n<p>accessible not only to specialists, that is, jargon need to be defined </p>\n<p>and intuitive interpretation provided for theories.  </p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>===========</p>\n<p>A submitted paper must contain original contributions, clearly written </p>\n<p>in English, and include comparison with related work.  The authors </p>\n<p>are advised to prepare their manuscripts using the LNCS style.  </p>\n<p>Simultaneous submissions to other conferences are not allowed.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From 2008, ATVA accepts two types of contributions: RESEARCH PAPERS </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS.  Both types of contributions will appear </p>\n<p>in the proceedings and have oral presentations during the conference.</p>\n<p>Research papers:</p>\n<p>Research papers should contain original research, and sufficient detail </p>\n<p>to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution.  Submissions </p>\n<p>reporting on industrial case studies are welcome, and should describe </p>\n<p>detailed weaknesses and strength in sufficient depth.  Submitted research </p>\n<p>papers should be no more than 15 pages long.  </p>\n<p>Tool demonstration papers:</p>\n<p>Tool demonstration papers present tools based on aforementioned </p>\n<p>technologies or fall into the above application areas.  Tool demonstration </p>\n<p>papers allow researchers to stress the technical and practical side, </p>\n<p>illustrating how one can apply the theoretic contributions in practice.  </p>\n<p>Submitted tool demonstration papers should be no more than 6 pages long.  </p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION</p>\n<p>============</p>\n<p>GENERAL CO-CHAIRS:</p>\n<p>Sungdeok Cha (Korea Univ., Korea)</p>\n<p>Insup Lee (Univ. of Pennsylvania, US)</p>\n<p>PROGRAM CO-CHAIRS:</p>\n<p>Moonzoo Kim (KAIST, Korea)</p>\n<p>Mahesh Viswanathan (UIUC, USA)</p>\n<p>LOCAL ARRANGEMENT CHAIR: </p>\n<p>Jin-Young Choi (Korea Univ., Korea)</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>=================</p>\n<p>Christel Baier (Univ. of Bonn, Germany) </p>\n<p>Jonathan Billington (Univ. of South Australia, Austrailia) </p>\n<p>Byeong-Mo Chang (SookMyung Women University, Korea)</p>\n<p>Yunja Choi (Kyungpook National Univ, Korea)</p>\n<p>Ching-Tsun Chou (Intel, USA) </p>\n<p>Masahiro Fujita (Univ. of Tokyo, Japan) </p>\n<p>Susanne Graf (VERIMAG, France)  </p>\n<p>Wolfgang Grieskamp (Microsoft research, USA) </p>\n<p>Teruo Higashino (Osaka Univ., Japan) </p>\n<p>Franjo Ivancic (NEC Lab, USA)</p>\n<p>Ranjit Jhala (UC San Diego, USA)</p>\n<p>Gihwon Kwon (Kyonggi Univ., Korea)</p>\n<p>Insup Lee  (Univ. of Pennsylvania, USA) </p>\n<p>Shaoying Liu (Hosei Univ., Japan) </p>\n<p>Zhiming Liu (IIST/United Nations Univ., Macao) </p>\n<p>Mila E.
