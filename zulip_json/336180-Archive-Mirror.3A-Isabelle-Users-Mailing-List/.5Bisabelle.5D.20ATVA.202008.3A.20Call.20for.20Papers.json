The purpose of ATVA is to promote research on<br>\ntheoretical and practical aspects of automated analysis, verification and<br>\nsynthesis in East Asia by providing a forum for interaction between the<br>\nregional and the international research communities and industry in the<br>\nfield. The first three ATVA symposia were held in 2003, 2004 and 2005 in<br>\nTaipei. ATVA 2006 and 2007 were held in Beijing and Tokyo.</p>\n<p>The proceedings of ATVA 2008 will be published by Springer as a volume in<br>\nthe LNCS series.  Submissions reporting original contributions are solicited<br>\nin all areas of automated verification and analysis.  Please visit the ATVA<br>\n2008 web site for details not found in this CFP.  </p>\n<p>SCOPE</p>\n<p>=====</p>\n<p>The scope of interest is intentionally kept broad; it includes :</p>\n<p>- Theory useful for providing designers with automated support for<br>\nobtaining correct software or hardware systems, including both functional<br>\nand non functional aspects, such as: theory on (timed) automata, Petri-nets,<br>\nconcurrency theory, compositionality, model-checking, automated theorem<br>\nproving, synthesis, performance analysis, correctness-by-construction<br>\nresults, infinite state systems, abstract interpretation, decidability<br>\nresults, parametric analysis or synthesis.</p>\n<p>- Applications of theory in engineering methods and particular domains and<br>\nhandling of practical problems occurring in tools, such as: analysis and<br>\nverification tools, synthesis tools, reducing complexity of verification by<br>\nabstraction, improved representations, handling user level notations, such<br>\nas UML, practice in industry applications to hardware, software or real-time<br>\nand embedded systems. Case studies, illustrating the usefulness of tools or<br>\na particular approach are also welcome.</p>\n<p>Theory papers should be motivated by practical problems and applications<br>\nshould be rooted in sound theory. Of particular interest are algorithms on<br>\none hand and methods and tools for integrating formal approaches into<br>\nindustrial practice. Special care should be taken as well to present papers<br>\nin such a way that they are accessible not only to specialists, that is,<br>\njargon need to be defined and intuitive interpretation provided for<br>\ntheories.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>===========</p>\n<p>A submitted paper must contain original contributions, clearly written in<br>\nEnglish, and include comparison with related work.  The authors are advised<br>\nto prepare their manuscripts using the LNCS style.  Each paper should be no<br>\nmore than 15 pages long and be submitted electronically via the ATVA 2008<br>\nWeb site.  Simultaneous submissions to other conferences are not allowed.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION</p>\n<p>================</p>\n<p>GENERAL CO-CHAIRS:</p>\n<p>Sungdeok Cha (KAIST, Korea)</p>\n<p>Insup Lee (Univ. of Pennsylvania, US)</p>\n<p>PROGRAM CO-CHAIRS:</p>\n<p>Moonzoo Kim (KAIST, Korea)</p>\n<p>Mahesh Viswanathan (UIUC, USA)</p>\n<p>LOCAL ARRANGEMENT CHAIR: </p>\n<p>Jin-Young Choi (Korea Univ., Korea)</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>=================</p>\n<p>Christel Baier (Univ. of Bonn, Germany) </p>\n<p>Jonathan Billington (Univ. of South Australia, Austrailia) </p>\n<p>Byeong-Mo Chang (SookMyung Women University, Korea)</p>\n<p>Yunja Choi (Kyungpook National Univ, Korea)</p>\n<p>Ching-Tsun Chou (Intel, USA) </p>\n<p>Masahiro Fujita (Univ. of Tokyo, Japan) </p>\n<p>Susanne Graf (VERIMAG, France)  </p>\n<p>Wolfgang Grieskamp (Microsoft research, USA) </p>\n<p>Teruo Higashino (Osaka Univ., Japan) </p>\n<p>Franjo Ivancic (NEC Lab, USA)</p>\n<p>Ranjit Jhala (UC San Diego, USA)</p>\n<p>Gihwon Kwon (Kyonggi Univ., Korea)</p>\n<p>Insup Lee  (Univ. of Pennsylvania, USA) </p>\n<p>Shaoying Liu (Hosei Univ., Japan) </p>\n<p>Zhiming Liu (IIST/United Nations Univ., Macao) </p>\n<p>Mila E.
