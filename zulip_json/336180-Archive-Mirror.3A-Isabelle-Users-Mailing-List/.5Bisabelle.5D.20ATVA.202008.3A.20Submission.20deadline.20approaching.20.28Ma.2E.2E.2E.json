The purpose of ATVA is to promote research on</p>\n<p>theoretical and practical aspects of automated analysis, verification and</p>\n<p>synthesis in East Asia by providing a forum for interaction between the</p>\n<p>regional and the international research communities and industry in the<br>\nfield.</p>\n<p>The first three ATVA symposia were held in 2003, 2004 and 2005 in Taipei.<br>\nATVA</p>\n<p>2006 and 2007 were held in Beijing and Tokyo.</p>\n<p>The proceedings of ATVA 2008 will be published by Springer as a volume in<br>\nthe</p>\n<p>LNCS series.  Submissions reporting original contributions are solicited in<br>\nall</p>\n<p>areas of automated verification and analysis.  Please visit the ATVA 2008<br>\nweb</p>\n<p>site for details not found in this CFP.  </p>\n<p>SCOPE</p>\n<p>=====</p>\n<p>The scope of interest is intentionally kept broad; it includes:</p>\n<p>- Theory useful for providing designers with automated support for<br>\nobtaining</p>\n<p>correct software or hardware systems, including both functional and non</p>\n<p>functional aspects, such as: theory on (timed) automata, Petri-nets,</p>\n<p>concurrency theory, compositionality, model-checking, automated theorem</p>\n<p>proving, synthesis, performance analysis, correctness-by-construction</p>\n<p>results, infinite state systems, abstract interpretation, decidability</p>\n<p>results, parametric analysis or synthesis.</p>\n<p>- Applications of theory in engineering methods and particular domains and</p>\n<p>handling of practical problems occurring in tools, such as: analysis and</p>\n<p>verification tools, synthesis tools, reducing complexity of verification<br>\nby</p>\n<p>abstraction, improved representations, handling user level notations,<br>\nsuch</p>\n<p>as UML, practice in industry applications to hardware, software or</p>\n<p>real-time and embedded systems. Case studies, illustrating the<br>\nusefulness</p>\n<p>of tools or a particular approach are also welcome.</p>\n<p>Theory papers should be motivated by practical problems and applications<br>\nshould</p>\n<p>be rooted in sound theory. Of particular interest are algorithms on one hand</p>\n<p>and methods and tools for integrating formal approaches into industrial</p>\n<p>practice. Special care should be taken as well to present papers in such a<br>\nway</p>\n<p>that they are accessible not only to specialists, that is, jargon need to be</p>\n<p>defined and intuitive interpretation provided for theories.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>===========</p>\n<p>A submitted paper must contain original contributions, clearly written in</p>\n<p>English, and include comparison with related work.  The authors are advised<br>\nto</p>\n<p>prepare their manuscripts using the LNCS style.  Simultaneous submissions to</p>\n<p>other conferences are not allowed.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From 2008, ATVA accepts two types of contributions: RESEARCH PAPERS and TOOL</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>DEMONSTRATION PAPERS.  Both types of contributions will appear in the</p>\n<p>proceedings and have oral presentations during the conference.</p>\n<p>Research papers:</p>\n<p>Research papers should contain original research, and sufficient detail to</p>\n<p>assess the merits and relevance of the contribution.  Submissions reporting<br>\non</p>\n<p>industrial case studies are welcome, and should describe detailed weaknesses</p>\n<p>and strength in sufficient depth.  Submitted research papers should be no<br>\nmore</p>\n<p>than 15 pages long.</p>\n<p>Tool demonstration papers:</p>\n<p>Tool demonstration papers present tools based on aforementioned technologies<br>\nor</p>\n<p>fall into the above application areas.  Tool demonstration papers allow</p>\n<p>researchers to stress the technical and practical side, illustrating how one</p>\n<p>can apply the theoretic contributions in practice.  Submitted tool</p>\n<p>demonstration papers should be no more than 6 pages long. </p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION</p>\n<p>================</p>\n<p>GENERAL CO-CHAIRS:</p>\n<p>Sungdeok Cha (Korea Univ., Korea)</p>\n<p>Insup Lee (Univ. of Pennsylvania, US)</p>\n<p>PROGRAM CO-CHAIRS:</p>\n<p>Moonzoo Kim (KAIST, Korea)</p>\n<p>Mahesh Viswanathan (UIUC, USA)</p>\n<p>LOCAL ARRANGEMENT CHAIR: </p>\n<p>Jin-Young Choi (Korea Univ., Korea)</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>=================</p>\n<p>Christel Baier (Univ. of Bonn, Germany) </p>\n<p>Jonathan Billington (Univ. of South Australia, Austrailia) </p>\n<p>Byeong-Mo Chang (SookMyung Women University, Korea)</p>\n<p>Yunja Choi (Kyungpook National Univ, Korea)</p>\n<p>Ching-Tsun Chou (Intel, USA) </p>\n<p>Masahiro Fujita (Univ. of Tokyo, Japan) </p>\n<p>Susanne Graf (VERIMAG, France)  </p>\n<p>Wolfgang Grieskamp (Microsoft research, USA) </p>\n<p>Teruo Higashino (Osaka Univ., Japan) </p>\n<p>Franjo Ivancic (NEC Lab, USA)</p>\n<p>Ranjit Jhala (UC San Diego, USA)</p>\n<p>Gihwon Kwon (Kyonggi Univ., Korea)</p>\n<p>Insup Lee  (Univ. of Pennsylvania, USA) </p>\n<p>Shaoying Liu (Hosei Univ., Japan) </p>\n<p>Zhiming Liu (IIST/United Nations Univ., Macao) </p>\n<p>Mila E.
