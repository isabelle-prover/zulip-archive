The proceedings of ATVA 2009 will be<br>\npublished by Springer as a volume in the LNCS series.</p>\n<p>SCOPE:</p>\n<p>The scope of interest is intentionally kept broad; it includes:</p>\n<p>-- Theory useful for providing designers with automated support for<br>\n    obtaining correct software or hardware systems, including both<br>\n    functional and non functional aspects, such as: theory of (timed<br>\n    and hybrid) automata, process calculi, Petri-nets, concurrency<br>\n    theory, compositionality, model-checking, automated theorem<br>\n    proving, synthesis, performance analysis,<br>\n    correctness-by-construction, infinite state systems, abstract<br>\n    interpretation, decidability results, parametric analysis or<br>\n    synthesis.</p>\n<p>-- Applications of theory in engineering methods and other particular<br>\n    domains and handling of practical problems occurring in tools,<br>\n    such as analysis and verification tools, synthesis tools, model<br>\n    transformation tools. Techniques of reducing complexity of<br>\n    verification by abstraction, improved representations. Methods and<br>\n    tools in handling user level notations, such as UML. Practice in<br>\n    industrial applications to hardware, software or real-time and<br>\n    embedded systems. Case studies, illustrating the usefulness of<br>\n    tools or a particular approach are also welcome.</p>\n<p>Theory papers should be motivated by practical problems and<br>\napplications should be rooted in sound theory. We are interested both<br>\nin algorithms and in methods and tools for integrating formal<br>\napproaches into industrial practice.</p>\n<p>Submissions: Submissions to the conference must not have been<br>\npublished or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All<br>\nsubmissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution<br>\nto the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the<br>\nconference.  ATVA 2009 calls for two types of contributions: RESEARCH<br>\nPAPERS and TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS.  Both types of contributions<br>\nwill appear in the proceedings and have oral presentations at the<br>\nconference. Papers should be written in English in LNCS format.</p>\n<p>Research papers:<br>\nResearch papers should contain original research, and sufficient<br>\ndetail to assess the mer its and relevance of the<br>\ncontribution. Submissions reporting on industrial case studies are<br>\nwelcome, and should describe both strengths and weaknesses in<br>\nsufficient depth.  Research papers should be no more than 15 pages.</p>\n<p>Tool demonstration papers:<br>\nTool demonstration papers present tools based on aforementioned<br>\ntheories or fall into the above application areas. Tool demonstration<br>\npapers allow researchers to stress the technical and practical side,<br>\nillustrating how one can apply the theoretic contributions in<br>\npractice. Tool demonstration papers should be no more than 6 pages.</p>\n<p>Submission Procedure: Further information and instruction about<br>\nsubmission can be found at the conference website<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.iist.unu.edu/atva09\">http://www.iist.unu.edu/atva09</a>.</p>\n<p>Important Dates:<br>\npaper submission: 1 May 2009,<br>\nnotification of acceptance: 15 June 2009,<br>\nfinal copy for proceedings: 29 June 2009,<br>\nATVA 2009: 14-16 October 2009.</p>\n<p>General Chair<br>\nChris George, UNU-IIST, Macao</p>\n<p>Program Chairs<br>\nZhiming Liu, UNU-IIST, Macao<br>\nAnders P.
