The subject is to be interpreted broadly  and inclusively. It covers all aspects of automated verification, including model  checking, theorem proving, SAT/SMT constraint solving, abstract interpretation,  and refinement pertaining to various types of critical systems which need to meet  stringent dependability requirements (safety-critical, security-critical, business- critical, performance-critical, etc). Contributions that describe different  techniques, or industrial case studies are encouraged. The technical programme  will consist of invited and contributed talks and also allow for short presentations  of on going work. The workshop will be relatively informal, with an emphasis  on discussion. </p>\n<p>Invited Speakers<br>\n•  Janet Barnes (Altran Praxis)<br>\n•  Tom Maibaum (McMaster University) - FME invited lecture</p>\n<p>Topics include (but are not limited to)<br>\n•   Model Checking,<br>\n•   Automatic and Interactive Theorem Proving,<br>\n•   SAT, SMT or constraint solving for Verification,<br>\n•   Abstract Interpretation,<br>\n•   Specification and Refinement,<br>\n•   Requirements Capture and Analysis,<br>\n•   Verification of Software and Hardware,<br>\n•   Verification of Security-Critical Systems,<br>\n•   Specification and Verification of Fault Tolerance and Resilience, <br>\n•   Probabilistic and Real-Time Systems,<br>\n•   Dependable Systems,<br>\n•   Verified System Development, and<br>\n•   Industrial Applications.</p>\n<p>Important Dates:<br>\nSubmission of Short Papers: 15th August 2011 </p>\n<p>Organisation Committee<br>\nJens Bendisposto (Dusseldorf)<br>\nCliff Jones (Newcastle)<br>\nMichael Leuschel (Dusseldorf)<br>\nAlexander Romanovsky (Newcastle)</p>\n<p>Program Committee<br>\nJens Bendisposto (Dusseldorf)<br>\nMichael Goldsmith (Warwick)<br>\nIan Hayes (Queensland)<br>\nCliff Jones (Newcastle)<br>\nMichael Leuschel (Dusseldorf)<br>\nFelix Loesch (BOSCH)<br>\nGerald Luettgen (Bamberg)<br>\nUrsula Martin (Queen Mary)<br>\nStephan Merz (INRIA Nancy)<br>\nAlice Miller (Glasgow)<br>\nMarkus Roggenbach (Swansea)<br>\nAlexander Romanovsky (Newcastle)<br>\nThomas Santen (Microsoft)<br>\nAntonio Casimiro Costa (Lisboa)<br>\nSebastian Wieczorek (SAP)<br>\nJim Woodcock (York)</p>\n<p>Sponsors: DEPLOY, FME, Microsoft, CSR</p>\n<p>Microsoft is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation</p>",
