The<br>\nsubject is to be interpreted broadly and inclusively. It covers all<br>\naspects of automated verification, including model checking, theorem<br>\nproving, abstract interpretation, and refinement pertaining to various<br>\ntypes of critical systems (safety-critical, security-critical,<br>\nbusiness-critical, performance-critical, etc.). Contributions that<br>\ndescribe different techniques, or industrial case studies are<br>\nencouraged.</p>\n<p>The technical programme will consist of invited talks and contributed<br>\ntalks and will also allow for short presentations of ongoing work. The<br>\nworkshop will be relatively informal, with an emphasis on discussion.</p>\n<p>Previous AVoCS workshops were held at the University of Oxford (2001<br>\nand 2007), the University of Birmingham (2002), the University of<br>\nSouthampton (2003), the Royal Society in London (2004), the University<br>\nof Warwick (2005), LORIA, Nancy (2006) and the University of Glasgow<br>\n(2008).</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Model Checking,</li>\n<li>Automatic and Interactive Theorem Proving,</li>\n<li>Abstract Interpretation,</li>\n<li>Specification and Refinement,</li>\n<li>Requirements Capture and Analysis,</li>\n<li>Verification of Software and Hardware,</li>\n<li>Verification of Security-Critical Systems,</li>\n<li>Probabilistic and Real-Time Systems,</li>\n<li>Verified System Development, and</li>\n<li>Industrial Applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ulrich Berger, Swansea, United Kingdom: Program Extraction from Proofs</li>\n<li>Christoph LÃ¼th, Bremen, Germany: User Interfaces for Theorem Provers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PUBLICATIONS</p>\n<p>At the workshop, a draft of the workshop proceedings will be available<br>\nin the form of a</p>\n<p>Technical Report</p>\n<p>of Swansea University; this report will also include the short<br>\ncontributions.</p>\n<p>After the workshop, the authors of accepted papers will have about one<br>\nmonth in order to revise their papers for publication in the workshop<br>\nproceedings which will appear in the</p>\n<p>Electronic Communications of the EASST<br>\n<a href=\"http://eceasst.cs.tu-berlin.de/index.php/eceasst\">http://eceasst.cs.tu-berlin.de/index.php/eceasst</a>.</p>\n<p>The authors of a selection of the best papers presented at the<br>\nworkshop will be invited to submit extended versions of their work for<br>\npublication in a special issue of Elsevier's journal</p>\n<p>Science of Computer Programming<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505623/description\">http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505623/description</a></p>\n<p>(Guest editor: Markus Roggenbach).</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>David Aspinall, Edinburgh, United Kingdom</li>\n<li>Muffy Calder, Glasgow, United Kingdom</li>\n<li>Michael Goldsmith, Warwick, United Kingdom</li>\n<li>\n<p>Constance Heitmeyer, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC,  <br>\nUnited States</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gerald Luettgen, York, United Kingdom</p>\n</li>\n<li>Eric Mercer, Brigham Young University, Utah, United States</li>\n<li>Stephan Merz, INRIA, Nancy, France</li>\n<li>Alice Miller, Glasgow, United Kingdom</li>\n<li>Paritosh Pandya, IIT Mumbai, India</li>\n<li>Silvio Ranise, Verona, Italy</li>\n<li>Mark Ryan, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom</li>\n<li>Markus Roggenbach (Chair), Swansea, United Kingdom</li>\n<li>Helen Treharne, Surrey, United Kingdom</li>\n<li>Markus Wenzel, TU Muenchen, Germany</li>\n<li>Sergio Yovine, Verimag, France</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>26 June 2009<br>\n    Deadline for submission of full papers<br>\n24 July 2009<br>\n    Author notification for full papers<br>\n27 July 2009<br>\n    Deadline for submission of short contributions<br>\n31 July 2009<br>\n    Author notification for short contributions<br>\n28 August 2009<br>\n    Deadline for final version of full papers &amp; short contributions<br>\n23-25 September 2009<br>\n    Workshop</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION OF FULL PAPERS</p>\n<p>Submissions of full papers to the workshop must not have been<br>\npublished or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere.<br>\nAll submissions will be peer-reviewed and judged on the basis of<br>\noriginality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation<br>\nquality, and relevance to the workshop. Papers must be written in<br>\nEnglish and not exceed 15 pages in the EASST format.</p>\n<p>Submission will be organized via EasyChair. The links to the<br>\nweb-interface as well as to the EASST latex style will be announced in<br>\ndue course.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION OF SHORT CONTRIBUTIONS</p>\n<p>AVoCS 09 encourages the submissions of short contributions in order to<br>\nstimulate discussions at the workshop. Reports on ongoing work or<br>\nsurveys on work published elsewhere are welcome. The Programme<br>\nCommittee will select short contributions on the basis of submitted<br>\nabstracts according to significance and general interest. Short<br>\ncontributions must be written in English and not exceed 2 pages in the<br>\nEASST format. Short contributions will be included in the Technical<br>\nReport available at the conference, however, they will not be part of<br>\nthe Workshop Proceedings published by EASST.</p>\n<p>Submission will be organized via EasyChair. The links to the<br>\nweb-interface as well as to the EASST latex style will be announced in<br>\ndue course.</p>\n<p>LOCATION AND ACCOMMODATION</p>\n<p>AVoCS 2009 will be organised by Swansea University and held at the<br>\nconference centre Gregynog. Gregynog is situated six miles north of<br>\nNewtown in Mid Wales. It is surrounded by the beautiful<br>\nMontgomeryshire countryside and Gregynog Hall is set in fabulously<br>\nlandscaped gardens that provide extensive grounds for peace and<br>\nrelaxation. The conference centre will host all participants of the<br>\nworkshop and will provide all catering.</p>\n<p>The workshop will start on Wednesday 23/09/2009 with lunch and<br>\nconclude on Friday 25/09/2009 with lunch.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION</p>\n<p>The local organisers are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Erwin R.
