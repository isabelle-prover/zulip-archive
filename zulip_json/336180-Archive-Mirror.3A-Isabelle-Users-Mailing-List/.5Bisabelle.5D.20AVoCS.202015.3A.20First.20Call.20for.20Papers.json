It covers <br>\n  all aspects of automated verification, including model checking, <br>\n  theorem proving, SAT/SMT constraint solving, abstract interpretation, <br>\n  and refinement pertaining to various types of critical systems which <br>\n  need to meet stringent dependability requirements (safety-critical, <br>\n  business-critical, performance-critical, etc.). Contributions that <br>\n  describe different techniques, or industrial case studies are encouraged. </p>\n<p>The technical programme will consist of invited and contributed talks <br>\n  and also allow for short presentations of research ideas. The workshop <br>\n  will be relatively informal, with an emphasis on discussion where special <br>\n  discussion sessions will be organised around the research ideas presentations. <br>\n  Topics include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<p>- Model Checking<br>\n    - Automatic and Interactive Theorem Proving<br>\n    - SAT, SMT or Constraint Solving for Verification<br>\n    - Abstract Interpretation<br>\n    - Specification and Refinement<br>\n    - Requirements Capture and Analysis<br>\n    - Verification of Software and Hardware<br>\n    - Specification and Verification of Fault Tolerance and Resilience<br>\n    - Probabilistic and Real-Time Systems<br>\n    - Dependable Systems<br>\n    - Verified System Development<br>\n    - Industrial Applications</p>\n<p>WORKSHOPS<br>\n  AI4FM 2015: 1 September 2015 -- <a href=\"http://www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2015/\">www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2015/</a></p>\n<p>VENUE<br>\n  The event will be held in the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences <br>\n  (ICMS) in the centre of the historic old town of Edinburgh - an UNESCO world<br>\n  heritage site. </p>\n<p>STUDENT GRANTS<br>\n  Thanks to sponsorships from FME and SICSA we can offer financial support for a <br>\n  limited number of students registering for AVoCS in the form of a registration <br>\n  fee waiver (full or partial). As this is limited, we ask the students that <br>\n  would like to take the advantage of this support to submit a short application. <br>\n  The details on how to apply will be available in due course from the AVoCS <br>\n  webpage.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION DETAILS<br>\n   Submissions of full papers to the workshop must not have been published <br>\n   or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions <br>\n   will be peer-reviewed and judged on the basis of originality, contribution <br>\n   to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the <br>\n   workshop. Submissions are handled via Easychair: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=avocs2015\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=avocs2015</a></p>\n<p>The papers must be written in English and not exceed 15 pages and should <br>\n   use the dedicated AVoCS 2015 EASST template available rom the the <br>\n   following link (for LaTeX and Word):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/eceasst\">http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/eceasst</a></p>\n<p>AVoCS also encourages the submissions of research ideas in order to stimulate <br>\n   discussions at the workshop. Reports on ongoing work or surveys on work <br>\n   published elsewhere are welcome. The Programme Committee will select <br>\n   research ideas on the basis of submitted abstracts according to significance <br>\n   and general interest. Research ideas must be written in English and not exceed <br>\n   2 pages using the EASST template. The presentation of these ideas will be organised <br>\n   around discussions, where the presenter should also prepare a set of question in <br>\n   which the audience will discuss.</p>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS<br>\n  At the workshop, pre-proceedings will be available in the form of a Heriot-Watt <br>\n  University Technical Report; this report will also include the research ideas.<br>\n  After the workshop, the authors of accepted full papers will have about one <br>\n  month in order to revise their papers for publication in the workshop post-<br>\n  proceedings which will appear in the Electronic Communications of the EASST <br>\n  Open Access Journal. Research ideas will not be part of the proceedings in the <br>\n  Open Access Journal.</p>\n<p>SPECIAL SCP JOURNAL ISSUE<br>\n  Authors of a selection of the best papers presented at the workshop will be <br>\n  invited to submit extended versions of their work for publication in a <br>\n  special issue of Elsevier's journal Science of Computer Programming.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE  <br>\n  Ernie Cohen, University of Pennsylvania, USA<br>\n  Ewen Denney, NASA Ames, USA<br>\n  Jean-Christophe Filliatre, CNRS, France<br>\n  Michael Goldsmith, University of Oxford, UK<br>\n  Gudmund Grov, Heriot-Watt University, UK (co-chair)<br>\n  Keijo Heljanko, Aalto University, Finland<br>\n  Mike Hinchey, University of Limerick, Ireland<br>\n  Marieke Huisman, University of Twente, Netherlands<br>\n  Andrew Ireland, Heriot-Watt University, UK (co-chair)<br>\n  Gerwin Klein, NICTA/UNSW, Australia<br>\n  Thierry Lecomte, ClearSy, France<br>\n  Peter Gorm Larsen, Aarhus University, Denmark <br>\n  Panagiotis (Pete) Manolios, Northeastern University, USA<br>\n  Stephan Merz, INRIA Nancy &amp; LORIA, France<br>\n  Jaco van de Pol, University of Twente, Netherlands<br>\n  Markus Roggenbach, Swansea University, UK<br>\n  Marco Roveri, FBK, Italy<br>\n  Thomas Santen, Microsoft Research, Germany<br>\n  Bernard Steffen, Technical University Dortmund, Germany<br>\n  Jan Strejček, Masaryk University, Czech Republic<br>\n  Jun Sun, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore<br>\n  Tayssir Touili, LIAFA, CNRS &amp; University Paris Diderot, France<br>\n  Helen Treharne, University of Surrey, UK<br>\n  Laurent Voisin, Systerel, France<br>\n  Angela Wallenburg, Altran, UK<br>\n  John Wickerson, Imperial College London, UK<br>\n  Peter Ölveczky, University of Oslo, Norway</p>\n<p>ORGANISERS <br>\n  Gudmund Grov, Heriot-Watt University, UK<br>\n  Andrew Ireland, Heriot-Watt University, UK<br>\n  Yuhui Lin, Heriot-Watt University, UK (Local arrangements and publicity chair)</p>\n<p>STEERING COMMITTEE <br>\n  Michael Goldsmith, University of Oxford, UK<br>\n  Stephan Merz, INRIA Nancy &amp; LORIA, France<br>\n  Markus Roggenbach, Swansea University, UK</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We invite research leaders and ambitious early career researchers to <br>\njoin us in leading and driving research in key inter-disciplinary themes. <br>\nPlease see <a href=\"http://www.hw.ac.uk/researchleaders\">www.hw.ac.uk/researchleaders</a> for further information and how<br>\nto apply.</p>\n<p>Heriot-Watt University is a Scottish charity<br>\nregistered under charity number SC000278.</p>",
