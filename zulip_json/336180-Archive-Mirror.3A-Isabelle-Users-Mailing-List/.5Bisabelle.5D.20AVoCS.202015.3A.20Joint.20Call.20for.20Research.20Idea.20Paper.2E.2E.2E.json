Reports on ongoing work or surveys on work <br>\n  published elsewhere are welcome. The Programme Committee will select <br>\n  research ideas on the basis of submitted abstracts according to significance <br>\n  and general interest. The subject of the ideas is to be interpreted broadly <br>\n  and inclusively. It covers all aspects of automated verification, including <br>\n  model checking, theorem proving, SAT/SMT constraint solving, abstract <br>\n  interpretation, and refinement pertaining to various types of critical <br>\n  systems which need to meet stringent dependability requirements <br>\n  (safety-critical, business-critical, performance-critical, etc.). Contributions <br>\n  that describe different techniques, or industrial case studies are encouraged. <br>\n  Topics include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<p>- Model Checking<br>\n    - Automatic and Interactive Theorem Proving<br>\n    - SAT, SMT or Constraint Solving for Verification<br>\n    - Abstract Interpretation<br>\n    - Specification and Refinement<br>\n    - Requirements Capture and Analysis<br>\n    - Verification of Software and Hardware<br>\n    - Specification and Verification of Fault Tolerance and Resilience<br>\n    - Probabilistic and Real-Time Systems<br>\n    - Dependable Systems<br>\n    - Verified System Development<br>\n    - Industrial Applications</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\n  Submission of research idea papers: 10th August 2015<br>\n  Submission of student grant application: 10th August 2015<br>\n  Notification (research idea): 14th August 2015<br>\n  Early registration: 18th August 2015<br>\n  Submissions of final versions: 21st August 2015 </p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>\n  Colin O'Halloran (D-RisQ &amp; the University of Oxford)<br>\n  Don Sannella (Contemplate &amp; the University of Edinburgh)  </p>\n<p>WORKSHOPS<br>\n  AI4FM 2015: 1 September 2015 -- <a href=\"http://www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2015/\">www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2015/</a><br>\n  including invited talk by J Strother Moore (Univerity of Texas at Austin)</p>\n<p>VENUE<br>\n  The event will be held in the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences <br>\n  (ICMS) in the centre of the historic old town of Edinburgh - an UNESCO world<br>\n  heritage site. </p>\n<p>SUBMISSION DETAILS<br>\n  Research ideas must be written in English and not exceed 2 pages using the <br>\n  dedicated AVoCS 2015 EASST template available from the the following link <br>\n  (for LaTeX and Word):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/public/template/\">http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/public/template/</a></p>\n<p>The presentation of these ideas will be organised around discussions, where the <br>\n  presenter should also prepare a set of question in which the audience will discuss.<br>\n  Submissions are handled via Easychair: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=avocs2015\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=avocs2015</a></p>\n<p>The research ideas will be included in the pre-proceedings, which will be available <br>\n  in the form of a Heriot-Watt University Technical Report and will be available at the<br>\n  workhsop.</p>\n<p>STUDENT GRANTS<br>\n  Thanks to sponsorships from Altran, FME and SICSA we can offer financial <br>\n  support for a limited number of students registering for AVoCS in the form<br>\n  of a registration fee waiver (full or partial). As this is limited, we <br>\n  ask the students that would like to take the advantage of this support <br>\n  to submit a short application. The details on how to apply is available<br>\n  from AVoCS webpage.</p>\n<p>SPECIAL SCP JOURNAL ISSUE<br>\n  Authors of a selection of the best papers presented at the workshop will be <br>\n  invited to submit extended versions of their work for publication in a <br>\n  special issue of Elsevier's journal Science of Computer Programming.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE  <br>\n  Ernie Cohen, University of Pennsylvania, USA<br>\n  Ewen Denney, NASA Ames, USA<br>\n  Jean-Christophe Filliatre, CNRS, France<br>\n  Michael Goldsmith, University of Oxford, UK<br>\n  Gudmund Grov, Heriot-Watt University, UK (co-chair)<br>\n  Keijo Heljanko, Aalto University, Finland<br>\n  Mike Hinchey, University of Limerick, Ireland<br>\n  Marieke Huisman, University of Twente, Netherlands<br>\n  Andrew Ireland, Heriot-Watt University, UK (co-chair)<br>\n  Gerwin Klein, NICTA/UNSW, Australia<br>\n  Thierry Lecomte, ClearSy, France<br>\n  Yuhui Lin, Heriot-Watt University, UK<br>\n  Peter Gorm Larsen, Aarhus University, Denmark <br>\n  Panagiotis (Pete) Manolios, Northeastern University, USA<br>\n  Stephan Merz, INRIA Nancy &amp; LORIA, France<br>\n  Jaco van de Pol, University of Twente, Netherlands<br>\n  Markus Roggenbach, Swansea University, UK<br>\n  Marco Roveri, FBK, Italy<br>\n  Thomas Santen, Microsoft Research, Germany<br>\n  Bernard Steffen, Technical University Dortmund, Germany<br>\n  Jan Strejček, Masaryk University, Czech Republic<br>\n  Jun Sun, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore<br>\n  Tayssir Touili, LIAFA, CNRS &amp; University Paris Diderot, France<br>\n  Helen Treharne, University of Surrey, UK<br>\n  Laurent Voisin, Systerel, France<br>\n  Angela Wallenburg, Altran, UK<br>\n  John Wickerson, Imperial College London, UK<br>\n  Peter Ölveczky, University of Oslo, Norway</p>\n<p>ORGANISERS <br>\n  Gudmund Grov, Heriot-Watt University, UK<br>\n  Andrew Ireland, Heriot-Watt University, UK<br>\n  Yuhui Lin, Heriot-Watt University, UK (local arrangements and publicity chair)</p>\n<p>STEERING COMMITTEE <br>\n  Michael Goldsmith, University of Oxford, UK<br>\n  Stephan Merz, INRIA Nancy &amp; LORIA, France<br>\n  Markus Roggenbach, Swansea University, UK</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We invite research leaders and ambitious early career researchers to <br>\njoin us in leading and driving research in key inter-disciplinary themes. <br>\nPlease see <a href=\"http://www.hw.ac.uk/researchleaders\">www.hw.ac.uk/researchleaders</a> for further information and how<br>\nto apply.</p>\n<p>Heriot-Watt University is a Scottish charity<br>\nregistered under charity number SC000278.</p>",
