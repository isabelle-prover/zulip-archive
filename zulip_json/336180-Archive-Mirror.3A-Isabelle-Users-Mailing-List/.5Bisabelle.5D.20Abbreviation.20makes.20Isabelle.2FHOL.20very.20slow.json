Unfolding these simple <br>\nabbreviations is no problem. But abbreviations as general as these could <br>\nbe folded anywhere, making it impossible to print.</p>\n<p>I think you might want to try abbreviation(input) rather than <br>\nabbreviation. You can define any of these abbreviations safely for input.</p>\n<p>That will allow you to type \"flip\" wherever you like, but it will <br>\ndisappear in output.</p>\n<p>In general, I find abbreviation(input) a very useful mechanism, and I <br>\nuse it by default rather than abbreviation.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n     Thomas.</p>",
