This is my second message to the list.<br>\nI've been using Isabelle to prove some HasCASL specifications and until now<br>\nI only had to use the Isar apply method.<br>\nI've already read the Isabelle Tutorial when I started working with the<br>\ntool.</p>\n<p>Recently I was told that I need to create lemmas over an axiom to put the<br>\nlast in such a way Isabelle can match it against the actual premises.<br>\nI've searched for a HOL BNF but I could not find it. I need to know what<br>\nexactly can be written in lemma/theorems, inside double quotes (the lemma<br>\nitself). I took a look in the logics-HOL.pdf but I didn't find the BNF, only<br>\nrules of the logic. As I'm not sure if I'm looking for HOL inner syntax or<br>\nIsar syntax, I had to ask you some help to find the right doc.</p>\n<p>The motivation to get the BNF is this:<br>\nI have this axiom:<br>\nEqualTransT [rule_format] :<br>\n\"ALL x.<br>\n ALL y.<br>\n ALL z. x ==' y = True' &amp; y ==' z = True' --&gt; x ==' z = True'\"</p>\n<p>And I need to prove this goal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(!!(x (y z)).<br>\n        ([| ((x ==' y) = True'); ((y ==' z) = True');<br>\n            ((x &lt;' z) = False');<br>\n            ((x ==' z) = False') |]<br>\n         ==&gt; False))</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I thought I should write some lemma as this one:<br>\nlemma L1:<br>\n\"ALL x.<br>\n ALL y.<br>\n ALL z.<br>\n[| [|(x ==' y) = True' ; (y ==' z) = True'|] ==&gt; (x ==' z) = True'; (x =='<br>\nz) = False'|]==&gt; False\"</p>\n<p>but I always get an inner syntax error and I cannot see where the error is.</p>\n<p>Even this lemma cannot pass:<br>\nlemma L1:<br>\n\"ALL x.<br>\n ALL z.<br>\n[| (x ==' z) = True'; (x ==' z) = False'|] ==&gt; False\"</p>\n<p>So I guess I need some doc to learn the correct HOL inner syntax (I guess)<br>\nand I could not found it.</p>\n<p>I'd be very thankful if you can give me some advices.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,<br>\nGlauber.</p>",

The meta logic uses type \"prop\" for propositions,<br>\nwhereas HOL uses type \"bool\".  There is a coercion from bool to prop<br>\n(called \"Trueprop\", but usually implicit).  However, there is no<br>\ncoercion from prop to bool.  Therefore connectives of the meta logic<br>\n(e.g., ==, ==&gt;, !!) which yield type prop cannot occur nested below HOL<br>\nconnectives (e.g., =, --&gt;, ALL).</p>\n<p>Also note that [| P; ...; Q |] ==&gt; R is merely an abbreviation for<br>\nP ==&gt; (... ==&gt; (Q ==&gt; R)).</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nTjark</p>",
