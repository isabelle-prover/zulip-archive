By briefly checking the Isabelle library, it seems that we have infinite sums in HOL/Series.thy:</p>\n<p>definition sums :: \"(nat ⇒ 'a::{topological_space, comm_monoid_add}) ⇒ 'a ⇒ bool\"<br>\n    (infixr \"sums\" 80)<br>\n  where \"f sums s ⟷ (λn. ∑i&lt;n. f i) ⇢ s”</p>\n<p>And some developments about infinite products in HOL/Analysis/Infinite_Product.thy:</p>\n<p>definition convergent_prod :: \"(nat ⇒ 'a :: {t2_space,comm_semiring_1}) ⇒ bool\" where<br>\n  \"convergent_prod f ⟷ (∃M L. (λn. ∏i≤n. f (i+M)) ⇢ L ∧ L ≠ 0)\"</p>\n<p>I was wondering if there is any other theory about infinite products, as HOL/Analysis/Infinite_Product.thy does not provide functions corresponding to @{term “sums”} and @{term “suminf”}.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nWenda</p>",

I surveyed the material a while ago for my<br>\nwork on Dirichlet series and Euler product expansions and found that<br>\nthere was very little there.</p>\n<p>I did not introduce something like \"sums\" for infinite products back<br>\nthen because 1. I could not think of a good name and 2. every additional<br>\nconstant you introduce means you have to provide a lot of additional<br>\ntheorems to make it practically usable, and that was not something I<br>\nwanted to do at the time. Besides, one can phrase simply use \"filterlim\"<br>\nwith little overhead.</p>\n<p>It would be nice to have more on this, but I'm not sure how to do it.<br>\nOften, one could probably reduce infinite products to infinite sums via<br>\nthe real or complex logarithm, but that seems like a bit of a hack<br>\nbecause it only works for real and complex numbers.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I know little about this and don't know if it is possible<br>\nhow to build a nice and general theory of infinite products for a<br>\nreasonably general type class similarly what we have to sums.</p>\n<p>For \"sums\", we at least have some theory about absolutely summable<br>\nseries index over an arbitrary set (\"infsetsum\") and Johannes Hölzl<br>\nrecently told me about some ways to nicely generalise this, although I<br>\ndoubt I'll be able to do anything of the sort any time soon. Ideally, it<br>\nwould be nice to have something like this for products, too, but I don't<br>\nknow if it is possible and how much work it would be.</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
