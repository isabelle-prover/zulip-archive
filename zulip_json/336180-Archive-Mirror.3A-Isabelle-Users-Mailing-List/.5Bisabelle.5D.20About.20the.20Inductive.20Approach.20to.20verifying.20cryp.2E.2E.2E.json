Anyone can help me?<br>\n   regards,<br>\n   Jane</p>",

So I don't understand how some theorems were reasoned by induction.I wish to get more detailed documents about protocol goal induction,that will help me understand your inductive approach to verifying cryptograpgic protocols. Wish to get the  documents including detailed inductive steps of NS_Public_Bad  protocol. <br>\n   Sincerely<br>\n    Jane</p>\n<p>----- 原邮件 ----- <br>\n从: Lawrence Paulson &lt;<a href=\"mailto:lp15@cam.ac.uk\">lp15@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt; <br>\n日期: 星期一, 一月 7日, 2008 下午8:25 <br>\n主题: Re: [isabelle] About the Inductive Approach to verifying cryptograpgic protocols <br>\nTo: \"jwang <a href=\"http://whu.edu.cn\">whu.edu.cn</a>\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:jwang@whu.edu.cn\">jwang@whu.edu.cn</a>&gt; (jwang) <br>\nCc: <a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a></p>",

It is not impossible, but hard to<br>\naccomplish, since that when you are starting to prove some protocol, you<br>\n import a base theory (in this case: imports Public begin), that will<br>\nimport its own base theories, and so on. Some of these theories also<br>\nhave restrictions on how to proceed the proofs, that you will need<br>\nalways to remember.</p>\n<p>All this will make the proofs even harder to accomplish than by using<br>\nIsabelle. For example it is a nightmare to prove by hand anything that<br>\nrelates with the use of Public keys. I can tell you its not worth.
