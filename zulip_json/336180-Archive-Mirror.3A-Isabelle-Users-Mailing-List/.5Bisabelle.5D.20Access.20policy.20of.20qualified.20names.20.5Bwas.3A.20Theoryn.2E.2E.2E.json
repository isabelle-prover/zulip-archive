This is as <br>\nfollows: a qualified name x1.---.xn.y can be accessed by any suffix of <br>\nthe whole name, or by a prefix of x1.---.xn followed by y.  Later <br>\naccesses take priority over earlier ones.</p>\n<p>You are probably right in pointing out that accesses of names generated <br>\nby the datatype package (or by other packages) should always contain the <br>\nname of the datatype.  This would also disable to refer by \"splits\" to <br>\nthe splitting lemmas of the last datatype.  I believe this hasn't been <br>\nconsidered a problem since traditionally theory names are upper case <br>\nwhile type names are lower.</p>\n<p>Clemens</p>",
