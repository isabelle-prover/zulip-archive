As far as I know, the visible Isabelle universe<br>\nonly contains two concrete instances of algebraically closed fields,<br>\nnamely the complex numbers (in HOL) and the algebraic complex numbers<br>\n(in the AFP entry Algebraic_Numbers). The latter are, I think, more<br>\ntechnically interesting and not so much for abstract mathematical<br>\ndevelopments.</p>\n<p>It is not necessarily bad to introduce a typeclass that has only one<br>\ninstance – especially when it coincides with a standard mathematical<br>\nconcept (as is the case here). However, it also doesn't have much<br>\nimmediate payoff, which is probably why no one has done it so far. Feel<br>\nfree to do so!</p>\n<p>There is also a HOL-Algebra development by former students of<br>\nLarry/Anthony (much of it still in a private repository) that could be<br>\nused to make a generic \"alg_closure\" type constructor. Not sure how<br>\nuseful that is though – it might be interesting when reasoning about<br>\nthings like Galois fields or also for generic proofs involving fields,<br>\nbecause it allows you to suddenly go to the algebraic closure for a<br>\nproof and then back.</p>\n<p>Another interesting instance would be formal Puiseux series. They've<br>\nbeen on my long-term potential to-do list. If anyone feels like having a<br>\ngo at them (e.g. in analogy to the existing formal power series/Laurent<br>\nseries in HOL-Compuational_Algebra), please do. :)</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
