Otherwise it is in general<br>\nnot possible to write qualified constant names like<br>\nMy_Theory.my_constant. It is very unfriendly to produce a theory where<br>\nusers cannot refer to qualified names within terms later.</p>\n<p>* Formal theory header, both in Isabelle/ML and Isabelle/Scala: there<br>\nare differences in string representation (UTF-8 vs. UTF-16) and<br>\nsometimes the difference cannot be fully hidden. Note that it is<br>\ngenerally a bad idea to use raw Unicode for names in Isabelle, only<br>\nproper Isabelle symbols like \\&lt;alpha&gt; or \\&lt;forall&gt;.</p>\n<p>* File-system name space on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Cygwin. This<br>\nimposes various real-world restrictions. Isabelle symbols are excluded<br>\nbecause of the use of the backslash required for Windows. Unicode often<br>\nworks, but not universally on all platforms in all situations. Spaces<br>\nwork most of the time, but are very bad style on Unix platforms. (There<br>\nis a funny problem in the Cygwin version bundled with Isabelle2016-1 and<br>\nIsabelle2017: if Isabelle is installed into a directory name like \"test<br>\na\" or \"testä\" it works, but if it is \"test ä\" it doesn't. Maybe we<br>\nshould start a thread on the Cygwin mailing list about that Unicode oddity).</p>\n<p>Intersecting all these side-conditions, the remainder is indeed a plain<br>\nASCII identifier consisting of: A-Z a-z 0-9 _ (starting with a letter).</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is a hard and fast convention to use upper-case words in<br>\nsingular that are separated by underscores (some particles might not<br>\ncount as words and remain lower-case). Plural means that several<br>\nconcepts of the same kind are covered.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p>theory Nat   -- a theory of natural numbers<br>\n  theory List  -- a theory of lists<br>\n  theory Coinductive_List  -- a theory of coinductive lists<br>\n  theory Orders  -- a theory with several kinds of orders (plural)<br>\n  theory Misc_List_Lemmas  -- a theory with various list lemmas (plural)<br>\n  theory Fundamental_Theorem_of_Algebra  -- particle in lower-case</p>\n<p>A common mistake is to use plural too often, e.g. a theory \"Lists\" of<br>\nlists would provide a constant \"<a href=\"http://Lists.map\">Lists.map</a>\", but this should be<br>\n\"<a href=\"http://List.map\">List.map</a>\" instead.</p>\n<p>Note that the situation is similar to type names: the type of lists is<br>\ncalled \"list\" in singular (and in lower-case).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To make Isabelle and its document build feature more permissive with<br>\nfilenames, what is the best way to solve these issues?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't think this is expected to work, hence I see very little prospect<br>\nto solve this in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Right. At some point, the system should check that explicitly and reject<br>\nstrange theory names outright.</p>\n<p>The Prover IDE could also provide more hints about further fine-points.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
