Is it possible that some people respond to these lockdowns by formalising mathematics? Anyway:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We formalize is Isabelle/HOL a result due to S. Banach and H. Steinhaus, known as the Banach-Steinhaus theorem or Uniform boundedness principle: A pointwise-bounded family of continuous linear operators from a Banach space to a normed space is uniformly bounded. Our approach is an adaptation to Isabelle/HOL of a proof due to A. Sokal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You will find it online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Banach_Steinhaus.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Banach_Steinhaus.html</a></p>\n<p>Many thanks to the authors for their contribution!</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
