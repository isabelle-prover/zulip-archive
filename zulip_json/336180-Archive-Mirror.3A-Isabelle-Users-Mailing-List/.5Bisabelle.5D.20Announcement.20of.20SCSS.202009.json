The Workshop grew out of internal workshops that<br>\nbring together researchers from SCORE (Symbolic Computation Research Group,<br>\nUniversity of Tsukuba, Japan), the Theorema Group at RISC (Research<br>\nInstitute for Symbolic Computation, Johannes Kepler University, Linz -<br>\nHagenberg, Austria), SSFG (Software Science Foundation Group, Kyoto<br>\nUniversity, Japan) and Sup'Com (University of November 7th at Carthage,<br>\nTunisia). SCSS is open for the international community and welcomes paper<br>\nsubmissions.</p>\n<p>VENUE<br>\n=======<br>\nThe workshop will be held at Ramada Hotel in Gammarth, Tunisia.<br>\nGammarth is 20km north east of Tunis and 10km north of the archeological<br>\nsite of Carthage. The legendary Phoenician princess Dido founded Carthage<br>\nand the city possessed economic, cultural, and military power in the<br>\nMediterranean during Punic and Roman eras.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>\n================</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Henk Barendregt (Radboud University Nijmegen, Netherlands)</li>\n<li>Dongming Wang (University Pierre et Marie Curie - CNRS, France)</li>\n<li>Stephen Watt (University of Western Ontario, Canada)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PROGRAM CO-CHAIRS<br>\n=================</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adel Bouhoula (University of November 7th at Carthage, Tunisia)</li>\n<li>Tetsuo Ida (University of Tsukuba, Japan)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>\n=================</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tudor Jebelean (Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria)</li>\n<li>Temur Kutsia (Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria)</li>\n<li>Yasuhiko Minamide (University of Tsukuba, Japan)</li>\n<li>Mohamed Mosbah (University of Bordeaux, France)</li>\n<li>Michael Rusinowitch (INRIA Lorraine, France)</li>\n<li>Masahiko Sato (Kyoto University, Japan)</li>\n<li>Yahya Slimani (University El Manar Tunis, Tunisia)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LOCAL ORGANIZERS<br>\n================</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nizar Ben Neji (University of November 7th at Carthage, Tunisia)</li>\n<li>Fadoua Ghourabi (University of Tsukuba, Japan)</li>\n<li>Sourour Meharouech (University of November 7th at Carthage, Tunisia)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSION<br>\n===========<br>\nAbstracts and papers or extended abstracts should be submitted using<br>\nEasyChair: <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scss2009\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scss2009</a></p>\n<p>Papers or extended abstracts should be prepared in LaTeX, formatted<br>\naccording to the EasyChair style (style files are available from<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip\">http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip</a>), and should not exceed<br>\n16 pages.</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION<br>\n===========<br>\nAccepted papers will be available during the workshop as the proceedings of<br>\nSCSS 2009. We plan to have a special issue of the Journal of Symbolic<br>\nComputation on SCSS 2009. The final decision for organizing the special<br>\nissue will be made after the workshop.  The full version of selected papers<br>\nwill be considered for the publication of the special issue subjected to the<br>\nnormal peer review process of the Journal of Symbolic Computation.</p>",
