In particular, it was shown that Falso can<br>\nprove its own consistency and allows for efficient implementation of<br>\ntheorem checkers and proof assistants.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to integrate this powerful new approach with existing<br>\nformal proofs, we, the Theorem Proving Group at the FU Dietersheim,<br>\nextended the Isabelle/HOL system to Isabelle/HOLF, which uses a hybrid<br>\nversion of HOL and the original version of Falso [1]. In particular, we<br>\nprovide an experimental amortised constant-time proof method, exfalso,<br>\nwhich shows promising results so far, e.g. in proving the Riemann<br>\nconjecture (publication pending).</p>\n<p>The key features of the Isabelle/HOLF axiom system and the corresponding<br>\nnew proof methods are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generally shorter, more readable proofs</li>\n<li>Highly parallelisable</li>\n<li>Fully backwards-compatible, i.e. legacy Isabelle/HOL proofs can be<br>\nused with the new system without restrictions (An automatic conversion<br>\ntool is in development.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It has been noted critically that the introduction of new axioms is<br>\nimprudent, however, we argue that as the above results show, the benefit<br>\nclearly outweighs any of these objections. Additionally, it has been<br>\nconjectured by [2] that the addition of the Falso axioms may render a<br>\nnumber of axioms in ZF and HOL superfluous, which would lead to an axiom<br>\nsystem that is both more powerful and has fewer axioms than ZF and HOL,<br>\nwhich is a clear indicator for robustness.</p>\n<p>You can download a prototype of Isabelle/HOLF that integrates seamlessly<br>\nwith Isabelle/HOL at our website [3]. If you wish, you can follow the<br>\ndevelopment at GitHub [4].</p>\n<p>Happy experimenting<br>\nLars Hupel</p>\n<p>[1] Amarilli, A. 2011.

Personally, I think the possibilities of application of<br>\nthe exfalso prover in circuit verification are virtually unlimited, but<br>\nI'm hardly an expert in this area.</p>\n<p>The integration with sledgehammer is a known issue; remember, this is<br>\nstill merely a prototype and we did not put too much effort into getting<br>\nit to work with Sledgehammer. I don't know where the problem is here,<br>\nbut unlike some other projects, we actually have a bug tracker, so you<br>\nmay want to file a bug report about this:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/larsrh/hol-falso/issues\">https://github.com/larsrh/hol-falso/issues</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2) For some really nasty Isabelle-Hacking, that I do not dare to<br>\nreproduce on this list, a lemma of the following form would be nice:<br>\n  lemma: \"PROP P\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The purpose of the exfalso prover is mainly to extend and, in the long<br>\nrun, replace certain older and somewhat slow and unreliable methods like<br>\n\"blast\" and \"auto\"; therefore, like these methods, it was not designed<br>\nto handle \"prop\" values. However, if you have an idea how to integrate<br>\nsomething like that into exfalso, do tell us, or better still, feel free<br>\nto fork the repository on Github and send us a pull request once you're<br>\ndone.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nManuel</p>",
