For<br>\nexample, the #haskell IRC channel is very helpful for answering questions<br>\nand getting quick turnaround or interactive help.  It's nice for things that<br>\nare urgent or easy to fix.  Especially for beginners who seem to run into<br>\nevery conceivable obstacle (like me!).  It's especially nice for doing<br>\n\"question exchanges\".  You come by, ask a question, and then stick around<br>\nlong enough to answer someone else's question thereby paying your karma<br>\nforward.</p>\n<p>My name on freenode is lispy.</p>\n<p>See you on freenode!<br>\nJason</p>",

So I <br>\nfeel free to frankly say my personal opinion:</p>\n<p>I appreciate the Isabelle lists, because</p>\n<h1>the answers are trustable, and I need no research on who is who</h1>\n<h1>the high quality conversations are worth to be searched in the archive.</h1>\n<p>So, I prefer these advantages to IRC chatting such that I do _not_ <br>\nintend to use your friendly offer.</p>\n<p>With kind regards,<br>\nWalther</p>",
