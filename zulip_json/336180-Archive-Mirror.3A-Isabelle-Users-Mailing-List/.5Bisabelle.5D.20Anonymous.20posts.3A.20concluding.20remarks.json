Most certainly, I did not mean to offend<br>\nanyone. Moreover, I never intended to become an oddity for which exceptions<br>\nhave to be made. When I registered this email address, I was still under<br>\nthe impression that the Isabelle project is significantly bigger than it<br>\nappeared to be. At the time I thought that just like almost any other<br>\nscience/mathematics forum this mailing list would be inhabited by other<br>\nregular anonymous/pseudonymous posters. However, by now, I understood that<br>\nthere exists a culture that is based on personal acquaintance and, as such,<br>\nanonymous posts are an uncommon occurrence.</p>\n<p>I still do not consider it to be an option to post under my real name<br>\nbecause I believe that such posts could have a negative and long-lasting<br>\neffect on my career and personal life. Nevertheless, I will cease to post<br>\non this list from this email address. If I will ever feel a great need to<br>\nask something on the list, most likely, I will do so under a human<br>\npseudonym, as suggested by several regular users of the list, including<br>\nMakarius Wenzel. It is not unlikely that this email address will be<br>\nderegistered in the near future.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
