It is like otway-Rees.<br>\nAccording my previous questions I model MAC function by Crypt(key) Hash X.<br>\nOf course it can not be cryptographicaly true,but it works for the verification.<br>\nBecause of the similarity I used most of the theorem in otway-Rees verification.<br>\nEnclosed the mail,is the \".thy\" file of my job. It will be truely kind of you to have a look,<br>\nand tell me your idea. I also have a problem. Although the tool can pass all the steps for verifying lemmas, <br>\nit shows an error when it reaches the \"done\" step,and displays:\"failed to finish proof after successful terminal methods\" .It happens even for very simple lemmas.<br>\nWould you please tell me what is the reason.<br>\n<br>\nThank you very much<br>\nShadi Shiri<br>\n<br>\nP.S: I know that this e-mail address is for problems with the tools, but it would be very kind of you,as professionals, to answer my questions and suggest me about how to verify this protocol better by better lemmas.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/6kJy9oXqWW6xyH4JvKTvF3tG/Final-verification.thy\">Final verification.thy</a></p>",
