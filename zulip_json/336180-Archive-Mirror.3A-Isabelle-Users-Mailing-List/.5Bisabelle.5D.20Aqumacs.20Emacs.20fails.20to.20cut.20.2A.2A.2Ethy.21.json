I remember that on some emacses it makes a<br>\ndifference whether you use the emacs cut and paste command or the<br>\nsystems ones (apple-C and apple-V). In the end I went back to xemacs<br>\n21.4, but that no longer works on Mac OS 10.6, snow leopard (I am still<br>\non 10.5.8).</p>\n<p>Tobias</p>\n<p>david streader schrieb:</p>",
