In other words: If C is a chain of countable sets, is the union of all the <br>\nsets in C countable again? I have been thinking about this for quite a while, but I could <br>\nnot come up with a stringent argument nor a counterexample. Does anybody know the answer? <br>\nIn case of yes, we could make the type cset an instance of the class ccpo.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",

I was<br>\nthinking of HOLCF’s countable chains, but now that I think about it that<br>\ncan’t be the one he is looking at, as I’m sure that he knows that the<br>\ncountable union of countable sets is countable.
