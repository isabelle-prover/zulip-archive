The tactics auto and blast <br>\nwill not prove this in a single step. Any ideas what the best way to go about <br>\nit is?</p>\n<p>For now, I have settled with</p>\n<p>from <code>F {A, B, C}</code> have \"F {B, A, C}\" using arg_cong[of \"{A, B, C}\" \"{B, A, <br>\nC}\" F] by blast</p>\n<p>but I am still having to help blast out by explicitly binding all the <br>\nschematic variables of arg_cong. Is this a problem with higher-order <br>\nunification? I wonder given that the following does not even go through:</p>\n<p>have \"{A, B, C} = {B, A, C}\" by auto<br>\nwith arg_cong have \"F {A, B, C} = F {B, A, C}\" .</p>\n<p>unless I supply the ?f argument in arg_cong:</p>\n<p>have \"{A, B, C} = {B, A, C}\" by auto<br>\nwith arg_cong[where f = F] have \"F {A, B, C} = F {B, A, C}\" .</p>\n<p>Any tips on how to best prove my original fact?</p>",
