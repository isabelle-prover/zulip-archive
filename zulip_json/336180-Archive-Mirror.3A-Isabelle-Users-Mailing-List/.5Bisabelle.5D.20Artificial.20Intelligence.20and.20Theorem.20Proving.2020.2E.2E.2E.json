New combinations of<br>\nAI and reasoning methods and tools deployed over large mathematical<br>\nand scientific corpora will be instrumental to this task.  The AITP<br>\nconference is the forum for discussing how to get there as soon as<br>\npossible, and the force driving the progress towards that.</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>- AI, machine learning and big-data methods in theorem proving<br>\n      and mathematics.</p>\n<p>- Collaboration between automated and interactive theorem proving,<br>\n      in particular their AI/ML aspects.</p>\n<p>- Common-sense reasoning and reasoning in science.<br>\n    - Alignment and joint processing of formal, semi-formal,<br>\n       and informal libraries, Formal Abstracts.</p>\n<p>- Methods for large-scale computer understanding of mathematics<br>\n       and science.</p>\n<p>- Combinations of linguistic/learning-based and semantic/reasoning<br>\nmethods</p>\n<p>- Formal verification of AI and machine learning algorithms,<br>\nexplainable AI .</p>\n<p>SESSIONS<br>\nThere will be several focused sessions on AI for ATP, ITP and<br>\nmathematics, Formal Abstracts, linguistic processing of<br>\nmathematics/science, modern AI and big-data methods, and several<br>\nsessions with contributed talks. The focused sessions will be based on<br>\ninvited talks and discussion oriented.</p>\n<p>CONFIRMED PARTICIPANTS/SPEAKERS (TBC)<br>\nJoão Araújo, Universidade Nova de Lisboa<br>\nKevin Buzzard, Imperial College London<br>\nMichael R.
