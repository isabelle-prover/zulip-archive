We interpret the area cybersecurity broadly:<br>\nthe ideal applicant is a computer scientist, conducting research on<br>\ncybersecurity or research that has cybersecurity as a direct application.<br>\nWe would like to expand on our current security research efforts within<br>\nCryptology, Formal Methods, Information Security, Security in DevOps, and<br>\nData-driven approaches, so these topics are of particular interest.</p>\n<p>Fluency in English is required. Knowledge of Danish is not a requirement:<br>\nmore English than Danish is used when teaching in computer science, and<br>\nmore than half of the faculty members in computer science have<br>\ninternational backgrounds.</p>\n<p>More information about the application procedure can be found at<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.sdu.dk/da/service/ledige_stillinger/1098235?sc_lang=en\">https://www.sdu.dk/da/service/ledige_stillinger/1098235?sc_lang=en</a></p>\n<p>Deadline: 30 May 2020.</p>\n<p>For further information, please contact Associate Professor Jacopo Mauro<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:mauro@imada.sdu.dk\">mauro@imada.sdu.dk</a> or Professor Joan Boyar <a href=\"mailto:joan@imada.sdu.dk\">joan@imada.sdu.dk</a>.</p>",
