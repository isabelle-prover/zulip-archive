From this chapter I finally understood that \"real world\" sequences (e.g. A) are represented by the lambda term (e.g. %s.Seq0'(A, s). That is fine. Now I can go forward.</p>\n<p>Now I am trying to understand:</p>\n<p>nonterminal seq and seqobj and seqcont</p>\n<p>syntax<br>\n \"_SeqEmp\"         :: seq                                  (\"\")<br>\n \"_SeqApp\"         :: \"[seqobj,seqcont] ⇒ seq\"            (\"__\")</p>\n<p>Isar reference manual (chapter 8) says that nonterminals add additional syntactic categories. Let it be so. But I can not understant the syntax secion. Isar reference manual is saying that syntax secion defines production. But from the other hand the formal secification of the syntax section says, that entries in the syntax sections are in the form:<br>\n          Name :: Type (mixfix)<br>\nSo - how can I interpret such construction as the production? There in this production I can see nonterminals and the relevant string of terminals/nonterminals?</p>\n<p>And, of course, I am still seeking the real world interpretation of the nonterminals seq / seqobj / seqcont.</p>\n<p>Alex</p>\n<hr>\n<p>No: Alex Meyer<br>\nNosūtīts: pirmdiena, 2017. gada 21. augusts 10:32<br>\nKam: <a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a><br>\nTēma: Sequents: meaning of types o, seq', meaning of nonterminals seq, seqobj, seqcont</p>\n<p>Hello!</p>\n<p>I am trying to understand <a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/library/Sequents/Sequents/Sequents.html\">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/library/Sequents/Sequents/Sequents.html</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/library/Sequents/Sequents/ILL.html\">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/library/Sequents/Sequents/ILL.html</a> and I have problems with the understanding the meaning of the basic items, namely:</p>\n<p>types o, seq'</p>\n<p>nonterminals seq, seqobj, seqcont?</p>\n<p>Do these types and nonterminals have some \"real world\" counterparts?
