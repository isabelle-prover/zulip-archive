Using inclusion proofs, knowledgeable systems can <br>\nselectively share their knowledge with other systems and the latter can verify <br>\nthe authenticity of what is being shared. In this article, we show how to <br>\nmodularly define authenticated data structures, their inclusion proofs, and <br>\noperations thereon as datatypes in Isabelle/HOL, using a shallow embedding. <br>\nModularity allows us to construct complicated trees from reusable building <br>\nblocks, which we call Merkle functors. Merkle functors include sums, products, <br>\nand function spaces and are closed under composition and least fixpoints. As a <br>\npractical application, we model the hierarchical transactions of Canton, a <br>\npractical interoperability protocol for distributed ledgers, as authenticated <br>\ndata structures. This is a first step towards formalizing the Canton protocol <br>\nand verifying its integrity and security guarantees.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/ADS_Functor.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/ADS_Functor.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/GsosirN93pNJ7N2D1MYgJYM0/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
