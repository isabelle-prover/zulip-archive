I was able to reproduce what you describe on my machine with Isabelle2013-RC1. Doubling the timeout to 4 s doesn't seem to help. Hence this would suggest it has something to do with the slicing or the otherwise reduced nature of Auto Sledgehammer.</p>\n<p>However, with the current repository version (fcb7bbbe3799), it finds the proof as expected, even with the lower, default timeout (2 s). In addition, with the current \"isabelle-release\" version (782e430e6a83), which includes several Sledgehammer-related changes by both Makarius and myself that could make a difference here, it also works as expected. So I would simply recommend that you give it a try in the RC2 once it is available to confirm that the problem is gone for you too.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
