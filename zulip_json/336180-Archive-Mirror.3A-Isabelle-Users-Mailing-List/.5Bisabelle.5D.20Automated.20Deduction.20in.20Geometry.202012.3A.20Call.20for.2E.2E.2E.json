The workshop is held every two years. The previous editions of ADG were held <br>\nin Munich in 2010, Shanghai in 2008, Pontevedra in 2006, Gainesville in 2004, Hagenberg <br>\nin 2002, Zurich in 2000, Beijing in 1998, and Toulouse in 1996. The 9th edition, ADG 2012, <br>\nwill be held in Edinburgh, UK, September 17 - 19, 2012. Note that the scope of the ADG <br>\n2012 has been expanded to cover topics in dynamic geometry.</p>\n<p>SCOPE</p>\n<p>Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>polynomial algebra, invariant and coordinate-free methods, probabilistic, <br>\n   synthetic, and logic approaches, techniques for automated geometric reasoning <br>\n   from discrete mathematics, combinatorics, and numerics;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>symbolic and numeric methods for geometric computation, geometric constraint solving, <br>\n   automated generation/reasoning and manipulation with diagrams;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>design and implementation of geometry software, special-purpose tools, automated theorem <br>\n   provers, experimental studies;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>applications of ADG to mechanics, geometric modelling, CAGD/CAD, computer vision, <br>\n   robotics, and education.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extended abstracts (or full papers) of maximum 20 pages.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The extended abstracts (or the introduction of the full papers) must address the following <br>\n  aspects explicitly:</p>\n<p>- Problem: What is the problem/question/objective?<br>\n  - Motivation: Why do we work on the problem? What is the importance?<br>\n  - State of the Art: What has been done already on the problem?<br>\n  - Contribution: What is the main original contribution?<br>\n  - Main Idea: What is the main idea underlying the contribution?\n* The submissions should follow the standard Springer LNCS Proceedings format.\n* Electronic submission as PDF is required via EasyChair <br>\n (at <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adg2012\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adg2012</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have any problems with the submission of your paper, or questions concerning <br>\n   ADG 2012 or EasyChair, please contact <a href=\"mailto:adg2012@easychair.org\">adg2012@easychair.org</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>REFEREEING AND PUBLICATION DETAILS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The submitted contributions will be subject to a summary review by the Program Committee, <br>\n   bearing in mind that this first review is mainly for presentation, NOT for publication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Digital publication of the full papers accepted for presentation will be available at the workshop.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The authors of full papers accepted for presentation at the workshop will be invited to <br>\n   submit their full and/or revised papers for publication in a formal proceedings <br>\n   of ADG 2012 after the workshop.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The full papers (submitted after the meeting) will be formally reviewed by PC members and <br>\n   external referees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The accepted full papers will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial <br>\n   Intelligence (LNAI) series or Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The proceedings of ADG 1996, ADG 1998, ADG 2000, ADG 2002, and ADG 2004, ADG 2006, <br>\n   and ADG 2010 appeared as LNAI 1360, LNAI 1669, LNAI 2061, LNAI 2930, LNAI 3763, <br>\n   LNAI 4869, and LNCS 6877, respectively.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extended abstract/paper submission: July 1, 2012.</li>\n<li>Notification of acceptance:   July 30, 2012.</li>\n<li>Final paper submission:  September 1, 2012.</li>\n<li>Early registration:  August 1-20, 2012.</li>\n<li>Workshop:  September 17 - 19, 2012.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tetsuo Ida, University of Tsukuba, Japan (Chair).</li>\n<li>Hirokazu Anai, ﻿﻿Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd/Kyushu University, Japan</li>\n<li>Francisco Botana, University of Vigo, Spain.</li>\n<li>Xiaoyu Chen, Beihang University, China.</li>\n<li>Giorgio Dalzotto, University of Pisa, Italy.</li>\n<li>Jacques Fleuriot, University of Edinburgh, UK.</li>\n<li>Laureano Gonzalez-Vega, University of Cantabria, Spain.</li>\n<li>Hoon Hong, North Carolina State University, USA.</li>\n<li>Andres Iglesias Prieto, University of Cantabria, Spain.</li>\n<li>Predrag Janicic, University of Belgrade, Serbia.</li>\n<li>Deepak Kapur, University of New Mexico, USA.</li>\n<li>Ulrich Kortenkamp, Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Germany.</li>\n<li>Shuichi Moritsugu, University of Tsukuba, Japan.</li>\n<li>Julien Narboux, University of Strasbourg, France.</li>\n<li>Pavel Pech, University of South Bohemia, Czech Republic.</li>\n<li>Tomas Recio,  University of Cantabria, Spain.</li>\n<li>Georg Regensburger, Inria Saclay – Île-de-France, France.</li>\n<li>Jürgen Richter-Gebert, TU Munich, Germany.</li>\n<li>Pascal Schreck, University of Strasbourg, France.</li>\n<li>Meera Sitharam, University of Florida, USA.</li>\n<li>Thomas Sturm, Max Planck Institute, Germany.</li>\n<li>Dongming Wang, University Pierre and Marie Curie - CNRS, France.</li>\n</ul>",
