Anyone wishing to attend but not interested in presenting<br>\nshould send a shorter position statement (1/2 - 1 page).</p>\n<p>Submissions should be sent in in either Postscript or PDF format by<br>\nemail to the workshop organisers at: <a href=\"mailto:sgc@doc.ic.ac.uk\">sgc@doc.ic.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p>Please use the LaTeX style file provided on the workshop web page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/crg/events/ARW07\">http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/crg/events/ARW07</a></p>\n<p>Each submission should include the names and complete addresses<br>\n(including email) of all authors. Correspondence will be sent to the<br>\nfirst author, unless otherwise indicated. The main objective of the<br>\nabstracts is to spread information about recent work in our community,<br>\nand we expect to accept most in-topic submissions, but we may ask for<br>\nrevisions.</p>\n<p>Abstracts will be published in informal workshop notes and be made<br>\navailable on the internet.<br>\n================================================================<br>\nPresentations</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Each workshop attendee will be allocated a 5 minute slot (or a 10<br>\nminute slot, depending on time constraints), for a short talk to<br>\nintroduce their research. Each attendee will also be allocated space<br>\nin a poster session, where they can further present and discuss their<br>\nwork. Please prepare posters for the event.<br>\n================================================================<br>\nStudentships</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A limited number of studentships will be available to fund travel and<br>\naccomodation expenses. Applications for studentships will require<br>\nwritten proof of student status, and must be received by the deadline<br>\nbelow.
