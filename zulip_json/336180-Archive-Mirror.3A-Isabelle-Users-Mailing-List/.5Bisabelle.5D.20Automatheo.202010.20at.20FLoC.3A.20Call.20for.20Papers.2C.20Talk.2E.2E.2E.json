This topic<br>\nconcerns the theory and practice of developing software systems that<br>\nsupport the automated development of mathematical theories, including<br>\nthe invention of definitions, theorems, conjectures, problems,<br>\nexamples and algorithms. The workshop aims to highlight the research<br>\narea and foster collaboration amongst those working in software<br>\nverification, formalised mathematics, and mathematical research, as<br>\nwell as help provide a shared understanding of the theory and tools<br>\nfor automated invention and discovery of mathematical theories.</p>\n<p>In this workshop, we want to encourage dissemination of knowledge as<br>\nwell as interaction between researchers. To facilitate this, the<br>\nprogramme will start with talks and be followed by demo and tutorial<br>\nsessions in smaller groups. Participants will experiment with and use<br>\nthe various systems, pose challenge problems, and develop a clear<br>\nunderstanding of the available technologies and concepts.</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers: John Harrison and Dana S. Scott</p>\n<p>Call for Participation and Submissions:</p>\n<p>We invite proposals to give a talk and/or to provide a demo. Topics<br>\nand demonstrations of interest include all aspects of mathematical<br>\ntheory exploration, especially the invention and discovery steps in<br>\nthe development of mathematical theories.  This includes, but is not<br>\nlimited to position statements, descriptions of important features,<br>\ntheories of theory exploration, and systems descriptions.  We also<br>\nwelcome contributions on the application of theory exploration to<br>\nother parts of mathematics, computer science and software engineering,<br>\nas well as to other sciences such as physics and biology.</p>\n<p>Submissions will be accepted based on light reviewing of extended<br>\nabstracts by a review panel of researchers interested in the area. The<br>\nextended abstracts will not be archival publications, but will be<br>\npublished online. Accepted submissions will also be disseminated in an<br>\ninformal proceedings which will be available during the workshop.</p>\n<p>Please submit extended abstracts and demo proposals by easychair:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=automatheo2010\">https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=automatheo2010</a><br>\nThese should not be longer than 15 pages and can be as short as 1<br>\npage.
