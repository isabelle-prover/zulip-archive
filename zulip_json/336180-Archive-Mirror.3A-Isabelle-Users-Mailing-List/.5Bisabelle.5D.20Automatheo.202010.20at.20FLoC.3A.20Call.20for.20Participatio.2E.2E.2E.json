It concerns the<br>\ntheory and practice of software systems for developing new<br>\nmathematical theories, including the invention of definitions,<br>\ntheorems, conjectures, problems, examples and algorithms.</p>\n<p>The workshop aims to highlight the research area and foster<br>\ncollaboration amongst those working in software verification,<br>\nformalised mathematics, and mathematical research, as well as help<br>\nprovide a shared understanding of the theory and tools for automated<br>\ndiscovery of mathematical theories.</p>\n<p>To facilitate dissemination of knowledge as well as interaction<br>\nbetween researchers, the programme will start with talks and be<br>\nfollowed by demos, tutorials, and discussion sessions. Participants<br>\nwill experiment with and use the various systems, pose challenge<br>\nproblems, and develop a clear understanding of the available<br>\ntechnologies, concepts, and challenges.</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers: John Harrison and Dana S. Scott</p>\n<p>Registration:</p>\n<p>Registration is separate from the FLoC procedure.
