They subsume computational logics such<br>\nas dynamic and Hoare logics and form a basis for many popular software<br>\ndevelopment methods.</p>\n<p>Isabelle has recently been extended by automated theorem provers and SMT<br>\nsolvers. We use these integrated tools for automatically proving several<br>\nrather intricate refinement and termination theorems. We also automate a<br>\nmodal correspondence result and soundness and relative completeness<br>\nproofs of propositional Hoare logic.</p>\n<p>These results show, for the first time, that Isabelle's tool integration<br>\nmakes automated algebraic reasoning particularly simple and concise.<br>\nThis is a step towards increasing the automation of formal methods.</p>\n<p>[2] Automated Engineering of Relational and Algebraic Methods in<br>\nIsabelle/HOL - Invited Tutorial (RAMICS 2011, joint work with Simon<br>\nFoster and Georg Struth)</p>\n<p>Kind regards,<br>\nTjark</p>",
