This means, that a goal like</p>\n<p>!!x. A x ==&gt; B x</p>\n<p>means that in the proof text one has to show \"B x\", while \"A x\" may be <br>\nassumed, in the context of a locally fixed x.  E.g. your answer to the <br>\nabove goal could be like this:</p>\n<p>fix x<br>\n  assume \"A x\"<br>\n  show \"B x\" sorry</p>\n<p>This piece of proof body is only loosely linked to the pending goal <br>\nsituation.  There is a lot of flexibility in rearrangeing the text (e.g. <br>\nassumptions may be permuted, or even ignored; the whole situation may be <br>\ngeneralized etc.).  Naturally, local entities are subject to static <br>\nscoping and alpha-conversion, e.g. the above \"x\" can be replaced by <br>\nanything more appropriate, but is has to be declared explicitly.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
