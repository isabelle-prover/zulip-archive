Prove AC =&gt; [...]\"<br>\n(AC is defined in [Andrews, 2002, p. 236], formal verification of X5308 <br>\navailable at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf\">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf</a>, pp. 151 ff.)</p>\n<p>For the same reason, language elements embodying the Axiom of Choice (such as <br>\nthe epsilon operator) should be avoided. For good reason Q0 uses the <br>\ndescription operator instead [cf. Andrews, 2002, p. 211].</p>\n<p>Andrews sees, concerning the \"Axiom Schema of Choice, an Axiom of Infinity, and <br>\nperhaps even the Continuum Hypothesis [...] room for argument whether these are <br>\naxioms of pure logic or of mathematics\" [Andrews, 2002, p. 204], and I also <br>\nclearly regard all of them as non-logical axioms. Note that they are not Axioms <br>\nfor Q0 [cf. Andrews, 2002, p. 213].</p>\n<p>For the references, please see: <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.4444/100.111\">http://doi.org/10.4444/100.111</a></p>\n<p>Ken Kubota</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ken Kubota<br>\n<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.4444/100\">http://doi.org/10.4444/100</a></p>",
