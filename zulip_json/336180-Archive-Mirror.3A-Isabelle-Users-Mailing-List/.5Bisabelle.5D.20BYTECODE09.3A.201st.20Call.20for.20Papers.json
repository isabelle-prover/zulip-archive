The<br>\nindustrial  interest stems from  the fact  that bytecode  is typically<br>\nused for  the Internet and mobile devices  (smartcards, phones, etc.),<br>\nwhere   security   is   a   major   issue.   Moreover,   bytecode   is<br>\ndevice-independent  and  allows  dynamic  loading  of  classes,  which<br>\nprovides an extra challenge for the application of formal methods.  In<br>\naddition, the lack of structure of the code and the pervasive presence<br>\nof the operand stack also provide extra challenges for the analysis of<br>\nbytecode. This workshop  will focus on the latest  developments in the<br>\nsemantics,    verification,    analysis,    and   transformation    of<br>\nbytecode.  Both new  theoretical results  and tool  demonstrations are<br>\nwelcome.</p>\n<p>Invited Speaker<br>\n===============</p>\n<p>TBA</p>\n<p>Submission<br>\n==========</p>\n<p>There are two  paper categories, Regular and Tool  demo papers.  Paper<br>\nshould be written using the ENTCS style and submitted through the easy<br>\nchair   page  \"<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bytecode08\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bytecode08</a>\".<br>\nPlease  indicate   in  the  submission  page  the   category  of  your<br>\nsubmission. Submissions will be evaluated by the Program Committee for<br>\ninclusion in the ENTCS proceedings.</p>\n<p>Regular  research  papers  should  be  at  most  15  pages  (including<br>\nbibliography  and excluding  well-marked appendices  not  intended for<br>\npublication). They must contain  original contributions, be written in<br>\nEnglish  and  be  unpublished  and not  submitted  simultaneously  for<br>\npublication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Tool demo papers must describe a completed, robust and well-documented<br>\ntool  --  highlighting the  overall  functionality  of  the tool,  the<br>\ninterfaces of  the tool, interesting examples and  applications of the<br>\ntool,  an assessment  of the  tool's strengths  and weaknesses,  and a<br>\nsummary of documentation/support available  with the tool. The body of<br>\nthe  paper  must  be no  longer  than  6  pages in  length  (including<br>\nbibliography),  and  it should  give  an  overview  of the  tool,  the<br>\nmethodology associated  with its  use, a summary  of how the  tool has<br>\nbeen  applied  and  to  what  effect,  and  it  should  indicate  what<br>\nsupporting artifacts (user manual, example repository, downloads, etc)<br>\nare  available.    This  material  will  be  included   in  the  ENTCS<br>\nproceedings if the  paper is accepted.  In addition,  the paper should<br>\ninclude an  appendix (limited to six  pages) that gives  an outline of<br>\nthe proposed demo  presentation (this material will NOT  appear in the<br>\nENTCS proceedings).</p>\n<p>Program Committee<br>\n=================</p>\n<p>Wolfgang Ahrendt        Chalmers University of Technology, SWE<br>\nElvira Albert (co-chair)    Complutense University of Madrid, ESP<br>\nJune Andronick              Security Lab - Gemalto, FRA<br>\nDavid Aspinall              University of Edinburgh, UK<br>\nCristina Cifuentes      Sun Microsystems, AUS<br>\nSamir Genaim (co-chair)     Technical University of Madrid, ESP<br>\nSara Kalvala                The University of Warwick, UK<br>\nGerwin Klein                The University of New South Wales, AUS<br>\nFrancesco Logozzo       Microsoft Research, USA<br>\nDavid Pichardie         INRIA Rennes (IRISA), FRA<br>\nTamara Rezk                 INRIA-Microsoft, FRA<br>\nFausto Spoto                University of Verona, ITA<br>\nEran Yahav              IBM T.J.
