It is hosted at <a href=\"http://www.babel-17.com\">www.babel-17.com</a>. There is also a Netbeans plugin for Babel-17, which is currently the featured plugin at <a href=\"http://netbeans.org\">netbeans.org</a> . </p>\n<p>Why would this be of interest to an Isabelle user? Well, first I think that purely functional programming is something that interests the typical Isabelle user. Second, if somebody is looking for a programming language for which to formulate a semantics in Isabelle, Babel-17 would surely be not too difficult to tackle, being purely functional and all :-) A slight complication might be the linear scope rules of Babel-17.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Steven Obua</p>",
