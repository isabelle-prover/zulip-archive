Among the most important ones are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there is a module system now</li>\n<li>you can define your own types, and in tandem with the module system achieve encapsulation and abstraction</li>\n<li>(automatic) type conversion</li>\n<li>unit testing is supported by language features</li>\n<li>there is a new built-in type \"real\" for floating point interval arithmetic</li>\n<li>the way order is dealt with has changed</li>\n<li>the Netbeans Plugin now supports not only Babel-17 files, but also entire Babel-17 projects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Initially I wasn't aware of it, but later it was pointed out to me that the way types in Babel-17 are defined is actually very similar to the way types in classic HOL systems like Isabelle are defined. Funny how the mind works :-)</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Steven Obua</li>\n</ul>",
