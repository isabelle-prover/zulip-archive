It is shipped with everything<br>\n     on-board, and hides a lot of complexity of system integration and<br>\n     consolidation.</p>\n<p>* Early adopters of arbitrary Isabelle repository clones need to<br>\n     understand more technicalities, and the semantic difference to a<br>\n     proper release (even though the younger generations no longer grasp<br>\n     the purpose of \"stable software releases\").</p>\n<p>You need to have extra time and/or good reasons to engage in repository <br>\nversions at all.  It is not a magic way to get new features earlier than <br>\nother users, but a way to participate in the ongoing development process <br>\ntowards the next official release.</p>\n<p>Discussing particular repository versions only makes sense in conjunction <br>\nwith the relevant changeset ids, and the isabelle-dev mailing list is the <br>\nplace for that.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
