Since<br>\nthe theory is somehow \"empty\" at the address above,<br>\nI wonder if something like this could be available in the next release?</p>\n<p>I am assuming this request makes some sense after all...</p>\n<p>Best!</p>",

And <br>\nsince this is also what Isabelle does, it would be very misleading to <br>\npresent it as if everything was actually inside Main. E.g., it is <br>\npossible to refer to constants and theorems using a theory name as <br>\nprefix. What you suggest would imply that \"Main.hd\" should work (since <br>\n\"hd\" is available after importing Main) but actually only \"List.hd\" will <br>\nwork.</p>\n<p>I agree that browsing is a bit inconvenient. Try browsing inside jEdit <br>\ninstead. If you press Ctrl and click on a constant (like \"hd\") you will <br>\ndirectly jump to its definition. (Use Ctrl + Backtick to jump back to <br>\nthe previous file.)</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",

I was not<br>\nso sure of this, especially<br>\nafter reading this:</p>\n<p>theory Main<br>\nimports Plain Predicate_Compile Nitpick SMT<br>\nbegin</p>\n<p>Also, this was not clear from the tutorial and the pdf documentation of<br>\nMain. Looking at the dependency theory graph, I have impression that we<br>\nhave in the ancessor list above more theories that  there are (really) in<br>\nMain.</p>\n<p>Thus, what I really wanted is to browse (examine?) Main exactly in the way<br>\nI can do, for<br>\ninstance, for Datatype.</p>\n<p>But I do not know if this could be done. It seems that Main is actually<br>\ncreated \"under the hood\".</p>\n<p>Many thanks for the reply!</p>",
