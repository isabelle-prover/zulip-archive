In that case, no other theories should need to be loaded. The only other theory to adopt as a starting point is Complex_Main, which includes some analysis. It is generally a mistake to import other theories from src/HOL or to store your own theories there.</p>\n<p>But even so, I am puzzled by your question. Isabelle/HOL pre-loads all the theories in the directory you mention, so I cannot see how they could be loaded again. I wonder whether the phenomenon you mention is simply that, when run for the first time, the system will automatically build Isabelle/HOL for you.</p>\n<p>Another remark: Isabelle2013-1 was found to have issues and was quickly replaced by Isabelle2013-2, which I advise you to download and use instead.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
