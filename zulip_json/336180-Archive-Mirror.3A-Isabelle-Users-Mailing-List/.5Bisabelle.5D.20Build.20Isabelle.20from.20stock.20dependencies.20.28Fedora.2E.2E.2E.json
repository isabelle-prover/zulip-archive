If you need special settings, put them into <br>\n~/.isabelle/etc/settings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>cvs -d :pserver:anon@cvs.inf.ed.ac.uk:/disk/cvs/proofgen login &amp;&amp; cvs -d :pserver:anon@cvs.inf.ed.ac.uk:/disk/cvs/proofgen checkout ProofGeneral</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Same here. You get an unknown development version, which hasn't been <br>\ntested to work properly with Isabelle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>export PROOFGENERAL_HOME=\"$(pwd)\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>the idea of settings like PROOFGENERAL_HOME is that you put them into <br>\n.isabelle/etc/settings, instead of a generic environment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>sed --in-place=\".backup.$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S')\" \"s|\\[ -z \\\"\\$PROOFGENERAL_HOME\\\" \\].*|PROOFGENERAL_HOME=\\\"$PROOFGENERAL_HOME\\\"|\" lib/Tools/emacs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not sure what this is for, but the scripts in lib/ are certainly not for <br>\nediting. Even if it happens to work, you get a big mess if you have to <br>\nupdate your Isabelle at some point.</p>\n<p>In summary, I cannot really recommend following this guide.</p>\n<p>Alex</p>",
