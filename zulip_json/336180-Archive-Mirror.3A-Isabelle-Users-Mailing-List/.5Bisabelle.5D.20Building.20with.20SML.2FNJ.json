I am <br>\nincluding the README of our distribution, which tells how binaries have <br>\nbeen produced.  You can also download our Poly/ML tar.gz files and then <br>\nbuild only the logic images.</p>\n<p>SML/NJ used to be an alternative many years ago, but the relative <br>\nperformance compared to Poly/ML has changed so much to render it <br>\nimpractical -- for two reasons: (1) big heap space makes NJ inherently <br>\nslow due to its stackless execution model, (2) NJ is single-threaded, but <br>\nstarting with Poly/ML 5.1 we have native Posix threads, which Isabelle2008 <br>\nalready uses to some degree for parallel theory loading.</p>\n<p>Recently, parallelism in Isabelle has been improved further -- in the next <br>\nrelease all proofs are checked concurrently.  There is also a general <br>\nprogramming ML model based on \"futures\".  Moreover, threads are used for <br>\nadvanced interaction models, e.g. an improved version of 'sledgehammer'.  <br>\nIn any case, heavy-duty multithreading after Isabelle2008 will require <br>\nPoly/ML 5.2.1 for stability reasons, see also <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/polyml-5.2.1/\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/polyml-5.2.1/</a></p>\n<p>Poly/ML 5.2.1 also works with Isabelle2008 if you pretend it is <br>\npolyml-5.2, e.g. like this in etc/settings:</p>\n<p>ML_PLATFORM=x86-linux<br>\n  ML_HOME=\"/home/polyml/polyml-5.2.1/$ML_PLATFORM\"<br>\n  ML_SYSTEM=polyml-5.2<br>\n  ML_OPTIONS=\"-H 500\"</p>\n<p>Here ML_SYSTEM is the critical bit.</p>\n<p>Makarius<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/gQhf6jh_8wCrmrn7pzM3y3nn/README\">README</a></p>",
