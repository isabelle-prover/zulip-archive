The conference programme will<br>\n  include invited talks, paper presentations, system<br>\n  descriptions, workshops, tutorials, and system competitions.</p>\n<p>SCOPE<br>\n  We invite high-quality submissions on the general topic of<br>\n  automated deduction, including foundations, applications,<br>\n  implementations and practical experiences.</p>\n<p>Logics of interest include, but are not limited to</p>\n<p>o propositional, first-order, equational, higher-order,<br>\n      classical, description, modal, temporal, many-valued,<br>\n      intuitionistic, other non-classical, meta-logics,<br>\n      logical frameworks, type theory and set theory.</p>\n<p>Methods of interest include, but are not limited to</p>\n<p>o saturation, resolution, instance-based, tableaux, sequent<br>\n      calculi, natural deduction, term rewriting, decision<br>\n      procedures, model generation, model checking, constraint<br>\n      solving, induction, unification, proof planning, proof<br>\n      checking, proof presentation and explanation.</p>\n<p>Applications of interest include, but are not limited to</p>\n<p>o program analysis and verification, hardware verification,<br>\n      mathematics, natural language processing, computational<br>\n      linguistics, knowledge representation, ontology reasoning,<br>\n      deductive databases, functional and logic programming,<br>\n      robotics, planning, and other areas of AI.</p>\n<p>WORKSHOPS, TUTORIALS, SYSTEM COMPETITION:<br>\n  A two-day workshop and tutorial programme will be co-organized<br>\n  with the conference. In addition, the annual CADE ATP System<br>\n  Competition (CASC) will be held during the conference.

The page limit in Springer LNCS style is<br>\n  15 pages for regular papers and 5 pages for system<br>\n  descriptions. Full system descriptions that provide in-depth<br>\n  presentation of original ideas in an implemented system can be<br>\n  submitted as regular papers. For the benefit of reviewers,<br>\n  additional material may be provided by a clearly marked<br>\n  appendix or a reference to a manuscript on a website. It is at<br>\n  the discretion of the reviewers whether such supplements will<br>\n  be considered. All regular papers will be evaluated according<br>\n  to the highest standards in terms of originality, significance,<br>\n  technical quality, and readability.</p>\n<p>Submissions must be in English and standard conforming pdf<br>\n  format. Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for<br>\n  publication elsewhere. Authors are strongly encouraged to<br>\n  produce their papers in LaTeX.</p>\n<p>Detailed instructions for electronic submission via EasyChair<br>\n  will be published at the conference website.
