Potential topics of interest include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)</li>\n<li>Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies and applications that both involve computer algebra and<br>\nmechanised reasoning</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Representation of mathematics in computer algebra</p>\n</li>\n<li>Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP</li>\n<li>Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving</li>\n<li>Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction</li>\n<li>Mathematical computation in PA and ATP</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for<br>\ncomputer mathematics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Infrastructure for mathematical services</p>\n</li>\n<li>Theory exploration techniques</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers on other topics closely related to the above research<br>\nareas will also be welcomed for consideration.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Abstract submission: 13 February 2009<br>\nSubmission deadline: 20 February 2009<br>\nNotification of acceptance: 10 April 2009<br>\nCamera ready copies due: 24 April 2009<br>\nCalculemus conference: 6,7 July 2009</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Theoretical and applied research papers on all topics within the scope<br>\nof the symposium are invited. Submitted papers (in English) must not<br>\nexceed 15 pages in length. The title page should contain the title,<br>\nauthor(s) with affiliation(s), e-mail address(es), listing of keywords<br>\nand abstract. The program committee (PC) will subject all submitted<br>\npapers to a peer review. Results must be unpublished.</p>\n<p>The web page for electronic submission is at:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calculemus2009\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calculemus2009</a></p>\n<p>The proceedings of the conference will be published as a volume in the<br>\nseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) by<br>\nSpringer-Verlag. Accepted papers will have to be prepared in LaTeX and<br>\nformatted according to the requirements of the Springer's LNAI series<br>\n(the corresponding style files can be downloaded from<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a> and are the same for LNCS<br>\nand LNAI).<br>\nProceedings</p>\n<p>Accepted papers will be published in the LNAI series of Springer.</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Markus Aderhold (TU Darmstadt, Germany)<br>\nSerge Autexier (DFKI, Germany)<br>\nJohn Campbell (University College London, UK)<br>\nJacques Carette (PC Chair) (McMaster University, Canada)<br>\nJames H.
