Potential topics of interest include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)</li>\n<li>Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies and applications that both involve computer algebra and<br>\nmechanised reasoning</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Representation of mathematics in computer algebra</p>\n</li>\n<li>Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP</li>\n<li>Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving</li>\n<li>Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction</li>\n<li>Mathematical computation in PA and ATP</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for<br>\ncomputer mathematics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Infrastructure for mathematical services</p>\n</li>\n<li>Theory exploration techniques</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers on other topics closely related to the above research<br>\nareas will also be welcomed for consideration.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For extended abstracts on emerging trends:</p>\n<p>Submission deadline: 7 May 2009<br>\nNotification of acceptance: 30 May 2009<br>\nCamera ready copies due: 12 June 2009</p>\n<p>The dates of the Calculemus conference are: 6,7 July 2009</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Extended abstracts for original theoretical and applied research on all<br>\ntopics within the scope of the symposium are invited. Submitions must be<br>\nin English. We suggest submitting extended abstracts of 10 pages, and<br>\nwill accept submissions between 200 words and 20 pages. The title page<br>\nshould contain the title, author(s) with affiliation(s), e-mail<br>\naddress(es), listing of keywords and abstract.</p>\n<p>The web page for electronic submissions for extended abstracts<br>\nconcerning emerging trends is:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calculemustrends2009\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calculemustrends2009</a></p>\n<p>These papers are expected to be describing work in progress. Emerging<br>\ntrends papers will be made available online, but will not be published.<br>\nEmerging trends submissions will be only lightly reviewed. The authors<br>\nwill present their work at a short talk in the symposium.</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Markus Aderhold (TU Darmstadt, Germany)<br>\nSerge Autexier (DFKI, Germany)<br>\nJohn Campbell (University College London, UK)<br>\nJacques Carette (PC Chair) (McMaster University, Canada)<br>\nJames H.
