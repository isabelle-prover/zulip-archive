As is<br>\nthe tradition, the hosts of the previous conference (i.e. TPHOLs 2008) are<br>\nrunning the process. There are two phases: solicitation of bids and voting.<br>\nThis message concerns the first phase.</p>\n<p>A longstanding convention is that the conference should be held in a<br>\ncontinent different to the location of the previous meeting, and therefore<br>\nno bids to host TPHOLs 2009 in America will be accepted. TPHOLs is<br>\ntraditionally held in August or September. Bids should be sent to<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:tphols08@ece.concordia.ca\">tphols08@ece.concordia.ca</a> and should include at least the following<br>\ninformation:</p>\n<p>name and email address of a contact person  :<br>\nnames of other people involved              :<br>\naddress of website for the bid              :<br>\napproximate dates of the conference         :<br>\nformat of the conference                    :</p>\n<p>Previous bids can be accessed through the TPHOLs webpages. Please refer to<br>\nthe TPHOLs 2009 Host Selection page</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ece.concordia.ca/TPHOLs2008/tphols2009.php\">http://www.ece.concordia.ca/TPHOLs2008/tphols2009.php</a></p>\n<p>Deadline for all bids is 10 March 2008.<br>\nShortly after that, the bids will be made public and the voting phase will<br>\ntake place. The people eligible to vote are those who are seriously thinking<br>\nof attending TPHOLs 2009. The voting system used will be Single Transferable<br>\nVote between all received bids.</p>",
