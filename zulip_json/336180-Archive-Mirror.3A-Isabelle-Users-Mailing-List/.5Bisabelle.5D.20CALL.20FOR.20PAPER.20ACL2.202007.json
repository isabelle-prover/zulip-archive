ACL2 is an industrial-strength<br>\nautomated reasoning system that is part of the Boyer-Moore family of<br>\ntheorem provers, for which its authors received the 2005 ACM Software<br>\nSystem Award. ACL2 2007 is hosted by FMCAD. We invite papers on any<br>\ntopics related to ACL2, and we encourage submission of papers related<br>\nto other theorem provers or formal methods that can be contributed to<br>\nthe ACL2 community.  Suggested topics include but are not limited by <br>\nthe following:</p>\n<p>* software or hardware verification with the theorem prover,<br>\n    * formalizations of mathematics in ACL2,<br>\n    * new libraries, tools, and interfaces for ACL2,<br>\n    * experiences with ACL2 in the classroom,<br>\n    * reports of and proposals for improvements of ACL2,<br>\n    * comparisons with other theorem provers<br>\n    * comparisons with other programming or specification languages,<br>\n    * challenge problems and their solutions,<br>\n    * foundational issues related to ACL2, and<br>\n    * implementations connecting ACL2 with other systems.</p>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format, as directed in<br>\nthe ACL2 2007 website. Submissions should be prepared in the ACM SIG<br>\nProceeding Templates, available from<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html\">http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html</a>. We strongly prefer<br>\nsubmissions in the \"LaTeX2e - Strict Adherence to the SIGS Style\".</p>\n<p>The ACL2 Workshop accepts both long papers (up to ten pages) and short<br>\npapers (up to four pages). Both categories of papers will be fully<br>\nrefereed. At least one author of each accepted papers must register<br>\nfor the workshop and give a presentation summarizing the paper's<br>\nresults. Authors of long papers will have more time to present their<br>\nwork at the workshop; this is the primary distinction between long and<br>\nshort papers. One of the main advantages of the ACL2 Workshop is that<br>\nattendees are already knowledgeable about ACL2, its syntax, its basic<br>\ncommands, and the art of writing models in it. So authors may assume<br>\nthat readers have this familiarity. We expect to provide workshop<br>\nproceedings and to include these proceedings in the ACM digital<br>\nlibrary.</p>\n<p>Many papers presented at the workshop will describe interactions with<br>\nthe theorem prover. We strongly encourage authors of such papers to<br>\nprovide ACL2 script files (aka \"books\") along with instructions for<br>\nusing these books in ACL2. Such supporting materials should follow the<br>\nguidelines at <a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/books/index.html\">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/books/index.html</a>. <br>\nFor accepted papers, these books will be mirrored on the ACL2 home page<br>\nand included in future ACL2 distributions.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION</p>\n<p>Chairs</p>\n<p>* Ruben Gamboa, University of Wyoming<br>\n        * Jun Sawada, IBM Austin Research Laboratory<br>\n        * John Cowles, University of Wyoming</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>* David Greve, Rockwell Collins, Inc.<br>\n        * John Harrison, Intel Corporation<br>\n        * Warren Hunt, University of Texas<br>\n        * Deepak Kapur, University of New Mexico<br>\n        * Matt Kaufmann, University of Texas<br>\n        * Bill Legato, NSA<br>\n        * Mike Lowry, NASA<br>\n        * Panagiotis Manolios, Georgia Institute of Technology<br>\n        * John Mathews, Galois Connections<br>\n        * Jose Meseguer, University of Illinois<br>\n        * Paul Miner, NASA<br>\n        * J Strother Moore, University of Texas<br>\n        * Rex Page, University of Oklahoma<br>\n        * Jose Luis Ruiz-Reina, University of Seville<br>\n        * Laurence Pierre, Universit√à de Nice Sophia-Antipolis, <br>\nLaboratoire TIMA</p>\n<p>* David Russinoff, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.<br>\n        * Konrad Slind, University of Utah<br>\n        * Matt Wilding, Rockwell Collins, Inc.</p>",
