This year, CAV is part of the 5th<br>\nInternational Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 2010), which includes<br>\nCAV and seven other conferences/symposia: CSF, ICLP, IJCAR, ITP, LICS,<br>\nRTA and SAT. More details about FLoC 2010 can be found at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.floc-conference.org/\">http://www.floc-conference.org/</a></p>\n<p>CAV considers it vital to continue its leadership in hardware<br>\nverification, maintain its recent momentum in software verification, and<br>\nconsider new domains such as biological systems. The conference covers<br>\nthe spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an<br>\nemphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and<br>\ntechniques that are needed for their implementation. The proceedings of<br>\nthe conference will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in<br>\nComputer Science series. A selection of papers will be invited to a<br>\nspecial issue of the International Journal on Formal Methods in System<br>\nDesign.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include:</p>\n<p>* Model checking techniques<br>\n  * Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations<br>\n  * Hardware verification techniques<br>\n  * Hybrid systems and embedded systems verification<br>\n  * Program analysis and software verification<br>\n  * Modeling and specification formalisms<br>\n  * Deductive, compositional, and abstraction techniques for verification<br>\n  * Testing and runtime analysis based on verification technology<br>\n  * Applications and case studies<br>\n  * Verification in industrial practice<br>\n  * Formal methods for biological systems</p>\n<p>Events</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There will be pre-conference workshops on July 14 and July 15, and<br>\npost-conference workshops on July 20. Please see the conference website<br>\nfor more details.</p>\n<p>There will be tutorials on July 15 (first day of the conference).</p>\n<p>Invited tutorial speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Brayton: University of California, Berkeley, US</li>\n<li>Kenneth McMillan: Cadence Berkeley Labs, US</li>\n<li>Thomas Reps: University of Wisconsin-Madison, US</li>\n<li>Andrey Rybalchenko: Max Planck Institute, Germany</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Invited speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Somesh Jha: University of Wisconsin-Madison, US</li>\n<li>Pasquale Malacaria: Queen Mary University, United Kingdom</li>\n<li>Maged  Michael: IBM, US</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CAV Award</p>\n<hr>\n<p>An annual award, called the CAV Award, has been established<br>\n       \"For a specific fundamental contribution<br>\n       or a series of outstanding contributions<br>\n       to the field of Computer-Aided Verification.\"</p>\n<p>The cited contribution(s) must have been made not more recently than<br>\nfive years ago and not over twenty years ago.  In addition, the<br>\ncontribution(s) should not yet have received recognition via a major<br>\naward, such as the ACM Turing or Kanellakis Awards. (The nominee may<br>\nhave received such an award for other contributions.)</p>\n<p>The award of $10,000 will be granted to an individual or a group of<br>\nindividuals chosen by the Award Committee from a list of nominations.<br>\nThe Award Committee may choose to make no award in a given year.</p>\n<p>The CAV Award will be presented in an award ceremony at the<br>\nComputer-Aided Verification Conference and a citation will be published<br>\nin a journal of record (currently, Formal Methods in System Design).</p>\n<p>Anyone, with the exception of members of the Award Committee, is<br>\neligible to receive the Award.</p>\n<p>The 2010 CAV Award Committee consists of Orna Grumberg (chair), Moshe<br>\nVardi, Joseph Sifakis, and Rajeev Alur. For the CAV Award in 2010,<br>\nplease send nominations to the CAV Award Committee Chair:<br>\nOrna Grumberg : orna (at) <a href=\"http://cs.technion.ac.il\">cs.technion.ac.il</a></p>\n<p>Nominations must be received by January 15, 2010.</p>\n<p>Paper Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There are two categories of submissions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A. Regular papers. Submissions, not exceeding fourteen (14) pages<br>\nusing Springer's LNCS format, should contain original research, and<br>\nsufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the<br>\ncontribution. For papers reporting experimental results, authors are<br>\nstrongly encouraged to make their data available with their submission.<br>\nSubmissions reporting on case studies in an industrial context are<br>\nstrongly invited, and should describe details, weaknesses and strength<br>\nin sufficient depth. Simultaneous submission to other conferences with<br>\nproceedings or submission of material that has already been published<br>\nelsewhere is not allowed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>B. Tool presentations. Submissions, not exceeding four (4) pages using<br>\nSpringer's LNCS format, should describe the implemented tool and its<br>\nnovel features. A demonstration is expected to accompany a tool<br>\npresentation. Papers describing tools that have already been presented<br>\nin this conference before will be accepted only if significant and clear<br>\nenhancements to the tool are reported and implemented.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers can be submitted in PDF or PS format. Submission is done with<br>\nEasyChair. The submission site  is now open.
