CAV considers it vital to continue<br>\n       its leadership in hardware verification, and maintain its recent<br>\n       momentum in software verification. The conference covers the<br>\n       spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with<br>\n       an emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and<br>\n       techniques that are needed for their implementation. The<br>\n       proceedings of the conference will be published in the<br>\n       Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A<br>\n       selection of papers will be invited to a special issue of the<br>\n       International Journal on Formal Methods and System Design.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include:</p>\n<p>- Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations<br>\n     - Hardware verification techniques<br>\n     - Hybrid systems and embedded systems verification<br>\n     - Program analysis and software verification<br>\n     - Modeling and specification formalisms<br>\n     - Deductive, compositional, and abstraction techniques for<br>\n       verification</p>\n<p>- Testing and runtime analysis based on verification technology<br>\n     - Applications and case studies<br>\n     - Verification in industrial practice</p>\n<p>Paper submission:</p>\n<p>There are two categories of submissions:</p>\n<p>A. Regular papers. Submissions, not exceeding thirteen (13) pages<br>\n          using Springer's LNCS format, should contain original research,<br>\n          and sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the<br>\n          contribution.  For papers reporting experimental results,<br>\n          authors are strongly encouraged to make their data available<br>\n          with their submission. Submissions reporting on case studies in<br>\n          an industrial context are strongly invited, and should describe<br>\n          details, weaknesses and strength in sufficient depth.<br>\n          Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings<br>\n          or submission of material that has already been published<br>\n          elsewhere is not allowed.</p>\n<p>B. Tool presentations. Submissions, not exceeding four (4) pages<br>\n          using Springer's LNCS format, should describe the implemented<br>\n          tool and its novel features. A demonstration is expected to<br>\n          accompany a tool presentation. Papers describing tools that<br>\n          have already been presented in this conference before will be<br>\n          accepted only if significant and clear enhancements to the tool<br>\n          are reported and implemented.</p>\n<p>Information concerning the procedure for submissions will be<br>\n     available on the conference home page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cav2007.org\">http://www.cav2007.org</a></p>\n<p>Submissions will be evaluated by the program committee for inclusion<br>\n     in the proceedings, which will be published by Springer-Verlag in<br>\n     the LNCS series. Papers exceeding the stated maximum length or<br>\n     submitted after January 28, 2007 run the risk of rejection<br>\n     without review.</p>\n<p>On an experimental basis for this year, authors will be granted<br>\n     access to the text content of their reviews during the review<br>\n     process. Authors will be given a short time period in which to<br>\n     submit feedback, which may (at the PC's discretion) be taken into<br>\n     account in the decision process. Strict guidelines on length and<br>\n     content of feedback will be provided to the authors.</p>\n<p>Important dates:</p>\n<p>Paper submission (firm): January 28, 2007<br>\n       Author feedback period: March 9-11, 2007<br>\n       Notification of acceptance: March 23, 2007<br>\n       Final version due: April 20, 2007</p>\n<p>Program Chairs:</p>\n<p>Werner Damm, U Oldenburg, damm at <a href=\"http://informatik.uni-oldenburg.de\">informatik.uni-oldenburg.de</a><br>\n     Holger Hermanns, Saarland U,  hermanns at <a href=\"http://cs.uni-sb.de\">cs.uni-sb.de</a></p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>Parosh Abdullah, Uppsala U<br>\n     Rajeev Alur, U Penn<br>\n     Sergey Berezin, Synopsis<br>\n     Armin Biere, JKU Linz<br>\n     Roderick Bloem, TU Graz<br>\n     Ahmed Bouajjani, U Paris 7<br>\n     Alessandro Cimatti, IRST Trento<br>\n     Edmund M.
