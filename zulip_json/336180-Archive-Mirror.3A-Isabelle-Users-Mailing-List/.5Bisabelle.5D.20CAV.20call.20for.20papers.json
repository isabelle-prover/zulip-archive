This year, CAV is part of the 4th</p>\n<p>International Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 2006), which includes</p>\n<p>CAV and five other conferences/symposia: ICLP, IJCAR, LICS, RTA, and</p>\n<p>SAT.  More details about FLoC 2006 can be found at</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/floc06\">http://research.microsoft.com/floc06</a>.</p>\n<p>CAV covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete</p>\n<p>applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and</p>\n<p>the algorithms and techniques that are needed for their</p>\n<p>implementation.  The proceedings of the conference will be published</p>\n<p>in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include:</p>\n<p>- Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations</p>\n<p>- Hardware verification techniques</p>\n<p>- Program analysis and software verification</p>\n<p>- Modeling and specification formalisms</p>\n<p>- Deductive, compositional, and abstraction techniques for</p>\n<p>verification</p>\n<p>- Testing and runtime analysis based on verification technology</p>\n<p>- Applications and case studies</p>\n<p>- Verification in industrial practice</p>\n<p>Events:</p>\n<p>Special Symposium:</p>\n<p>The first day of CAV is traditionally a tutorial day.  This year,</p>\n<p>the tutorial will be replaced with a special symposium entitled</p>\n<p>\"25 Years of Model Checking\".  The symposium will consist of</p>\n<p>invited lectures delivered by leading researchers in the field of</p>\n<p>model checking.  Topics will include historical perspectives,</p>\n<p>state-of-the-art research, and directions for future research.</p>\n<p>In addition to the special symposium, there will be seven affiliated</p>\n<p>workshops:</p>\n<p>- BMC'06: 4th International Workshop on Bounded Model Checking</p>\n<p>- TV'06: Multithreading in Hardware and Software: Formal</p>\n<p>Approaches to Design and Verification</p>\n<p>- SMT-COMP'06: 2nd Satisfiability Modulo Theories tools competition</p>\n<p>- ACL2'06: 6th International Workshop on the ACL2 Theorem Prover</p>\n<p>and its Applications</p>\n<p>- GDV'06: 3rd International Workshop on Games in Design and</p>\n<p>Verification</p>\n<p>- V&amp;D'06: 1st International Workshop on Verification on Debugging</p>\n<p>- Verified Software: Tools, Techniques, and Experiments</p>\n<p>Paper submission:</p>\n<p>There are two categories of submissions:</p>\n<p>A. Regular papers. Submissions, not exceeding thirteen (13) pages</p>\n<p>using Springer's LNCS format, should contain original research,</p>\n<p>and sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the</p>\n<p>contribution.  For papers reporting experimental results,</p>\n<p>authors are strongly encouraged to make their data available</p>\n<p>with their submission.  Simultaneous submission to other</p>\n<p>conferences with proceedings or submission of material that has</p>\n<p>already been published elsewhere is not allowed.</p>\n<p>B. Tool presentations. Submissions, not exceeding four (4) pages</p>\n<p>using Springer's LNCS format, should describe the implemented</p>\n<p>tool and its novel features. A demonstration is expected to</p>\n<p>accompany a tool presentation. Papers describing tools that</p>\n<p>have already been presented in this conference before will be</p>\n<p>accepted only if significant and clear enhancements to the tool</p>\n<p>are reported and implemented.</p>\n<p>Information concerning the procedure for submissions will be available</p>\n<p>on the conference home page: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/floc06/cav.htm\">http://research.microsoft.com/floc06/cav.htm</a></p>\n<p>Important dates:</p>\n<p>Paper submission (firm): January 27, 2006</p>\n<p>Notification of acceptance/rejection: April 10, 2006</p>\n<p>Final version due: May 6, 2006</p>\n<p>Program Chairs:</p>\n<p>Thomas Ball, Microsoft, tball at <a href=\"http://microsoft.com\">microsoft.com</a></p>\n<p>Robert Jones, Intel, rjones at <a href=\"http://ichips.intel.com\">ichips.intel.com</a></p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>Thomas Ball, Microsoft</p>\n<p>Clark Barrett, NYU</p>\n<p>Karthik Bhargavan, Microsoft</p>\n<p>Per Bjesse, Synopsys</p>\n<p>Ahmed Bouajjani, Univ.
