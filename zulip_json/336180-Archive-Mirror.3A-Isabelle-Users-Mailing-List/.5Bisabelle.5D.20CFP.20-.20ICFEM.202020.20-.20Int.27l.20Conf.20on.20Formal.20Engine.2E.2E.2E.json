Formal <br>\nMethods for the development of computer systems have been extensively <br>\nresearched and studied. We now have good theoretical understandings of <br>\nhow to describe what programs do, how they do it, and why they work. A <br>\nrange of semantic theories, specification languages, design techniques, <br>\nverification methods, and supporting tools have been developed and <br>\napplied to the construction of programs of moderate size that are used <br>\nin critical applications. The remaining challenge now is how to deal <br>\nwith problems in developing and maintaining large scale and complex <br>\ncomputer systems.</p>\n<p>The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial, academic, <br>\nand government experts, from a variety of user domains and software <br>\ndisciplines, to help advance state of the art. Researchers, <br>\npractitioners, tool developers, users, and technology transfer experts <br>\nare all welcome. We are interested in work that has been incorporated <br>\ninto real production systems, and in theoretical work that promises to <br>\nbring practical, tangible engineering benefits.</p>\n<p>Scope and Topics:<br>\nSubmissions related to the following principal themes are encouraged, <br>\nbut any topics relevant to the field of formal engineering methods and <br>\ntheir practical applications will also be considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstraction, refinement, and evolution</li>\n<li>Formal specification and modelling</li>\n<li>Formal verification and analysis</li>\n<li>Model checking</li>\n<li>Formal approaches to software testing and inspection</li>\n<li>Formal methods for self-adaptive systems</li>\n<li>Formal methods for object-oriented systems</li>\n<li>Formal methods for component-based systems</li>\n<li>Formal methods for concurrent and real-time systems</li>\n<li>Formal methods for cloud computing</li>\n<li>Formal methods for cyber-physical systems</li>\n<li>Formal methods for software safety and security</li>\n<li>Formal methods for software reliability and dependability</li>\n<li>Development, integration, and experiments involving verified systems</li>\n<li>Formal certification of products under international standards</li>\n<li>Formal model-based development and code generation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Dates:<br>\nFull Paper Submissions: 1 May 2020 (AoE)<br>\nWorkshop/Tutorial Proposals: 20 March 2020<br>\nAcceptance/Rejection Notification: 19 June 2020<br>\nCamera-ready: 17 July 2020</p>\n<p>Submission and Publication:<br>\nSubmissions to the conference must not have been published or be <br>\nconcurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will <br>\nbe judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field, <br>\ntechnical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference. The <br>\nproceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer <br>\nScience series.</p>\n<p>Papers should be written in English and should not exceed 16 pages in <br>\nLNCS format (more details here). Submissions should be made through the <br>\nICFEM 2020 submission page, handled by the EasyChair conference <br>\nmanagement system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfem20\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfem20</a></p>\n<p>Workshop or tutorial proposals should be directly sent to the Workshop <br>\nChair via email. Each proposal should include (1) title, scope, and <br>\naims, (2) brief bio of the organizer or lecturer, and (3) postal and <br>\nemail addresses.</p>\n<p>Organising Committee:</p>\n<p>General Co-Chairs<br>\nJin Song Dong, National University of Singapore and Griffith University, <br>\nSingapore/Australia<br>\nJim McCarthy, Defence Science and Technology, Australia</p>\n<p>Program Co-Chairs<br>\nShang-Wei Lin, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>\nZhe Hou, Griffith University, Australia<br>\nBrendan Mahony, Defence Science and Technology, Australia</p>\n<p>Finance Chair<br>\nYang Liu, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>\nJun Sun, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore</p>\n<p>Workshop Chair<br>\nHadrien Bride, Griffith University, Australia</p>\n<p>Doctoral Symposium Chair<br>\nLei Ma, Kyushu University, Japan</p>",
