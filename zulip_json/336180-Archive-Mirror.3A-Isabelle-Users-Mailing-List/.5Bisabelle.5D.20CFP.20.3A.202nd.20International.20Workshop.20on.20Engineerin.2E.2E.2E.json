The workshop covers areas such as formal<br>\nspecification, (extended) type checking, model checking, program<br>\nanalysis/transformation, model-based testing and model-driven software<br>\nconstruction. The workshop will bring together researchers and<br>\nindustry R&amp;D expertise together to exchange their knowledge, discuss<br>\ntheir research findings, and explore potential collaborations.</p>\n<p>Theme of the Workshop</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The main theme of the workshop is methods and techniques for<br>\nconstructing large reliable and secure systems. The goal of the<br>\nworkshop is to establish a platform for the exchange of ideas,<br>\ndiscussion, cross-fertilization, inspiration, co-operation, and<br>\ndissemination. The topics of the workshop include, but are not<br>\nlimited to:</p>\n<p>-- methods, techniques and tools for system safety and security<br>\n-- methods, techniques and tools for analysis, certification, and<br>\n   debugging of complex safety and security systems<br>\n-- model-based and verification-based testing<br>\n-- emerging application domains such as cloud computing and<br>\n   cyber-physical systems<br>\n-- case studies and experience reports on the use of formal methods<br>\n   for analyzing safety and security systems</p>\n<p>Submissions guidelines</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Paper submissions must be original, unpublished work. Submissions<br>\nshould be in made via the Easychair site:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esss2013\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esss2013</a>.</p>\n<p>Submitted manuscripts should be in English and formatted in the style<br>\nof the IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Format (see<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html\">http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>).<br>\nPapers should not exceed 6 pages for full papers and 2 pages for short<br>\npapers, including figures, references, and appendices. All submissions<br>\nshould be in PDF format. Submissions not adhering to the specified<br>\nformat and length may be rejected immediately, without review.</p>\n<p>All workshop papers will be published in the IEEE Digital Library in<br>\nthe form of a post-proceedings. A pre-workshop version of the papers<br>\nwill be available on the workshop website prior. Publication of<br>\naccepted articles requires the commitment of one of the authors to<br>\nregister for the workshop and present the paper.</p>\n<p>General chair</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Sjouke Mauw, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg</p>\n<p>Program chairs</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yang Liu, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>\nJun Pang, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg</p>\n<p>Program committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Etienne Andre, Universite Paris 13, France<br>\nCyrille Artho, AIST, Japan<br>\nMarieke Huisma, University of Twente, The Netherlands<br>\nWeiqiang Kong, Kyushu University, Japan<br>\nKeqin Li, SAP Research, France<br>\nYang Liu, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>\nZhiming Liu, UNU/IIST Macao, China<br>\nSjouke Mauw, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg<br>\nJun Pang, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg<br>\nGeguang Pu, East China Normal University, China<br>\nMohammad Torabi Dashti, ETH Zurich, Switzerland<br>\nAnton Wijs, Eindhoven University of Technology<br>\nYoriyuki Yamagata, AIST, Japan</p>",
