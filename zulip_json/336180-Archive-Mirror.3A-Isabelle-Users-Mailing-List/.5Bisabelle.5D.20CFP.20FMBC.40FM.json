Participants on the network reach agreement on what valid<br>\ntransactions are through consensus algorithms.</p>\n<p>Blockchains may also provide support for Smart Contracts. Smart<br>\nContracts are scripts of an ad-hoc programming language that are<br>\nstored in the blockchain and that run on the network. They can<br>\ninteract with the ledgers data and update its state. These scripts<br>\ncan express the logic of possibly complex contracts between users of<br>\nthe blockchain. Thus, Smart Contracts can facilitate the economic<br>\nactivity of blockchain participants.</p>\n<p>With the emergence and increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies such<br>\nas Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is now of utmost importance to have strong<br>\nguarantees of the behavior of blockchain so ware. These guarantees<br>\ncan be brought by using Formal Methods. Indeed, Blockchain software<br>\nencompasses many topics of computer science where using Formal Methods<br>\ntechniques and tools are relevant: consensus algorithms to ensure the<br>\nliveness and the security of the data on the chain, programming<br>\nlanguages specifically designed to write smart contracts,<br>\ncryptographic protocols, such as zero-knowledge proofs, used to ensure<br>\nprivacy, etc.</p>\n<p>This workshop is a forum to identify theoretical and practical<br>\napproaches of formal methods for blockchain technology. Topics<br>\ninclude, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design and implementation of Smart Contract languages</li>\n<li>Formal models of blockchain applications or concepts</li>\n<li>Formal methods for consensus protocols</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal methods for blockchain-specific cryptographic primitives or<br>\n  protocols Formal languages for Smart</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Verification of Smart Contracts</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submit original manuscripts (not published or considered elsewhere)<br>\nwith a maximum of twelve pages (regular papers), six pages (short<br>\npapers), and two pages (extended abstract) describing new and emerging<br>\nideas or summarizing existing work). Each paper should include a title<br>\nand the name and affiliation of each author. Authors of selected<br>\nextended-abstracts are invited to give a short lightning talk of up to<br>\n15 minutes.</p>\n<p>At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the<br>\npaper at the workshop as a registered participant. All accepted<br>\ncontributions will be reviewed once more by the program committee<br>\nafter the workshop and before being included in the post-proceedings.</p>\n<p>submission link <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmbc19\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmbc19</a></p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the<br>\nprogram committee for quality and relevance.
