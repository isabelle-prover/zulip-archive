Although this is<br>\ncommonly recognized, the incorporation of security requirements in the<br>\nsoftware development process is not yet well understood. The<br>\ndeployment of security mechanisms is often ad hoc, without a formal<br>\nsecurity specification or analysis, and practically always without a<br>\nformal security validation of the final product. Progress is being<br>\nmade, but there remains a wide gap between high-level security models<br>\nand actual code development.</p>\n<p>We aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from both the<br>\nsecurity and the software engineering communities, from academia and<br>\nindustry, who are working on applying formal methods to the design and<br>\nvalidation of large-scale systems.</p>\n<p>We seek original research papers addressing foundational issues in<br>\nformal methods in security engineering.  Topics covered include, but<br>\nare not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>security requirements and risk analysis</li>\n<li>access control models, information flow models, and trust models</li>\n<li>specification and analysis of security properties</li>\n<li>stepwise development by refinement and composition</li>\n<li>computationally sound abstraction</li>\n<li>program logics and type systems for security</li>\n<li>other techniques for verification and static analysis</li>\n<li>\n<p>tool support for the development and analysis of security-critical <br>\n  systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>design and analysis of security protocols</p>\n</li>\n<li>security aspects of operating systems and middleware</li>\n<li>case studies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed.  Authors of accepted papers<br>\nmust guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.<br>\nFinal proceedings will be published by the ACM.  </p>\n<p>Submissions must be received by Sunday June 10, 2007 to be considered.<br>\nFor submitting a paper, follow the guidelines on the FMSE'07 webpage<br>\nat <a href=\"http://www.fmis.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fmse07/\">http://www.fmis.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fmse07/</a> .</p>\n<p>Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers that have been<br>\npublished or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a<br>\nconference with proceedings.  The article must list all authors and<br>\ntheir affiliations.  It should begin with a title, a short abstract,<br>\nand a list of key words, and its introduction should summarize the<br>\ncontributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist<br>\nreader.  The submitted paper should be at most 12 pages excluding the<br>\nbibliography and clearly marked appendices, and at most 15 pages in<br>\ntotal, using at least 11-point font, reasonable margins, and page<br>\nnumbers on each page.  Committee members are not required to read<br>\nappendices; the paper should be intelligible without them.  The<br>\ndocument must be in Acrobat PDF format, and must be legible after<br>\nprinting on standard grayscale printers, both those that use A4 and<br>\nthose that use 8-1/2x11\" paper.  Submissions not meeting these<br>\nguidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.<br>\nCamera-ready versions of accepted papers will be limited to 10 pages<br>\nin total using the ACM conference style.</p>\n<p>Program Chairs<br>\n  Virgil D.
