The challenge aims  to be a</p>\n<p>showcase  that deductive  program  verification  can produce  relevant</p>\n<p>results for  real systems with  acceptable effort. The  challenge 2020</p>\n<p>started in  September 2019, and  ends February 2020.  To  conclude the</p>\n<p>challenge, we will  have a final workshop session at  ETAPS along with</p>\n<p>the VerifyThis program verification competition [1].</p>\n<p>For 2020, the  challenge system is the new, implementation  of the PGP</p>\n<p>server infrastructure,  called HAGRID [2]. The  old implementation did</p>\n<p>not  conform to  GDPR  and  was known  to  be  vulnerable against  DoS</p>\n<p>attacks.</p>\n<p>We invite  you to  present your  results on  the verification  of this</p>\n<p>security-relevant  challenge system  during a  special session  of the</p>\n<p>VerifyThis program verification competition, held at ETAPS.</p>\n<h2>Submission</h2>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit a presentation proposal (or extended</p>\n<p>abstract) as a PDF using Springerâ€™s LNCS style, which should be about</p>\n<p>a page long, but not longer than three pages (excluding bibliography).</p>\n<p>It should discuss ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>... the used verification approach and tools</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>... how the challenge was adapted to make verification possible</p>\n<p>(abstractions, reimplementation, different behaviour)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>... what has been achieved (modelled and verified properties)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>... successes and challenges encountered in the course of the case</p>\n<p>study.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Submission Link</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vtltc2020\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vtltc2020</a></p>\n<h2>Proceedings</h2>\n<p>There will be an informal pre-proceeding of the accepted presentation</p>\n<p>proposals.</p>\n<p>A special issue for this verification challenge is planned and will be</p>\n<p>discussed on-site.</p>\n<h2>Important dates</h2>\n<p>Submission deadline: 1st March 2020</p>\n<p>Notifications: 15th March 2020</p>\n<p>Workshop: 25-26th April 2020</p>\n<h2>Program Chairs and Organizers</h2>\n<p>Marieke Huisman                 Raul E.
