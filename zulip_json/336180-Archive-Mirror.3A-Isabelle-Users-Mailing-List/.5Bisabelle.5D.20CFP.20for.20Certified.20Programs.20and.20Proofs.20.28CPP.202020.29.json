Certification<br>\nhere means formal, mechanized verification of some sort, preferably<br>\nwith the production of independently checkable certificates.<br>\nCPP spans areas of computer science, mathematics, logic, and education.</p>\n<p>CPP 2020 will be held on 20-21 January 2020 in New Orleans, Louisiana,<br>\nUnited States and will be co-located with POPL 2020. CPP 2020 is<br>\nsponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGLOG.</p>\n<p>For more information about this edition and the CPP series please visit:<br>\n<a href=\"https://popl20.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2020\">https://popl20.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2020</a></p>\n<h3>News</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Submission guideline news: <strong>lightweight double-blind reviewing process</strong><br>\n and <strong>unrestricted appendices</strong> that don't count against the page limit</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delighted to announce that the <strong>invited speakers</strong> for CPP 2020 will be:<br>\n Adam Chlipala (MIT CSAIL) and Grigore Rosu (UIUC and Runtime Verification)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CPP 2020 will also host the <strong>POPLmark 15 Year Retrospective Panel</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Important Dates</h3>\n<p>- Abstract Deadline: 16 October 2019 at 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h)<br>\n  - Paper Submission Deadline: 21 October 2019 at 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h)<br>\n  - Notification: 27 November 2019<br>\n  - Camera Ready Deadline: 20 December 2019<br>\n  - Conference: 20 - 21 January 2020</p>\n<p>Deadlines expire at the end of the day, anywhere on earth.

Shorter<br>\npapers are welcome and will be given equal consideration. Papers not<br>\nconforming to the requirements concerning format and maximum length may<br>\nbe rejected without further consideration.</p>\n<p>CPP 2020 will employ a <strong>lightweight double-blind reviewing process</strong>.<br>\nTo facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>author names and institutions must be omitted, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>references to authors' own related work should be in the third person<br>\n  (e.g., not \"We build on our previous work …\" but rather “We build on<br>\n  the work of …\").</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers<br>\ncome to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it<br>\nimpossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing<br>\nshould be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or<br>\nmakes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular,<br>\nimportant background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In<br>\naddition, authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions<br>\nof their paper as usual. For example, authors may post drafts of their<br>\npapers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. POPL has<br>\nanswers for frequently asked questions addressing many common concerns:<br>\n<a href=\"https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ\">https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ</a></p>\n<p>We encourage authors to provide any supplementary material that is<br>\nrequired to support the claims made in the paper, such as proof scripts<br>\nor experimental data. These materials must be uploaded at submission<br>\ntime, as an archive, not via a URL. Two forms of supplementary material<br>\nmay be submitted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Anonymous supplementary material is available to the reviewers before<br>\n they submit their first-draft reviews.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Non-anonymous supplementary material is available to the reviewers<br>\n after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and learned the<br>\n identity of the authors.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use the anonymous form whenever possible, so that the materials can be<br>\ntaken into account from the beginning of the reviewing process.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and the<br>\nACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences,<br>\njournals, workshops with proceedings, or similar forums of publication<br>\nare not allowed. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related<br>\nwork submitted to a conference or journal in advance of submission.</p>\n<p>One author of each accepted paper is expected to present it at the<br>\nconference.</p>\n<h3>Publication, copyright, and open access</h3>\n<p>The CPP proceedings will be published by the ACM, and authors of accepted<br>\npapers will be required to choose one of the following publication options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM<br>\n<strong>a non-exclusive permission-to-publish license</strong><br>\n  and, optionally, licenses the work under a Creative Commons license;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM<br>\n<strong>an exclusive permission-to-publish license</strong>;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Author <strong>transfers copyright</strong> of the work to ACM.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For authors who can afford it, we recommend option 1, which will make<br>\nthe paper <strong>Gold Open Access</strong>, and also encourage such authors to<br>\nlicense their work under the CC-BY license. ACM will charge you an<br>\narticle processing fee for this option (currently, US$700), which you<br>\nhave to pay directly with the ACM.</p>\n<p>For everyone else, we recommend option 2, which is free and allows you<br>\nto achieve <strong>Green Open Access</strong>, by uploading a pre-print of your paper<br>\nto a repository that guarantees permanent archival such as arXiv or<br>\nHAL. This is anyway a good idea for <strong>timely dissemination</strong> even if you<br>\nchose option 1. Ensuring timely dissemination is particularly important<br>\nfor this edition, since, because of the very tight schedule, the<br>\nofficial proceedings might not be available in time for CPP.</p>\n<p>The official CPP 2020 proceedings will also be available via SIGPLAN<br>\nOpenTOC.</p>\n<p>For ACM's take on this, see their Copyright Policy and Author Rights.</p>\n<h3>Contact</h3>\n<p>For any questions please contact the <br>\n[message truncated]</p>",
