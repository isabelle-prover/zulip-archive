Theories of abstract syntax have proved<br>\nharder to find, especially those addressing properties related to<br>\nsubstituting structures for variables, binding of names and fresh<br>\nname generation. This special issue is devoted to papers describing<br>\nrecent advances in this area. Submissions are encouraged, but not<br>\nlimited to, the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>logical frameworks, meta-languages and tools that aid reasoning<br>\n   about substitution and binding</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>new formalisation techniques for languages involving binders</p>\n</li>\n<li>applications in programming languages that support binding</li>\n<li>\n<p>mechanised meta-theory of calculi involving binding and fresh<br>\n   name generation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>logic-based, categorical or set-based theories of names and binding</p>\n</li>\n<li>unification for languages involving binders</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Manuscripts should be unpublished works and not submitted<br>\nelsewhere. Revised and enhanced versions of papers published in<br>\nconference proceedings that have not appeared in archival journals<br>\nare eligible for submission. All submissions will be reviewed<br>\naccording to the high standards of scholarship and originality<br>\ncharacteristic of the Journal of Automated Reasoning.</p>\n<p>Submissions are due October 1, 2009. Papers should be in pdf format<br>\nfollowing the JAR guidelines for authors, see</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.springer.com/computer/foundations/journal/10817\">http://www.springer.com/computer/foundations/journal/10817</a></p>\n<p>We encourage authors to keep their submissions below 25 pages. Authors<br>\nshould submit their papers electronically via Easychair, see</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=taasnjar09\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=taasnjar09</a></p>\n<p>Guest Editors:</p>\n<p>Christian Urban and Maribel Fernandez<br>\n(TU Munich,King's College London)</p>\n<p>================================================================</p>",
