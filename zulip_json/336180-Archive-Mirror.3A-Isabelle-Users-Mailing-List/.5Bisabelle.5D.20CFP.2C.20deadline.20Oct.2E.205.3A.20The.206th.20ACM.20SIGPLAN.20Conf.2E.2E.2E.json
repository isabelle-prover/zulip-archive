The following is a suggested list of topics of <br>\ninterests to CPP. This is a non-exhaustive list and should be read as a <br>\nguideline rather than a requirement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>certified or certifying programming, compilation, linking, OS kernels, <br>\nruntime systems, and security monitors;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>program logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>certified decision procedures, mathematical libraries, and <br>\nmathematical theorems;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>proof assistants and proof theory;</p>\n</li>\n<li>new languages and tools for certified programming;</li>\n<li>program analysis, program verification, and proof-carrying code;</li>\n<li>certified secure protocols and transactions;</li>\n<li>\n<p>certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra, <br>\npolynomial systems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of interest;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality, <br>\nfirst-order logic, and higher-order unification;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>certificates for program termination;</p>\n</li>\n<li>logics for certifying concurrent and distributed programs;</li>\n<li>\n<p>higher-order logics, logical systems, separation logics, and logics <br>\nfor security;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>teaching mathematics and computer science with proof assistants.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission guidelines</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted in PDF format through the EasyChair <br>\nsubmission page at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2017\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2017</a>.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers must be formatted following the ACM SIGPLAN Proceedings <br>\nformat (seehttp://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/) using <strong>10 point</strong> <br>\nfont for the main text (not the default 9pt font).</p>\n<p>Papers should should not exceed <strong>12 pages</strong> including all tables, <br>\nfigures, and bibliography. Shorter papers are very welcome and will be <br>\ngiven equal consideration.</p>\n<p>Abstracts must be submitted by October 5, 2016 (AOE). The deadline for <br>\nfull papers is October 12, 2016 (AOE), and authors have the option to <br>\nwithdraw their papers during the window between the two.</p>\n<p>Submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to <br>\nallow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper. They <br>\nshould begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the <br>\nmain results, and a brief explanation of their significance and <br>\nrelevance to the conference, all phrased for the non-specialist. <br>\nTechnical and formal developments directed to the specialist should <br>\nfollow. References and comparisons with related work should be included. <br>\nPapers not conforming to the above requirements concerning format and <br>\nlength may be rejected without further consideration.</p>\n<p>Whenever appropriate, the submission should come along with a formal <br>\ndevelopment, using whatever prover, e.g., Agda, Coq, Dafny, Elf, HOL, <br>\nHOL-Light, Isabelle, Lean, Matita, Mizar, NQTHM, PVS, Vampire, etc. Such <br>\nformal developments must be submitted together with the paper as <br>\nauxiliary material, and will be taken into account during the reviewing <br>\nprocess.</p>\n<p>The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication <br>\nelsewhere, including the proceedings of other published conferences or <br>\nworkshops. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work <br>\nsubmitted to a conference or journal in advance of submission. Original <br>\nformal proofs of known results in mathematics or computer science are <br>\nwelcome. One author of each accepted paper is expected to present it at <br>\nthe conference.</p>\n<p>For any questions about the formatting or submission of papers, please <br>\nconsult the PC chairs.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>Abstract submission:    October 5, 2016<br>\nFull paper submission:    October 12, 2016<br>\nNotification:    November 16, 2016<br>\nConference dates:    January 16-17, 2017</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Reynald Affeldt, AIST, Japan<br>\nThorsten Altenkirch, University of Nottingham, UK<br>\nJesús Aransay, Universidad de La Rioja, Spain<br>\nAndrea Asperti, University of Bologna, Italy<br>\nClark Barrett, Stanford University, USA<br>\nYves Bertot, INRIA, France (co-chair)<br>\nNikolaj Bjorner, Microsoft Research, USA<br>\nAna Bove, Chalmers University of Technology &amp; University of Gothenburg, <br>\nSweden<br>\nDelphine Demange, IRISA / University of Rennes 1, France<br>\nReiner Hähnle, Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany<br>\nMarieke Huisman, University of Twente, Netherlands<br>\nCezary Kaliszyk, University of Innsbruck, Austria<br>\nRobbert Krebbers, Aarhus University, Denmark<br>\nOndřej Kunčar, Technische Universität München, Germany<br>\nMohsen Lesani, MIT, USA<br>\nAssia Mahboubi, INRIA, France<br>\nMichael Norrish, Data61, Australia<br>\nVincent Rahli, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg<br>\nTom Ridge, University of Leicester, UK<br>\nViktor Vafeiadis, MPI-SWS, Germany (co-chair)<br>\nFreek Verbeek, Open University of the Netherlands, Netherlands<br>\nSteve Zdancewic, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>",
