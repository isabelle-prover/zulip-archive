Rewriting <br>\nis the science of replacing equals by equals and thus a very powerful <br>\nmethod for dealing with equations. There are strong connections between <br>\nHaskell programming and rewriting.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we announce a new workshop,</p>\n<p>International Workshop on Haskell And Rewriting Techniques<br>\nHART 2013</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/HART2013/\">http://www.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/HART2013/</a></p>\n<p>to be held on June 27, in conjunction with RDP 2013, in Eindhoven. (RDP <br>\ncontains RTA, the main rewriting conference.)</p>\n<p>We plan a half day of discussions, in an informal setting, on how <br>\nHaskell and rewriting techniques and theories can cross-fertilize each <br>\nother.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest are, for example,</p>\n<p>- equational reasoning and other rewriting techniques for program <br>\nverification and analysis;</p>\n<p>- lambda calculi and type systems for functional programs and higher <br>\norder rewriting systems;</p>\n<p>- rewriting of type expressions in the type checker;<br>\n   - rewriting of programs by refactoring tools, optimizers, code <br>\ngenerators;</p>\n<p>- execution of programs as a form of graph rewriting;<br>\n   - template Haskell, introducing a rewriting-like macro language into <br>\nthe compilation process.</p>\n<p>This list of topics is non-exclusive. If you have a contribution that <br>\nconnects Haskell and rewriting, then submit. When in doubt, contact a <br>\nmember of the program committee.</p>\n<p>Program committee:</p>\n<p>Alcino Cunha (U Minho)<br>\n     Jürgen Giesl (RWTH Aachen)<br>\n     Andy Gill (U of Kansas)<br>\n     Johan Jeuring (U Utrecht)<br>\n     Keisuke Nakano (UEC Tokyo)<br>\n     Kristoffer H Rose (IBM Watson) (co-chair)<br>\n     Christian Sternagel (JAIST)<br>\n     Janis Voigtländer (U Bonn)<br>\n     Johannes Waldmann (HTWK Leipzig) (co-chair)</p>\n<p>Dates:</p>\n<p>May 6: deadline for submissions<br>\n     May 20: notification of acceptance<br>\n     June 27: workshop</p>\n<p>Submission and Proceedings:</p>\n<p>Two categories of submissions are invited:</p>\n<p>- Extended abstracts. Presenting original research, and also <br>\npreliminary reports of work in progress. Will be included in the <br>\nproceedings.</p>\n<p>- Presentation-only papers. Describing work recently published or <br>\nsubmitted. Will not be included in the proceedings.</p>\n<p>Papers should be at most 5 pages in length, and should use the <br>\neasychair.cls style. Submission is handled through the EasyChair <br>\nHART2013 page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hart2013\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hart2013</a></p>\n<p>In line with the informal style of the workshop, the reviewing of <br>\nsubmissions will be light.</p>\n<p>When accepting and scheduling presentations, preference will be given to <br>\noriginal research.</p>\n<p>Proceedings will be made available electronically at the workshop.</p>",
