CLIMA-IX will be co-located with JELIA 2008, the 11th<br>\nEuropean Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence, which runs<br>\nfrom 28th September to 1st October, 2008. See <a href=\"http://www.jelia.eu/2008\">http://www.jelia.eu/2008</a></p>\n<p>Multi-Agent Systems are communities of problem-solving entities that<br>\ncan perceive and act upon their environment in order to achieve both<br>\ntheir individual goals and their joint goals. The work on such systems<br>\nintegrates many technologies and concepts from artificial intelligence<br>\nand other areas of computing as well as other disciplines. Over recent<br>\nyears, the agent paradigm gained popularity, due to its applicability<br>\nto a full spectrum of domains, such as search engines, recommendation<br>\nsystems, educational support, e-procurement, simulation and routing,<br>\nelectronic commerce and trade, etc. Computational logic provides a<br>\nwell-defined, general, and rigorous framework for studying the syntax,<br>\nsemantics and procedures for the various tasks in individual agents,<br>\nas well as the interaction between, and integration amongst, agents in<br>\nmulti-agent systems. It also provides tools, techniques and standards<br>\nfor implementations and environments, for linking specifications to<br>\nimplementations, and for the verification of properties of individual<br>\nagents, multi-agent systems and their implementations.</p>\n<p>In this workshop we aim to bring together researchers from all these<br>\nareas to discuss and present their work.</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Relevant topics include, but are not limited to, the following (all<br>\nwith a focus on agents, multi-agent systems, or agent organisations):</p>\n<p>* logical foundations<br>\n     * extensions of logic programming<br>\n     * modal logic approaches<br>\n     * logic-based programming languages<br>\n     * non-monotonic reasoning<br>\n     * decision theory<br>\n     * hypothetical reasoning and learning<br>\n     * knowledge and belief representation and updates<br>\n     * operational semantics and execution agent models<br>\n     * model checking approaches using (multi-)agent logics<br>\n     * semantics of interaction and agent communication languages<br>\n     * distributed constraint satisfaction<br>\n     * temporal reasoning<br>\n     * distributed theorem proving<br>\n     * logic-based implementations<br>\n     * specification and verification of formal properties</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We invite submissions of high quality, original papers, which are not<br>\nsimultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers should be<br>\nwritten in English, formatted according to the Springer Verlag LNCS<br>\nstyle, which can be obtained from <a href=\"http://www.springeronline.com\">http://www.springeronline.com</a>, and<br>\nnot exceed 16 pages including figures, references, etc. Each paper<br>\nshould include some examples illustrating the proposed techniques.</p>\n<p>Submissions must be made via<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=clima9\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=clima9</a></p>\n<p>Submissions will be reviewed and selected and a printed volume of the<br>\nproceedings will be available at the workshop. We aim to publish a<br>\nselection of extended workshop papers in a Post-Proceedings volume<br>\nwithin the Springer Verlag LNAI series, as in previous years; see<br>\n<a href=\"http://centria.di.fct.unl.pt/~clima\">http://centria.di.fct.unl.pt/~clima</a></p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission Deadline:   9th July 2008<br>\nNotification:          9th August 2008<br>\nCamera Ready Copy Due: 5th September 2008<br>\nCLIMA IX:              29th-30th September 2008</p>\n<p>WORKSHOP CO-CHAIRS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Michael Fisher     (Liverpool, UK)  <a href=\"http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~michael\">http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~michael</a><br>\n  Fariba Sadri       (Imperial, UK)   <a href=\"http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~fs\">http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~fs</a><br>\n  Michael Thielscher (Dresden, DE)    <a href=\"http://web.inf.tu-dresden.de/~mit\">http://web.inf.tu-dresden.de/~mit</a></p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Natasha Alechina       (Nottingham, UK)<br>\n    Jose Julio Alferes     (Lisbon, PT)<br>\n    Rafael Bordini         (Durham, UK)<br>\n    Gerhard Brewka         (Leipzig, DE)<br>\n    Stefania Costantini    (L'Aquila, IT)<br>\n    Mehdi Dastani          (Utrecht, NL)<br>\n    Juergen Dix            (Clausthal, NL)<br>\n    Chiara Ghidini         (Trento, IT)<br>\n    James Harland          (RMIT, AUS)<br>\n    Hisashi Hayashi        (Toshiba, JP)<br>\n    Wiebe van der Hoek     (Liverpool, UK)<br>\n    Katsumi Inoue          (NII, JP)<br>\n    Joao Leite             (Lisbon, PT)<br>\n    Fangzhen Lin           (UST, HK)<br>\n    Viviana Mascardi       (Genoa, IT)<br>\n    Paola Mello            (Bologna, IT)<br>\n    John-Jules Meyer       (Utrecht, NL)<br>\n    Leora Morgenstern      (Stanford, USA)<br>\n    Naoyuki Nide           (Nara, JP)<br>\n    Mehmet Orgun           (Macquarie, AUS)<br>\n    Maurice Pagnucco       (NSW, AUS)<br>\n    Jeremy Pitt            (Imperial, UK)<br>\n    Enrico Pontelli        (New Mexico, USA)<br>\n    Chiaki Sakama          (Wakayama, JP)<br>\n    Ken Satoh              (NII, JP)<br>\n    Renate Schmidt         (Manchester, UK)<br>\n    Tran Cao Son           (New Mexico, USA)<br>\n    Francesca Toni         (Imperial, UK)<br>\n    Marina de Vos          (Bath, UK)<br>\n    Cees Witteveen         (Delft, NL)</p>\n<hr>",
