We welcome<br>\nsubmissions related to any pragmatic aspect of automated tools for formal<br>\nmethods covering languages, methodology, interfaces, integration, and<br>\nexperiments, including work in progress and comparisons with related<br>\nsystems.  Topics of interest include  </p>\n<p>- Language embeddings<br>\n   - Decision procedures <br>\n   - Model checking (symbolic, explicit-state, bounded, timed, and hybrid)<br>\n   - Extended type systems, type checking, and static analysis<br>\n   - Interactive proof checking<br>\n   - Code generation and test generation from specifications<br>\n   - Combinations of the above techniques<br>\n   - Applications, including novel uses of formal methods technologies<br>\n   - Experimental evaluations and system comparisons<br>\n   - Benchmark suites</p>\n<p>The workshop will include a tutorial on the recent developments in PVS,<br>\nICS, and SAL, as well as invited and contributed talks.  PVS is a<br>\ngeneral-purpose verification system based on higher-order logic with an<br>\ninteractive theorem prover integrating decision procedures, rewriting, and<br>\nmodel checking.  ICS is a family of ground decision procedures for<br>\nsatisfiability modulo theories.  SAL is a framework for specifying and<br>\nverifying transition systems using a combination of static analysis, model<br>\nchecking, and theorem proving tools.  More information about these tools<br>\nis available at <a href=\"http://fm.csl.sri.com\">http://fm.csl.sri.com</a></p>\n<p>AFM 2006 will be part of IJCAR 2006 (<a href=\"http://ijcar06.uni-koblenz.de/\">http://ijcar06.uni-koblenz.de/</a>) and the<br>\nFederated Logic Conference (FLoC '06; <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/floc06/\">http://research.microsoft.com/floc06/</a>)<br>\nto be held in Seattle during August 10--22, 2006.<br>\n===========================================================================<br>\nSUBMISSIONS: Submitted papers should be in PDF form and can <br>\nbe at most 12 pages long in the LNCS format.  They must be original and not<br>\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere.  Submissions are to be uploaded at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/AFM\">http://www.easychair.org/AFM</a>.  The proceedings will be published<br>\ninformally and made available in electronic form.  Authors are strongly<br>\nencouraged to make available any relevant machine proofs or software<br>\n(including proof strategies) needed to verify the results in their<br>\nsubmission.   <br>\n===========================================================================<br>\nWORKSHOP CHAIRS:<br>\n    John Rushby (SRI International, rushby at csl . sri . com)<br>\n    Natarajan Shankar (SRI International, shankar at csl . sri . com)<br>\n===========================================================================<br>\nPROGRAM COMMITTEE:<br>\n    Myla Archer (NRL)<br>\n    Geoffrey Brown (Indiana)<br>\n    Chris George (UNU-IIST)<br>\n    Mike Gordon (Cambridge)<br>\n    Mats Heimdahl (Minnesota)<br>\n    Wim Hesselink (Groningen)<br>\n    Jerry James (Utah State) <br>\n    Mark Lawford (McMaster)<br>\n    Pete Manolios (Georgia Tech)<br>\n    Cesar Munoz (NIA) <br>\n    Hendrik Tews (Dresden)<br>\n    R.
