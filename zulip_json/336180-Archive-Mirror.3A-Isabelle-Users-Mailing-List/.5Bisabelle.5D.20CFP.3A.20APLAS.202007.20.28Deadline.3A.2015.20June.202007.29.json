APLAS is based in Asia, but is an international forum that<br>\nserves the worldwide programming languages community.</p>\n<p>The APLAS series is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation<br>\nof Software (AAFS), which has recently been founded by Asian<br>\nresearchers in cooperation with many researchers from Europe and the<br>\nUSA.  The past formal APLAS symposiums were successfully held in<br>\nSydney (2006, Australia), Tsukuba (2005, Japan), Taipei (2004, Taiwan)<br>\nand Beijing (2003, China) after three informal workshops held in<br>\nShanghai (2002, China), Daejeon (2001, Korea) and Singapore (2000).<br>\nProceedings of the past symposiums were published in Springer-Verlag's<br>\nLNCS 2895, 3302, 3780, and 4279.</p>\n<p>TOPICS:</p>\n<p>The symposium is devoted to both foundational and practical issues in<br>\nprogramming languages and systems. Papers are solicited on, but not<br>\nlimited, to the following topics:</p>\n<p>* semantics, logics, foundational theory<br>\n     * type systems, language design<br>\n     * program analysis, optimization, transformation<br>\n     * software security, safety, verification<br>\n     * compiler systems, interpreters, abstract machines<br>\n     * domain-specific languages and systems<br>\n     * programming tools and environments</p>\n<p>Original results that bear on these and related topics are<br>\nsolicited. Papers investigating novel uses and applications of<br>\nlanguage systems are especially encouraged. Authors concerned about<br>\nthe appropriateness of a topic are welcome to consult with the program<br>\nchair &lt;<a href=\"mailto:aplas2007@easychair.org\">aplas2007@easychair.org</a>&gt; prior to submission.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS:</p>\n<p>Vincent Danos    (University of Paris VII &amp; CNRS, France)<br>\n   Sriram Rajamani  (Microsoft Research, India)<br>\n   Vijay Saraswat   (IBM TJ Watson Research Lab, USA)</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>\n<p>Paper Submission Deadline:   11:00AM (in Samoan Time), June 15, 2007<br>\n   Author Notification:         August 17, 2007<br>\n   Camera Ready:                September 7, 2007<br>\n   Conference:                  November 29-December 1, 2007</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS INFORMATION:</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted electronically online via the conference<br>\nsubmission web page at URL &lt;<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/APLAS2007\">http://www.easychair.org/APLAS2007</a>&gt;.<br>\nAcceptable formats are PostScript or PDF, viewable by Ghostview or<br>\nAcrobat Reader.
