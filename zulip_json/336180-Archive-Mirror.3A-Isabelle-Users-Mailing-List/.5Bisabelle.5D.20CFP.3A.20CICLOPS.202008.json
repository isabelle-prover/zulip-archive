Experience  backed  up   by  real<br>\nimplementations and their evaluation will be given preference, as well<br>\nas descriptions of work in progress in that direction.</p>\n<p>Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* Standard and alternative sequential implementation schemes (e.g.,<br>\n    generalization / modification of the WAM, translation to<br>\n    lower-level and/or general-purpose languages, etc.)</p>\n<p>* Implementation of parallel and concurrent logic and constraint<br>\n    programming systems.</p>\n<p>* Compile-time analysis and its application to code generation.</p>\n<p>* Interaction between high-level optimizations / transformations /<br>\n    specialization and low-level issues.</p>\n<p>* Memory management, indexing, and garbage collection issues.</p>\n<p>* Balance between compile-time effort and run-time machinery.</p>\n<p>* Implementation techniques for declarative programming paradigms<br>\n    with basis on, or extending, logic and constraint programming,<br>\n    such as non-monotonic reasoning, inductive logic programming,<br>\n    co-inductive logic programming, contextual logic programming, etc. </p>\n<p>* Implementation of systems closely related to, or based on, logic,<br>\n    such as theorem provers and natural language processing systems.</p>\n<p>* Automatic performance evaluation of logic and constraint<br>\n    programming systems.</p>\n<p>* User-oriented tools for performance evaluation and enhancement.</p>\n<p>* Software design with / for LP/CP systems: components, code<br>\n    patterns and rules, etc.</p>\n<p>* Design and implementation of programming environments.</p>\n<p>* Experiences from using systems in real-life applications.</p>\n<p>Workshop Goals</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Our  intent is  to  bring  together, in  an  informal setting,  people<br>\ninvolved  in  research   on  sequential  and  parallel  implementation<br>\ntechnologies  for  logic  and  constraint  programming  languages  and<br>\nsystems, in  order to  promote the exchange  of ideas and  feedback on<br>\nrecent developments. We hope that  the workshop will provide a meeting<br>\npoint for  people working  on implementation technology  for different<br>\naspects of logic and constraint-based languages and systems.</p>\n<p>Rationale and History</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Progress in computing technology,  including the now readily available<br>\nmulticore processors, increased  memory capacity and bandwidth, faster<br>\nnetworking  technology,  and   O.S.  support  for  cluster  computing,<br>\ncombined  with recent  advances  in compilation  technologies and  the<br>\nwider  adoption   of  alternative  constraint/logic-based  programming<br>\nlanguages,  are making  high-level languages  to be  regarded  as good<br>\ncandidates for programming  complex, demanding applications. A witness<br>\nof this  very interesting  trend is the  interest of Intel  with their<br>\nsponsorship  of the DAMP  series of  workshops. Logic  Programming and<br>\nConstraint  Programming,   in  particular,  offer  one   of  the  best<br>\nalternatives, as  they couple a very  high level of  abstraction and a<br>\ndeclarative nature with flexibility  its execution model, which can be<br>\nadapted to different scenarios.</p>\n<p>An orthogonal but synergistic  issue in the pursue of high-performance<br>\nand  high-level  languages   comes  from  advances  in  implementation<br>\ntechniques for logic and constraint languages. These techniques aim at<br>\nachieving  both design flexibility  and good  performance in  terms of<br>\nspeed and memory consumption,  thus making those languages and systems<br>\nmore  amenable  than ever  for  real  world applications.  Maintaining<br>\nflexibility without  unnecessarily sacrificing performance,  and while<br>\nretaining a  high level which  relieves the programmer  from burdening<br>\ntasks,  requires   sophisticated  technology  whose   exploration  and<br>\ndevelopment is one the aims of this workshop.</p>\n<p>This  workshop  continues  a  tradition  of  successful  workshops  on<br>\nImplementations of Logic Programming  Systems, previously held with in<br>\nBudapest  (1993) and  Ithaca  (1994), the  Compulog  Net workshops  on<br>\nParallelism and  Implementation Technologies held in  Madrid (1993 and<br>\n1994), Utrecht (1995) and Bonn (1996), the Workshop on Parallelism and<br>\nImplementation Technology for (Constraint) Logic Programming Languages<br>\nheld in  Port Jefferson (1997), Manchester (1998),  Las Cruces (1999),<br>\nand London (2000), and  more recently the Colloquium on Implementation<br>\nof Constraint and LOgic  Programming Systems in Paphos (Cyprus, 2001),<br>\nCopenhagen (2002),  Mumbai (2003),  Saint Malo (France,  2004), Sitges<br>\n(Spain, 2005), Seattle (U.S.A., 2006) and Porto (Portugal, 2007).</p>\n<p>Submission Information</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Authors  are invited  to  submit  papers written  in  English and  not<br>\nexceeding 12 pages and using  LNCS format.
