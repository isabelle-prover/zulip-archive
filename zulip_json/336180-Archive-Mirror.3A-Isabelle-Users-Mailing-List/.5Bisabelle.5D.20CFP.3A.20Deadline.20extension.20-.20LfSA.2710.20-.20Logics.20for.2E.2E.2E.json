Henzinger, IST Austria</li>\n<li>César A. Muñoz, NASA Langley</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Safety-critical systems frequently occur as real-time systems, embedded<br>\nsystems, hybrid systems, distributed systems, and cyber-physical<br>\nsystems. They are also becoming more and more important in many<br>\napplication domains, including aviation, automotive, railway, robotic,<br>\nor medical applications. To ensure the correct functioning of<br>\nsafety-critical systems it is necessary to model and reason about<br>\nhardware (including physical properties or movement), software,<br>\ncommunication aspects, and qualitative and quantitative aspects of the<br>\nsystem environment.</p>\n<p>Logics for system analysis, system modeling, and specification, are<br>\nprimary tools to analyze system behavior.  Logic is equally important<br>\nfor understanding the theoretical foundations of system analysis and as<br>\nthe basis for practical analysis tools that establish correct<br>\nfunctioning of systems or find bugs in their designs.  Depending on the<br>\nnature of the system, modeling languages that are amenable to logical<br>\nanalysis and the study of correctness properties include logical<br>\nrepresentations, automata, state charts, Petri nets, dataflow models, or<br>\nsystems of differential equations. Several system models can be analyzed<br>\nrigorously with the help of techniques such as logical calculi, decision<br>\nprocedures, model checking, and abstraction.</p>\n<p>LfSA'10 is devoted to the systematic theoretical study, practical<br>\ndevelopment, and applied use of logics for system analysis. The purpose<br>\nof the LfSA workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners<br>\ninterested in studying practically relevant systems or in developing the<br>\nlogical foundations and analysis tools for their study.</p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Logics for safety-critical systems (real-time, embedded, hybrid,<br>\n  distributed, stochastic, cyber-physical)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logic-based methods for development of safety-critical systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>System representations using logics, automata, modeling<br>\n  languages, state charts, Petri nets, dataflow models</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theories, decision procedures, and calculi for system analysis</p>\n</li>\n<li>Model checking, theorem proving, and systematic testing</li>\n<li>Case studies for logical system analysis</li>\n<li>Applications of system analysis to industrial problems<br>\n  (including automotive, aviation, railway, robotics, process<br>\n  control, mixed analog/digital circuits in chip design)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular, we invite contributions that bridge the gap between<br>\ntheory and practice or that combine different application domains.</p>\n<p>Submission Categories</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Regular papers (up to 15 pages), which should present previously<br>\n  unpublished work (completed or in progress), including<br>\n  descriptions of research, tools, and applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short papers (up to 5 pages), which describe work in progress or<br>\n  aim at initiating discussions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Presentation-only papers, i.e., papers already submitted or<br>\n  presented at a conference or another workshop; such papers will<br>\n  not be included in the LfSA proceedings but will be presented<br>\n  during the workshop.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to informal and electronic workshop proceedings, we consider<br>\nthe option of a special issue in a journal after the workshop.</p>\n<p>Submission is done via Easychair:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=lfsa2010\">https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=lfsa2010</a></p>\n<p>Important Dates/Deadlines</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Abstract submission:  March 30, 2010<br>\nPaper submission:     April 5, 2010<br>\nNotification:         April 28, 2010<br>\nFinal version due:    May 20, 2010<br>\nWorkshop:             July 15, 2010</p>\n<p>Workshop/Programme Chairs</p>\n<hr>\n<p>André Platzer (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA)<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:aplatzer@cs.cmu.edu\">aplatzer@cs.cmu.edu</a></p>\n<p>Philipp Rümmer (Oxford University, UK)<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:philr@comlab.ox.ac.uk\">philr@comlab.ox.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p>Programme Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Raul Barbosa (Chalmers, Gothenburg, Sweden)<br>\nAlessandro Cimatti (IRST Trento, Italy)<br>\nStéphane Demri (CNRS Cachan, France)<br>\nJavier Esparza (TU Munich, Germany)<br>\nGeorgios E.
