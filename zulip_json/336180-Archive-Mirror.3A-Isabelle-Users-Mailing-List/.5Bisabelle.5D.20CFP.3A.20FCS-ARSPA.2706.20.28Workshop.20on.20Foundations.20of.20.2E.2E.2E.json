In recent years, there has been<br>\nincreasing interest in logic-based foundations for various methods in<br>\ncomputer security, including the formal specification, analysis and<br>\ndesign of security protocols and their applications, the formal<br>\ndefinition of various aspects of security such as access control<br>\nmechanisms, mobile code security and denial-of-service attacks, and the<br>\nmodeling of information flow and its application to confidentiality<br>\npolicies, system composition, and covert channel analysis.</p>\n<p>The workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is the fusion of two workshops. The workshop<br>\nFCS continues a tradition, initiated with the Workshops on Formal<br>\nMethods and Security Protocols (FMSP) in 1998 and 1999, then with the<br>\nWorkshop on Formal Methods and Computer Security (FMCS) in 2000, and<br>\nfinally with the LICS satellite Workshop on Foundations of Computer<br>\nSecurity (FCS) in 2002 through 2005, of bringing together formal methods<br>\nand the security community.</p>\n<p>The ARSPA workshop is the third in a series of workshops on Automated<br>\nReasoning for Security Protocol Analysis, bringing together researchers<br>\nand practitioners from both the security and the formal methods<br>\ncommunities, from academia and industry, who are working on developing<br>\nand applying automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal<br>\nspecification and analysis of security protocols. The first two ARSPA<br>\nworkshops were held as satellite events of IJCAR'04 and of ICALP'05,<br>\nrespectively.</p>\n<p>The aim of the joint workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is to provide a forum for<br>\ncontinued activity in these areas, to bring computer security<br>\nresearchers in closer contact with the LICS community, and to give LICS<br>\nattendees an opportunity to talk to experts in computer security. We<br>\nthus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work and on work in<br>\nprogress.</p>\n<p>We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security<br>\nand also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions<br>\nand raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in<br>\nnew results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques<br>\nand tools for the formal specification and analysis of security<br>\nprotocols.</p>\n<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>Automated reasoning techniques       Access control and resource usage control<br>\nComposition issues                   Authentication<br>\nFormal specification                 Availability and denial of service<br>\nFoundations of verification          Covert channels<br>\nInformation flow analysis            Confidentiality<br>\nLanguage-based security              Integrity and privacy<br>\nLogic-based design              for  Intrusion detection<br>\nProgram transformation               Malicious code<br>\nSecurity models                      Mobile code<br>\nStatic analysis                      Mutual distrust<br>\nStatistical methods                  Privacy<br>\nTools                                Security policies<br>\nTrust management                     Security protocols</p>\n<p>All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must<br>\nguarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION<br>\n==========</p>\n<p>Submissions should be at most 15 pages (a4paper, 11pt), including<br>\nreferences, in the Springer LNCS style available at the URL<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a><br>\nThe cover page should include title, names of authors, co-ordinates of<br>\nthe corresponding author, an abstract, and a list of keywords.<br>\nIt is recommended that submissions adhere to the specified format and<br>\nlength. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected<br>\nimmediately.<br>\nAdditional material intended for the referees but not for publication in<br>\nthe final version - for example details of proofs - may be placed in a<br>\nclearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. <br>\nSimultaneous submissions to a journal or another conference are accepted.</p>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit their papers electronically, as portable<br>\ndocument format (pdf) or postscript (ps); please, do not send files<br>\nformatted for work processing packages (e.g., Microsoft Word or<br>\nWordperfect files).</p>\n<p>The only mechanism for paper submissions is via the electronic<br>\nsubmission web-site (which will soon be available).</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\n===============</p>\n<p>Papers due:                     May  10, 2006<br>\nNotification of acceptance:     June 16, 2006<br>\nFinal paper versions due:       July 14, 2006<br>\nWorkshop:                   August 15-16, 2006</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION<br>\n===========<br>\nInformal proceedings will be made available in electronic format and<br>\nthey will be distributed to all participants of the workshop.<br>\nThe authors of the best papers might be invited to submit an extended<br>\nrevision for inclusion in a special issue of a journal, with an<br>\nadditional reviewing process.</p>\n<p>INVITED TALKS<br>\n=============<br>\nTo be announced</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>\n=================</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alessandro Armando (Universita` di Genova, Italy)</li>\n<li>Jorge R.
