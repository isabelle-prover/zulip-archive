Newer languages such<br>\nas Java and C# provide good platforms to bridge the gap between formal<br>\ntechniques and practical program development, because of their<br>\nreasonably clear semantics and standardized libraries. Moreover, these<br>\nlanguages are interesting targets for formal techniques, because the<br>\nnovel paradigm for program deployment introduced with Java, with its<br>\nimproved portability and mobility, opens up new possibilities for<br>\nabuse and causes concern about security.</p>\n<p>Work on formal techniques and tools for programs and work on the<br>\nformal underpinnings of programming languages themselves naturally<br>\ncomplement each other. This workshop aims to bring together people<br>\nworking in both these fields, on topics such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formal techniques for Java, C#, Scala or similar languages</li>\n<li>specification techniques and interface specification languages</li>\n<li>specification of software components and library packages</li>\n<li>automated checking and verification of program properties</li>\n<li>verification logics</li>\n<li>language semantics</li>\n<li>type systems</li>\n<li>dynamic linking and loading</li>\n<li>security</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS</p>\n<p>Contributions (of up to 6 pages in the ACM 2-column style) are sought<br>\non open questions, new developments, or interesting new applications<br>\nof formal techniques in the context of Java or similar<br>\nlanguages. Contributions need not merely present completely finished<br>\nwork, but also raise challenging open problems or propose speculative<br>\nnew approaches. We particularly welcome contributions that simply<br>\nsuggest good topics for discussion at the workshop, or raise issues<br>\nthat you feel deserve the attention of the research community.</p>\n<p>Contributions will be formally reviewed, for originality, relevance,<br>\nand the potential to generate interesting discussions.</p>\n<p>Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. In<br>\naddition, depending on the nature of the contributions, we may<br>\norganize a special journal issue as a follow-up to the workshop, as<br>\nhas been done for some of the previous FTfJP workshops.</p>\n<p>Contributions must be in English, in pdf format, and are limited to<br>\n6-pages in ACM 2-column style.</p>\n<p>Papers must be submitted electronically via Easy Chair at:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2012\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2012</a></p>\n<p>Any PC member, other than the chair, may be an author or co-author on<br>\nany paper submitted for consideration but will be excluded from any<br>\nevaluation or discussion of the paper.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>abstract submission:        16 March 2012 (anywhere on Earth)<br>\nfull paper submission:      25 March 2012 (anywhere on Earth)<br>\nnotification:           29 April 2012<br>\ncamera-ready paper:     12 May 2012<br>\nconference date:        12 June 2012</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>Aditya Nori,        Microsoft Research India<br>\nAquinas Hobor,      National University of Singapore, (co-chair)<br>\nAtsushi Igarashi,   Kyoto University, Japan<br>\nFlorin Craciun,     Babes Bolyai University, Romania<br>\nHoang Truong,       Vietnam National University, Vietnam<br>\nJens Palsberg,      University of California, USA<br>\nJesper Bengtson,    IT-University of Copenhagen, Denmark<br>\nJianjun Zhao,       Shanghai Jiaotong University, China<br>\nJohn Boyland,       University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, USA<br>\nJules Villard,      Queen Mary, University of London, UK<br>\nSophia Drossopoulou,    Imperial College London, UK<br>\nThomas Wies,        New York University, USA<br>\nTyng-Ruey Chuang,   Academia Sinica, Taiwan<br>\nWei-Ngan Chin,      National University of Singapore, (co-chair)<br>\nZongyan Qiu,        Peking University, China</p>",
