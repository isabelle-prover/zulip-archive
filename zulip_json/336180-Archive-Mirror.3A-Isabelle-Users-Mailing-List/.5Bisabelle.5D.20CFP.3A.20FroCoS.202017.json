Its main goal is to disseminate and promote<br>\n  progress in research areas related to the development of techniques<br>\n  for the integration, combination, and modularization of formal<br>\n  systems together with their analysis.</p>\n<p>FroCoS 2017 will be co-located with the 26th International<br>\n  Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related<br>\n  Methods (TABLEAUX 2017) and the 8th International Conference on<br>\n  Interactive Theorem­Proving (ITP 2017). The local organization of<br>\n  all events will be organised  by Claudia Nalon (USB, Brazil),<br>\n  Daniele Nantes (UnB, Brazil), Elaine Pimentel (UFRN, Brazil) and<br>\n  João Marcos (UFRN, Brazil).</p>\n<p>SCOPE OF CONFERENCE<br>\n  In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation,<br>\n  program development and verification, artificial intelligence,<br>\n  knowledge representation, and automated reasoning, there is an<br>\n  obvious need for using specialized formalisms and inference systems<br>\n  for selected tasks. To be usable in practice, these specialized<br>\n  systems must be combined with each other and integrated into general<br>\n  purpose systems. This has led---in many research areas---to the<br>\n  development of techniques and methods for the combination and<br>\n  integration of dedicated formal systems, as well as for their<br>\n  modularization and analysis.</p>\n<p>The International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems<br>\n  (FroCoS) traditionally focusses on these types of research questions<br>\n  and activities. Like its predecessors, FroCoS 2017 seeks to offer a<br>\n  common forum for research in the general area of combination,<br>\n  modularization, and integration of systems, with emphasis on<br>\n  logic-based ones, and of their practical use.</p>\n<p>Typical topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<p>* combinations of logics (such as higher-order, first-order,<br>\n      temporal, modal, description or other non-classical logics);</p>\n<p>* combination and integration methods in SAT and SMT solving;<br>\n    * combination of decision procedures, satisfiability<br>\n      procedures, constraint solving techniques, or logical<br>\n      frameworks;</p>\n<p>* combinations and modularity in ontologies;<br>\n    * integration of equational and other theories into deductive<br>\n      systems;</p>\n<p>* hybrid methods for deduction, resolution and constraint<br>\n      propagation;</p>\n<p>* hybrid systems in knowledge representation and natural<br>\n      language semantics;</p>\n<p>* combined logics for distributed and multi-agent systems;<br>\n    * logical aspects of combining and modularizing programs and<br>\n      specifications;</p>\n<p>* integration of data structures into constraint logic<br>\n      programming and deduction;</p>\n<p>* combinations and modularity in term rewriting;<br>\n    * applications of methods and techniques to the verification and<br>\n      analysis of information systems.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>\n  [TO BE ANNOUNCED]</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION DETAILS<br>\n  The proceedings of the symposium will be published in the<br>\n  Springer LNAI/LNCS series.</p>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS<br>\n  The program committee seeks high-quality submissions describing<br>\n  original work, written in English, not overlapping with published or<br>\n  simultaneously submitted work to a journal or conference with<br>\n  archival proceedings. Selection criteria include accuracy and<br>\n  originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and<br>\n  quality of presentation. The page limit in Springer LNCS style is 16<br>\n  pages.</p>\n<p>Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be<br>\n  submitted electronically as PDF files via the EasyChair system at<br>\n  the following address:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=frocos2017\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=frocos2017</a></p>\n<p>For each accepted paper, at least one of the authors is required to<br>\n  attend the symposium and present the work. Prospective authors must<br>\n  register a title and an abstract five days before the paper<br>\n  submission deadline. Further information about paper submissions is<br>\n  available at the conference website that can be found at the<br>\n  beginning of this call for papers.</p>\n<p>WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS<br>\n  Proposals for Workshops and Tutorial sessions have been solicited<br>\n  in a separate call, which can be found at<br>\n<a href=\"http://frocos2017.cic.unb.br/#cfw\">http://frocos2017.cic.unb.br/#cfw</a>.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\n  24th April 2017: Abstract submission deadline<br>\n  28th April 2017: Full paper submission deadline<br>\n   9th June  2017: Author notification<br>\n  23rd June  2017: Camera-ready version due<br>\n  September 25-29, 2017: FroCoS Conference</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>\n Carlos Areces, FaMAF - Universidad Nacional de Córdoba<br>\n Alessandro Artale, Free University of Bolzano-Bozen<br>\n Mauricio Ayala-Rincon, Universidade de Brasilia<br>\n Franz Baader, TU Dresden<br>\n Peter Baumgartner, National ICT Australia<br>\n Christoph Benzmüller, Freie Universität Berlin<br>\n Thomas Bolander, Technical University of Denmark<br>\n Marcelo Coniglio, State University of Campinas<br>\n Clare Dixon, University of Liverpool [co-chair]<br>\n François Fages, Inria Paris-Rocquencourt<br>\n Marcelo Finger, Universidade de Sao Paulo [co-chair]<br>\n Pascal Fontaine, LORIA, INRIA, University of Lorraine<br>\n Didier Galmiche, LORIA, University of Lorraine<br>\n Vijay Ganesh, University of Waterloo<br>\n Silvio Ghilardi, Università degli Studi di Milano<br>\n Jürgen Giesl, RWTH Aachen<br>\n Laura Giordano, Università del Piemonte Orientale<br>\n Agi Kurucz, Kings College, London<br>\n Till Mossakowski, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg<br>\n Cláudia Nalon, University of Brasília<br>\n Elaine Pimentel, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte<br>\n Silvio Ranise, Fondazione Bruno Kessler-Irst<br>\n Christophe Ringeissen, LORIA-INRIA<br>\n Uli Sattler, University of Manchester<br>\n Roberto Sebastiani, University of Trento<br>\n Guillermo Simari, Universidad Nacional del Sur in Bahia Blanca<br>\n Viorica Sofronie-Stokkermans, University Koblenz-Landau<br>\n Andrzej Szalas, University of Warsaw<br>\n René Thiemann, University of Innsbruck<br>\n Ashish Tiwari, SRI International<br>\n Christoph Weidenbach, Max Planck Institute for Informatics</p>",
