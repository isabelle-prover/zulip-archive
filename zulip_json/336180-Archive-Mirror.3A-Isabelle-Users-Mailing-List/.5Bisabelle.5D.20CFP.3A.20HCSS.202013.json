You are invited to<br>\nsubmit a proposal to present a talk at this year's conference. As an added<br>\nfeature at the 2013 HCSS Conference, you are also invited to participate in<br>\na poster session. See details below for more information.<br>\n<em>Background</em><br>\nOur security, safety, privacy, and well-being are all increasingly<br>\ndependent upon the correctness, reliability, resilience, and integrity of<br>\nsoftware-intensive systems of all kinds, including cyber-physical systems<br>\n(CPS). Our systems must be capable of interacting correctly, safely, and<br>\nsecurely with humans and the physical world even while they operate in<br>\nchanging, difficult-to-predict, and possibly malicious environments. New<br>\nfoundations in science, technology, and advanced practice continue to be<br>\nneeded. Moreover, these methods and tools have to be transitioned into<br>\nmainstream use to build and assure these systems‹and to move towards more<br>\neffective models for acceptance and certification.<br>\n<em>Conference Scope, Goals, and Vision</em><br>\nThe High Confidence Software and Systems (HCSS) Conference, now in its<br>\nsecond decade, draws together researchers, practitioners, and management<br>\nleaders from government, universities, and industry. The conference<br>\nprovides a forum for dialogue centered upon the development of scientific<br>\nfoundations for the assured engineering of software-intensive complex<br>\ncomputing systems and the transition of science into practice. The<br>\ntechnical emphasis of the HCSS conference is on mathematically-based tools<br>\nand techniques, scientific foundations supporting evidence creation,<br>\nsystems assurance, and security. The HCSS vision is one of engaging and<br>\ngrowing a community‹including researchers and skilled practitioners‹that is<br>\nfocused around the creation of dependable systems that are capable,<br>\nefficient, and responsive; that can work in dangerous or inaccessible<br>\nenvironments; that can support large-scale, distributed coordination; that<br>\naugment human capabilities; that can advance the mission of national<br>\nsecurity; and that enhance quality of life, safety, and security.<br>\n<em>Conference Themes</em><br>\nThe 2013 HCSS Conference week will highlight daily themes including on the<br>\nfollowing topics:<br>\n·       <em>Automatic theorem proving and SMT:</em> With the rapidly increasing<br>\npower and applicability of automated theorem proving and SMT tools, both<br>\nnew and existing tools can benefit tremendously from the reduction of both<br>\ndecidable and undecidable programs to these off-the-shelf tools.<br>\n Furthermore, developers of automated reasoning tools are actively looking<br>\nto increase the applicability and performance of their tools based on<br>\ncustomer need.  The idea of this day is to get prover developers together<br>\nwith users of the tools to discuss what is possible today, and what will be<br>\npossible tomorrow.<br>\n·       <em>Javascript:</em>  Javascript is the modern day x86 (messy but<br>\nomnipresent). In order to make off-the-shelf systems robust and secure, we<br>\nmust consider ways of writing and reasoning about Javascript code.  The<br>\npurpose of this day¹s theme will be to gather experts in programming,<br>\nnetworking, program verification/analysis, etc to discuss the current<br>\nadvances in the area of Javascript-based development.  Note that<br>\npresentations on tools or techniques that address problems similar to<br>\nJavascript are also welcome.<br>\n·       <em>Boundary between hardware and software</em>: The dramatic increase in<br>\ncomputational performance and power requirements combined with the<br>\nleveling-off of microprocessor clock speeds forces us to remove traditional<br>\nabstractions between hardware and software.  For example, weak memory<br>\nconcurrency gives increased performance at the cost of the traditional idea<br>\nof sequential consistency. On this day we aim to bring together those<br>\nworking at different levels of abstraction in computer systems to discuss<br>\ncommon techniques, goals, and to learn about techniques unique to their<br>\narea that may be applicable in others.<br>\nNote that presentations on other related themes are also encouraged.<br>\n<em>Conference Presentations</em><br>\nThe conference program features invited speakers, panel discussions, poster<br>\npresentations, and a technical track of contributed papers.<br>\n<em>Technical Track Presentations</em><br>\nThe technical track features two kinds of talks:<br>\n§  <em>Experience reports.</em> These talks inform participants about how emerging<br>\nHCSS and CPS techniques play out in real-world applications, focusing<br>\nespecially on lessons learned and insights gained. While experience reports<br>\ndo not have to be highly technical, they should emphasize substantive<br>\nreflection on all aspects of experience, building on data and direct<br>\nexperience. Experience reports can focus on topics such as transitioning<br>\nscience into practice, architecture and requirements, the use of advanced<br>\nlanguages and tools, evaluation and assessment, team practice and tooling,<br>\nsupply-chain issues, and so on.<br>\n§  <em>Technical talks.</em> These talks focus on informing the audience regarding<br>\nspecific techniques or methods, ideally from the point of view of someone<br>\nwith experience in practice. There is a wide range of relevant topics and<br>\nthemes including analysis of concurrency, use of hybrid reasioning<br>\napproaches, theorem proving, separation logic, analysis, synthesis,<br>\nanalytics, and modeling particular techniques. Such talks should<br>\nnonetheless be accessible to the broad HCSS and CPS audience.<br>\nIf you are interested in offering a talk on one of this year's topics or<br>\nthemes‹or nominating someone else to be invited to do so‹please upload an<br>\nabstract of  *one page or less *for your proposed talk or a *one paragraph<br>\ndescription* of your nominee¹s proposed talk by <em>Tuesday, March 22nd, 2013</em><br>\n to</p>\n<p><em>http://cps-vo.org/group/hcss_conference/cfp2013</em>&lt;<a href=\"http://cps-vo.org/group/hcss_conference/cfp2013\">http://cps-vo.org/group/hcss_conference/cfp2013</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Slide presentations and supporting documents of accepted talks should be<br>\nsubmitted in pdf format no later than <em>Friday, April 27, 2013</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Poster Presentations</em><br>\nIf you are interested in participating in the poster session, please upload<br>\nan <em>abstract</em> of your proposed poster theme with title by *Tuesday, March<br>\n22nd, 2013* at</p>\n<p><em>http://cps-vo.org/group/hcss_conference/cfposters2013</em></p>\n<p>Posters should provide an overview of the HCSS Conference theme or research<br>\ntopic and/or results, with effective use of appropriate graphics.
