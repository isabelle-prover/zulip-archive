ITP is the evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to the<br>\nbroad<br>\nfield of interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year<br>\nfrom<br>\n1988 until 2009. The ninth ITP conference, ITP 2018, will be held in Oxford,<br>\nJuly 9-12, 2018.</p>\n<p>SCOPE OF CONFERENCE<br>\nITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of<br>\ninteractive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics include<br>\nbut<br>\nare not limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formal aspects of hardware and software</li>\n<li>formalizations of mathematics</li>\n<li>improvements in theorem prover technology</li>\n<li>user interfaces for interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>formalizations of computational models</li>\n<li>verification of security algorithms</li>\n<li>use of theorem provers in education</li>\n<li>industrial applications of interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PUBLICATION DETAILS<br>\nThe proceedings of the symposium will be published in the Springer's LNCS<br>\nseries.</p>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS<br>\nAll submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted<br>\nconcurrently<br>\nfor publication elsewhere. Furthermore, when appropriate, submissions are<br>\nexpected to be accompanied by verifiable evidence of a suitable<br>\nimplementation,<br>\nsuch as the source files of a formalization for the proof assistant used.<br>\nThese<br>\nmaterials can be uploaded with the submission, or made available on the<br>\nweb. In<br>\neither case, the submission should provide clear instructions to referees<br>\nas to<br>\nhow to obtain the relevant materials and compile them or check them, as the<br>\ncase<br>\nmay be.</p>\n<p>Submissions will be subjected to single-blind peer review. They should be no<br>\nmore than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic references and are to<br>\nbe<br>\nsubmitted in PDF via EasyChair at the following address:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2018\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2018</a></p>\n<p>Submissions must conform to the LNCS style in LaTeX. An author of each<br>\naccepted<br>\npaper is expected to present it at the conference and will be required to<br>\nsign a<br>\ncopyright release form.</p>\n<p>In addition to regular papers, described above, there will be a section for<br>\nshorter papers, which can be used to describe interesting work that is still<br>\nongoing and not fully mature. Such a preliminary report is limited to 6<br>\npages<br>\nand may consist of an extended abstract. Each of these papers should bear<br>\nthe<br>\nphrase \"(short paper)\" beneath the title, and will be refereed and be<br>\nexpected<br>\nto present innovative and promising ideas, possibly in early form. Accepted<br>\nsubmissions in this category will be published in the main proceedings and<br>\nwill<br>\nbe presented as short talks.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\nAbstract submission deadline: January 25, 2018<br>\nFull paper submission deadline: January 31, 2018<br>\nAuthor notification: March 31, 2018<br>\nCamera-ready papers: May 2, 2018<br>\nConference: July 9-10, 2018</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>\nJeremy Avigad, Carnegie Mellon University (chair)<br>\nAssia Mahboubi, Inria (chair)<br>\nAndreas Abel, Gothenburg University<br>\nBenedikt Ahrens, University of Birmingham<br>\nJune Andronick, CSIRO|Data61 and UNSW<br>\nAdam Chlipala, Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br>\nJasmin Christian Blanchette, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam<br>\nThierry Coquand, Chalmers University of Technology<br>\nKarl Crary, Carnegie Mellon University<br>\nDelphine Demange, IRISA / University of Rennes 1<br>\nTimothy Griffin, University of Cambridge<br>\nThomas Hales, University of Pittsburgh<br>\nJohn Harrison, Intel<br>\nJohannes Hölzl, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam<br>\nChung-Kil Hur, Seoul National University<br>\nJacques-Henri Jourdan, LRI, CNRS, Université Paris-Sud<br>\nCezary Kaliszyk, University of Innsbruck<br>\nAmbrus Kaposi, Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest<br>\nChantal Keller, LRI, CNRS, Université Paris-Sud<br>\nPanagiotis Manolios, Northeastern University<br>\nMariano Moscato, National Institute of Aerospace<br>\nLeonardo de Moura, Microsoft Research<br>\nMagnus O.
