Their<br>\ndesign and implementation on one hand and their applications, for<br>\nexample, to proof-carrying code have been the focus of considerable<br>\nresearch over the last two decades. This workshop will bring together<br>\ndesigners, implementors, and practitioners to discuss all aspects of<br>\nlogical frameworks.</p>\n<p>The broad subject areas of LFMTP'06 are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The automation and implementation of the meta-theory of programming<br>\n   languages and related calculi, particularly work which involves<br>\n   variable binding and fresh name generation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The theoretical and practical issues concerning the encoding of<br>\n   variable binding and fresh name generation, especially the<br>\n   representation of, and reasoning about, datatypes defined from binding<br>\n   signatures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies of meta-programming, and the mechanization of the<br>\n   (meta)theory of programming languages and calculi. Papers focusing on<br>\n   experiences with encoding programming languages theory and instances<br>\n   of proof-carrying code or proof-carrying authorization are<br>\n   particularly welcome.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* logical framework design<br>\n     * meta-theoretic analysis<br>\n     * applications and comparative studies<br>\n     * implementation techniques<br>\n     * efficient proof representation and validation<br>\n     * proof-generating decision procedures and theorem provers<br>\n     * proof-carrying code<br>\n     * sub-structural frameworks<br>\n     * semantic foundations<br>\n     * methods for reasoning about logics<br>\n     * case studies.</p>\n<p>Invited Speaker: Gordon Plotkin (University of Edinburgh).</p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>Andrew Appel            Princeton University<br>\nThierry Coquand     Goteborg University<br>\nMartin Hofmann      LMU Munich<br>\nFurio Honsell       University of Udine<br>\nDale Miller         Inria Futurs<br>\nBrigitte Pientka    McGill University<br>\nAndrew Pitts        Cambridge University<br>\nKevin Watkins       Carnegie Mellon University</p>\n<p>Paper Submissions.</p>\n<p>Three categories of papers are solicited:</p>\n<p>* Category A: Detailed and technical accounts of new research: up<br>\n     to fifteen pages including bibliography.</p>\n<p>* Category B: Shorter accounts of work in progress and proposed<br>\n     further directions, including discussion papers: up to eight<br>\n     pages including bibliography.</p>\n<p>* Category C: System descriptions, presenting an implemented tool<br>\n     and its novel features: up to six pages.
