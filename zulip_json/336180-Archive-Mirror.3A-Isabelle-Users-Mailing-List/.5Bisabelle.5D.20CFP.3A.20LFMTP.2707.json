Their<br>\ndesign and implementation on the one hand and their applications in<br>\nfor example proof-carrying code have been the focus of considerable<br>\nresearch over the last two decades. This workshop will bring together<br>\ndesigners, implementors, and practitioners to discuss all aspects of<br>\nlogical frameworks.</p>\n<p>The broad subject areas of LFMTP'07 are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The automation and implementation of the meta-theory of programming<br>\n     languages and related calculi, particularly work which involves<br>\n     variable binding and fresh name generation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The theoretical and practical issues concerning the encoding of<br>\n     variable binding and fresh name generation, especially the<br>\n     representation of, and reasoning about, datatypes defined from binding<br>\n     signatures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies of meta-programming, and the mechanization of the<br>\n     (meta)theory of descriptions of programming languages and other<br>\n     calculi.  Papers focusing on logic translations and on experiences<br>\n     with encoding programming languages theory are particularly welcome.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Topics include, but are not limited to</p>\n<p>* logical framework design<br>\n       * meta-theoretic analysis<br>\n       * applications and comparative studies<br>\n       * implementation techniques<br>\n       * efficient proof representation and validation<br>\n       * proof-generating decision procedures and theorem provers<br>\n       * proof-carrying code<br>\n       * substructural frameworks<br>\n       * semantic foundations<br>\n       * methods for reasoning about logics<br>\n       * formal digital libraries</p>\n<p>Invited Speaker: Randy Pollack, University of Edinburgh</p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>Andreas Abel           (LMU Munich)<br>\nPeter Dybjer           (Chalmers University)<br>\nMarino Miculan         (University Udine)<br>\nDale Miller        (INRIA Futurs)<br>\nBrigitte Pientka       (McGill University)<br>\nBenjamin Pierce        (University of Pennsylvania)<br>\nCarsten Schuermann     (IT University of Copenhagen, PC Chair)<br>\nChristian Urban        (TU Munich)</p>\n<p>Paper Submissions:</p>\n<p>Three categories of papers are solicited:</p>\n<p>* Category A: Detailed and technical accounts of new research: up<br>\n       to fifteen pages including bibliography.</p>\n<p>* Category B: Shorter accounts of work in progress and proposed<br>\n       further directions, including discussion papers: up to eight<br>\n       pages including bibliography and appendices.</p>\n<p>* Category C: System descriptions presenting an implemented tool<br>\n       and its novel features: up to six pages.
