SPES_XT (Software Platform Embedded<br>\nSystems) is a large German endeavour to build a consistent, coherent<br>\nmodel-based design methodology for complex embedded and cyber-physical<br>\nsystems. The aim of AVoCS (International Workshop on Automated<br>\nVerification of Critical Systems) is to further research on tools and<br>\ntechniques for the verification of critical systems. The SPES_XT<br>\nSummer School at AVoCS'14 will present results and experiences from<br>\nthe SPES_XT project, as well as research approaches established at<br>\nAVoCS. It will provide a concise introduction to the state-of-the-art,<br>\nas well as new approaches and research questions. Attendants will gain<br>\nan intimate understanding of a consistent system development process<br>\nfor complex embedded and cyber-physical systems over different<br>\napplication domains (e.g. automation, automotive, avionic, rail).</p>\n<p>The school addresses young researchers as well as young professionals<br>\nfrom industry.
