Strongly encouraged are proposals of<br>\nnew, speculative ideas, evaluations of new or known techniques in<br>\npractical settings, and discussions of emerging threats and important<br>\nproblems.  The scope of PLAS includes, but is not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Compiler-based security mechanisms or runtime-based security<br>\n  mechanisms such as inline reference monitors</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Program analysis techniques for discovering security vulnerabilities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automated introduction and/or verification of security enforcement<br>\n  mechanisms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Language-based verification of security properties in software,<br>\n  including verification of cryptographic protocols</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specifying and enforcing security policies for information flow<br>\n  and access control</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Model-driven approaches to security</p>\n</li>\n<li>Security concerns for web programming languages</li>\n<li>\n<p>Language design for security in new domains such as cloud computing<br>\n  and embedded platforms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications, case studies, and implementations of these techniques</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission Guidelines</p>\n<p>Two kinds of papers are invited:</p>\n<p>Full papers should be at most 12 pages long including bibliography and<br>\nappendices. Papers in this category are expected to have relatively<br>\nmature content. Full paper presentations will be 25 minutes each.</p>\n<p>Short papers should be at most 6 pages long including bibliography and<br>\nappendices. Preliminary and exploratory work are welcome in this<br>\ncategory. Short papers presentations will be 15 minutes each. Authors<br>\nsubmitting papers in this category must prepend the phrase \"Short<br>\nPaper:\" to the title of the submitted paper.</p>\n<p>All submissions must be in English. Page limits are<br>\nstrict. Submissions must be PDF documents typeset in the ACM<br>\nproceedings format using 10pt fonts. A SIGPLAN-approved template can<br>\nbe found at the following link:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/\">http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/</a>. We recommend using this<br>\ntemplate.</p>\n<p>Both full and short papers must describe work not published in other<br>\nrefereed venues (see the SIGPLAN republication policy at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/republicationpolicy.htm\">http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/republicationpolicy.htm</a> for more<br>\ndetails). Accepted papers will appear in workshop proceedings, which<br>\nwill be distributed to the workshop participants and be available in<br>\nthe ACM Digital Library.</p>\n<p>Submissions will be accepted through EasyChair at the following URL:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=plas2015\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=plas2015</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Stephen Chong, Harvard University<br>\nMichael Clarkson (co-chair), Cornell University<br>\nChristian Hammer, CISPA, Saarland University<br>\nMatthew Hammer, University of Maryland, College Park<br>\nLimin Jia (co-chair), Carnegie Mellon University<br>\nStephen McCamant, University of Minnesota<br>\nMatteo Maffei, CISPA, Saarland University<br>\nJohn C.
