Regular papers should not exceed 15 pages, excluding<br>\n  bibliography.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tool papers that describe an operational tool and its<br>\n  contributions. Tool papers should not exceed 6 pages (including<br>\n  bibliography) and should include the URL of the tool.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted<br>\nconcurrently for publication elsewhere. Paper submission is done<br>\nvia EasyChair at <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sefm2020\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sefm2020</a><br>\nPapers must be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer<br>\nLNCS papers (see <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/lncs\">http://www.springer.com/lncs</a>).</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION</p>\n<p>All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the conference<br>\nthat will be published as a volume in the Formal Methods sublime of<br>\nthe Springer's LNCS series.</p>\n<p>The authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited<br>\nto submit extended versions of their papers to a journal special<br>\nissue.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM CO-CHAIRS</p>\n<p>Frank de Boer (CWI, The Netherlands)<br>\nAntonio Cerone (Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan)</p>\n<p>CONTACT: <a href=\"mailto:sefm2020@easychair.org\">sefm2020@easychair.org</a></p>",
