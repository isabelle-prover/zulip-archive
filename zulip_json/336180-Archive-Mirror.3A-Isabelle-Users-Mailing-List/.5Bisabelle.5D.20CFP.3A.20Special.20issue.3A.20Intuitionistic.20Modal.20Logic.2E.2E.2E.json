May, 2009</p>\n<p>Constructive modal logics and type theories are of increasing<br>\nfoundational and practical relevance in computer science. Applications<br>\nare in type disciplines for programming languages, and meta-logics for<br>\nreasoning about a variety of computational phenomena.<br>\nTheoretical and methodological issues center around the question of<br>\nhow the proof-theoretic strengths of constructive logics can best be<br>\ncombined with the model-theoretic strengths of modal logics. Practical<br>\nissues center around the question of which modal connectives with<br>\nassociated laws or proof rules capture computational phenomena<br>\naccurately and at the right level of abstraction and how to implement<br>\nthese efficiently.</p>\n<p>There have been a series of   LICS-affiliated workshops devoted to the<br>\ntheme. The first one was held as part of FLoC1999, Trento, Italy, the<br>\nsecond was part  of FLoC2002, Copenhagen, Denmark, the third was<br>\nassociated with LiCS2005, Chicago, USA and the last one was associated<br>\nwith LICS 2008 in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Two special issues of journals<br>\non the theme have already appeared,  a Mathematical Structures in<br>\nComputer Science volume edited by Matt Fairtlough, Michael Mendler and<br>\n  Eugenio Moggi ( Modalities in type theory) in 2001, and a special<br>\nissue of  the Journal of Logic and Computation  in 2004<br>\n(Intuitionistic Modal Logics and Application, eds. Valeria de Paiva,<br>\nR. Gore ad M. Mendler).</p>\n<p>We are hereby soliciting papers for a further special volume<br>\n  of Information and Computation, devoted to Intuitionistic Modal<br>\nLogics and Applications. We hope to cover the novel applications<br>\npresented in the last two workshops, especially applications to<br>\ncomputer security, automated deduction and  computational linguistics,<br>\nbut also to include work not presented at the workshops. The proposed<br>\ntimeline  of events is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Papers (preferably under 20 pages long) should be submitted by 31st<br>\nMay  2009</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviews will be provided until the end of August 2009 and the volume<br>\nshould be ready by the end of the Fall.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Topics  of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>applications of intuitionistic necessity and possibility</li>\n<li>monads and strong monads</li>\n<li>constructive belief logics and type theories</li>\n<li>\n<p>applications of constructive modal logic and modal type theory to<br>\nformal verification, foundations of security, abstract interpretation,<br>\nand program analysis and optimization</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>modal types for integration of inductive and co-inductive types,<br>\nhigher-order abstract syntax, strong functional programming</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>models of constructive modal logics such as algebraic, categorical,<br>\nKripke, topological, and realizability interpretations</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>notions of proof for constructive modal logics</p>\n</li>\n<li>extraction of constraints or programs from modal proofs</li>\n<li>proof search methods for constructive modal logics and their <br>\nimplementations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please contact one of the editors (Valeria de Paiva<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:valeria@cuill.com\">valeria@cuill.com</a> or  Brigitte Pientka <a href=\"mailto:bpientka@cs.mcgill.ca\">bpientka@cs.mcgill.ca</a>) if<br>\nyou're not sure that your paper is within the scope of this special<br>\nvolume. Submissions should be 10 to 20  pages  long and sent in<br>\nPostScript or PDF format to one of the editors, before the 31st<br>\nMay 2009.</p>",
