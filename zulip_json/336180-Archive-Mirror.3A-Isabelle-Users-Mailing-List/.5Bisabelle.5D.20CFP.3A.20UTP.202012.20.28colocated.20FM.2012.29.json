The theories define, in various different ways, many common<br>\nnotions, such as abstraction, refinement, choice, termination,<br>\nfeasibility,<br>\nconcurrency and communication. Despite these differences, such theories<br>\nmay be unified in a way which greatly facilitates their study and<br>\ncomparison. Moreover, such a unification offers a means of combining<br>\ndifferent languages describing various facets and artifacts of software<br>\ndevelopment in a seamless, logically consistent way. Hoare and He's<br>\nUnifying Theories of Programming (UTP) is widely acknowledged one<br>\nof the most significant such unification approaches to have emerged in<br>\nthe last 15 years.</p>\n<p>Based on their pioneering work, the aims of the UTP Symposium<br>\nseries are to continue reaffirming the significance of the ongoing UTP<br>\nproject and to stimulate efforts to advance it by providing a focus for<br>\nthe<br>\nsharing of results by those already actively contributing, and to raise<br>\nawareness of the benefits of such unifying theoretical frameworks among<br>\nthe wider computer science and software engineering communities.</p>\n<p>To this end the Symposium welcomes contributions on all the themes <br>\nthat can be related to the Unifying Theories of Programming.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>\nPapers may be up to 20 pages in length and should be prepared using<br>\nLaTeX in Springer LNCS paper format.
