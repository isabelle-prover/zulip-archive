Nevertheless, the area is of still growing importance as the<br>\nnumber of computers affecting everyday life and the complexity of these<br>\nsystems are both increasing. The purpose of the VERIFY workshop series<br>\nis to discuss problems arising during the formal modeling and<br>\nverification of information systems and to investigate suitable<br>\nsolutions. Possible perspectives include those of automated theorem<br>\nproving, tool support, system engineering, and applications.</p>\n<p>The VERIFY workshop series aims at bringing together people who are<br>\ninterested in the development of safety and security critical systems,<br>\nin formal methods, in the development of automated theorem proving<br>\ntechniques, and in the development of tool support. Practical<br>\nexperiences gained in realistic verifications are of interest to the<br>\nautomated theorem proving community and new theorem proving techniques<br>\nshould be transferred into practice. The overall objective of the VERIFY<br>\nworkshops is to identify open problems and to discuss possible solutions<br>\nunder the theme</p>\n<p>What are the verification problems? What are the deduction techniques?</p>\n<p>The scope of VERIFY includes topics such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ATP techniques in verification      + Information flow control</li>\n<li>Case studies (specif. &amp; verific.)       + Refinement &amp; Decomposition</li>\n<li>Combination of verification tools       + Mobile computing reliability</li>\n<li>Integration of ATPs and CASE-tools      + Reuse of specs &amp; proofs</li>\n<li>Compositional &amp; modular reasoning       + Management of change</li>\n<li>Experience reports with formal methods  + Safety-critical systems</li>\n<li>Gaps between problems and techniques    + Security models</li>\n<li>Formal methods for fault tolerance      + Tool support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions are encouraged in one of the following two categories:</p>\n<p>A.  Regular papers:<br>\nSubmissions in this category should describe previously unpublished work<br>\n(completed or in progress), including descriptions of research, tools,<br>\nand applications.  Papers must be formatted following the Springer LNCS<br>\nguidelines and be 6-15 pages long.</p>\n<p>B.  Discussion papers: Submissions in this category are intended to<br>\ninitiate discussions and should address controversial issues, and may<br>\ninclude provocative statements.  Papers must be formatted following the<br>\nSpringer LNCS guidelines and be 3-15 pages long.</p>\n<p>Submission of papers is via EasyChair at <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/VERIFY07\">http://www.easychair.org/VERIFY07</a></p>\n<p>The workshop proceedings will be distributed at the workshop as a<br>\ncollection of the accepted papers; they will also be made available as<br>\nCEUR Workshop Proceedings.</p>\n<p>A journal special issue on the topic of the VERIFY workshop is planned.<br>\nParticipants of VERIFY'07 are particularly encouraged to submit a paper<br>\nto the special issue, but other submissions will also be accepted.</p>\n<p>Program &amp; Workshop Chair<br>\n  B.
