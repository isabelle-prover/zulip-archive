The workshops on<br>\n(constraint) logic programming serve as the scientific forum of the<br>\nannual meeting of the Society of Logic Programming (GLP e.V.) and bring<br>\ntogether researchers interested in logic programming, constraint<br>\nprogramming, and related areas like databases, artificial intelligence,<br>\nand operations research.</p>\n<p>In this year both workshops will be jointly organized and co-located, in<br>\norder to promote the cross-fertilizing exchange of ideas and experiences<br>\namong researchers and students from the different communities interested<br>\nin the foundations, applications, and combinations of high-level,<br>\ndeclarative programming languages and related areas. The technical<br>\nprogram of the workshop will include invited talks, presentations of<br>\nrefereed papers and demo presentations.</p>\n<p>The joint workshop will consist of two tracks (WFLP and WLP). Sessions<br>\nof these two tracks will be interleaved.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<p>The topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<p>Functional programming<br>\n   Logic programming<br>\n   Constraint programming<br>\n   Deductive databases, data mining<br>\n   Extensions of declarative languages, objects<br>\n   Multi-paradigm declarative programming<br>\n   Foundations, semantics, nonmonotonic reasoning, dynamics<br>\n   Parallelism, concurrency<br>\n   Program analysis, abstract interpretation<br>\n   Program transformation, partial evaluation, meta-programming<br>\n   Specification, verification, declarative debugging<br>\n   Knowledge representation, machine learning<br>\n   Interaction of declarative programming with other formalisms (e.g.,<br>\nagents, XML, Java)<br>\n   Implementation of declarative languages<br>\n   Advanced programming environments and tools<br>\n   Software technique for declarative programming<br>\n   Applications</p>\n<p>The primary focus is on new and original research results but<br>\nsubmissions describing innovative products, prototypes under<br>\ndevelopment, application systems, or interesting experiments (e.g.,<br>\nbenchmarks) are also encouraged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Program Committee (WFLP track)</p>\n<p>Elvira Albert, Complutense University of Madrid, Spain<br>\n   Sergio Antoy, Portland State University<br>\n   Mauricio Ayala-Rincon, University of Brasilia, Brazil<br>\n   William Byrd, University of Utah<br>\n   Michael Hanus , Universität Kiel, Germany<br>\n   Herbert Kuchen, Universität Münster, Germany<br>\n   Carlos Olarte, DECC, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali, Colombia<br>\n   Janis Voigtländer, Universität Bonn, Germany<br>\n   Johannes Waldmann (chair), HTWK Leipzig, Germany<br>\n   Peter J.
