In<br>\ncontrast, application of formal methods to C and C++ code are<br>\nrelatively rare. Holes in the type system, the frequent use of<br>\ntype casts and sometimes direct hardware access in C/C++ code<br>\nmake the development of formal methods very challenging.</p>\n<p>The aim of the C/C++ verification workshop is to bring together<br>\npeople that are working on the verification or the semantics of C<br>\nor C++ programs. The workshop will provide a forum to discuss<br>\naspects of the type system and the semantics of C/C++, present<br>\napproaches for the verification of C or C++ programs, demonstrate<br>\ntools and report about (ongoing) verification projects.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<p>* formal semantics of parts or aspects of C/C++<br>\n    * formal approaches to compiler or platform specific properties of C/C++<br>\n    * formal approaches for safety-critical C/C++ code<br>\n    * semantical treatment and verification of embedded <br>\n                          assembly code for direct hardware access</p>\n<p>* verification of C/C++ code and verification results<br>\n    * tools for the semantic analysis of C/C++ code<br>\n    * tools for the verification of C/C++<br>\n    * case studies of C/C++ verification</p>\n<p>Interested speakers should submit an extended abstract (between 2<br>\nand 10 pages) to <a href=\"mailto:H.Tews@cs.ru.nl\">H.Tews@cs.ru.nl</a>. The abstracts will be subject to<br>\nlight reviewing by the organisation committee. Accepted<br>\nsubmissions are collected in a technical report of Radboud<br>\nUniversity Nijmegen. A CFP for post-workshop proceedings is<br>\nenvisaged.</p>\n<p>Important dates:<br>\n      29th April:   submission deadline<br>\n      8th  May  :   notification of accepted speakers<br>\n      14th May  :   early (reduced) IFM registration deadline<br>\n      1st June  :   final version of extended abstracts<br>\n      2nd July  :   workshop <br>\n          4-6th July:   IFM main conference</p>\n<p>For more information see <a href=\"http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~rhuuck/CV07/\">http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~rhuuck/CV07/</a></p>\n<p>The workshop is organised as a satellite event of the conference<br>\non Integrated Formal Methods 2007 (2nd-6th July Oxford UK)</p>\n<p>Organisation</p>\n<p>Hendrik Tews          Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen, The Netherlands<br>\nReiner Haehnle        Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden<br>\nWolfgang J.
