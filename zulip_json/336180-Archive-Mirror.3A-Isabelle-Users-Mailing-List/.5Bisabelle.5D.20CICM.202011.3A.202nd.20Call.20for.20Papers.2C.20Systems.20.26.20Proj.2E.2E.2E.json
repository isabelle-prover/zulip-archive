Its development is driven, on the one hand, by new <br>\ntechnological possibilities which computer science, the Internet, and <br>\nintelligent knowledge processing offer, and, on the other hand, by the <br>\nincreasing demand by engineers and scientists for new techniques to help <br>\nin producing, transmitting, consuming, and managing sophisticated <br>\nmathematical knowledge.</p>\n<p>Calculemus is a series of conferences dedicated to the integration of <br>\ncomputer algebra systems (CAS) and systems for mechanised reasoning, the <br>\ninteractive theorem provers or proof assistants (PA) and the automated <br>\ntheorem provers (ATP). Currently, symbolic computation is divided into <br>\nseveral (more or less) independent branches: traditional ones (e.g., <br>\ncomputer algebra and mechanised reasoning) as well as newly emerging ones <br>\n(on user interfaces, knowledge management, theory exploration, etc.) The <br>\nmain concern of the Calculemus community is to bring these developments <br>\ntogether in order to facilitate the theory, design, and implementation of <br>\nintegrated systems for computer mathematics that will routinely be used by <br>\nmathematicians, computer scientists and engineers in their every day <br>\nbusiness.</p>\n<p>Common to MKM and Calculemus is a need for these theories to be developed <br>\nin systems and projects, hence there will also be a \"Systems and Projects\" <br>\ntrack, designed to enable people to showcase their systems and projects.</p>\n<p>After successfully colocating as the Conference of Intelligent Computer <br>\nMathematics (CICM), MKM and Calculemus will formally join for CICM 2011. <br>\nCICM seeks original high-quality submissions in their tracks and the <br>\n\"Systems and Projects\" track. The topics of interest include but are not <br>\nlimited to:</p>\n<p><strong> MKM track </strong></p>\n<p>* Representations of mathematical knowledge</p>\n<p>* Repositories of formalized mathematics</p>\n<p>* Mathematical digital libraries</p>\n<p>* Diagrammatic representations</p>\n<p>* Multi-modal representations</p>\n<p>* Mathematical OCR</p>\n<p>* Mathematical search and retrieval</p>\n<p>* Deduction systems</p>\n<p>* Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems</p>\n<p>* Authoring languages and tools</p>\n<p>* MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards</p>\n<p>* Web presentation of mathematics</p>\n<p>* Data mining, discovery, theory exploration</p>\n<p>* Computer algebra systems</p>\n<p>* Collaboration tools for mathematics</p>\n<p>* Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows</p>\n<p><strong> Calculemus track </strong></p>\n<p>* Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)</p>\n<p>* Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)</p>\n<p>* Case studies and applications that both involve computer algebra and mechanised reasoning</p>\n<p>* Representation of mathematics in computer algebra</p>\n<p>* Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP</p>\n<p>* Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving</p>\n<p>* Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction</p>\n<p>* Mathematical computation in PA and ATP</p>\n<p>* Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for computer mathematics</p>\n<p>* Theory exploration techniques</p>\n<p>* Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint languages, and modeling languages for mechanised mathematics systems (PA, CAS, and ATP).</p>\n<p>* Infrastructure for mathematical services</p>\n<p>Papers on other topics closely related to the above research areas will <br>\nalso be welcomed for consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Submission <strong>*</strong></p>\n<p>CICM seeks both formal and work-in-progress submissions.</p>\n<p>Formal submissions must not exceed 15 pages and will be reviewed by blind <br>\npeer review and evaluated regarding to relevance, clarity, quality, <br>\noriginality, and impact. Shorter papers, e.g., for system descriptions, <br>\nare welcome. Authors will have an opportunity to respond to their papers' <br>\nreviews before the programme committee makes a decision.</p>\n<p>Selected formal submissions will be published as a volume in the series <br>\nLecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) by Springer-Verlag. In <br>\naddition to these formal proceedings, authors are permitted and encouraged <br>\nto publish the final versions of their papers on <a href=\"http://arXiv.org\">arXiv.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Work-in-progress submissions are intended to provide a forum for the <br>\npresentation of original work that is not (yet) in a suitable form for <br>\nsubmission as a full or system description paper. This includes work in <br>\nprogress and emerging trends. Their size is not limited, but we recommend <br>\n5 - 10 pages.</p>\n<p>The programme committee may offers authors of rejected formal submission <br>\nto publish as an work-in-progress submission instead. Depending on the <br>\nnumber of work-in-progress papers accepted, presentation may be as a short <br>\ntalk or as a poster. The work-in-progress proceedings will be published as <br>\na technical report.</p>\n<p>The Systems and Projects track requires an abstract, with appropriate <br>\nreferences and links to on-line materials/demonstrations, of at most two <br>\npages.</p>\n<p>All papers should be prepared in LaTeX and formatted according to the <br>\nrequirements of the Springer's LNCS series (the corresponding style files <br>\ncan be downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>). By <br>\nsubmitting a paper the authors agree that if it is accepted at least one <br>\nof the authors will attend the conference to present it.</p>\n<p>The web page for electronic submission is:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm11\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm11</a>  &lt;--- not 2011</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Important Dates <strong>*</strong></p>\n<p>For formal submissions:</p>\n<p>Abstract submission: March 03, 2011</p>\n<p>Submission deadline: March 11, 2011</p>\n<p>Reviews sent to authors: April 07, 2011</p>\n<p>Rebuttals due: April 14, 2011</p>\n<p>Notification of acceptance: April 21, 2011</p>\n<p>Camera ready copies due: May 09, 2011</p>\n<p>For work-in-progress submissions:</p>\n<p>Abstract submission: April 30, 2011</p>\n<p>Submission deadline: May 7, 2011</p>\n<p>Notification of acceptance: May 30, 2011</p>\n<p>Camera ready copies due: June 7, 2011</p>\n<p>CICM conference:</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Programme Committee Chairs <strong>*</strong></p>\n<p>General chair:</p>\n<p>James Davenport (University of Bath)</p>\n<p><strong> MKM track </strong></p>\n<p>Florian Rabe                 (Jacobs University, Germany) Chair<br>\nLaurent Bernardin            (Maplesoft)<br>\nThierry Bouche               (Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble) <br>\nSimon Colton                 (Imperial College)<br>\nPatrick Ion                  (American Mathematical Society)<br>\nJohan Jeuring                (University of Utrecht)<br>\nFairouz Kamareddine          (Heriot-Watt University)<br>\nManfred Kerber               (University of Birmingham)<br>\nAndrea Kohlhase              (DFKI Bremen)<br>\nPaul Libbrecht               (University of Saarbruecken)<br>\nBruce Miller                 (National Institute of Science and Technology)<br>\nAdam Naumowicz               (University of Bialystok)<br>\nClaudio Sacerdoti Coen       (University of Bologna)<br>\nPetr Sojka                   (Masaryk University)<br>\nVolker Sorge                 (University of Birmingham)<br>\nMasakazu Suzuki              (Kyushu University)<br>\nEnrico Tassi                 (INRIA)<br>\nMakarius Wenzel              (University of Paris-South)<br>\nFreek Wiedijk                (Radboud University Nijmegen)</p>\n<p><strong> Calculemus track </strong></p>\n<p>William Farmer               (McMaster University, Canada) Chair<br>\nThorsten Altenkirch          (Nottingham University)<br>\nSerge Autexier               (DFKI Bremen)<br>\nChristoph Benzmueller        (Articulate Software)<br>\nAnna Bigatti                 (University of Genoa)<br>\nHerman Geuvers               (Radboud University Nijmegen)<br>\nDeepak Kapur                 (University of New Mexico)<br>\nCezary Kaliszyk              (University of Tsukuba)<br>\nAssia Mahboubi               (Ecole Polytechnique)<br>\nFrancisco-Jesus Martin-Mateos(University of Seville)<br>\nRussell O'Connor             (INRIA and McMaster University)<br>\nGrant Passmore               (University of Cambridge and University of Edinburgh)<br>\nSilvio Ranise                (Fondazione Bruno Kessler)<br>\nAlan Sexton                  (University of Birmingham)<br>\nAdam Strzebonski             (Wolfram Research)</p>\n<p><strong> Systems and Projects Tract </strong></p>\n<p>Josef Urban                  (Radboud University Nijmegen) Chair<br>\nAndrea Asperti               (University of Bologna)<br>\nMichael Beeson               (San Jose State University)<br>\nJacques Carette              (McMaster University)<br>\nMichael Kohlhase             (Jacobs University)<br>\nChristoph Lange              (Jacobs University)<br>\nPiotr Rudnicki               (University of Alberta)<br>\nand members of the MKM and Calculemus programme committees</p>\n<p>More details are at <a href=\"http://cicm11.cs.unibo.it\">http://cicm11.cs.unibo.it</a></p>",
