Its development is driven, on the one hand, by<br>\nnew technological possibilities which computer science, the Internet,<br>\nand intelligent knowledge processing offer, and, on the other hand, by<br>\nthe increasing demand by engineers and scientists for new techniques<br>\nto help in producing, transmitting, consuming, and managing<br>\nsophisticated mathematical<br>\nknowledge.</p>\n<p>Calculemus is a series of conferences dedicated to the integration of<br>\ncomputer algebra systems (CAS) and systems for mechanised reasoning,<br>\nthe interactive theorem provers or proof assistants (PA) and the<br>\nautomated theorem provers (ATP). Currently, symbolic computation is<br>\ndivided into several (more or less) independent branches: traditional<br>\nones (e.g., computer algebra and mechanised reasoning) as well as<br>\nnewly emerging ones (on user interfaces, knowledge management, theory<br>\nexploration, etc.) The<br>\nmain concern of the Calculemus community is to bring these<br>\ndevelopments together in order to facilitate the theory, design, and<br>\nimplementation of integrated systems for computer mathematics that<br>\nwill routinely be used by mathematicians, computer scientists and<br>\nengineers in their every day business.</p>\n<p>Common to MKM and Calculemus is a need for their solutions to be<br>\nimplemented and applied. Hence there will also be a \"Systems and<br>\nProjects\" track. It aims to provide a broad overview of the developed<br>\nsystems, projects, ideas, and interests of the CICM community. The<br>\ntrack welcomes two-page abstracts about fresh systems and projects<br>\nrelated to mathematical knowledge management (MKM) and Calculemus<br>\ntopics, and about progress on existing systems and projects.</p>\n<p>After successfully colocating as the Conference of Intelligent<br>\nComputer Mathematics (CICM), MKM and Calculemus will formally join for<br>\nCICM 2011. CICM seeks original high-quality submissions in their<br>\ntracks and the \"Systems and Projects\" track. The topics of interest<br>\ninclude but are not limited to:</p>\n<p><strong> MKM track </strong></p>\n<p>* Representations of mathematical knowledge</p>\n<p>* Repositories of formalized mathematics</p>\n<p>* Mathematical digital libraries</p>\n<p>* Diagrammatic representations</p>\n<p>* Multi-modal representations</p>\n<p>* Mathematical OCR</p>\n<p>* Mathematical search and retrieval</p>\n<p>* Deduction systems</p>\n<p>* Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems</p>\n<p>* Authoring languages and tools</p>\n<p>* MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards</p>\n<p>* Web presentation of mathematics</p>\n<p>* Data mining, discovery, theory exploration</p>\n<p>* Computer algebra systems</p>\n<p>* Collaboration tools for mathematics</p>\n<p>* Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows</p>\n<p><strong> Calculemus track </strong></p>\n<p>* Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)</p>\n<p>* Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)</p>\n<p>* Case studies and applications that both involve computer algebra<br>\nand mechanised reasoning</p>\n<p>* Representation of mathematics in computer algebra</p>\n<p>* Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP</p>\n<p>* Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving</p>\n<p>* Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction</p>\n<p>* Mathematical computation in PA and ATP</p>\n<p>* Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems<br>\nfor computer mathematics</p>\n<p>* Theory exploration techniques</p>\n<p>* Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint<br>\nlanguages, and modeling languages for mechanised mathematics systems<br>\n(PA, CAS, and ATP).</p>\n<p>* Infrastructure for mathematical services</p>\n<p><strong> Systems and Projects track </strong></p>\n<p>* Systems addressing the MKM and Calculemus topics</p>\n<p>* Projects and long-term visions addressing the MKM and Calculemus topics</p>\n<p>Papers on other topics closely related to the above research areas<br>\nwill also be welcomed for consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Submission <strong>*</strong></p>\n<p>CICM seeks both formal and work-in-progress submissions.</p>\n<p>Formal submissions to tracks A or B must not exceed 15 pages and will<br>\nbe reviewed by blind peer review and evaluated with respect to<br>\nrelevance, clarity, quality, originality, and impact. Shorter papers,<br>\ne.g., for system descriptions, are welcome. Authors will have an<br>\nopportunity to respond to their papers' reviews before the programme<br>\ncommittee makes a decision.</p>\n<p>Submissions to the Systems &amp; Projects track must not exceed two pages.<br>\nThe accepted abstracts will be presented at CICM in a fast<br>\npresentation session, followed by an open demo/poster session. System<br>\npapers must be accompanied by a system demonstration, and project<br>\npapers must be accompanied by a poster presentation. The two pages of<br>\nthe abstract should be new material, accompanied by links to<br>\ndemos/downloads/project-pages and [existing] system descriptions.<br>\nAvailability of such accompanying<br>\nmaterial will be a strong prerequisite for acceptance.</p>\n<p>Selected formal submissions from all tracks will be published as a<br>\nvolume in the series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI)<br>\nby Springer-Verlag. In addition to these formal proceedings, authors<br>\nare permitted and encouraged to publish the final versions of their<br>\npapers on <a href=\"http://arXiv.org\">arXiv.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Work-in-progress submissions are intended to provide a forum for the<br>\npresentation of original work that is not (yet) in a suitable form for<br>\nsubmission as a full or system description paper. This includes work<br>\nin progress and emerging trends. Their size is not limited, but we<br>\nrecommend 5 - 10 pages.</p>\n<p>The programme committee may offer authors of rejected formal<br>\nsubmissions to publish their contributions as work-in-progress papers<br>\ninstead. Depending on the number of work-in-progress papers accepted,<br>\nthey will be presented at the conference either as short talks or as<br>\nposters. The work-in-progress proceedings will be published as a<br>\ntechnical report.</p>\n<p>All papers should be prepared in LaTeX and formatted according to the<br>\nrequirements of the Springer's LNCS series (the corresponding style<br>\nfiles can be downloaded from<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>). By submitting a paper<br>\nthe authors agree that if it is accepted at least one of the authors<br>\nwill attend the conference to present it.</p>\n<p>The web page for electronic submission is:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm11\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm11</a>  &lt;--- not 2011</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Important Dates <strong>*</strong></p>\n<p>For formal submissions:</p>\n<p>Abstract submission: March 03, 2011</p>\n<p>Submission deadline: March 11, 2011</p>\n<p>Reviews sent to authors: April 07, 2011</p>\n<p>Rebuttals due: April 14, 2011</p>\n<p>Notification of acceptance: April 21, 2011</p>\n<p>Camera ready copies due: May 09, 2011</p>\n<p>For work-in-progress submissions:</p>\n<p>Abstract submission: April 30, 2011</p>\n<p>Submission deadline: May 7, 2011</p>\n<p>Notification of acceptance: May 30, 2011</p>\n<p>Camera ready copies due: June 7, 2011</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Programme Committee <strong>*</strong></p>\n<p>General chair:</p>\n<p>James Davenport (University of Bath)</p>\n<p><strong> MKM track </strong></p>\n<p>Florian Rabe                 (Jacobs University, Bremen) Chair<br>\nLaurent Bernardin            (Maplesoft)<br>\nThierry Bouche               (Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble)<br>\nSimon Colton                 (Imperial College)<br>\nPatrick Ion                  (American Mathematical Society)<br>\nJohan Jeuring                (University of Utrecht)<br>\nFairouz Kamareddine          (Heriot-Watt University)<br>\nManfred Kerber               (University of Birmingham)<br>\nAndrea Kohlhase              (DFKI Bremen)<br>\nPaul Libbrecht               (University of Saarbruecken)<br>\nBruce Miller                 (National Institute of Science and Technology)<br>\nAdam Naumowicz               (University of Bialystok)<br>\nClaudio Sacerdoti Coen       (University of Bologna)<br>\nPetr Sojka                   (Masaryk University)<br>\nVolker Sorge                 (University of Birmingham)<br>\nMasakazu Suzuki              (Kyushu University)<br>\nEnrico Tassi                 (INRIA)<br>\nMakarius Wenzel              (University of Paris-South)<br>\nFreek Wiedijk                (Radboud University Nijmegen)</p>\n<p><strong> Calculemus track </strong></p>\n<p>William Farmer               (McMaster University, Canada) Chair<br>\nThorsten Altenkirch          (Nottingham University)<br>\nSerge Autexier               (DFKI Bremen)<br>\nChristoph Benzmueller        (Articulate Software)<br>\nAnna Bigatti                 (University of Genoa)<br>\nHerman Geuvers               (Radboud University Nijmegen)<br>\nDeepak Kapur                 (University of New Mexico)<br>\nCezary Kaliszyk              (University of Tsukuba)<br>\nAssia Mahboubi               (Ecole Polytechnique)<br>\nFrancisco-Jesus Martin-Mateos(University of Seville)<br>\nRussell O'Connor             (INRIA and McMaster University)<br>\nGrant Passmore               (University of Cambridge and University<br>\nof Edinburgh)<br>\nSilvio Ranise                (Fondazione Bruno Kessler)<br>\nAlan Sexton                  (University of Birmingham)<br>\nAdam Strzebonski             (Wolfram Research)</p>\n<p><strong> Systems and Projects Track </strong></p>\n<p>Josef Urban                  (Radboud University Nijmegen) Chair<br>\nAndrea Asperti               (University of Bologna)<br>\nMichael Beeson               (San Jose State University)<br>\nJacques Carette              (McMaster University)<br>\nMichael Kohlhase             (Jacobs University, Bremen)<br>\nChristoph Lange              (Jacobs University, Bremen)<br>\nPiotr Rudnicki               (University of Alberta)<br>\nand members of the MKM and Calculemus programme committees</p>\n<p>More details are at <a href=\"http://cicm11.cs.unibo.it\">http://cicm11.cs.unibo.it</a></p>",
