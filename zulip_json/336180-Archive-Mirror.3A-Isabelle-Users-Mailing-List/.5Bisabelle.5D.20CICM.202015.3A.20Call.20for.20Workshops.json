While<br>\ncomputer  algebra, automated  deduction,  mathematical publishing  and<br>\nnovel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,<br>\nwe are  now seeing  increasing opportunities  for synergy  among these<br>\nareas.  The Conference  on  Intelligent  Computer Mathematics  (CICM)<br>\noffer a venue for discussing these areas and their synergy.</p>\n<p>CICM has been held annually as  a joint meeting since 2008, colocating<br>\nrelated conferences and  workshops to advance work  in these subjects.<br>\nPrevious meetings have been held in Birmingham (U.K. 2008), Grand Bend<br>\n(Canada  2009), Paris  (France 2010),  Bertinoro (Italy  2011), Bremen<br>\n(Germany 2012), Bath (U.K. 2013) and Coimbra (Portugal, 2014).</p>\n<p>This is a  call for proposals for  workshops to be held  at CICM 2015,<br>\nwhich will be held in Washington D.C. (USA), July 13-17 next year.</p>\n<p>The principal tracks of the 2015 meeting will be</p>\n<p>Calculemus (Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning)<br>\n  DML (Towards a Digital Mathematics Library)<br>\n  MKM (Mathematical Knowledge Management)<br>\n  Systems and Data</p>\n<p>Some of the workshops that have been held at past CICM meetings are:</p>\n<p>Automated Reasoning: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice<br>\n  Compact Computer Algebra<br>\n  Empirically Successful Automated Reasoning for Mathematics<br>\n  Intelligent Proof Search<br>\n  Mathematical user Interfaces<br>\n  OpenMath<br>\n  Pen-Based Mathematical Computation<br>\n  Programming languages for Mechanized Mathematics Systems<br>\n  SCIEnce<br>\n  The Notion of Proof</p>\n<p>Proposals for workshops  to be held at CICM  2015 are solicited.
