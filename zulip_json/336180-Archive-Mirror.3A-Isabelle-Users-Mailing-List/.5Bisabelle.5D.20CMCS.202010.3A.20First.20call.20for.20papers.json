Over the<br>\nlast two decades, coalgebra has developed into a field of its own,<br>\npresenting a mathematical foundation for various kinds of dynamical<br>\nsystems, infinite data structures, and logics.  Coalgebra has an ever<br>\ngrowing range of applications in and interactions with other fields<br>\nsuch as reactive and interactive system theory, object oriented and<br>\nconcurrent programming, formal system specification, modal logic,<br>\ndynamical systems, control systems, category theory, algebra,<br>\nanalysis, etc.</p>\n<p>The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical<br>\n    approaches);</p>\n<p>* coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming<br>\n    languages, dynamical systems, etc.);</p>\n<p>* coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;<br>\n  * coalgebras and data types;<br>\n  * (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with<br>\n    bisimulations or invariants);</p>\n<p>* coalgebras and algebras;<br>\n  * coalgebraic specification and verification;<br>\n  * coalgebras and (modal) logic;<br>\n  * coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid<br>\n    systems).</p>\n<p>An anniversary: the 10th CMCS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>CMCS took place for the first time when ETAPS started, in 1998.  Since<br>\nthen, it has always been collocated with ETAPS, becoming bi-annual<br>\nsince the start of CALCO (Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra) in<br>\n2005.</p>\n<p>In 2010, we will celebrate the 10th edition of CMCS,<br>\nby inviting a number of specialists in the field to present overviews<br>\nof both obtained results and future challenges.</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>At this tenth meeting the following invited speakers will present<br>\noverviews of important subareas.</p>\n<p>* Venanzio Capretta: Coalgebra in functional programming and type theory<br>\n  * Bartek Klin: Operational semantics coalgebraically<br>\n  * Dirk Pattinson: Logic and coalgebra<br>\n  * Ana Sokolova: Probabilistic systems coalgebraically</p>\n<p>Submissions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There are two types of submissions possible:</p>\n<p>(a) Papers to be evaluated by the PC for publication in the proceedings:</p>\n<p>They must have a length no greater than 20 pages.  They must contain<br>\n original contributions, be clearly written, and include appropriate<br>\n reference to and comparison with related work.  Accepted papers will<br>\n appear in ENTCS (style files can be found in <a href=\"http://www.entcs.org/\">http://www.entcs.org/</a>).<br>\n The web-based system EasyChair will be used for submission<br>\n (<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmcs10\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmcs10</a>).</p>\n<p>After the event, a special journal issue of selected papers will be<br>\n considered.</p>\n<p>(b) Short contributions:</p>\n<p>These will not be published in the proceedings but will be bundled in<br>\n a CWI technical report.</p>\n<p>They should be no more than two pages and may describe work in<br>\n progress, summarise work submitted to a conference or workshop<br>\n elsewhere, or in some other way appeal to the CMCS audience.  For<br>\n short submissions, the style file easychair.cls should be used<br>\n (<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/coolnews.cgi\">http://www.easychair.org/coolnews.cgi</a>).
