Coalgebra has developed into a field of its own interest<br>\npresenting a deep mathematical foundation, a growing field of<br>\napplications, and interactions with various other fields such as<br>\nreactive and interactive system theory, object-oriented and concurrent<br>\nprogramming, formal system specification, modal and description<br>\nlogics, artificial intelligence, dynamical systems, control systems,<br>\ncategory theory, algebra, analysis, etc. The aim of the CMCS workshop<br>\nseries is to bring together researchers with a common interest in the<br>\ntheory of coalgebras, their logics, and their applications.</p>\n<p>The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical<br>\n     approaches);</p>\n<p>* coalgebras as computational and semantic models (for programming<br>\n     languages, dynamical systems, etc.);</p>\n<p>* coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;<br>\n   * coalgebras and data types;<br>\n   * (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with<br>\n     bisimulations or invariants);</p>\n<p>* coalgebras and algebras;<br>\n   * coalgebraic specification and verification;<br>\n   * coalgebras and (modal) logic;<br>\n   * coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid<br>\n     systems).</p>\n<p>Registration</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Registration is handled via the ETAPS website; please visit<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.etaps.org/2012/registration\">http://www.etaps.org/2012/registration</a></p>\n<p>Keynote Speaker</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Samson Abramsky, Oxford University, UK</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Marcello Bonsangue,  Leiden University, The Netherlands<br>\nPawel Sobocinski, University of Southampton, UK</p>\n<p>Submission of Short Contributions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission is electronic via the easychair system at</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmcs2012\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmcs2012</a></p>\n<p>following the submission guidelines below.
