The conference is<br>\nintended for computer scientists whose research activities involve<br>\nlogic,  as well as for logicians working on issues significant for<br>\ncomputer science.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include:<br>\nautomated deduction and interactive theorem proving,<br>\nconstructive mathematics and type theory,<br>\nequational logic and term rewriting,<br>\nautomata and games,<br>\nmodal and temporal logics,<br>\nmodel checking,<br>\nlogical aspects of computational complexity,<br>\nfinite model theory,<br>\ncomputational proof theory,<br>\nlogic programming and constraints,<br>\nlambda calculus and combinatory logic,<br>\ncategorical logic and topological semantics,<br>\ndomain theory,<br>\ndatabase theory,<br>\nspecification, extraction and transformation of programs,<br>\nlogical foundations of programming paradigms,<br>\nverification and program analysis,<br>\nlinear logic,<br>\nhigher-order logic,<br>\nnonmonotonic reasoning.</p>\n<p>Proceedings will be published in the LNCS series.<br>\nEach paper accepted by the Programme Committee must be presented at the<br>\nconference by one of the authors, and final copy be prepared according<br>\nto Springer's guidelines.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers must be in Springer's LNCS style and of no more than 15<br>\npages, presenting work not previously published.  They must not be<br>\nsubmitted concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings.<br>\nAny closely related work submitted by the authors to a conference or<br>\njournal before March 28, 2008 must be reported to the PC chairs. Papers<br>\nauthored or coauthored by members of the Programme Committee are not<br>\nallowed.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers must be in English and provide sufficient detail to<br>\nallow the Programme Committee to assess the merits of the paper.<br>\nFull proofs may appear in a technical appendix which will be read at the<br>\nreviewer's discretion. The title page must contain: title and author(s),<br>\nphysical and e-mail addresses, identification of the corresponding<br>\nauthor, an abstract of no more than, 200 words, and a list of keywords.</p>\n<p>ACKERMANN AWARD:<br>\nThe Ackermann Award is the EACSL Outstanding Dissertation Award for<br>\nLogic in Computer Science.<br>\nThe Ackermann Award 2008 will be presented to the recipients at CSL2008.<br>\nDeadline for nominations is March 15, 2008.<br>\nDetails at: <a href=\"http://www.dimi.uniud.it/~eacsl/submissionsAck.html\">http://www.dimi.uniud.it/~eacsl/submissionsAck.html</a><br>\nFor the three years 2007-2009, the Award is sponsored by Logitech, S.A.,<br>\nRomanel, Switzerland, the world's leading provider of personal peripherals.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS:<br>\nLuca Cardelli, Microsoft Research, Cambridge<br>\nPierre Louis Curien, PPS, Paris<br>\nJean-Pierre Jouannaud, Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau<br>\nWolfgang Thomas, RWTH, Aachen</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE:<br>\nMichael Kaminski (co-chair), Technion, Haifa<br>\nSimone Martini (co-chair), Università di Bologna<br>\nZena Ariola, University of Oregon, Eugene<br>\nPatrick Baillot, CNRS and Université Paris 13<br>\nPatrick Cegielski, Université Paris 12<br>\nGilles Dowek, École Polytechnique, Palaiseau<br>\nAmy Felty, University of Ottawa<br>\nMarcelo Fiore, University of Cambridge<br>\nAlan Jeffrey, Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent<br>\nLeonid Libkin, University of Edinburgh<br>\nZoran Majkic, University of Beograd<br>\nDale Miller, INRIA-Futurs, Palaiseau<br>\nLuke Ong, University of Oxford<br>\nDavid Pym, HP Labs, Bristol and University of Bath<br>\nAlexander Rabinovich, Tel Aviv University<br>\nAntonino Salibra, Università Ca' Foscari, Venezia<br>\nThomas Schwentick, Universität Dortmund<br>\nValentin Shehtman, Moscow University and King's College London<br>\nAlex Simpson, University of Edinburgh<br>\nGert Smolka, Universität des Saarlandes, Saarbrücken<br>\nKazushige Terui, National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo<br>\nThomas Wilke, Universität Kiel</p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION:<br>\nUgo Dal Lago, Università di Bologna<br>\nSimone Martini, Università di Bologna</p>\n<hr>",
