Moreover, the modeling community is continuously pushing<br>\nforward the OCL. Now, OCL is used in quite different applications<br>\ndomains (e.g., domain-specific languages, web semantics) and for<br>\nvarious purposes (e.g., model verification and validation, code<br>\ngeneration, test-driven development, transformations). This workshop<br>\nwill focus on the challenges of using OCL on these new domains and how<br>\nthe language needs to evolve to be successfully applied on them.</p>\n<p>In particular, we are interested in discussing alternative<br>\nnotations/representations for OCL that simplify its application, new<br>\ntextual/graphical languages that can complement/replace OCL, new ways<br>\nof writing OCL expressions (e.g., patterns, templates and libraries),<br>\nsharing OCL expressions and OCL know-how, new domain-dependent<br>\nevaluation and optimization strategies, mappings from OCL to other<br>\nlanguages and formalisms (Java, SQL, Alloy, Maude, constraint<br>\nprogramming, ...) and, of course, the tools that will make all of this<br>\npossible. In addition, all other aspects that may facilitate a wider<br>\nadoption and support of OCL or its usability are also welcome.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New and/or succesful applications of the OCL</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mappings between OCL and other languages/formalisms (e.g., Java,<br>\n  SQL, Alloy, Maude, constraint programming)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New algorithms, evaluation strategies and optimizations for OCL for<br>\n      o validation, verification, and testing,<br>\n      o model transformation and code generation,<br>\n      o metamodeling/DSLs,<br>\n      o query and constraint specifications</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternative graphical/textual notations for OCL</p>\n</li>\n<li>Evolution, transformation and simplification of OCL expressions</li>\n<li>Libraries, templates and patterns for OCL</li>\n<li>Complexity results for the OCL language</li>\n<li>\n<p>Quality models and benchmarks for comparing and evaluating OCL tools<br>\n  and algorithms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies on industrial applications of OCL</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experience reports:<br>\n      o usage of OCL and OCL tools in complex domains,<br>\n      o usability of the OCL and of the OCL tools for end-users</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Empirical studies about the benefits and drawbacks of OCL</p>\n</li>\n<li>Innovative OCL tools</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The workshop will include short (about 15 min) presentations, parallel<br>\nsessions of working groups, and sum-up discussions.</p>\n<p>Short papers (up to 5 pages) and full papers (up to 15 pages) can be<br>\nsubmitted to the workshop. All papers must follow LNCS style<br>\nguidelines and be uploaded to the Submission system (EasyChair):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ocl09\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ocl09</a></p>\n<p>The program committee will review the submissions (minimum 2 reviews<br>\nper paper) and select papers according to their relevance and interest<br>\nfor discussions that will take place at the workshop. Accepted papers<br>\nwill be published at <a href=\"http://www.metamodel.com/\">http://www.metamodel.com/</a> and the OCL Portal.<br>\nAs in previous editions, it is planned that polished versions of<br>\naccepted papers will be published in cooperation with an international<br>\npublisher, e.g., the Electronic Communications of the EASST.</p>\n<p><em>Important dates</em></p>\n<p>Paper submission: July 19, 2009<br>\nAuthor notification: August 28, 2009<br>\nCamera-ready papers: September 20, 2009</p>\n<p><em>Workshop Organisers</em></p>\n<p>Jordi Cabot, Open University of Catalonia, Spain (primary contact)<br>\nJoanna Chimiak-Opoka, University of Innsbruck, Austria<br>\nFrédéric Jouault, INRIA, France<br>\nMartin Gogolla, University of Bremen, Germany<br>\nAlexander Knapp, University of Augsburg, Germany</p>\n<p><em>Programme Committee</em></p>\n<p>Thomas Baar, Tech@Spree, Germany<br>\nAchim Brucker, SAP, Germany<br>\nManuel Clavel, IMDEA Software Institute, Spain<br>\nDan Chiorean, University of Cluj, Romania<br>\nTony Clark, Thames Valley University, UK<br>\nBirgit Demuth, Technical University of Dresden, Germany<br>\nRemco Dijkman, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands<br>\nRobert France, University of Fort Collins, USA<br>\nHeinrich Hussmann, University of Munich, Germany<br>\nTihamer Levendovszky, Vanderbilt University, USA<br>\nRichard Mitchell, Inferdata, UK<br>\nRichard Paige, University of York, UK<br>\nMark Richters, Astrium Space Transportation, Germany<br>\nShane Sendall, IBM, Switzerland<br>\nPieter Van Gorp, University of Eindhoven<br>\nBurkhart Wolff, LRI, University Paris-Sud, France<br>\nSteffen Zschaler, Lancaster University, UK</p>\n<hr>",
