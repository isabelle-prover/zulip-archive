The following seven conferences will <br>\nparticipate in FLoC:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>International Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV).<br>\n     Workshop Chair:  Tomas Vojnar &lt;<a href=\"mailto:vojnar@fit.vutbr.cz\">vojnar@fit.vutbr.cz</a>&gt; . </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP).<br>\n     Workshop Chair: Michael Norrish &lt;<a href=\"mailto:Michael.Norrish@nicta.com.au\">Michael.Norrish@nicta.com.au</a>&gt; .</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP).<br>\n     Workshop Chair: Veronica Dahl &lt;<a href=\"mailto:veronica@cs.sfu.ca\">veronica@cs.sfu.ca</a>&gt; .</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR).<br>\n     Workshop Chair:  Aaron Stump &lt;<a href=\"mailto:astump@cs.uiowa.edu\">astump@cs.uiowa.edu</a>&gt; .</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS).<br>\n     Workshop Co-Chairs: Adriana Compagnoni &lt;<a href=\"mailto:abc@cs.stevens.edu\">abc@cs.stevens.edu</a>&gt;  and<br>\n                                    Maribel Fernandez &lt;<a href=\"mailto:Maribel.Fernandez@kcl.ac.uk\">Maribel.Fernandez@kcl.ac.uk</a>&gt; .                 </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA).<br>\n     Workshop Chair: Christopher A.

Each workshop will<br>\n  have its own registration, with uniform FLoC workshop<br>\n  fees.  It is not necessary to register for FLoC in<br>\n  order to attend workshops. Meeting rooms and accommodations will be<br>\n  reserved by the university in the center of Edinburgh.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-FLoC workshops:  Friday &amp; Saturday, July 9-10</li>\n<li>Mid-FLoC workshops:  Wednesday &amp; Thursday, July 14-15</li>\n<li>Post-FLoC workshops:  Tuesday &amp; Wednesday, July 20, 21 .</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for<br>\n  workshops on topics relating logic, broadly understood, applied to<br>\n  computer science. Each workshop proposal must indicate one sponsoring<br>\n  conference among the participating conferences.  (It is suggested<br>\n  that prospective workshop organizers contact the relevant conference <br>\n  Workshop Chair before submitting a proposal.) Workshops will have to be<br>\n  financially self-supporting, unless the sponsoring conference<br>\n  accepts financial responsibility. The FLoC Organizing Committee will <br>\n  determine the final list of accepted workshops based on the recommendations <br>\n  from the Workshop Chairs of the sponsoring conferences and subject to <br>\n  the availability of space and facilities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proposals should consist of two parts. First, a short scientific<br>\n  justification of the proposed topic, its significance, and the<br>\n  particular benefits of the workshop to the community, as well as a list of<br>\n  previous or related workshops (if relevant). A second, organizational  part<br>\n  should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>contact information of the workshop organizers. </li>\n<li>proposed sponsoring conference. </li>\n<li>estimate of the audience size.</li>\n<li>proposed format and agenda  (for example, demo sessions, tutorials, etc.)</li>\n<li>potential invited speakers.</li>\n<li>procedures for selecting papers and participants.</li>\n<li>plans for dissemination, if any (for example, special issues of journals) .</li>\n<li>\n<p>duration (which may vary from one day to two days) and<br>\n  preferred period. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>special technical or AV needs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Workshops are strongly encouraged to find external financial support.<br>\n  This will be wholly their responsibility.  Modest funding, based upon <br>\n  numbers of registrants, minus FLoC local expenses, will be made available<br>\n  to each workshop.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proposals are due by July 31, 2009.  Organizers will be notified by<br>\n  September 15, 2009. Proposals should be submitted electronically<br>\n  to EasyChair at the following address (which opens June 18, 2009):    </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc10cfw\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc10cfw</a></p>\n<p>(Clearly indicate at the top of the proposal the relevant conference)</p>\n<p>For further enquiries or information, please contact:</p>\n<p>Philip Scott (FLoC Workshop Chair)<br>\n Department of Mathematics and Statistics<br>\n University of Ottawa<br>\n Ottawa, Ont.
