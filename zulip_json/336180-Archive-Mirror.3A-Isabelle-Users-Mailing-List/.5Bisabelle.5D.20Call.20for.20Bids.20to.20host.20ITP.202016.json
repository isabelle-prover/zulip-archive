Shortly after, all admitted<br>\nbids will be made public and the voting phase will take place. The people<br>\neligible to vote are those who are seriously thinking of attending ITP 2016.<br>\nThe voting system used will be Single Transferable Vote between all received<br>\nbids.</p>\n<p>Xingyuan Zhang<br>\nChristian Urban</p>",
