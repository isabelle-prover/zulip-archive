But planning ahead never hurts, so we<br>\nare already looking forward to 2021.</p>\n<p>As in previous years, the procedure consists of two phases:<br>\nsolicitation of bids and voting. This message concerns the first<br>\nphase. A long-standing ITP/TPHOLs convention is that the conference<br>\nshould by preference be held on a continent different from the<br>\nlocation of the previous meeting. For 2021, we therefore particularly<br>\nsolicit bids from prospective hosts located outside Europe. However,<br>\nbids from within Europe are also welcome. Similar to previous years,<br>\nwe expect bids to propose a date in July, August or September.</p>\n<p>Bids should be sent to <a href=\"mailto:itp19@cecs.pdx.edu\">itp19@cecs.pdx.edu</a> and should include at least<br>\nthe following information:</p>\n<p>* name and email address of a contact person<br>\n  * names of other people involved<br>\n  * address of website for the bid<br>\n  * approximate dates of the conference<br>\n  * structure (e.g., k workshop days and n days of presentations,<br>\n    excursion, etc.)</p>\n<p>* advantages of the proposed venue </p>\n<p>Some examples of previous winning bids follow:</p>\n<p>* ITP 2016 in Nancy, France  <a href=\"https://members.loria.fr/JCBlanchette/itp2016/bid.html\">https://members.loria.fr/JCBlanchette/itp2016/bid.html</a><br>\n  * ITP 2017 in Brasilia, Brazil  <a href=\"https://cic.unb.br/~nalon/itp2017/\">https://cic.unb.br/~nalon/itp2017/</a><br>\n  * ITP 2019 in Portland, USA  <a href=\"http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/itp2019bid/\">http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/itp2019bid/</a></p>\n<p>The deadline for bids is Friday, May 31. Shortly after, all admitted<br>\nbids will be made public and the voting phase will take place. The<br>\npeople eligible to vote are those who are seriously considering<br>\nattending ITP 2021. The voting system used will be single transferable<br>\nvote between all received bids.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact this year's<br>\norganizers at <a href=\"mailto:itp19@cecs.pdx.edu\">itp19@cecs.pdx.edu</a>.</p>\n<p>Andrew Tolmach, Portland State University<br>\nJohn Harrison, Amazon AWS<br>\nJohn O'Leary, Intel Corporation</p>",
