It is a<br>\nvenue for researchers working on new approaches to cope with partial<br>\nrecursive or corecursive functions in interactive theorem provers.<br>\nSee  &lt;<a href=\"http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ek/PAR-10/\">http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ek/PAR-10/</a>&gt; for further details.</p>\n<p>The programme of the workshop will comprise of two invited talks, and<br>\nseveral regular paper presentations. Additionally, we wish to provide<br>\nan opportunity for informal discussion of ongoing research on partial<br>\nrecursion and co-recursion in interactive theorem provers.</p>\n<p>If you wish to contribute an informal presentation, please upload a<br>\ntitle and an abstract by <em>28 April</em> 2010 to EasyChair via<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=par10\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=par10</a>&gt; .
