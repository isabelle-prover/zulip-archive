Recent years have seen an<br>\nincreasing industrial and academic interest in the use of static and<br>\ndynamic analysis techniques together. Success has been reported<br>\ncombining different test techniques such as model-based testing,<br>\nstructural testing, or concolic testing with static techniques such as<br>\nprogram slicing, dependencies analysis, model-checking, abstract<br>\ninterpretation, predicate abstraction, or verification. This special<br>\nissue serves as a platform for researchers and practitioners to<br>\npresent theory, results, experience and advances in Tests and Proofs<br>\n(TAP).</p>\n<p>Topics<br>\n======<br>\nThis special issue focuses on all topics relevant to TAP. In<br>\nparticular, the topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* Program proving with the aid of testing techniques<br>\n    * New challenges in automated reasoning emerging from<br>\n      specificities of test generation</p>\n<p>* Verification and testing techniques combining proofs and tests<br>\n    * Generation of test data, oracles, or preambles by deductive<br>\n      techniques such as: theorem proving, model checking, symbolic<br>\n      execution, constraint logic programming, SAT and SMT solving</p>\n<p>* Model-based testing and verification<br>\n    * Automatic bug finding<br>\n    * Debugging of programs combining static and dynamic analysis<br>\n    * Transfer of concepts from testing to proving (e.g., coverage<br>\n      criteria) and from proving to testing</p>\n<p>* Formal frameworks for test and proof<br>\n    * Tool descriptions, experience reports and evaluation of test and<br>\n      proof</p>\n<p>* Case studies combining tests and proofs<br>\n    * Applying combination of test and proof techniques to new<br>\n      application domains such as validating security procotols or<br>\n      vulnerability detection of programs</p>\n<p>* The processes, techniques, and tools that support test and proof</p>\n<p>Submission Information<br>\n======================<br>\nThe deadline for submissions is 17th December, 2012. Notification of<br>\ndecisions will be given by April 15th, 2013.</p>\n<p>All submissions must contain original unpublished work not being<br>\nconsidered for publication elsewhere. Original extensions to<br>\nconference papers - identifing clearly additional contributions - are<br>\nalso encouraged unless prohibited by copyright. Submissions will be<br>\nrefereed according to standard procedures for Software Testing,<br>\nVerification and Reliability.
