Such additional themes include, but are<br>\nnot limited to,<br>\nrelational semantics, relational algebra, healthiness conditions, normal<br>\nforms,<br>\nlinkage of theories, algebraic descriptions, incorporation of probabilistic<br>\nprogramming,<br>\ntimed calculi and object-based descriptions, as well as alternative<br>\nprogramming paradigms<br>\nsuch as functional, logical, data-flow, and beyond. In all cases, the UTP<br>\napproach should<br>\nbe compared and advantages/disadvantages discussed.</p>\n<p>Accepted papers will be published in the symposium proceedings by Springer<br>\nas a volume of<br>\nthe Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences. It is also planned to have a special<br>\njournal issue<br>\nof Formal Aspects of Computing for revised/extended versions of selected<br>\nbest papers from<br>\nthe UTP 2010 symposium.</p>\n<p>Papers should be written in English not exceeding 20 pages in LNCS format<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>).
