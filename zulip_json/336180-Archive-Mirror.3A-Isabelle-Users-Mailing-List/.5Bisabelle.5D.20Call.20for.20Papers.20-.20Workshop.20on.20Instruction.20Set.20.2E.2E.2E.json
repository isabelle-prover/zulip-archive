If there is a more appropriate way to post a CFP to the Isabelle community please let me know. If a list admin wants to reject this message, I understand, but if not please consider the following conference workshop opportunity.</p>\n<p>The inaugural Workshop on Instruction Set Architecture Specification<br>\n(SpISA2019) will take place on September 13th, 2019 in Portland, Oregon,<br>\nUSA. SpISA2019 will be collocated with the Tenth International<br>\nConference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP2019).</p>\n<p>Paper Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>SpISA2019 is devoted to the specification of instruction set<br>\narchitectures in a formal setting, and to the formal proofs of code<br>\ncorrectness and other properties with respect to such specifications. We<br>\nwelcome contributions from academia and industry. Topics of interest<br>\ninclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Specifications of traditional machine architectures (ARM, MIPS,<br>\n  PowerPC, RISC-V, x86, ...)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specifications of virtual machines (JVM, LLVM, Webasm, ...)</p>\n</li>\n<li>Domain-specific languages for specifying ISAs</li>\n<li>ISA semantics in interactive theorem provers</li>\n<li>Proof methodologies (symbolic simulation, interactive proof, ...)</li>\n<li>Formal applications of instruction set simulators</li>\n<li>Compiler correctness with respect to formal ISA specifications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions will undergo single-blind peer review. They should be no<br>\nmore than 4 pages in length including bibliographic references and are<br>\nto be submitted in PDF format via EasyChair via the following link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spisa19\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spisa19</a></p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Paper submission: June 30, 2019<br>\nAuthor notification: July 25, 2019<br>\nWorkshop: September 13, 2019</p>\n<p>Contact</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Matthew Fernandez &lt;<a href=\"mailto:matthew.fernandez@intel.com\">matthew.fernandez@intel.com</a>&gt;<br>\nJohn Harrison &lt;<a href=\"mailto:jrh013@gmail.com\">jrh013@gmail.com</a>&gt;</p>",
