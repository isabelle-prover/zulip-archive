Its development is driven, on the one hand, by new technological possibilities which computer science, the Internet, and intelligent knowledge processing offer, and, on the other hand, by the increasing demand by engineers and scientists for new techniques to help in producing, transmitting, consuming, and managing sophisticated mathematical knowledge.</p>\n<p>Calculemus is a series of conferences dedicated to the integration of computer algebra systems (CAS) and systems for mechanised reasoning, the interactive theorem provers or proof assistants (PA) and the automated theorem provers (ATP). Currently, symbolic computation is divided into several (more or less) independent branches: traditional ones (e.g., computer algebra and mechanised reasoning) as well as newly emerging ones (on user interfaces, knowledge management, theory exploration, etc.) The main concern of the Calculemus community is to bring these developments together in order to facilitate the theory, design, and implementation of integrated systems for computer mathematics that will routinely be used by mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers in their every day business.</p>\n<p>After successfully colocating as the Conference of Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM), MKM and Calculemus will formally join for CICM 2011. CICM seeks original high-quality submissions in two tracks. The topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>\n<p><strong> MKM track </strong></p>\n<p>* Representations of mathematical knowledge</p>\n<p>* Repositories of formalized mathematics</p>\n<p>* Mathematical digital libraries</p>\n<p>* Diagrammatic representations</p>\n<p>* Multi-modal representations</p>\n<p>* Mathematical OCR</p>\n<p>* Mathematical search and retrieval</p>\n<p>* Deduction systems</p>\n<p>* Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems</p>\n<p>* Authoring languages and tools</p>\n<p>* MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards</p>\n<p>* Web presentation of mathematics</p>\n<p>* Data mining, discovery, theory exploration</p>\n<p>* Computer algebra systems</p>\n<p>* Collaboration tools for mathematics</p>\n<p>* Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows</p>\n<p><strong> Calculemus track </strong></p>\n<p>* Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)</p>\n<p>* Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)</p>\n<p>* Case studies and applications that both involve computer algebra and mechanised reasoning</p>\n<p>* Representation of mathematics in computer algebra</p>\n<p>* Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP</p>\n<p>* Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving</p>\n<p>* Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction</p>\n<p>* Mathematical computation in PA and ATP</p>\n<p>* Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for computer mathematics</p>\n<p>* Theory exploration techniques</p>\n<p>* Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint languages, and modeling languages for mechanised mathematics systems (PA, CAS, and ATP).</p>\n<p>* Infrastructure for mathematical services</p>\n<p>Papers on other topics closely related to the above research areas will also be welcomed for consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Submission <strong>*</strong></p>\n<p>CICM seeks both formal and work-in-progress submissions.</p>\n<p>Formal submissions must not exceed 15 pages and will be reviewed by blind peer review and evaluated regarding to relevance, clarity, quality, originality, and impact. Shorter papers, e.g., for system descriptions, are welcome. Authors will have an opportunity to respond to their papers' reviews before the programme committee makes a decision.</p>\n<p>Selected formal submissions will be published as a volume in the series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) by Springer-Verlag. In addition to these formal proceedings, authors are permitted and encouraged to publish the final versions of their papers on <a href=\"http://arXiv.org\">arXiv.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Work-in-progress submissions are intended to provide a forum for the presentation of original work that is not (yet) in a suitable form for submission as a full or system description paper. This includes work in progress and emerging trends. Their size is not limited, but we recommend 5 - 10 pages.</p>\n<p>The programme committee may offers authors of rejected formal submission to publish as an work-in-progress submission instead. Depending on the number of work-in-progress papers accepted, presentation may be as a short talk or as a poster. The work-in-progress proceedings will be published as a technical report.</p>\n<p>All papers should be prepared in LaTeX and formatted according to the requirements of the Springer's LNCS series (the corresponding style files can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>). By submitting a paper the authors agree that if it is accepted at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it.</p>\n<p>The web page for electronic submission is:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2011\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2011</a></p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Important Dates <strong>*</strong></p>\n<p>For formal submissions:</p>\n<p>Abstract submission: 03/March/2011</p>\n<p>Submission deadline: 11/March/2011</p>\n<p>Reviews sent to authors: 07/April/2011</p>\n<p>Rebuttals due: 14/April/2011</p>\n<p>Notification of acceptance: 21/April/2011</p>\n<p>Camera ready copies due: 09/May/2011</p>\n<p>For work-in-progress submissions:</p>\n<p>Abstract submission: April 30, 2011</p>\n<p>Submission deadline: May 7, 2011</p>\n<p>Notification of acceptance: May 30, 2011</p>\n<p>Camera ready copies due: June 7, 2011</p>\n<p>CICM conference:</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Programme Committee Chairs <strong>*</strong></p>\n<p>General chair:</p>\n<p>James Davenport (University of Bath)</p>\n<p><strong> MKM track </strong></p>\n<p>Florian Rabe                 (Jacobs University, Germany) Chair<br>\nLaurent Bernardin            (Maplesoft)<br>\nThierry Bouche               (Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble)<br>\nSimon Colton                 (Imperial College)<br>\nPatrick Ion                  (American Mathematical Society)<br>\nJohan Jeuring                (University of Utrecht)<br>\nFairouz Kamareddine          (Heriot-Watt University)<br>\nManfred Kerber               (University of Birmingham)<br>\nAndrea Kohlhase              (DFKI Bremen)<br>\nPaul Libbrecht               (University of Saarbruecken)<br>\nBruce Miller                 (National Institute of Science and Technology)<br>\nAdam Naumowicz               (University of Bialystok)<br>\nClaudio Sacerdoti Coen       (University of Bologna)<br>\nPetr Sojka                   (Masaryk University)<br>\nVolker Sorge                 (University of Birmingham)<br>\nMasakazu Suzuki              (Kyushu University)<br>\nEnrico Tassi                 (INRIA)<br>\nMakarius Wenzel              (University of Paris-South)<br>\nFreek Wiedijk                (Radboud University Nijmegen)</p>\n<p><strong> Calculemus track </strong></p>\n<p>William Farmer               (McMaster University, Canada) Chair<br>\nThorsten Altenkirch          (Nottingham University)<br>\nSerge Autexier               (DFKI Bremen)<br>\nChristoph Benzmueller        (Articulate Software)<br>\nAnna Bigatti                 (University of Genoa)<br>\nHerman Geuvers               (Radboud University Nijmegen)<br>\nDeepak Kapur                 (University of New Mexico)<br>\nCezary Kaliszyk              (University of Tsukuba)<br>\nAssia Mahboubi               (Ecole Polytechnique)<br>\nFrancisco-Jesus Martin-Mateos(University of Seville)<br>\nRussell O'Connor             (INRIA and McMaster University)<br>\nGrant Passmore               (University of Cambridge and University of Edinburgh)<br>\nSilvio Ranise                (Fondazione Bruno Kessler)<br>\nAlan Sexton                  (University of Birmingham)<br>\nAdam Strzebonski             (Wolfram Research)</p>\n<p>More details are at <a href=\"http://cicm11.cs.unibo.it/cicm11/index.html\">http://cicm11.cs.unibo.it/cicm11/index.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>projects-mkm-ig mailing list<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:projects-mkm-ig@lists.jacobs-university.de\">projects-mkm-ig@lists.jacobs-university.de</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://lists.jacobs-university.de/mailman/listinfo/projects-mkm-ig\">http://lists.jacobs-university.de/mailman/listinfo/projects-mkm-ig</a></p>",
