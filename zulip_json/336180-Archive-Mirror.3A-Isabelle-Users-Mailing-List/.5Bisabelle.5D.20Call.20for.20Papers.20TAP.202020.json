Formal techniques for counter-example generation<br>\nbased on, for example, symbolic execution, SAT/SMT-solving or<br>\nmodel checking, furnish evidence for the potential of a combination of<br>\ntest and proof. The combination of predicate abstraction with testing-like<br>\ntechniques based on exhaustive enumeration opens the perspective<br>\nfor novel techniques of proving correctness. On the practical side,<br>\ntesting offers cost-effective debugging techniques of specifications<br>\nor crucial parts of program proofs (such as invariants).  Last but not<br>\nleast, testing is indispensable when it comes to the validation of the<br>\nunderlying assumptions of complex system models involving<br>\nhardware and/or system environments. Over the years, there is<br>\ngrowing acceptance in research communities that testing and proving<br>\nare complementary rather than mutually exclusive techniques.</p>\n<p>The TAP conference aims to promote research in the intersection of<br>\ntesting and proving by bringing together researchers and practitioners<br>\nfrom both areas of verification.</p>\n<p>Topics of Interest</p>\n<hr>\n<p>TAP's scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology,<br>\nincluding foundational work, tool development, and empirical<br>\nresearch. Its topics of interest center around the connection between<br>\nproofs (and other static techniques) and testing (and other dynamic<br>\ntechniques). Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the<br>\nfollowing topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verification and analysis techniques combining proofs and tests</li>\n<li>Program proving with the aid of testing techniques</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deductive techniques supporting the automated generation of test vectors<br>\n   and oracles (theorem proving, model checking, symbolic execution, SAT/SMT<br>\n   solving, constraint logic programming, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deductive techniques supporting novel definitions of coverage criteria,</p>\n</li>\n<li>Program analysis techniques combining static and dynamic analysis</li>\n<li>Specification inference by deductive and dynamic methods</li>\n<li>Testing and runtime analysis of formal specifications</li>\n<li>Search-based technics for proving and testing</li>\n<li>Verification of verification tools and environments</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of test and proof techniques in new domains,<br>\n   such as security, configuration management, learning</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combined approaches of test and proof in the context of formal<br>\n   certifications (Common Criteria, CENELEC, …)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies, tool and framework descriptions, and experience<br>\n   reports about combining tests and proofs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission Instructions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>TAP 2020 accepts papers of four kinds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Regular research papers: full submissions describing original<br>\nresearch, of up to 16 pages (excluding references).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tool demonstration papers: submissions describing the design and<br>\nimplementation of an analysis/verification tool or framework, of up<br>\nto 8 pages (excluding references). The tool/framework described in<br>\na tool demonstration paper should be available for public use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short papers: submissions describing preliminary findings, proofs<br>\nof concepts, and exploratory studies, of up to 6 pages (excluding<br>\nreferences).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Journal-first extended abstracts, of up to 4 pages, summarizing recently<br>\npublished articles in high-quality journals. The aim of journal-first papers<br>\nis to further enrich the program of TAP, as well as to provide an more <br>\nflexible<br>\npath to dissemination of results in the field. The summarized journal <br>\narticle<br>\nshould have been published (or accepted) by 1 July 2018 or later, and report<br>\nnew results (as opposed as simply extending prior conference work with<br>\n'appendix' material, or minor enhancements). Journal-first submissions <br>\nmust be<br>\nmarked as such in the submission’s title, and must explicitly include full<br>\nbibliographic details (including a DOI) of the journal publication they are<br>\nbased on.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accepted submissions will be published in Springer's LNCS series. Papers <br>\nhave to<br>\nadhere to Springer's LNCS format and must be submitted in PDF format at the<br>\nEasyChair submission site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tap2020\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tap2020</a></p>\n<p>Committees</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Information about all committees can be found under<br>\n<a href=\"https://tap.sosy-lab.org/2020\">https://tap.sosy-lab.org/2020</a></p>\n<p>Program Chairs :</p>\n<p>Wolfgang Ahrendt (Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden)<br>\nHeike Wehrheim (Paderborn University, Germany)</p>\n<p>Contact</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:tap2020@easychair.org\">tap2020@easychair.org</a></p>",
