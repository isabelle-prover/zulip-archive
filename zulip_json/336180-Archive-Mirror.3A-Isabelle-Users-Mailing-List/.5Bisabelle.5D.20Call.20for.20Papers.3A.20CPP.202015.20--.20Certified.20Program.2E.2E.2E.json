Certification here means formal, mechanized verification of some<br>\nsort, preferably with production of independently checkable<br>\ncertificates.</p>\n<p>CPP 2015 is the fourth in the CPP conference series and will be co-located<br>\nwith POPL 2015 in Mumbai from 12 - 14 January 2015.</p>\n<p>Important dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Abstract submission:     3 October 2014, anywhere on Earth (11:59 pm,<br>\nUTC-12)<br>\nFull paper submission:    10 October 2014, anywhere on Earth (11:59 pm,<br>\nUTC-12)<br>\nNotification:         29 November 2014<br>\nCamera-ready deadline:    15 December 2014<br>\nConference dates:    12 - 14 January 2015</p>\n<p>Scope</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Suggested, but not exclusive, specific topics of interest for<br>\nsubmissions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>certified or certifying programming, compilation, linking, OS<br>\n  kernels, runtime systems, and security monitors;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>program logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>certified decision procedures, mathematical libraries, and<br>\n  mathematical theorems;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>proof assistants and proof theory;</p>\n</li>\n<li>new languages and tools for certified programming;</li>\n<li>program analysis, program verification, and proof-carrying code;</li>\n<li>certified secure protocols and transactions;</li>\n<li>\n<p>certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra,<br>\n  polynomial systems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of<br>\n  interest;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality,<br>\n  first-order logic, and higher-order unification;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>certificates for program termination;</p>\n</li>\n<li>logics for certifying concurrent and distributed programs;</li>\n<li>\n<p>higher-order logics, logical systems, separation logics, and logics<br>\n  for security;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>teaching mathematics and computer science with proof assistants.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission instructions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages in the ACM SIGPLAN<br>\nProceedings format. Shorter papers are welcome and will be given equal<br>\nconsideration. The proceedings of the conference will be published<br>\nby the ACM. Templates for ACM SIGPLAN format can be found on the<br>\nACM SIGPLAN website:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author\">http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author</a>.</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted in PDF format, through the EasyChair<br>\nsubmission page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2015\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2015</a></p>\n<p>Each submission must be written in English and provide sufficient<br>\ndetail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the<br>\npaper. It should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a<br>\nsummary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their<br>\nsignificance and relevance to the conference, all phrased for the<br>\nnon-specialist. Technical and formal developments directed to the<br>\nspecialist should follow. Whenever appropriate, the submission should<br>\ncome along with a formal development, using whatever prover, e.g.,<br>\nAgda, Coq, Elf, HOL, HOL-Light, Isabelle, Matita, Mizar, NQTHM, PVS,<br>\nVampire, etc. References and comparisons with related work should be<br>\nincluded. Papers not conforming to the above requirements concerning<br>\nformat and length may be rejected without further consideration.</p>\n<p>The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>\nelsewhere, including the proceedings of other published conferences or<br>\nworkshops. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work<br>\nsubmitted to a conference or journal in advance of<br>\nsubmission. Original formal proofs of known results in mathematics or<br>\ncomputer science are among the targets. One author of each accepted<br>\npaper is expected to present it at the conference.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Andreas Abel, Chalmers and Gothenburg University, Sweden<br>\nJune Andronick, NICTA and UNSW, Sydney, Australia<br>\nNick Benton, Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK<br>\nLennart Beringer, Princeton University, USA<br>\nJames Brotherston.
