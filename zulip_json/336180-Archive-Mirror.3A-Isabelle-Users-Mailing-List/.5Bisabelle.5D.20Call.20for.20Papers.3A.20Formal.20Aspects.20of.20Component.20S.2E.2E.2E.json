However, many<br>\n    issues in component-based software development remain open and<br>\n    pose challenging research questions.</p>\n<p>Formal methods consist of mathematically-based<br>\n    techniques for the specification, development and verification of<br>\n    software and hardware systems. They have shown their great utility<br>\n    for setting up the formal foundations of component software and  <br>\nworking<br>\n    out challenging issues such as mathematical models for components,<br>\n    their composition and adaptation, or rigorous approaches to<br>\n    verification, deployment, testing and certification.</p>\n<p>The objective of FACS'09 is to bring together researchers in the<br>\n    areas of component software and formal methods to promote a deep<br>\n    understanding of this paradigm and its applications. The workshop<br>\n    will also be interested in defining the common aspects of<br>\n    components and component-based development. It is expected that<br>\n    formal paper presentations will be followed by lively<br>\n    discussions. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>- formal models for software components and component interaction<br>\n    - design and verification methods for component software<br>\n    - component composition and deployment: models, calculi, languages<br>\n    - component testing, re-engineering and reuse<br>\n    - specification of extra-functional properties in component<br>\n      software</p>\n<p>- certification of components and software architectures<br>\n    - component software vs. object orientation, multi-agent systems,<br>\n      and aspect oriented development</p>\n<p>- components for real-time, safety-critical, secure and/or embedded<br>\n      systems</p>\n<p>- standard models for software components (e.g. Fractal, GCM, etc.)<br>\n    - industrial or experience reports, and case studies in<br>\n      component software</p>\n<p>- partial behavior models for software components<br>\n    - update and reconfiguration of component architectures<br>\n    - component systems evolution and maintenance<br>\n    - formal methods and modeling languages for components<br>\n    - trust models for components<br>\n    - autonomic components and self-managed applications<br>\n    - formal / rigorous approaches to software adaptation and<br>\n      self-adaptive systems</p>\n<p>- formal aspects of Web services and business processes<br>\n    - component-based Web services and service-oriented<br>\n      architectures</p>\n<p>- QoS issues in web services, multi-agent systems and<br>\n      component-based systems</p>\n<p>FACS'09 is the 6th event in a series of workshops, founded by<br>\n    the International Institute for Software Technology of the United<br>\n    Nations University (UNU-IIST). The first FACS workshop was<br>\n    co-located with FM'03 (Pisa, Italy, September 2003). The<br>\n    following FACS workshops were organised as standalone events,<br>\n    respectively at UNU-IIST in Macau (October 2005), at Charles<br>\n    University in Prague (September 2006), at INRIA in<br>\n    Sophia-Antipolis (September 2007), and at University of Málaga in<br>\n    Spain (September 2008). FACS'09 is planned to be co-located with<br>\n    a number of events together under the heading of Formal Methods Week<br>\n    (Eindhoven, the Netherlands, October 2009).</p>\n<p>Submission &amp; proceedings:</p>\n<p>Submissions to the workshop must present original research<br>\n    that is unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>\n    elsewhere. Papers will be judged on the basis of originality,<br>\n    relevance, technical soundness and presentation quality.  Papers<br>\n    must be written in English and not exceed 15 pages in the ENTCS<br>\n    format. Note that to encourage submission of work still in<br>\n    progress, we may also accept promising papers to be presented at<br>\n    the workshop. The presenters of these papers will be entitled to<br>\n    submit a revised version for full review for inclusion in the formal<br>\n    (post-)proceedings to be published in ENTCS. Extended versions of  <br>\nall<br>\n    accepted papers will be eligible for selection for a journal special<br>\n    issue.  The final version of the papers must be prepared in LaTeX,<br>\n    adhering to the ENTCS format (see <a href=\"http://www.entcs.org/final.html\">http://www.entcs.org/final.html</a>).</p>\n<p>Papers/abstracts can be submitted via the following link:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=facs09\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=facs09</a></p>\n<p>A special issue consisting of extended versions of selected papers  <br>\nfrom<br>\n    FACS 2009 will be published in Science of Computer Programming.  <br>\nSelected<br>\n    participants will be invited to submit an extended version of  <br>\ntheir papers<br>\n    after the workshop. These extended versions will be reviewed by the<br>\n    international program committee of FACS'09, which will decide on  <br>\ntheir<br>\n    suitability for final publication in the special issue.</p>\n<p>Important dates:</p>\n<p>Abstract submission: June 12, 2009<br>\n    Paper submission: June 19, 2009<br>\n    Acceptance notification: July 31, 2009<br>\n    Camera ready: August 28, 2009<br>\n    Workshop: November 2-3, 2009</p>\n<p>Keynote speakers:</p>\n<p>Jan Rutten (CWI, The Netherlands)<br>\n    Gert Doehmen (AIRBUS Deutschland GmbH, Germany)</p>\n<p>Program chairs: Bernhard Schätz and Sun Meng</p>\n<p>Program committee:</p>\n<p>Farhad Arbab (CWI, The Netherlands)<br>\n    Luis Barbosa (Universidade do Minho, Portugal)<br>\n    Frank S. de Boer (CWI, The Netherlands)<br>\n    Christiano Braga (Univesidade Federal Fliminense, Brazil)<br>\n    Carlos Canal (Universidad de Malaga, Spain)                     <br>\n    Paolo Ciancarini (Universita di Bologna, Italy)<br>\n    Rolf Hennicker (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany)<br>\n    Atsushi Igarashi (Kyoto University, Japan)<br>\n    Einar Broch Johnsen (Universitetet i Oslo, Norway)<br>\n    Ying Liu (IBM China Research, China)<br>\n    Markus Lumpe (Swinburne University of Technology, Australia)<br>\n    Eric Madelaine (INRIA, Centre Sophia Antipolis, France)<br>\n    Sun Meng (CWI, The Netherlands)<br>\n    Corina Pasareanu (NASA Ames, USA)<br>\n    Frantisek Plasil (Charles University, Czech Republic)<br>\n    Anders Ravn (Aalborg University, Denmark)<br>\n    Ralf Reussner (Universitaet Karlsruhe, Germany)<br>\n    Bernhard Schaetz (Technical University of Munich, Germany)<br>\n    Heinrich Schmidt (RMIT University, Australia)<br>\n    Marjan Sirjani (Reykjavik University, Iceland, University of  <br>\nTehran, Iran)<br>\n    Volker Stolz (UNU-IIST, MACAU)<br>\n    Carolyn Talcott (SRI International, USA)<br>\n    Dang Van Hung (Vietnam National University, Vietnam)<br>\n    Naijun Zhan (IOS, China)</p>\n<p>Steering Committee:</p>\n<p>Zhiming Liu (IIST UNU, Macau, China, coordinator)<br>\n    Farhad Arbab (CWI, The Netherlands)<br>\n    Luis Barbosa (Universidade do Minho, Portugal)<br>\n    Carlos Canal (University of Málaga, Spain)<br>\n    Markus Lumpe (Swinburne University of Technology, Australia)<br>\n    Eric Madelaine (INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France)<br>\n    Vladimir Mencl (Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic, and  <br>\nUniversity of Canterbury, New Zealand)<br>\n    Corina Pasareanu (NASA Ames Research Center, USA)<br>\n    Sun Meng (CWI, the Netherlands)<br>\n    Bernhard Schaetz (Technical University of Munich, Germany)</p>\n<p>Co-location:</p>\n<p>FACS'09 is part of  the first Formal Methods Week (FMweek), which  <br>\nwill bring together<br>\n    a choice of events in the area, including TESTCOM/FATES  <br>\n(Conference on Testing of<br>\n    Communicating Systems and Workshop on Formal Approaches to Testing  <br>\nof Software),<br>\n    FMICS (Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems), PDMC  <br>\n(Parallel and Distributed<br>\n    Methods of verifiCation), FM2009 (Symposium of Formal Methods  <br>\nEurope), CPA (Communicating<br>\n    Process Architectures), FAST (Formal Aspects in Security and  <br>\nTrust), FMCO (Formal Methods<br>\n    for Components and Objects), and the REFINE Workshop.
