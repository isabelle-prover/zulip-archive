For example, future autonomous cars are <br>\nready to hit the public roads in a few years. Due to a direct impact on <br>\nhuman lives, their functional safety, security, and dependability are <br>\nimportant for both the general public and Original Equipment <br>\nManufacturers (OEMs). Formal Methods techniques have the potential to <br>\naddress some of the most important verification and dependability <br>\nchallenges associated with such autonomous systems. Indeed,  industrial <br>\nstandards, such as ISO 26262, ISO 61508, IEC 62304, EN 50128  explicitly <br>\nrecommend the use of formal methods in the design and development of <br>\nautonomous systems. The main purpose of this workshop is to bring <br>\ntogether people from both industry and academia and serve as a forum to <br>\ndiscuss practical applications of formal methods. Moreover, we believe <br>\nthis workshop will help to discuss the readiness of formal methods in <br>\nindustrial applications by discussing the needs of autonomous systems <br>\nindustry and challenges faced by formal methods researchers.</p>\n<p>The focus of the workshop will be on formal verification techniques for <br>\nthe modeling, analysis, and verification of safety and security critical <br>\nautonomous systems. We encourage submissions on interdisciplinary <br>\napproaches that bring together various formal methods and techniques <br>\nsuch as model checking, runtime verification, and theorem proving.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Topics of Interest</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Formal modeling, requirement specification &amp; validation for autonomous <br>\nsystems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal verification of AI and ML algorithm for autonomous systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>Runtime verification of safety and security properties</li>\n<li>Combination of formal, semi-formal and informal approaches</li>\n<li>Formalization of probability, reliability and statistical metrics</li>\n<li>Formal Verification of security &amp; privacy aspects of autonomous systems</li>\n<li>Hybrid systems</li>\n<li>Reliability, maintainability, and security issues in autonomous systems</li>\n<li>Formal modeling of ethical issues in autonomous systems</li>\n<li>Benchmarks for autonomous Cyber-physical systems</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal verification &amp; international standards(e.g., ISO26262, <br>\nIEC61508, DO178)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal verification for safety and security assurance cases</p>\n</li>\n<li>Formal verification and safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Application domains include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autonomous aerospace and avionics systems</li>\n<li>Autonomous/semi-autonomous automotive systems</li>\n<li>Autonomous robotics</li>\n<li>Human factors in autonomous systems</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission Details</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There are three categories of submissions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Regular papers (including case studies) describing developed work with<br>\n   theoretical or experimental results (up to 12 pages)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short papers on experience reports, tools or work in progress with<br>\n   preliminary results (up to 6 pages)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New idea papers with innovative and thought-provoking research<br>\n   plans (up to 4 pages)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accepted papers will be published by Springer in Lecture Notes in Computer<br>\nScience volume and will be provided as a complementary book to the <br>\nSafeComp 2019<br>\nproceedings.
