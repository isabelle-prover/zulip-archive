Despite a period of low popularity a<br>\ndecade ago, there is a new realisation, in academia and industry, of<br>\nthe usefulness of microkernels. The MIKES workshop will bring together<br>\nresearchers and developers from industry and academia to discuss</p>\n<p>* emerging novel concepts,<br>\n    * analysis approaches, and<br>\n    * case studies</p>\n<p>in the area of microkernels.</p>\n<p>MIKES 2006 seeks papers that describe original research in the area of<br>\nmicrokernels. This includes but is not limited to:</p>\n<p>* case studies<br>\n    * real-time behaviour<br>\n    * temporal analysis<br>\n    * functional verification<br>\n    * portability<br>\n    * API proposals<br>\n    * security and safety</p>\n<p>Papers describing new ideas, promising approaches, experiences with<br>\npractical systems are considered particularly appropriate. Submissions<br>\nshould be 6 pages in IEEE conference paper format.</p>\n<p>See the workshop website for submission details:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ertos.nicta.com.au/events/07/0116-mikes.pml\">http://www.ertos.nicta.com.au/events/07/0116-mikes.pml</a></p>\n<p>The material must be unpublished and not under submission<br>\nelsewhere.
