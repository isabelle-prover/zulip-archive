However, many techniques are working under restrictive<br>\nassumptions that are invalidated by complex embedded systems software<br>\nsuch as operating system kernels, low-level device drivers, or<br>\nmicrocontroller code.</p>\n<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and developers<br>\nfrom both academia and industry who are facing real software and real<br>\nproblems with the goal of finding real, applicable solutions. By “real”<br>\nwe mean problems such as time-to-market or reliability that the industry<br>\nis facing. A real solution is one that is applicable to the problem in<br>\nindustry and not one that only applies to an abstract, academic, toy<br>\nversion of it. In this workshop we will discuss software analysis and<br>\ndevelopment techniques and tools; this forum will serve as a platform to<br>\ndiscuss open problems and future challenges in dealing with existing and<br>\nupcoming systems-level code.</p>\n<p>Topics include, but are not restricted to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Model checking</li>\n<li>Automated and interactive theorem proving</li>\n<li>Static analysis</li>\n<li>Automated testing</li>\n<li>Model-driven development</li>\n<li>Embedded systems development</li>\n<li>Programming languages</li>\n<li>Verifying compilers</li>\n<li>Software certification</li>\n<li>Software tools</li>\n<li>Experience reports</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions<br>\n===========<br>\nSubmissions must be made electronically through the EasyChair system<br>\n[https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssv2014] until April 1st,<br>\n2014. Papers should be up to 10 pages in pdf format and formatted in<br>\nEPTCS style [http://info.eptcs.org/]. Additional details may be included<br>\nin a clearly marked appendix, which will be read at the discretion of<br>\nthe program committee. All will be subject to peer review under normal<br>\nconference standards. Experience reports and papers on work in progress<br>\nare welcome as long as there is a clear contribution. Submissions which<br>\nare based or discuss a non-trivial piece of software are required to<br>\nmake all those non-standard software parts available, which a referee<br>\nmay need, in order to check the claims of the submission.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers must not have previously appeared in a journal or<br>\nconference with published proceedings and must not be concurrently<br>\nsubmitted to any other peer-reviewed workshop, symposium, conference or<br>\narchival journal. Any partial overlap with any such published or<br>\nconcurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated.</p>\n<p>PC Chairs<br>\n=========<br>\nKim G. Larsen, AAU, Aalborg, Denmark<br>\nMads Chr.
