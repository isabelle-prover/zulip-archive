In many  cases,  interfaces remain  relatively basic  and<br>\nunder-designed.</p>\n<p>The User  Interfaces for  Theorem Provers  workshop series  provides a<br>\nforum for  researchers interested in improving  human interaction with<br>\nproof  systems. We  welcome participation  and contributions  from the<br>\ntheorem proving, formal  methods and tools, and  HCI communities, both<br>\nto  report on  experience with  existing systems,  and to  discuss new<br>\ndirections. Topics covered include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Application-specific  interaction mechanisms  or designs  for prover<br>\n  interfaces Experiments and evaluation of prover interfaces</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Languages and tools for authoring, exchanging and presenting proof</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implementation  techniques (e.g.  web  services, custom  middleware,<br>\n  DSLs)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integration of interfaces and tools to explore and construct proof</p>\n</li>\n<li>Representation and manipulation of mathematical knowledge or objects</li>\n<li>Visualisation of mathematical objects and proof</li>\n<li>System descriptions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>UITP 2016 is a one-day workshop to be held on Saturday, July 2nd, 2016<br>\nin Coimbra, Portugal, as a IJCAR 2016 workshop.</p>\n<p><strong> Submissions </strong></p>\n<p>Submitted   papers  should   describe   previously  unpublished   work<br>\n(completed or  in progress), and  be at least 4  pages and at  most 12<br>\npages.
