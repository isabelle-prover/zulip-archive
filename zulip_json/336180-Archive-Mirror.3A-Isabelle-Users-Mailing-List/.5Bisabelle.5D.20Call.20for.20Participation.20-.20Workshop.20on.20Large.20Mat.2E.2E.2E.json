I am<br>\ninvited speaker both on LML and the MKM conference track, see the papers:</p>\n<p>* LML: \"Isabelle technology for the Archive of Formal Proofs\"<br>\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07244\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07244</a></p>\n<p>* MKM: \"Interaction with Formal Mathematical Documents in Isabelle/PIDE\"<br>\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01735\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01735</a></p>\n<p>Maybe I will see some of you there.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Call for Participation<br>\n        Workshop on Large Mathematics Libraries (LML 2019)</p>\n<p>12th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics</p>\n<p>- CICM 2019 -<br>\n                           July 8-12, 2019<br>\n                    CIIRC, Prague, Czech Republic<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cicm-conference.org/2019\">http://www.cicm-conference.org/2019</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Large formal and semiformal mathematics libraries are needed to<br>\nsupport mathematics research, mathematics education, rigorous software<br>\ndevelopment, and formal proof development.  This workshop will explore<br>\nmethods for designing, constructing, and maintaining large mathematics<br>\nlibraries as well as for finding, comparing, and applying the<br>\nknowledge residing in these libraries.</p>\n<p>Key topics of interest will include:</p>\n<p>o Methods for sharing knowledge between libraries.</p>\n<p>o Modular techniques for organizing the knowledge within libraries.</p>\n<p>o The translation of libraries to different languages and logics.</p>\n<p>o The construction of new libraries by integrating existing<br>\n     libraries.</p>\n<p>o Tools for exploring the contents of large libraries.</p>\n<p>o Observations about past results.</p>\n<p>The workshop will consist of two invited presentations and several<br>\ncontributed presentations and system demonstrations.  We welcome<br>\npresentation and demonstration proposals in the form of extended 1-4<br>\npage abstracts formatted in LaTeX.  Abstracts should be sent via email<br>\nto <a href=\"mailto:wmfarmer@mcmaster.ca\">wmfarmer@mcmaster.ca</a> and <a href=\"mailto:dennis.mueller@fau.de\">dennis.mueller@fau.de</a>.  Abstracts of<br>\nselected presentations and demonstrations will be published online.</p>\n<p>More details about LML 2019 are available at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cicm-conference.org/2019/cicm.php?event=lml&amp;menu=general\">https://www.cicm-conference.org/2019/cicm.php?event=lml&amp;menu=general</a></p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>o Abstract submission: June 24, 2019</p>\n<p>o Notification:        July 01, 2019</p>\n<p>o Workshop:            July 10, 2019</p>\n<p>Registration</p>\n<p>Registration to CICM 2019 and the workshops is open at the CICM<br>\nwebsite or directly at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cicm-conference.org/2019/cicm.php?event=&amp;menu=registration\">https://www.cicm-conference.org/2019/cicm.php?event=&amp;menu=registration</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/GN2C7c4qYcqUYmVO1d7XuQat/Attached-Message-Part\">Attached Message Part</a></p>",
