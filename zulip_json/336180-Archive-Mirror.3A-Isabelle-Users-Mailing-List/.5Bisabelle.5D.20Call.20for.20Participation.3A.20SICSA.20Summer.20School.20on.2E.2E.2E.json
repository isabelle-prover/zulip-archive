The school consists of eight introductory <br>\nlectures, each concentrating on an unique aspect of one or both of the overall <br>\nthemes. The topics of the lectures include inductive theorem proving; SAT and SMT<br>\nsolving; proof planning and rippling; rely/guarantee conditions; separation <br>\nlogic; operating system verification;  process algebras and formal analysis of security.</p>\n<p>The school is intended for PhD students and researchers working within one or both of <br>\nthese themes, however familiarity with any of the techniques is not a prerequisite. <br>\nAll lectures are meant to be introductory. </p>\n<p>PRESENTERS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The following will present at the summer school:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Atkey (University of Strathclyde) &amp; Ewen Maclean (Heriot-Watt University) </li>\n<li>Alan Bundy &amp; Lucas Dixon (University of Edinburgh)</li>\n<li>Jane Hillston (University of Edinburgh)</li>\n<li>Cliff Jones (University of Newcastle)</li>\n<li>Gerwin Klein (National ICT Australia)</li>\n<li>J Strother Moore (University of Texas at Austin)</li>\n<li>Natarajan Shankar (SRI)</li>\n<li>Graham Steel (INRIA)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>REGISTRATION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Registration is available from: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/vstte10_reg/Registration.php\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/vstte10_reg/Registration.php</a></p>\n<p>The registration fee is £110, which also covers materials and lunches.<br>\nAccommodation at the Heriot-Watt campus (£42.50 per night incl. VAT and<br>\nbreakfast) can be including with your booking when you register.<br>\nThis is highly recommended since the summer school will coincide with several of the famous <br>\nEdinburgh festivals -- where hotel prices in town tend to be very inflated. </p>\n<p>SICSA will cover registration and two nights campus accommodation for SICSA students (students<br>\nfrom most Scottish Universities -- see <a href=\"http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/\">http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/</a> to check if you are eligible).<br>\nThe number of SICSA students is limited, and a decision on ranking if this number is exceeded<br>\nwill only be taken if necessary.</p>\n<p>PRELIMINARY PROGRAM</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The summer school has the following preliminary program (timing and titles may still change):</p>\n<p>Saturday:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>09:00: Registration</li>\n<li>09:30: J Moore -- Machines Reasoning about Machines - 39 Years and Counting</li>\n<li>11:00: Coffee break</li>\n<li>11:30: Gerwin Klein -- Specification and Refinement in Operating System Verification</li>\n<li>13:00: Lunch</li>\n<li>14:00: Bob Atkey/Ewen Maclean -- Amortised Resource Analysis and Functional Correctness with Separation Logic</li>\n<li>15:30: Coffee break</li>\n<li>16:00: Alan Bundy/Lucas Dixon -- Proof-planning, inductive reasoning, and beyond</li>\n<li>17:30: End</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sunday:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>09:30: Natarajan Shankar -- Verification using SAT and SMT solvers</li>\n<li>11:00: Coffee break</li>\n<li>11:30: Graham Steel -- Formal Analysis of Key Management APIs</li>\n<li>13:00: Lunch</li>\n<li>14:00: Cliff Jones -- Tackling concurrency by reasoning explicitly about inference</li>\n<li>15:30: Coffee break</li>\n<li>16:00: Jane Hillston -- From Milner to Markov and Back: Stochastic process algebras and their equivalence relations</li>\n<li>17:30: End</li>\n</ul>\n<p>VENUE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The summer school is a satellite event of VSSTE 2010 (see <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/vstte10/\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/vstte10/</a>) and <br>\nwill be held the two days before the main event: Saturday 14th and Sunday 15th August 2010. <br>\nLike VSTTE 2010, it will be held at the Edinburgh campus of Heriot-Watt University.</p>\n<p>ORGANISERS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The summer school is jointly organised by The School of Informatics at Edinburgh University and<br>\nThe School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt University by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lucas Dixon (Edinburgh)</li>\n<li>Gudmund Grov (Edinburgh)</li>\n<li>Ewen Maclean (Heriot-Watt)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CONTACT</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The organisers can be contacted at the following email address: <a href=\"mailto:ssfrr-2010@inf.ed.ac.uk\">ssfrr-2010@inf.ed.ac.uk</a>.</p>",
