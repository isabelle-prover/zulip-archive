Separate  communities  have  developed  to<br>\ninvestigate  and build  computer based  systems for  computer algebra,<br>\nautomated deduction, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user<br>\ninterfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their<br>\nintegration  can   lead  to   synergies  offering   significant  added<br>\nvalue.  The  Conference  on Intelligent  Computer  Mathematics  (CICM)<br>\noffers a  venue for discussing  and developing solutions to  the great<br>\nchallenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.</p>\n<p>CICM has been held annually as a joint meeting since 2008, co-locating<br>\nrelated   conferences  and   workshops  to   advance  work   in  these<br>\nsubjects. Previous  meetings have been  held in Birmingham  (UK 2008),<br>\nGrand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France 2010), Bertinoro (Italy 2011),<br>\nBremen (Germany  2012), Bath (UK  2013), Coimbra (Portugal  2014),<br>\nWashington DC (USA 2015) and Bialystok (Poland 2016).</p>\n<p>This  is a  call for  papers  for CICM  2017,  which will  be held  in<br>\nEdinburgh, Scotland, July 17-21, 2017. CICM 2017 also invites work-in-<br>\nprogress papers.</p>\n<p>The principal tracks of the conference are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Track: Calculemus (chair: Matthew England)</li>\n<li>Track: Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML) (chair: Olaf Teschke)</li>\n<li>Track: Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM) (chair: Florian Rabe)</li>\n<li>Track: Systems &amp; Data (chair: Osman Hasan)</li>\n<li>Track: Doctoral Programme (chair: Adnan Rashid)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The overall programme is organized by the General Program Chair Herman<br>\nGeuvers.  The  local  arrangements  are  coordinated  by  Jacques<br>\nFleuriot.  The publicity chair is Serge Autexier.</p>\n<p>CICM is  also an excellent  opportunity for graduate students  to meet<br>\nestablished researchers from the  areas of computer algebra, automated<br>\ndeduction, and mathematical publishing.</p>\n<p>The Doctoral Programme provides a  dedicated forum for PhD students to<br>\npresent  and discuss  their ideas,  ongoing or  planned research,  and<br>\nachieved  results   in  an  open   atmosphere.  It  will   consist  of<br>\npresentations  by  the  PhD  students to  get  constructive  feedback,<br>\nadvice, and suggestions from the research advisory board, researchers,<br>\nand  other PhD  students.  Each PhD  student will  be  assigned to  an<br>\nexperienced researcher from  the research advisory board  who will act<br>\nas a mentor and who will provide detailed feedback and advice on their<br>\nintended and ongoing research.</p>\n<p>Submission to the doctoral programs are possible until 5. June, details<br>\nof the submission process are given below.</p>\n<p><em>Important Dates</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission deadline (Abstract + CV):          5.
