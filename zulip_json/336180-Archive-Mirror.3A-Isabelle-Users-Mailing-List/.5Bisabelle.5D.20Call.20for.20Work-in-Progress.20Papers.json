Separate communities have developed to investigate and build<br>\ncomputer based systems for computer algebra, automated deduction, and<br>\nmathematical publishing as well as novel user interfaces. While all of these<br>\nsystems excel in their own right, their integration can lead to synergies<br>\noffering significant added value. The Conference on Intelligent Computer<br>\nMathematics (CICM) offers a venue for discussing and developing solutions<br>\nto the great challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.</p>\n<p>CICM has been held annually as a joint meeting since 2008, co-locating<br>\nrelated conferences and workshops to advance work in these<br>\nsubjects. Previous meetings have been held in Birmingham (UK 2008),<br>\nGrand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France 2010), Bertinoro (Italy 2011),<br>\nBremen (Germany 2012), Bath (UK 2013), and Coimbra (Portugal 2014).</p>\n<p>This is a (short version of the) call for Work-in-Progress papers for CICM<br>\n2015, which will be held in Washington, D.C., 13-17 July 2015.<br>\nWe solicit for papers which describe work in progress, recent developments,<br>\nand other work of interest to our communities which does not yet have<br>\nthe maturity for archival proceedings.</p>\n<p>The full version of the CFP is available from the conference web page<br>\nathttp://cicm-conference.org/2015/cicm.php</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The principal tracks of the conference will be:</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Calculemus (Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning)<br>\n  Chair: Jacques Carette</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DML (Digital Mathematical Libraries)<br>\n  Chair: Volker Sorge</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MKM (Mathematical Knowledge Management)<br>\n  Chair: Cezary Kaliszyk</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Systems and Data<br>\n  Chair: Florian Rabe</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Publicity chair is Serge Autexier.
