Separate  communities  have  developed  to<br>\ninvestigate  and build  computer based  systems for  computer algebra,<br>\nautomated deduction, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user<br>\ninterfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their<br>\nintegration  can   lead  to   synergies  offering   significant  added<br>\nvalue.  The  Conference  on Intelligent  Computer  Mathematics  (CICM)<br>\noffers a  venue for discussing  and developing solutions to  the great<br>\nchallenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.</p>\n<p>CICM has been held annually as a joint meeting since 2008, co-locating<br>\nrelated   conferences  and   workshops  to   advance  work   in  these<br>\nsubjects. Previous  meetings have been  held in Birmingham  (UK 2008),<br>\nGrand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France 2010), Bertinoro (Italy 2011),<br>\nBremen (Germany  2012), Bath (UK  2013), Coimbra (Portugal  2014), <br>\nWashington DC (USA 2015) and Bialystok (Poland 2016).</p>\n<p>This is the call for proposals for  workshops to be held  at CICM 2017<br>\nEdinburgh, Scotland, July 17-21, 2017. </p>\n<p>Some of the workshops that have been held at past CICM meetings are:<br>\n  Automated Reasoning: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice<br>\n  Compact Computer Algebra<br>\n  Empirically Successful Automated Reasoning for Mathematics<br>\n  Formal Mathematics for Mathematicians <br>\n  Intelligent Proof Search<br>\n  Mathematical user Interfaces<br>\n  Mathematics Information Retrieval<br>\n  OpenMath<br>\n  Pen-Based Mathematical Computation<br>\n  Programming languages for Mechanized Mathematics Systems<br>\n  Proof Engineering<br>\n  SCIEnce<br>\n  The Notion of Proof<br>\n  User Interfaces for Theorem Provers</p>\n<p>Proposals for workshops  to be held at CICM  2017 are solicited.  Both<br>\nwell-established workshops and newer or brand new ones are encouraged.</p>\n<p>Please provide the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workshop title.</li>\n<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>\n<li>Brief description of workshop goals and/or topics.</li>\n<li>Proposed workshop duration (half a day up to two days is possible).</li>\n<li>If the workshop has met previously, please include the conference <br>\n   affiliation for the previous meeting. If the workshop is new, <br>\n   please indicate so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CICM  will take  care  of copying  and  distributing informal  printed<br>\nproceedings for  workshops that  would like this  service, as  well as<br>\npermanently archived open access online proceedings with <a href=\"http://CEUR-WS.org\">CEUR-WS.org</a>.</p>\n<p>All  proposals  should  be  sent  via email to the CICM workshop chair<br>\nPetros Papapanagiotou (<a href=\"mailto:pe.p@ed.ac.uk\">pe.p@ed.ac.uk</a>).</p>\n<p>Important dates:</p>\n<p>Deadline for proposal submissions:                     17.
