Separate  communities  have  developed  to<br>\ninvestigate  and build  computer based  systems for  computer algebra,<br>\nautomated deduction, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user<br>\ninterfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their<br>\nintegration  can   lead  to   synergies  offering   significant  added<br>\nvalue.  The  Conference  on Intelligent  Computer  Mathematics  (CICM)<br>\noffers a  venue for discussing  and developing solutions to  the great<br>\nchallenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.</p>\n<p>CICM has been held annually as  a joint meeting since 2008, colocating<br>\nrelated conferences and  workshops to advance work  in these subjects.<br>\nPrevious meetings have been held in Birmingham (U.K. 2008), Grand Bend<br>\n(Canada  2009), Paris  (France 2010),  Bertinoro (Italy  2011), Bremen<br>\n(Germany   2012),  Bath (U.K.  2013),    Coimbra (Portugal, 2014)  and<br>\nWashington D.C. (USA, 2015). </p>\n<p>This is the call for proposals for  workshops to be held  at CICM 2016,<br>\nwhich will be held at the University of Bialystok (Poland), July 25-29<br>\nnext year.</p>\n<p>Some of the workshops that have been held at past CICM meetings are:<br>\n  Automated Reasoning: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice<br>\n  Compact Computer Algebra<br>\n  Empirically Successful Automated Reasoning for Mathematics<br>\n  Formal Mathematics for Mathematicians <br>\n  Intelligent Proof Search<br>\n  Mathematical user Interfaces<br>\n  Mathematics Information Retrieval<br>\n  OpenMath<br>\n  Pen-Based Mathematical Computation<br>\n  Programming languages for Mechanized Mathematics Systems<br>\n  SCIEnce<br>\n  The Notion of Proof<br>\n  User Interfaces for Theorem Provers</p>\n<p>Proposals for workshops  to be held at CICM  2016 are solicited.  Both<br>\nwell-established workshops and newer or brand new ones are encouraged.</p>\n<p>Please provide the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workshop title.</li>\n<li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>\n<li>Brief description of workshop goals and/or topics.</li>\n<li>Proposed workshop duration (half a day up to two days is possible).</li>\n<li>If the workshop has met previously, please include the conference <br>\n   affiliation for the previous meeting.
