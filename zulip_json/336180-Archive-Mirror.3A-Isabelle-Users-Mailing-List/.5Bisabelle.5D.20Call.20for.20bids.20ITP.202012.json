There are two phases: solicitation<br>\nof bids and voting. This message concerns the first phase. A<br>\nlong-standing TPHOLs convention is that the conference should be held in<br>\na continent different from the location of the previous meeting, and<br>\ntherefore no bids to host ITP 2012 in Europe will be accepted. Based on<br>\nITP and TPHOLs history, ITP 2012 will likely be held in July, August or<br>\nSeptember.</p>\n<p>Bids should be sent to <a href=\"mailto:itp2011@easychair.org\">itp2011@easychair.org</a> and should include at least<br>\nthe following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>name and email address of a contact person</li>\n<li>names of other people involved</li>\n<li>address of website for the bid</li>\n<li>approximate dates of the conference</li>\n<li>\n<p>structure (e.g., k workshop days and n days of presentations followed<br>\n  by excursion...)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>advantages of the proposed venue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example of a previous winning bid is here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://itp2011.cs.ru.nl/ITP2011/Bid_ITP11.html\">http://itp2011.cs.ru.nl/ITP2011/Bid_ITP11.html</a></p>\n<p>Deadline for all bids is Monday, 30 May 2011. Shortly after that, the<br>\nbids will be made public and the voting phase will take place.  The<br>\npeople eligible to vote are those who are seriously thinking of<br>\nattending ITP 2012. The voting system used will be Single Transferable<br>\nVote between all received bids.</p>\n<p>Marko van Eekelen<br>\nHerman Geuvers<br>\nJulien Schmaltz<br>\nFreek Wiedijk</p>",
