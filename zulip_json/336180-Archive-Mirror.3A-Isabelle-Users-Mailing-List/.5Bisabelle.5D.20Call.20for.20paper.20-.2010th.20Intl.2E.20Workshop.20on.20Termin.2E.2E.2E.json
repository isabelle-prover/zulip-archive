Workshop on Termination greatly welcomes<br>\ncontributions from the type theory community and developers and users of<br>\nproof assistants.</p>\n<p>10th International Workshop on Termination (WST 2009)</p>\n<p>Leipzig, Germany, June 3-5, 2009</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/wst09/\">http://www.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/wst09/</a></p>\n<p>Termination is a fundamental topic in computer science.  Classical<br>\nundecidability results show that termination is difficult.  On the<br>\nother hand, programs are usually required to terminate.  So methods<br>\nare needed that prove termination and non-termination automatically<br>\nfor a wide range of programs.  Termination proofs are essential not<br>\nonly for program verification, but also as components of program<br>\ntransformation systems. The topic is challenging both in theory<br>\n(mathematical logic, proof theory) and practice (software development,<br>\nformal methods), and many interesting ramifications are yet to be<br>\nexplored.</p>\n<p>The 10th International Workshop on Termination will delve into all<br>\naspects of termination of processes.  It will continue the sequence of<br>\nsuccessful workshops held in St. Andrews (1993), La Bresse (1995), Ede<br>\n(1997), Dagstuhl (1999), Utrecht (2001), Valencia (2003), Aachen<br>\n(2004), Seattle (2006), and Paris (2007).  It will attain the same<br>\nfriendly atmosphere as those past workshops.  The intent is to bring<br>\ntogether, in an informal setting, researchers interested in all<br>\naspects of termination, whether this interest be practical or<br>\ntheoretical, primary or derived.  The workshop shall help exchange<br>\nideas from term rewriting and from the various programming language<br>\ncommunities.</p>\n<p>Contributions from the imperative, constraint, functional, and logic<br>\nprogramming communities, and papers investigating new applications of<br>\ntermination are particularly welcome.</p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>Frederic Blanqui,     INRIA, FR and Tsinghua University, CN<br>\n   Byron Cook,           Microsoft Corporation, US<br>\n   Alfons Geser,         HTWK Leipzig, DE (chair)<br>\n   Michael Hanus,        Universität Kiel, DE<br>\n   Janis Voigtlander,    Technische Universität Dresden, DE</p>\n<p>Local organization:</p>\n<p>Johannes Waldmann, HTWK Leipzig, DE</p>\n<p>Important Dates:</p>\n<p>Paper submission 19 April 2009<br>\n   Notification 26 April 2009<br>\n   Final Paper Version 3 May 2009</p>\n<p>Conference Venue:</p>\n<p>The workshop will be held in the city of Leipzig,<br>\nat the conference center Mediencampus Villa Ida.</p>\n<p>Hosting institution:</p>\n<p>Hochschule fur Technik, Wirtschaft und Kultur Leipzig,<br>\nin cooperation with Leipzig School of Media<br>\nand Medienstiftung der Sparkasse Leipzig.</p>",
