Though termination of processes is often a <br>\nstrict requirement, it may be hard to establish. Classical results state the undecidability of<br>\nvarious termination problems, so research focuses on automated methods that prove termination<br>\nor non-termination in practical cases. The topic is challenging both in theory (mathematical logic, <br>\nproof theory) and practice (software development, formal methods), and many interesting ramifications <br>\nare yet to be explored.</p>\n<p>The 9th International Workshop on Termination will delve into all aspects of termination. It will <br>\ncontinue the sequence of successful workshops held in St. Andrews (1993), La Bresse (1995), Ede (1997), <br>\nDagstuhl (1999), Utrecht (2001), Valencia (2003), Aachen (2004), and Seattle (2006). We hope to attain <br>\nthe same friendly atmosphere as those past workshops. The intent is to bring together, in an informal <br>\nsetting, researchers interested in various aspects of termination, whether this interest be practical or <br>\ntheoretical, primary or derived. The workshop is hoped to provide a ground for cross-fertilisation of <br>\nideas from term rewriting and from programming.</p>\n<p>Contributions from the imperative, object-oriented, constraint, functional, and logic programming <br>\ncommunities, and papers investigating new applications of termination are particularly welcome.</p>\n<p>Paper Submissions:<br>\nExtended abstracts in the prescribed format, not exceeding 4 pages, should be submitted<br>\nelectronically through EasyChair's WST 2007 submission site <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/WST2007/\">http://www.easychair.org/WST2007/</a>.<br>\nA common workshop style file will be made available on the WST'2007 web site. Papers should <br>\nbe submitted in PostScript or PDF format. We expect proceedings to be made available<br>\nthrough the Computing Research Repository, CoRR.</p>\n<p>The Termination Competition:<br>\nThe competition will run again in 2007, and entries are strongly encouraged.  Detailed instructions for<br>\nsubmission of problems and programs will be made available at the competition website<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.lri.fr/~marche/termination-competition/2007/\">http://www.lri.fr/~marche/termination-competition/2007/</a></p>\n<p>Program Committee<br>\nNachum Dershowitz (Tel Aviv, Israel)<br>\nDaniel De Schreye (Leuven, Belgium)<br>\nSamir Genaim (Madrid, Spain)<br>\nJuergen Giesl (Aachen, Germany)<br>\nIsabelle Gnaedig (Nancy, France)<br>\nDieter Hofbauer (Kassel, Germany), co-chair<br>\nAart Middeldorp (Innsbruck, Austria)<br>\nEtienne Payet (La Reunion, France)<br>\nAlexander Serebrenik (Eindhoven, The Netherlands), co-chair</p>\n<p>Termination Competition Committee<br>\nClaude Marche (Paris, France)<br>\nJohannes Waldmann (Leipzig, Germany)<br>\nHans Zantema (Eindhoven, The Netherlands)</p>\n<p>Workshop Themes (non-exhaustive list)<br>\nTermination of programs<br>\nTermination of rewriting<br>\nNormalization of lambda calculi<br>\nImplementation of termination methods<br>\nChallenging termination problems and proofs<br>\nApplication of termination methods, e.g. to program transformation and compilation<br>\nComparison and classification of termination methods<br>\nNon-termination detection<br>\nTermination methods for theorem provers<br>\nTermination in distributed systems<br>\nTermination proof methods for liveness and fairness<br>\nDerivational complexity<br>\nWell-quasi-orderings and ordinal notations</p>\n<p>Important Dates:<br>\nDeadline for electronic submission of papers :  April 8, 2007<br>\nNotification of acceptance                   :  May 6, 2007<br>\nDeadline for final versions                  :  May 27, 2007</p>\n<p>Competition Deadlines:<br>\nSubmission of public problems     :  May 1, 2007<br>\nRegistration of termination tools :  May 21, 2007<br>\nSubmission of secret problems     :  June 1, 2007<br>\nSubmission of termination tools   :  June 1, 2007<br>\nStart of competition              :  June 4, 2007</p>\n<p>Workshop Venue and Related Events:<br>\nWST 2007 is part of the Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming 2007.<br>\nCo-located events include RTA'07, HOR'07, PATE'07, RULE'07, SecReT'07, UNIF'07, WFLP'07, and WRS'07.<br>\nThese colloquia will run from June 25 to June 29, 2007, in Paris (France).<br>\nFor details see the RDP website at <a href=\"http://www.rdp07.org/\">http://www.rdp07.org/</a>.</p>\n<p>Web Sites<br>\nWST 2007: <a href=\"http://www.rdp07.org/wst.html\">http://www.rdp07.org/wst.html</a><br>\nTermination Competition: <a href=\"http://www.lri.fr/~marche/termination-competition/2007/\">http://www.lri.fr/~marche/termination-competition/2007/</a><br>\nRDP 2007: <a href=\"http://www.rdp07.org/\">http://www.rdp07.org/</a></p>",
