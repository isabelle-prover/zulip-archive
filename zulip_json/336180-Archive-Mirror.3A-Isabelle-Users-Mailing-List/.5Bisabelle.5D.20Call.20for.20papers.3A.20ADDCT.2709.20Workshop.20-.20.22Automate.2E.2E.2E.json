It is therefore<br>\nimportant to identify such decidable fragments and design efficient<br>\ndecision procedures for them. It is equally important to have uniform<br>\nmethods (such as resolution, rewriting, tableaux, sequent calculi, ...)<br>\nwhich can be tuned to provide algorithms with optimal complexity.</p>\n<p>The goal of ADDCT is to bring together researchers interested in</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>identifying (fragments of) logical theories which are decidable,<br>\n  identifying fragments thereof which have low complexity, and<br>\n  analyzing possibilities of obtaining optimal complexity results<br>\n  with uniform tools;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>analyzing decidability in combinations of theories and possibilities<br>\n  of combining decision procedures;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>efficient implementations for decidable fragments;</p>\n</li>\n<li>application domains where decidability resp. tractability are crucial.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Topics of interest for ADDCT include (but are not restricted to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Decidability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>decision procedures based on logical calculi such as:<br>\n   resolution, rewriting, tableaux, sequent calculi, or natural deduction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>decidability in combinations of logical theories</p>\n</li>\n<li>Complexity:</li>\n<li>complexity analysis for fragments of first- (or higher) order logic</li>\n<li>complexity analysis for combinations of logical theories<br>\n   (including parameterized complexity results)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tractability (in logic, automated reasoning, algebra, ...)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application domains for which complexity issues are essential<br>\n  (verification, security, databases, ontologies, ...)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal of ADDCT is to bring together researchers interested in exploring<br>\nthe topics above, both at a theoretical level and motivated by applications.</p>\n<p>Submission and selection procedure</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions are encouraged in one of the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Original papers (up to 15 pages, LNCS style, including bibliography);<br>\n  should describe original research and contain sufficient detail to<br>\n  assess the merits and relevance of the contribution.<br>\n  Simultaneous submission of material is prohibited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work in progress (up to 6 pages, LNCS style, without bibliography).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Presentation-only papers: may describe work previously published,<br>\n  and will not be inserted in the proceedings. We are allowing the<br>\n  submission of previously published work in order to allow researchers<br>\n  to communicate good ideas that the attendees may not be aware of.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the informal style of the workshop, the submission of papers<br>\npresenting student's work and work in progress is encouraged.</p>\n<p>Submission of papers is via EasyChair at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=addct2009\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=addct2009</a></p>\n<p>The final versions of the selected contributions will be collected in a<br>\nvolume to be distributed at the workshop and made accessible on the web.</p>\n<p>Organizers and Chairs<br>\n  Franz Baader (TU Dresden)<br>\n  Silvio Ghilardi (U.
