In the last few years, tremendous<br>\nprogress was made in both the speed and capacity of constraint<br>\ntechnology. Most notably, SAT solvers have become orders of magnitude<br>\nfaster and capable of handling problems that are orders of magnitude<br>\nbigger, thus enabling the formal verification of more complex computer<br>\nsystems. As a result, the formal verification of hardware and software<br>\nhas become a promising area for research and industrial applications.<br>\nThe main goals of the Constraints in Formal Verification workshop are<br>\nto bring together researchers from the CSP/SAT and the formal<br>\nverification communities, to describe new applications of constraint<br>\ntechnology to formal verification, to disseminate new challenging<br>\nproblem instances, and to propose new dedicated algorithms for hard<br>\nformal verification problems.<br>\nThis workshop will be of interest to researchers from both academia<br>\nand industry, working on constraints or on formal verification and<br>\ninterested in the application of constraints to formal verification.</p>\n<p>Scope</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The scope of the workshop includes topics related to the application<br>\nof constraint technology to formal verification, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>application of constraint solvers to hardware verification;</li>\n<li>application of constraint solvers to software verification;</li>\n<li>dedicated solvers for formal verification problems;</li>\n<li>challenging formal verification problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Delivery</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The workshop is scheduled for June 25, 2009. It will be<br>\nstructured to allow ample time for discussion and demonstration of new<br>\ntools and new problem instances.</p>\n<p>Submissions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions should be in the LNCS format and in one of the following types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a regular paper of up to 15 pages;</li>\n<li>a short paper of up to 4 pages, describing an industrial experience.<br>\nWorkshop papers should be submitted electronically in pdf format.<br>\nPapers should be formatted using the Lecture Notes in Computer Science<br>\n(LNCS) style.<br>\nPaper submissions should be e-mailed to the workshop chairs at:<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:mvelev@gmail.com\">mvelev@gmail.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The important dates for the workshop are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>abstract submission deadline:  April 15</li>\n<li>paper submission deadline:  April 22</li>\n<li>notification of acceptance:  May 10</li>\n<li>camera-ready version deadline:  May 31</li>\n<li>workshop date:  June 25</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bernd Becker, University of Freiburg, Germany<br>\nTalk title: SAT and SMT Solving in a Multi-Core Environment</p>\n<p>Workshop Chair</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Miroslav Velev, Aries Design Automation, U.S.A.<br>\nMasahiro Fujita, University of Tokyo, Japan</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Jay Bhadra, Freescale, U.S.A.<br>\nSÃ©rgio Vale Aguiar Campos, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Brazil<br>\nMaciej Ciesielski, University of Massachusetts, U.S.A.<br>\nGoerschwin Fey, University of Bremen, Germany<br>\nAlex D.
