Within<br>\nNASA, for example, such systems include autonomous robots, separation<br>\nassurance algorithms for aircraft, and autonomous rendezvous and<br>\ndocking for spacecraft. Moreover, emerging paradigms such as code<br>\ngeneration and safety cases are bringing with them new challenges and<br>\nopportunities.</p>\n<p>The focus of the symposium will be on formal techniques, their theory,<br>\ncurrent capabilities, and limitations, as well as their application to<br>\naerospace, robotics, and other safety-critical systems. The symposium<br>\naims to introduce researchers, graduate students, and partners in<br>\nindustry to those topics that are of interest, to survey current<br>\nresearch, and to identify unsolved problems and directions for future<br>\nresearch.</p>\n<p>The meeting will be comprised of invited talks by leading researchers<br>\nand practitioners, a panel discussion on the current status of formal<br>\nmethods, and more specialized talks based on contributed papers.</p>\n<p>The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is a new annual event intended to<br>\nhighlight the state of formal methods' art and practice. It follows<br>\nthe earlier Langley Formal Methods Workshop series and aims to foster<br>\ncollaboration between NASA researchers and engineers, as well as the<br>\nwider aerospace, safety-critical and formal methods communities.</p>\n<p>Topics of Interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<p>* Formal verification, including theorem proving, model checking,<br>\n      and static analysis</p>\n<p>* Automated testing and simulation techniques<br>\n    * Model-based development</p>\n<p>* Techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods, such as<br>\n      abstraction and symbolic methods, compositional techniques, as<br>\n      well as parallel and/or distributed techniques</p>\n<p>* Code generation<br>\n    * Safety cases<br>\n    * Accident/safety analysis<br>\n    * Formal approaches to fault tolerance</p>\n<p>* Theoretical advances and empirical evaluations of formal methods<br>\n      techniques for safety-critical systems, including hybrid and<br>\n      embedded systems</p>\n<hr>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There are two categories of submissions (in NASA conference style):</p>\n<p>* Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete results<br>\n      (10 pages / 30 minute talks)</p>\n<p>* Short papers describing interesting work in progress and/or<br>\npreliminary<br>\n      results (5 pages / 15 minute talks)</p>\n<p>All papers should describe original work that has not been published<br>\nelsewhere. Submissions will be fully reviewed and the symposium<br>\nproceedings will appear as a NASA Conference Publication. Authors of<br>\nselected papers will then be invited to submit extended versions to a<br>\nspecial issue of \"Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering: a<br>\nNASA Journal\" (Springer).</p>\n<p>Details for the NASA conference style and the link for submissions<br>\nwill be available from <a href=\"http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/event/nfm09/callpapers/\">http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/event/nfm09/callpapers/</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>PROGRAM CHAIRS:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ewen Denney, NASA Ames<br>\nDimitra Giannakopoulou, NASA Ames<br>\nCorina Pasareanu, NASA Ames</p>\n<hr>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Gilles Barthe, IMDEA, Madrid<br>\nGuillaume Brat, NASA Ames<br>\nRicky Butler, NASA Langley<br>\nCharles Consel, INRIA, Bordeaux<br>\nKrzysztof Czarnecki, U.
