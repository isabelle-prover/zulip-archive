We welcome  participation  and contributions from  the<br>\ntheorem proving, formal methods  and tools, and HCI  communities, both<br>\nto  report on experience   with existing systems,  and  to discuss new<br>\ndirections.</p>\n<p>UITP 2010 is a one-day workshop to be held on the 15th July 2010 in<br>\nEdinburgh, Scotland, as a FLoC'10 workshop.  The meeting is affiliated<br>\nwith the ITP 2010 and IJCAR 2010 conferences.</p>\n<p>Submissions</p>\n<p>Submissions are encouraged in one of the following two categories:</p>\n<p>- Regular paper:<br>\n     Submissions in this category should describe previously<br>\n     unpublished work (completed or in progress), including<br>\n     descriptions of research, tools, and applications.<br>\n     Papers should be formated following the ENTCS guidelines<br>\n     and be up to 15 pages long</p>\n<p>- System description:<br>\n     Submissions in this category are intended to describe existing<br>\n     systems. Papers should be formated following the ENTCS guidelines<br>\n     and be up to 5 pages long</p>\n<p>The additional UTIP'10-specific ENTCS macro file can be downloaded from:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.entcs.org/files/uitp10/prentcsmacro.sty\">http://www.entcs.org/files/uitp10/prentcsmacro.sty</a></p>\n<p>Suggested topics include, but are not restricted to:</p>\n<p>* Application-specific interaction mechanisms or designs for prover<br>\n     interfaces</p>\n<p>* Experiments and evaluation of prover interfaces<br>\n   * Languages and tools for authoring, exchanging and presenting proofs<br>\n   * Implementation techniques (e.g. web services, middleware, DSLs)<br>\n   * Integration of interfaces and tools to explore and construct proof<br>\n   * Representation and manipulation of mathematical knowledge or objects<br>\n   * Visualisation of mathematical objects and proofs<br>\n   * System descriptions</p>\n<p>Authors   are encouraged to bring     along versions of their  systems<br>\nsuitable for informal  demonstration during breaks  in the  program of<br>\ntalks.</p>\n<p>The workshop  proceedings will  be  distributed at  the workshop as  a<br>\ncollection of the accepted papers.  Final  versions of accepted papers<br>\nhave    to be prepared   with LaTeX.   Following  up  the workshop the<br>\n(revised)  accepted  papers will be  published in  a   volume of ENTCS<br>\ndevoted to the workshop.</p>\n<p>Dates</p>\n<p>Deadline for submissions:  April 5th  2010<br>\n  Notification:              April 28th 2010<br>\n  Final versions due:        May   22nd 2010<br>\n  Workshop:                  July  15th 2010</p>\n<p>Submission is via EasyChair (thanks to Andrei Voronkov)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=uitp09\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=uitp09</a></p>\n<p>More information can be found on the UITP web page at</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://uitp10.cs.unibo.it/\">http://uitp10.cs.unibo.it/</a></p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>David Aspinall         (University of Edinburgh, UK) (Co-Chair)<br>\n   Serge Autexier         (DFKI Bremen, DE)<br>\n   Christoph Benzmüller   (Saarland University, DE)<br>\n   Yves Bertot            (INRIA Sophia-Antipolis - Méditerranée, FR)<br>\n   Ewen Denney            (NASA Ames Research Center, USA)<br>\n   Cezary Kaliszyk        (Technical University München, DE)<br>\n   Paul Libbrecht         (University of Saarlandes/DFKI Saarbrücken, DE)<br>\n   Christoph Lüth         (University of Bremen and DFKI Bremen, DE)<br>\n   James McKinna          (Radboub University Nijmegen, NL)<br>\n   Michael Norrish        (NICTA, AU)<br>\n   Claudio Sacerdoti Coen (University of Bologna, IT) (Co-Chair)<br>\n   Geoff Sutcliffe        (University of Miami, USA)<br>\n   Laurent Thery          (INRIA Sophia-Antipolis - Méditerranée, FR)<br>\n   Gem Stapleton          (University of Brighton, UK)<br>\n   Makarius Wenzel        (TU Munich, DE)<br>\n   Burkhart Wolff         (University Paris-Sud 11, FR)</p>",
