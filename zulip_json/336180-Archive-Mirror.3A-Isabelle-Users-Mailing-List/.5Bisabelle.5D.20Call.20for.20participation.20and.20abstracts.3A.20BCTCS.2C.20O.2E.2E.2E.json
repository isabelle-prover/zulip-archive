It also aims to provide an<br>\nenvironment in which PhD students can gain experience in presenting<br>\ntheir work, and benefit from contact with established researchers.</p>\n<p>SCOPE</p>\n<p>All aspects of theoretical computer science, including automata<br>\ntheory, algorithms, complexity theory, semantics, formal methods,<br>\nconcurrency, types, languages and logics. Computer scientists and<br>\nmathematicians are welcome to attend, as are participants from<br>\noutside the UK.</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME</p>\n<p>The programme  will consist of nearly 3 days worth of invited and<br>\ncontributed talks, beginning at 5.30pm on Monday 2nd April and<br>\nconcluding at 1pm on Thursday 5th April 2007. The abstracts of the<br>\ntalks will be published in the Bulletin of the European Association<br>\nfor Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS).</p>\n<p>The invited speakers are as follows:</p>\n<p>Dimitris Achlioptas, University of California, Santa Cruz, U.S.A.<br>\n        \"Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems:<br>\n         from Physics to Algorithms\"</p>\n<p>Steven Alpern, The London School of Economics and Political Science<br>\n        \"Search Games and Utilitarian Postman Paths on Networks\"</p>\n<p>Julian Bradfield, University of Edinburgh<br>\n        (BCS-FACS Lecturer in Formal Methods)</p>\n<p>Georg Gottlob, University of Oxford<br>\n        \"Living with Computational Complexity\"<br>\n        (This is Prof. Gottlob's inaugural lecture at Oxford University.)</p>\n<p>Bob Harper, Carnegie Mellon University, U.S.A.</p>\n<p>Richard Jozsa, University of Bristol</p>\n<p>Kristina Vuskovic, University of Leeds<br>\n        (LMS Lecturer in Discrete Mathematics)</p>\n<p>LOCATION</p>\n<p>The 2007 colloquium will be held at St Anne's College, Oxford, one<br>\nof the colleges of the University of Oxford, and hosted by the<br>\ncomputing departments of both Oxford Brookes and Oxford universities,<br>\nOxford itself is known as the \"City of Dreaming Spires\", and has<br>\nbeen home to both royalty and scholars for over 800 years.</p>\n<p>REGISTRATION</p>\n<p>Registration for BCTCS2007 is open, via the web page.<br>\nThe deadline for registration and submission of abstracts for<br>\nproposed talks is 16th February 2007.
