APLAS is based in Asia, but is<br>\nan international forum that serves the worldwide programming language<br>\ncommunity.</p>\n<p>APLAS is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation of Software<br>\n(AAFS) founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with many researchers<br>\nfrom Europe and the USA. Past APLAS symposiums were successfully held<br>\nin Kyoto ('12), Kenting ('11), Shanghai ('10), Seoul ('09), Bangalore<br>\n('08), Singapore ('07), Sydney ('06), Tsukuba ('05), Taipei ('04) and<br>\nBeijing ('03) after three informal workshops. Proceedings will be<br>\npublished in Springer's LNCS series.</p>\n<p>CPP is an international forum on theoretical and practical topics in<br>\nall areas, including computer science, mathematics, and education,<br>\nthat consider certification as an essential paradigm for their<br>\nwork. Certification here means formal, mechanized verification of some<br>\nsort, preferably with production of independently checkable<br>\ncertificates.</p>\n<p>The first two CPP conferences were held in Kenting, Taiwan, and Kyoto,<br>\nJapan, in December 2011 and 2012, respectively. As with the first<br>\nmeetings, the proceedings will be published in Springer-Verlag’s<br>\nLecture Notes in Computer Science series.</p>\n<p>===================<br>\nConference Location<br>\n===================</p>\n<p>APLAS and CPP will be held at the Rydges on Swanston hotel in Melbourne,<br>\nAustralia, adjacent to the University of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>Melbourne is widely considered to be Australia's financial and arts<br>\ncapital, and was recently selected by The Economist Intelligence Unit as<br>\nthe World's Most Livable City.
