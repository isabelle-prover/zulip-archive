What are the deduction techniques?</p>\n<p>in connection with IJCAR'06 at FLoC'06</p>\n<p>August 15-16, 2006, Seattle, USA</p>\n<p>[http://www.easychair.org/FLoC-06/VERIFY.html]</p>\n<p>The formal verification of   critical information systems has  a  long<br>\ntradition as   one  of the  main  areas of  application for  automated<br>\ntheorem  proving.    Nevertheless,  the  area  is  of  still   growing<br>\nimportance as the number of computers affecting  everyday life and the<br>\ncomplexity of  these systems are both increasing.   The purpose of the<br>\nVERIFY workshop  series is to  discuss   problems arising  during  the<br>\nformal  modeling   and  verification  of  information systems  and  to<br>\ninvestigate suitable solutions.   Possible  perspectives include those<br>\nof automated theorem  proving,  tool support, system  engineering, and<br>\napplications.</p>\n<p>The   VERIFY   workshops  aim  at  bringing  together  people  who are<br>\ninterested in the development of safety and security critical systems,<br>\nin formal  methods, in the  development  of automated theorem  proving<br>\ntechniques, and  in  the  development  of  tool   support.   Practical<br>\nexperiences  gained in realistic verifications  are of interest to the<br>\nautomated theorem proving community and new theorem proving techniques<br>\nshould be transferred into   practice.  The overall objective  of  the<br>\nVERIFY workshops is to identify open problems  and to discuss possible<br>\nsolutions under the theme</p>\n<p>What are the verification problems? What are the deduction techniques?</p>\n<p>In  2006,   VERIFY will  specifically   consider issues  regarding the<br>\napplication of \"tool support   for formal modeling,  verification  and<br>\nstepwise  system  development\" without excluding submissions regarding<br>\nother topics in the focus of the  workshop.  Therefore, submissions in<br>\nthis area are especially encouraged.</p>\n<p>KEYNOTE SPEAKERS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>John Rushby  (SRI International)<br>\n  Threatened by a Great Opportunity: Disruptive Innovation in Formal<br>\n  Verification</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Luca Vigano  (ETH ZÃ¼rich)<br>\n  Automated Reasoning for Security Protocol Analysis</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Christoph Walther  (TU Darmstadt)<br>\n  Verification in the Classroom</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ACCEPTED PAPERS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Robert Palmer, Ganesh Gopalakrishnan, and Mike Kirby<br>\n  Formal Specification and Verification Using +CAL: An Experience<br>\n  Report</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Viorica Sofronie-Stokkermans<br>\n  Local reasoning in verification</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Laura Ildiko Kovacs, Tudor Jebelean<br>\n  Finding Polynomial Invariants for Imperative Loops in the Theorema<br>\n  System</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bernhard Beckert, Vladimir Klebanov<br>\n  Must Program Verification Systems and Calculi be Verified?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dieter Hutter<br>\n  Automating Proofs of Unwinding Conditions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Andreas Schlosser, Christoph Walther, and Markus Aderhold<br>\n  Axiomatic Specifications in VeriFun</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Achim D.
