For that<br>\npurpose, I'd like to collect some ‘real-world problems’ from Isabelle users.</p>\n<p>I am looking for problems involving the limit of functions of type \"real<br>\n⇒ real\" built from arithmetic (+-*/^), powr, sqrt, root, ln, exp, abs,<br>\nmin, max as well as sin, cos, tan at finite points. Real parameters<br>\n(i.e. free variables of type \"real\") are also allowed.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",

The transformers are built from <br>\nlinear combinations (*,+), infimum and least fixed point.  The <br>\nnon-recursive cases are in thys/pGCL/Continuity.thy, and the recursive <br>\ncase (that a loop is equivalent to the limit of its iterates) is in <br>\nthys/pGCL/LoopInduction.thy.  The proofs are long, but there's nothing <br>\nespecially funky in there - it's mostly just dancing around not having <br>\nthe extended reals.</p>\n<p>David</p>",
