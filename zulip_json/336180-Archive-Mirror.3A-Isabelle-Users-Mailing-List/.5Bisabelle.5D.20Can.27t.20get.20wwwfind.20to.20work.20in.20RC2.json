The documentation (doc/design.tex) says:</p>\n<p>\"The module is built by using a \\texttt{ROOT.ML} file inside a heap that<br>\ncontains the theories to be searched.\"</p>\n<p>So how do I get it to work? Did anyone else succeed in getting it to work?</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Rafal Kolanski.</p>",
