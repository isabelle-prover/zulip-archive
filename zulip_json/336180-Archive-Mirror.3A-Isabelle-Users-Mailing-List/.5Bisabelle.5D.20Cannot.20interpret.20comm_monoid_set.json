Consequently, the command</p>\n<p>interpretation foo: comm_monoid_set ... ...</p>\n<p>raises the error</p>\n<p>Duplicate fact declaration \"Scratch.foo.commute\" vs. \"Scratch.foo.commute\"</p>\n<p>One can get around this by first interpreting abel_semigroup with the same parameters but <br>\na different name prefix, but this is just a hack. Is it possible to rename one of the <br>\ncommute lemmas before the next release to avoid the clash?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
