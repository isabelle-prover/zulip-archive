X(i)| le K\"</p>\n<p>But looking at the amount of work done to get there, it looks as if it<br>\nis too hard to re-do it in HOL. Am I right to assume that there is no<br>\nsensible way of using results from ZF in HOL?</p>\n<p>Maybe I can try the result above at least for countable infinite M in<br>\nHOL.</p>\n<p>Greetings,<br>\nJoachim<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/HqrAfPOdaM5bqm8sFYT9pfEP/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",

I wasn’t aware of HOL/Library, and I’ll make<br>\nsure to look there the next time as well. HOL/Library/Countable looks<br>\ninteresting as well.</p>\n<p>I’d like to know of a way to proof this for uncountable sets as well<br>\nbefore digging into this, though. Having the result only for nat is not<br>\nvery exciting.</p>\n<p>Greetings,<br>\nJoachim<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/L2rT112eDTTfmEfssYO3ACha/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
