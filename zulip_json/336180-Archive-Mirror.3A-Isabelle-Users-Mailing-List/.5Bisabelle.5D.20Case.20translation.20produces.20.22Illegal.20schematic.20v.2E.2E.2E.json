A small example can be found in the <br>\nattached theory. (The first term statement parses and displays the term as usual, but the <br>\nsecond statement produces the above error.)</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the problem occurs only if the datatype declaration inside the locale comes <br>\nonly after the function definition in the locale. Has anyone an idea what's happening here?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/oDgbW3qMd915W_hSj3ih67Mm/Scratch.thy\">Scratch.thy</a></p>",
