Shorter papers are welcome and will be given equal<br>\nconsideration. The proceedings of the conference will be published<br>\nby the ACM. Templates for ACM SIGPLAN format can be found on the<br>\nACM SIGPLAN website:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author\">http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author</a>.</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted in PDF format, through the EasyChair<br>\nsubmission page:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2016\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2016</a></p>\n<p>Abstracts must be submitted by the deadline given above.<br>\nThe deadline for full papers falls one week later, and authors<br>\nhave the option to withdraw their papers during the window between the<br>\ntwo.</p>\n<p>Each submission must be written in English and provide sufficient<br>\ndetail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the<br>\npaper. It should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a<br>\nsummary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their<br>\nsignificance and relevance to the conference, all phrased for the<br>\nnon-specialist. Technical and formal developments directed to the<br>\nspecialist should follow. If the submission reports on a<br>\ncomputer-checked formalization, code, or the results of a computation,<br>\na link to the relevant data should be provided. References and<br>\ncomparisons with related work should be included. Papers not<br>\nconforming to the above requirements concerning format and length may<br>\nbe rejected without further consideration.</p>\n<p>The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>\nelsewhere, including the proceedings of other published conferences or<br>\nworkshops. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work<br>\nsubmitted to a conference or journal in advance of submission.<br>\nOriginal formal proofs of known results in mathematics or computer<br>\nscience are among the targets. One author of each accepted paper is<br>\nexpected to present it at the conference.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Jeremy Avigad (co-chair), Carnegie Mellon University, US<br>\nSandrine Blazy, UniversitÃ© de Rennes 1, France<br>\nAdam Chlipala (co-chair), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US<br>\nThierry Coquand, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden<br>\nJohn Harrison, Intel, US<br>\nChris Hawblitzel, Microsoft Research, Redmond, US<br>\nCÄƒtÄƒlin HriÅ£cu, INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt, France<br>\nBrian Huffman, Galois, Inc., US<br>\nLaura KovÃ¡cs, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden<br>\nPeter Lammich, Technische UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen, Germany<br>\nDan Licata, Wesleyan University, US<br>\nHongjin Liang, University of Science and Technology of China, China<br>\nPanagiotis Manolios, Northeastern University, US<br>\nDale Miller, INRIA Saclay and LIX, France<br>\nDominic Mulligan, Cambridge University, UK<br>\nLawrence Paulson, Cambridge University, UK<br>\nAndrei Popescu, Middlesex University London, UK<br>\nClaudio Sacerdoti Coen, University of Bologna, Italy<br>\nZachary Tatlock, University of Washington, US<br>\nCesare Tinelli, University of Iowa, US</p>",
