Researchers are<br>\n   aiming to provide well-designed and widely-applicable user interfaces<br>\n   for this diverse audience. Among the questions lies the hypothesis<br>\n   that unified mathematical language is used with all systems. Can we<br>\n   achieve this?</p>\n<p>This workshop provides a forum for the discussion of computer<br>\n   representations of mathematics, and how gestures, writing, speech, or<br>\n   other novel techniques can be used to improve mathematical user<br>\n   interfaces.</p>\n<p>Topics include:</p>\n<p>- presentations on manipulation of mathematical knowledge<br>\n   - workflow studies based on mathematical applications<br>\n   - user studies on the effectiveness of interfaces<br>\n   - interactive teaching and testing<br>\n   - novel, original or downright funky interfaces to mathematics software<br>\n   - interactive mathematics generally</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>We are seeking submissions of either papers on and/or demonstrations<br>\n   of user interfaces for mathematics. Videos, prototypes, mock ups and<br>\n   any other sort of demonstration are welcome!<br>\n   Proceedings will be online.</p>\n<p>Submission format: article of 3-8 (printed) pages, in PDF format only,<br>\n   which may include other electronic presentations such as videos or<br>\n   animations complemented by an abstract of less than 150 words.</p>\n<p>Important Dates:</p>\n<p>- Either submit your abstract on until May 1st 2009 and a paper on<br>\nMay 15th.<br>\n     or submit an paper on May 8th 2009</p>\n<p>- Be prepared for a rebuttal phase from May 25th till 30th<br>\n   - Expect an answer on June 2nd 2009<br>\n   - Enjoy the workshop on July 6th 2009<br>\n   All submissions are done on MathUI's easychair.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mathui09\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mathui09</a></p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>The workshop will be reviewed by the following persons:</p>\n<p>- David Aspinall,  Edinburgh, Scotland<br>\n   - Paul Cairns, York, Great Britain<br>\n   - Olga Caprotti, Helsinki, Finland<br>\n   - Richard Fateman, Berkeley, USA<br>\n   - Anthony Jameson, Saarbruecken, Germany<br>\n   - Paul Libbrecht (organizer), Saarbruecken, Germany<br>\n   - Robert Miner, Minneapolis, USA<br>\n   - Elena Smirnova, London, Canada</p>\n<p>Further information, please contact Paul Libbrecht, <a href=\"mailto:paul@activemath.org\">paul@activemath.org</a>.</p>",
