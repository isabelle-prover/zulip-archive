Based on mathematics and logic, formal methods help practitioners<br>\nconstruct technology that can ensure increasingly important concerns such as<br>\nsafety, security, reliability and accountability.</p>\n<p>This special issue of the Software Quality Journal [1] is dedicated to program<br>\nanalysis techniques that can be used to improve the quality of software<br>\nproducts. The special issue welcomes static and dynamic program analysis<br>\ntechniques, approaches based on theorem proving, model checking, and any other<br>\nanalysis technique that can help improving the quality of software systems.</p>\n<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:<br>\n• model checking<br>\n• theorem proving<br>\n• correct by construction development<br>\n• model-based testing<br>\n• software testing<br>\n• symbolic execution<br>\n• static and dynamic analysis<br>\n• abstract interpretation<br>\n• analysis methods for dependable systems<br>\n• software certification and proof carrying code<br>\n• fault diagnosis and debugging<br>\n• verification and validation of large-scale software systems</p>\n<p>= Requirements for Submission</p>\n<p>Papers should be original and must not have been previously published or being<br>\ncurrently under submission at any other venue. A paper extending a conference or<br>\nworkshop publication must contain at least 30% of new material to be considered<br>\nfor publication. In that case, a clear indication in the introduction is<br>\nexpected.</p>\n<p>Manuscripts should be formatted according to the rules of the Software Quality<br>\nJournal, available by following the \"Instructions for Authors\" link on the<br>\njournal webpage [1], the CfP [2] and submit through [3], please make sure to<br>\nselect \"SI: Improving Software Quality Through Program Analysis\". See [4] for<br>\nfrequently asked questions.</p>\n<p>= Reviewing Details</p>\n<p>Each paper will be reviewed by at least two experts selected by the guest<br>\neditors.</p>\n<p>= Important dates</p>\n<p>• Deadline for submissions: 27 Sep 2019<br>\n• First round reviews: 20th Dec 2019<br>\n• Submission of revised papers: Feb 2020<br>\n• Notification of acceptance: April 2020<br>\n• Camera-ready version: May 2020</p>\n<p>= Guest Editors</p>\n<p>All inquiries can be sent to the guest editors of the journal:</p>\n<p>Leonardo Mariani<br>\nUniversity of Milano Bicocca<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:mariani@disco.unimib.it\">mariani@disco.unimib.it</a> &lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:mariani@disco.unimib.it\">mariani@disco.unimib.it</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Matthias Güdemann<br>\nIOHK<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:matthias@guedeman.org\">matthias@guedeman.org</a> &lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:matthias@guedemann.org\">matthias@guedemann.org</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>= References</p>\n<p>[1] Software Quality Journal.<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/computer/swe/journal/11219\">https://www.springer.com/computer/swe/journal/11219</a><br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/computer/swe/journal/11219\">https://www.springer.com/computer/swe/journal/11219</a>&gt;.<br>\n[2] <a href=\"https://www.springer.com/?SGWID=0-102-2-1470055-preview&amp;dynamic=true\">https://www.springer.com/?SGWID=0-102-2-1470055-preview&amp;dynamic=true</a><br>\n[3] <a href=\"https://www.editorialmanager.com/sqjo/\">https://www.editorialmanager.com/sqjo/</a><br>\n[4] Springer Frequently Asked Questions, 2018.<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/frequently-asked-questions/3832\">https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/frequently-asked-questions/3832</a><br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/frequently-asked-questions/3832\">https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/frequently-asked-questions/3832</a>&gt;.</p>",
