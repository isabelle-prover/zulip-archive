Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>problems from application domains, which could benefit from better<br>\n  verification and knowledge management facilities, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>knowledge management and verification tools, which domain experts<br>\n  can use without a computer science background. (Read more about our<br>\n  topics of interest)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For further examples, please see the Symposium on Enabling Domain<br>\nExperts to use Formalised Reasoning<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/events/aisb2013/\">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/events/aisb2013/</a>)<br>\nheld at the annual convention of the AISB (Society for the Study of<br>\nArtificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour) in April 2013.</p>\n<p>Submission: 31 October 2013<br>\n    Notification: 15 December 2013<br>\n    Revised version due: 15 January 2014<br>\n    Final version due: 15 February 2014<br>\n    Publication (expected): April 2014</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>for domain experts: what problems in application domains could<br>\n  benefit from better verification and knowledge management<br>\n  facilities? Possible fields include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Example 1 (economics): auctions, value-at-risk models, trading<br>\n  algorithms, market design</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Example 2 (engineering): system interoperability, manufacturing<br>\n  processes, product classification</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for computer scientists: how to provide the right knowledge<br>\n  management and verification tools to domain experts without a<br>\n  computer science background?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>wikis and blogs for informal, semantic, semiformal, and formal<br>\n   mathematical knowledge;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>general techniques and tools for online collaborative mathematics;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>tools for collaboratively producing, presenting, publishing, and<br>\n   interacting with online mathematics;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>automation and human-computer interaction aspects of mathematical<br>\nwikis;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ontologies and knowledge bases designed to support knowledge<br>\n   management and verification in application domains;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>practical experiences, usability aspects, feasibility studies;</p>\n</li>\n<li>evaluation of existing tools and experiments;</li>\n<li>requirements, user scenarios and goals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions should be approximately 20 pages long, should follow<br>\npublishers' instructions and should be submitted via EasyChair.</p>\n<p>Potential contributors may contact the guest editors<br>\n(<a href=\"mailto:doformmcs2014@easychair.org\">doformmcs2014@easychair.org</a>) to discuss the suitability of topics and<br>\npapers.</p>",
