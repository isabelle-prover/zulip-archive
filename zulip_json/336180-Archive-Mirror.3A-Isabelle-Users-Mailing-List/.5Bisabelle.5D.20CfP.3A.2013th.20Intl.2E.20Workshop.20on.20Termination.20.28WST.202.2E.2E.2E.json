The   workshop  also  provides  a  ground  for<br>\ncross-fertilisation  of  ideas  from   term  rewriting  and  from  the<br>\ndifferent programming  language communities.  The  friendly atmosphere<br>\nenables fruitful  exchanges leading  to joint research  and subsequent<br>\npublications.</p>\n<p>The 13th  Workshop on Termination will  be held from August  29 to 31,<br>\n2013, at the Centro Residenziale Universitario di Bertinoro (Italy).</p>\n<p>It  will be  a joint  workshop,  together with  the 3rd  International<br>\nWorkshop on  Foundational and Practical Aspects  of Resource Analysis.<br>\nThe  sessions  of  WST  and  FOPARA  will  be  interleaved,  this  way<br>\nfacilitating the interaction between the two communities.</p>\n<p>========= Important Dates ============================================</p>\n<p>submission:     July 15, 2013<br>\n    notification:   July 25, 2013<br>\n    final version:  August 10, 2013<br>\n    workshop:       August 29 - 31, 2013</p>\n<p>========= Topics =====================================================</p>\n<p>The 13th International  Workshop on Termination welcomes contributions<br>\non all aspects of termination and complexity analysis.</p>\n<p>Contributions from  the imperative, constraint,  functional, and logic<br>\nprogramming  communities,  and  papers investigating  applications  of<br>\ncomplexity or  termination (for  example in program  transformation or<br>\ntheorem proving) are particularly welcome.</p>\n<p>Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p>Termination of programs<br>\n    Termination of rewriting<br>\n    Termination analysis of transition systems<br>\n    Complexity of programs<br>\n    Complexity of rewriting<br>\n    Implicit computational complexity<br>\n    Implementation of termination and complexity analysis methods<br>\n    Certification of termination and complexity proofs<br>\n    Termination orders, well-founded orders, and reduction orders<br>\n    Termination methods for theorem provers<br>\n    Strong and weak normalization of lambda calculi<br>\n    Termination analysis for different language paradigms<br>\n    Invariants for termination proving<br>\n    Challenging termination problems<br>\n    Applications to program transformation and compilation<br>\n    Comparison and classification of termination methods<br>\n    Non-termination and loop detection<br>\n    Termination in distributed systems<br>\n    Proof methods for liveness and fairness<br>\n    Well-quasi-order theory<br>\n    Ordinal notations and subrecursive hierarchies</p>\n<p>========= Program Committee ==========================================</p>\n<p>Evelyne Contejean (Univ.
