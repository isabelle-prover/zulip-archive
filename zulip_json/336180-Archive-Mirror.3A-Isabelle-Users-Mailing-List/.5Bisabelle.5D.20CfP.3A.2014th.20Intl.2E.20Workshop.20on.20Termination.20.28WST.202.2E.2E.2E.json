The workshop also provides a ground for<br>\ncross-fertilisation of ideas from term rewriting and from the<br>\ndifferent programming language communities. The friendly atmosphere<br>\nenables fruitful exchanges leading to joint research and subsequent<br>\npublications.</p>\n<p>The 14th International Workshop on Termination in Vienna continues the<br>\nsuccessful workshops held in St. Andrews (1993), La Bresse (1995),<br>\nEde (1997), Dagstuhl (1999), Utrecht (2001), Valencia (2003),<br>\nAachen (2004), Seattle (2006), Paris (2007), Leipzig (2009),<br>\nEdinburgh (2010), Obergurgl (2012), and Bertinoro (2013). More<br>\ninformation on earlier WSTs is available on the Termination Portal:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.termination-portal.org/wiki/WST\">http://www.termination-portal.org/wiki/WST</a></p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>The 14th International Workshop on Termination welcomes contributions<br>\non all aspects of termination and complexity analysis (and their<br>\nautomation) for various models of computation, ranging from rewrite<br>\nsystems and state transition systems to programming languages.</p>\n<p>Contributions from the imperative, constraint, functional, and logic<br>\nprogramming communities, and papers investigating applications of<br>\ncomplexity or termination (for example in program transformation or<br>\ntheorem proving) are particularly welcome.</p>\n<p>Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p>* Termination of programs<br>\n      * Termination of rewriting<br>\n      * Termination analysis of transition systems<br>\n      * Complexity of programs<br>\n      * Complexity of rewriting<br>\n      * Implicit computational complexity<br>\n      * Implementation of termination and complexity analysis methods<br>\n      * Certification of termination and complexity proofs<br>\n      * Termination orders, well-founded orders, and reduction orders<br>\n      * Termination methods for theorem provers<br>\n      * Strong and weak normalization of lambda calculi<br>\n      * Termination analysis for different language paradigms<br>\n      * Invariants for termination proving<br>\n      * Challenging termination problems<br>\n      * Applications to program transformation and compilation<br>\n      * Comparison and classification of termination methods<br>\n      * Non-termination and loop detection<br>\n      * Termination in distributed and concurrent systems<br>\n      * Proof methods for liveness and fairness<br>\n      * Well-quasi-order theory<br>\n      * Ordinal notations and subrecursive hierarchies</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>Elvira Albert (Complutense University of Madrid)<br>\nAmir Ben-Amram (Tel-Aviv Academic College)<br>\nByron Cook (Microsoft Research and University College London)<br>\nCarsten Fuhs (University College London) - chair<br>\nJürgen Giesl (RWTH Aachen)<br>\nLaure Gonnord (University of Lyon)<br>\nAlbert Rubio (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya)<br>\nPeter Schneider-Kamp (University of Southern Denmark)<br>\nChristian Sternagel (University of Innsbruck)<br>\nThomas Ströder (RWTH Aachen)<br>\nJohannes Waldmann (HTWK Leipzig)<br>\nHarald Zankl (University of Innsbruck)</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<p>Submissions are short papers / extended abstracts which should not<br>\nexceed 5 pages using the LIPIcs style for LaTeX:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/\">http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/</a></p>\n<p>There will be no formal reviewing, but we will provide informal<br>\nfeedback for each submission. Accepted papers will be made available<br>\nelectronically, both on the WST 2014 web page and on the FLoC USB<br>\nproceedings. The workshop proceedings are informal as well. Thus,<br>\nsubmission to WST 2014 is not in conflict with an earlier, concurrent,<br>\nor later submission of the same material to a journal, a conference,<br>\nor another workshop. In case of simultaneous submissions to several<br>\nFLoC events, please state in the abstract on easychair to which other<br>\nFLoC venues you are submitting as well.</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wst2014\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wst2014</a></p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>Paper submission      23 April 2014<br>\nNotification          07 May 2014<br>\nFinal versions due    21 May 2014<br>\nWorkshop date         17 - 18 July 2014</p>",
