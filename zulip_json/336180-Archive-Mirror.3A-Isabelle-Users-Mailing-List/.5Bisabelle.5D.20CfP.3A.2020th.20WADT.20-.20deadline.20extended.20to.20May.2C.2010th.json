Originally born<br>\n  as formal method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now<br>\n  covers new specification frameworks and programming paradigms<br>\n  (such as object-oriented, aspect-oriented, agent-oriented, logic<br>\n  and higher-order functional programming) as well as a wide range<br>\n  of application areas (including information systems, concurrent,<br>\n  distributed and mobile systems).</p>\n<p>The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and<br>\n  ongoing work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and<br>\n  future trends.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest:<br>\n  Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:</p>\n<p>- Foundations of algebraic specification<br>\n  - Other approaches to formal specification, including process<br>\n    calculi and models of concurrent, distributed and mobile computing</p>\n<p>- Specification languages, methods, and environments<br>\n  - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques<br>\n  - Model-driven development<br>\n  - Graph transformations, term rewriting and proof systems<br>\n  - Integration of formal specification techniques<br>\n  - Formal testing and quality assurance, validation, and verification</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>\n  Hans-Dieter Ehrich, Institut f\\\"ur Informationssysteme, Braunschweig<br>\n  Frantisek Plasil, Charles University, Prague<br>\n  Martin Wirsing, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\\\"at, M\\\"unchen</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\n  Submission deadline for abstracts:   May 10, 2010<br>\n  Notification of acceptance:          May 23, 2010<br>\n  Final abstract due:                  June 13, 2010<br>\n  Workshop:                            July 1-4, 2010</p>\n<p>Workshop Format and Location:<br>\n  The workshop will take place over four days, Thursday to Sunday,<br>\n  at Schloss Etelsen, <a href=\"http://www.schloss-etelsen.de\">www.schloss-etelsen.de</a>, a castle located near<br>\n  Bremen. Presentations will be selected on the basis of submitted<br>\n  abstracts. Three talks will be given by invited speakers.</p>\n<p>Submissions:<br>\n  The scientific program of the workshop will include presentations<br>\n  of recent results and ongoing research.  The presentations will be<br>\n  selected by the Steering Committee on the basis of the submitted<br>\n  abstracts according to originality, significance, and general<br>\n  interest.</p>\n<p>The abstracts have to be submitted electronically according to the<br>\n  instructions published on the workshop web site. The final<br>\n  versions of the selected abstracts will be included in a hand-out<br>\n  for the workshop participants.</p>\n<p>After the workshop, selected authors will be invited to submit<br>\n  full papers for the refereed proceedings, which is expected to be<br>\n  published as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science<br>\n  (Springer Verlag).</p>\n<p>Sponsorship:<br>\n  The workshop takes place under the auspices of IFIP WG 1.3, and is<br>\n  sponsored by IFIP TC1, University of Bremen, and DFKI GmbH. The<br>\n  event is organized by the Computer Science Department of the<br>\n  University of Bremen and the DFKI Bremen group Safe and Secure<br>\n  Cognitive Systems.</p>\n<p>WADT Steering Committee:<br>\n  Michel Bidoit                (France)<br>\n  Andrea Corradini             (Italy)<br>\n  Jos\\'e Fiadeiro              (UK)<br>\n  Rolf Hennicker               (Germany)<br>\n  Hans-J\\\"org Kreowski         (Germany)<br>\n  Till Mossakowski             (Germany) [chair]<br>\n  Fernando Orejas              (Spain)<br>\n  Francesco Parisi-Presicce    (Italy)<br>\n  Andrzej Tarlecki             (Poland)</p>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p>The abstracts accepted for presentation will be available at the<br>\n  workshop.
