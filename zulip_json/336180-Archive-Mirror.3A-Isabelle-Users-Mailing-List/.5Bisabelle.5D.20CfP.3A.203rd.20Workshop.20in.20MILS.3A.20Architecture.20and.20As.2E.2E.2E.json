The MILS architectural<br>\napproach is all about decomposition of a system design into<br>\nwell-understood components and their interactions with the goal to<br>\nachieve composable architecture and composable assurance for the<br>\ndesigned system. The composability of architecture and assurance  for<br>\nsecure systems is a grand challenge, which we undertake to meet using<br>\nthe MILS architectural approach.</p>\n<p>Architecture composition defines a secure system from trustworthy<br>\ncomponents and system architecture. The MILS framework for composable<br>\narchitecture is based on a separation kernel (which has overlapping<br>\nfunctionality with a hypervisor) that creates partitions to separate<br>\ndifferent security domains. Such a separation kernel often needs to<br>\nsupport real-time because there are many use-cases in embedded systems.<br>\nAssurance composition targets creating an assurance argument for the<br>\noverall system from arguments of its components and the system's<br>\nsecurity architecture. The workshop also welcomes contributions on the<br>\nindustrial application of the MILS architecture, assurance and<br>\ncertification frameworks, attack methods and templates for MILS systems,<br>\nas well as presenting the MILS  community.</p>\n<p>Workshop topics:<br>\nThe workshop topics are but not limited to:\n*   MILS architectural approach for security and safety\n*   MILS components and eco-system\n*   MLS systems and their relation to MILS systems\n*   MILS use-cases, e.g. from avionics, automotive, communications,<br>\nindustrial automation, medical, railway, consumer and similar domains.\n*   Real-time separation kernels\n*   MILS evaluation and certification\n*   MILS testing and vulnerability analysis of MILS systems\n*   Application of novel and existing information flow models/policies\n*   Cross-European/world-wide high-assurance security\n*   Formal methods for MILS systems as a basis for high assurance</p>\n<p>Abstract submission:<br>\nThis is a workshop and we are looking for interesting experience, work,<br>\nand ideas (possibly preliminary and exploratory) that will stimulate<br>\ndiscussion and thought around MILS concepts and challenges. At this<br>\nstage, submissions are in the form of abstracts. Submission should<br>\nclearly shows industrial relevance.</p>\n<p>Submissions should be made via Embedded World online portal at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.embedded-world.eu/call-for-papers.html\">http://www.embedded-world.eu/call-for-papers.html</a><br>\nWhen submitting your abstract please choose contribution topic area<br>\n\"8.5 MILS: Architecture and Assurance for Secure and Safe Systems\".<br>\nAbstracts are submitted in plain text and must be 3000 characters max.<br>\n(including white-space).</p>\n<p>Slides/papers:<br>\nIf your abstract is accepted you will be invited to submit a<br>\npaper/slides.
