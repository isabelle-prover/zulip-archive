MILS (multiple independent <br>\nlevels of safety / security) is a software architecture concept <br>\nthat is amenable to formal modelization and verification, hence <br>\nof interest to list members.</p>\n<p>Best, Holger</p>\n<p>=====================================================================<br>\nCALL FOR PAPERS</p>\n<p>4th INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MILS:<br>\nARCHITECTURE AND ASSURANCE FOR SECURE SYSTEMS</p>\n<p>25-28 June 2018<br>\nLuxembourg City, Luxembourg</p>\n<p>The workshop is co-located with the The IEEE/IFIP International<br>\nConference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN <a href=\"https://dsn2018.uni.lu/\">https://dsn2018.uni.lu/</a>)</p>\n<p>=====================================================================<br>\nImportant dates:<br>\nAbstract due:      19 April, 2018<br>\nReviews/decisions: 20 May, 2018<br>\nFinal Paper:       20 June, 2018<br>\nWorkshop:      25-28 June 2018 (exact one day TBC)<br>\n=====================================================================</p>\n<p>QUICK LINKS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>MILS Workshop <a href=\"http://mils-workshop.mils.community/\">http://mils-workshop.mils.community/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Submission <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mils18\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mils18</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>=====================================================================</p>\n<p>Workshop objectives</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The complexity, mission-criticality, and connectivity of the modern<br>\nsystems bring system trustworthiness to the front page. The required<br>\ntrustworthiness shall provide a sufficient assurance for the safety and<br>\nsecurity of the deployed systems. Examples of systems benefiting of,<br>\nemerging, or badly needing it, are aircrafts, cars and autonomous<br>\nvehicles, C2X/C2C, trains, subways, industrial IoT, traffic management<br>\nsystems, ships, satellites, medical devices, handheld devices.</p>\n<p>The \"MILS Workshop\" focuses on bringing industry and research<br>\nstakeholders together to advance methods, tools, approaches, and<br>\nuse-case on creating compositional assurance and trustworthiness for<br>\nsafety, security, and mixed-critical connected systems.</p>\n<p>The assurance can be provided for example by architectural approaches,<br>\ndesign properties, technologies, results of analysis, testing, formal<br>\nverification, artifacts from model-based engineering, standard-based<br>\ncertification approaches, as well as assurance maintenance during the<br>\nsystem life-time.</p>\n<p>More about MILS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>MILS* is a high-assurance security architecture concept based on the<br>\nprinciples of separation and controlled information flow. The MILS<br>\napproach is all about decomposition of a system design into<br>\nwell-understood components and their interactions with the goal to<br>\nachieve composable architecture and composable assurance.</p>\n<p>The composability of architecture and assurance as well as assurance<br>\nmaintenance for safe and secure systems is a grand challenge. The MILS<br>\nworkshop targets exactly this challenge.</p>\n<p>MILS defines a secure system from trustworthy components and system<br>\narchitecture. The MILS framework for composable architecture is based on<br>\na separation kernel (it can have overlapping functionality with a<br>\nhypervisor or a distributed hypervisor) that creates partitions to<br>\nseparate different security domains. Such a separation kernel often<br>\nneeds to support real-time because there are many use-cases in embedded<br>\nsystems. Assurance composition targets creating an assurance argument<br>\nfor the overall system from arguments of its components and the system's<br>\nsecurity architecture.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Historically MILS stands for \"Multiple Independent Levels of Security\"<br>\nand today is considered as a proper noun.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Workshop topics</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The workshop explicitly welcomes contributions on the industrial<br>\napplication of compositional assurance, assurance and certification<br>\nframeworks, attack methods, and templates for MILS systems.</p>\n<p>The workshop topics are, but not limited to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compositional approaches for safety and security architectures</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compositional approaches for safety and security assurance and<br>\ncertification</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Designing and modelling of assurance cases</p>\n</li>\n<li>Application of novel and existing information flow models/policies</li>\n<li>Methods and tools for assurance generation, model-based approaches</li>\n<li>Formal methods as a basis for high assurance</li>\n<li>Gap-less path from implementation to assurance</li>\n<li>Maintenance of compositional assurance</li>\n<li>MILS components and eco-system,</li>\n<li>MLS systems and their relation to MILS systems</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use-cases for compositional design/assurance , e.g. from avionics,<br>\nIMA, automotive, Adaptive Autosar, communications, industrial<br>\nautomation, Industry 4.0, medical, railway, consumer and similar domains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real-time separation kernels</p>\n</li>\n<li>MILS evaluation and certification</li>\n<li>MILS testing and vulnerability analysis of MILS systems</li>\n<li>Cross-European/world-wide high-assurance security</li>\n<li>Comparison MILS approach to other software engineering approaches and<br>\nconcepts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>=====================================================================<br>\nSlides/papers:<br>\nIf your abstract is accepted you will be invited to submit a<br>\npaper/slides.
