It is one of the first areas to which <br>\nArtificial<br>\nIntelligence (AI) was applied and has remained the focus of much work in the<br>\nfield, giving rise to new mathematical concepts and techniques, heuristics,<br>\nalgorithms, and applications over the past fifty years. In view of the <br>\nimportance<br>\nof geometry and the sustained advances in the field of computer-based <br>\ngeometric<br>\nreasoning and its applications, the time seems ripe to take stock of the <br>\nprogress<br>\nso far and look at some of the latest mathematical and AI-related <br>\nadvances in<br>\nthe field. Thus, we invite original contributions -- ranging from theory to<br>\nimplementations and applications -- and insightful surveys to a special <br>\nissue of<br>\nthe Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence on Geometric <br>\nReasoning.</p>\n<p>Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Automated and interactive theorem proving in geometry involving algebraic,<br>\n   logical, and/or probabilistic approaches.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Symbolic and numerical methods for geometric computation and constraint<br>\n   solving.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The formal verification of geometric algorithms, for instance in <br>\nrelation to<br>\n   computational geometry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reasoning and manipulation via diagrams, including approaches based on <br>\ndynamic<br>\n   geometry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The design, implementation, and evaluation of software for geometric <br>\nreasoning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Knowledge management and libraries of test problems for theorem proving in<br>\n   geometry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The applications to geometric modelling, CAGD/CAD, computer vision, <br>\nrobotics,<br>\n   and education.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<p>Prospective authors should follow the instructions set out by the Annals of<br>\nMathematics and Artificial Intelligence on its webpage<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10472\">http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10472</a>) and submit their <br>\narticles<br>\nthrough Springer's Editorial Manager System (at <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.editorialmanager.com/amai\">https://www.editorialmanager.com/amai</a>)<br>\nby the deadline indicated below.</p>\n<p>Please note that the guest editors will first carry a quick assessment <br>\nof each<br>\nsubmission and only papers that are deemed relevant to the special issue <br>\nand are<br>\nof high enough quality will be forwarded to at least two referees for full,<br>\nindependent reviews.</p>\n<p>Important dates</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submissions due: December 31, 2013</li>\n<li>First-round acceptance notification: March  31, 2014</li>\n<li>Revised versions due: April 30, 2014</li>\n<li>Final decision: June 30, 2014</li>\n<li>Final papers due: August 31, 2014</li>\n<li>Publication date: 2014 (To be confirmed)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Special Issue Editors</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jacques Fleuriot (University of Edinburgh, UK)</li>\n<li>Tetsuo Ida (University of Tsukuba, Japan)</li>\n</ul>",
