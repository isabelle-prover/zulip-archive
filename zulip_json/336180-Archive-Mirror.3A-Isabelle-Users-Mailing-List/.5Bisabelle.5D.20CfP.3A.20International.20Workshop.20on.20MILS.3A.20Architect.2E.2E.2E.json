The MILS architectural<br>\napproach is all about decomposition of a system design into<br>\nwell-understood components and their interactions with the goal to<br>\nachieve composable security and composable assurance for the designed<br>\nsystem.</p>\n<p>The security and assurance composability is a grand challenge which we<br>\nundertake to meet using the MILS architectural approach.</p>\n<p>Security composition seeks to define a secure system from trustworthy<br>\ncomponents and system architecture. The framework for composable<br>\nsecurity is a separation kernel (which has overlapping functionality<br>\nwith a hypervisor) that creates partitions to separate different<br>\nsecurity domains. Such a separation kernel often needs to support<br>\nreal-time because there are many use-cases in embedded systems.</p>\n<p>An assurance composition targets creating assurance argument for the<br>\noverall system from arguments of its components and system's security<br>\narchitecture. We selected Common Criteria to define such a composable<br>\nassurance framework for MILS system. Amongst others, at the workshop a<br>\nMILS System Protection Profile draft for a MILS separation kernel will<br>\nbe presented and discussed.</p>\n<p>The workshop topics are but not limited to:</p>\n<p>MILS architectural approach for security and safety<br>\nMILS components and eco-system<br>\nMILS use-cases, e.g. from avionics, automotive, communications,<br>\nindustrial automation, medical, railway, consumer and similar domains.<br>\nReal-time separation kernels<br>\nMILS certification<br>\nMILS testing and vulnerability analysis of MILS systems<br>\nCross-European/world-wide high-assurance security<br>\nFormal methods for MILS systems as a basis for high assurance</p>\n<p>Paper/Presentation submission</p>\n<p>Submissions do not need to be full papers: this is a workshop and we are<br>\nlooking for interesting experience, work, and ideas (possibly<br>\npreliminary and exploratory) that will stimulate discussion and thought.<br>\nSubmissions should be in PDF format between 3-12 pages.<br>\nWe recommend the guidelines for ACM SIG Proceedings.</p>\n<p>Electronic Submissions</p>\n<p>The submissions page at Easychair is open:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mils15\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mils15</a></p>\n<p>Organiser</p>\n<p>Sergey Tverdyshev, SYSGO AG, Germany<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:sergey.tverdyshev@sysgo.com\">sergey.tverdyshev@sysgo.com</a></p>\n<p>FP7 EURO-MILS project<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.euromils.eu\">http://www.euromils.eu</a></p>\n<p>Workshop committee</p>\n<p>Romain Bergé, ITSEF Thales, France<br>\nIgor Furgel, ITSEF T-Systems, Germany<br>\nKevin Müller, Airbus Group Innovations, Germany<br>\nMichael Paulitsch, Thales, Austria<br>\nJoseph Bergmann, The Open Group, UK<br>\nRance DeLong, The Open Group, UK<br>\nHarald Rueß, Fortiss, Germany<br>\nAndreas Lindinger, Continental Corporation, Germany<br>\nSergey Tverdyshev, SYSGO, Germany</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Historically MILS stands for \"Multiple Independent Levels of<br>\nSecurity\"? and today is considered as a proper noun.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>best,</p>",
