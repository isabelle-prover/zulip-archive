Mathematical communication has not been at rest with the<br>\nmany standards and tools around. User-interfaces that encompass these<br>\ncommunications are most diverse but their user-side is crucial for the<br>\ncommunication to happen well. The MathUI workshop proposes a place of<br>\nexchange and presentation for investigations in mathematical<br>\nuser-interfaces, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>presentation and manipulations mathematical knowledge</li>\n<li>workflows induced by mathematical knowledge representations</li>\n<li>interactions in the communication of mathematical content</li>\n<li>user studies with MKM tools or other mathematical interfaces</li>\n<li>novel, original or downright funky interfaces to mathematics software</li>\n<li>interactive mathematics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>We are seeking submissions of either papers on and/or demonstrations<br>\nof user interfaces for mathematics. Videos, prototypes, mock ups and<br>\nany other sort of demonstration are welcome!  Proceedings will be  <br>\nonline.<br>\nSubmission format: article of 3-8 (printed) pages, in HTML or PDF<br>\nformat, which may include other electronic presentations such as videos<br>\nor animations complemented by an abstract of less than 150 words.</p>\n<p>DATES:</p>\n<p>Either submit a paper by email until May 31st 2007,<br>\nor submit an abstract on May 20th 2007 and a paper on June 7th.<br>\nExpect an answer on June 25th 2007.<br>\nEnjoy the workshop on July 27th</p>\n<p>ON THE DAY</p>\n<p>We will have a mix of talks and demos followed by a demonstration<br>\nsession when we will get a chance to look and interact more closely<br>\nwith people's work.</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>(to be confirmed):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>David Aspinall,  University of Edinburgh, Scotland</li>\n<li>Paul Cairns, University of York, Great Britain</li>\n<li>Olga Caprotti, University of Helsinki, Finland</li>\n<li>Anthony Jameson, DFKI GmbH and International University, Germany</li>\n<li>Norbert Kajler, École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris, France</li>\n<li>Paul Libbrecht (organizer),DFKI GmbH, Saarbruecken, Germany</li>\n<li>Robert Miner, Design Science Inc., Long Beach, California, USA</li>\n<li>Elena Smirnova, Texas Instruments Inc.
