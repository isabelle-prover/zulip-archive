From 2010 its importance has increased in that OpenMath<br>\nContent Dictionaries were adopted as a foundation of the MathML 3 W3C<br>\nrecommendation (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML\">http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML</a>), the standard for<br>\nmathematical formulae on the Web.</p>\n<p>Topics we expect to see at the workshop include</p>\n<p>* Feature Requests (Standard Enhancement Proposals) and Discussions<br>\n     for going beyond OpenMath 2;</p>\n<p>* Further convergence of OpenMath and MathML 3;<br>\n   * Reasoning with OpenMath;<br>\n   * Software using or processing OpenMath;<br>\n   * OpenMath on the Semantic Web;<br>\n   * New OpenMath Content Dictionaries;</p>\n<p>Contributions can be either full research papers, Standard Enhancement<br>\nProposals, or a description of new Content Dictionaries, particularly<br>\nones that are suggested for formal adoption by the OpenMath Society.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES (all times are \"anywhere on earth\")</p>\n<p>* 7 June: Submission<br>\n   * 20 June: Notification of acceptance or rejection<br>\n   * 5 July: Final revised papers due<br>\n   * 10 July: Workshop</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>Submission is via EasyChair<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=om20131\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=om20131</a>).
