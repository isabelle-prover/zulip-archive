Now postproceedings are planned to collect the contributions<br>\n  upgraded to full papers. The contributions' topics are diverse<br>\n  according to ThEdu's scope, and this is a call open for everyone, also<br>\n  those who did not participate in the workshop. All papers will undergo<br>\n  review according to EPTCS standards.</p>\n<p>THedu'18 Scope:</p>\n<p>Computer Theorem Proving is becoming a paradigm as well as a<br>\n  technological base for a new generation of educational software in<br>\n  science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The workshop brings<br>\n  together experts in automated deduction with experts in education in<br>\n  order to further clarify the shape of the new software generation and<br>\n  to discuss existing systems.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>methods of automated deduction applied to checking students' input;</li>\n<li>\n<p>methods of automated deduction applied to prove post-conditions<br>\n   for particular problem solutions;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>combinations of deduction and computation enabling systems<br>\n   to propose next steps;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>automated provers specific for dynamic geometry systems;</p>\n</li>\n<li>proof and proving in mathematics education.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2nd call for papers:        10 Sep 2018</li>\n<li>Submission (full papers):   18 Nov 2018</li>\n<li>Notification of acceptance: 17 Dec 2018</li>\n<li>Revised papers due:         21 Jan 2019</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<p>We welcome submission of papers presenting original unpublished work<br>\n  which is not been submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The authors should comply with the \"instructions for authors\", LaTeX<br>\n  style files and accept the \"Non-exclusive license to distribute\" of<br>\n  EPTCS:<br>\n    Instructions for authors (<a href=\"http://info.eptcs.org/\">http://info.eptcs.org/</a>)<br>\n    LaTeX style file, formatting instructions (<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org/\">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>)<br>\n    Copyright (<a href=\"http://copyright.eptcs.org/\">http://copyright.eptcs.org/</a>)</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted via easychair,<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu18\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu18</a>.</p>\n<p>In case the contributions finally do not reach the standards of EPTCS<br>\n  in number, there will be an alternative to publish as a techreport<br>\n  at CISUC <a href=\"https://www.cisuc.uc.pt/publications\">https://www.cisuc.uc.pt/publications</a>.</p>\n<p>Program Committee<br>\n  Francisco Botana, University of Vigo at Pontevedra, Spain<br>\n  Roman Ha≈°ek, University of South Bohemia, Czech Republic<br>\n  Filip Maric, University of Belgrade, Serbia<br>\n  Walther Neuper, Graz University of Technology, Austria (co-chair)<br>\n  Pavel Pech, University of South Bohemia, Czech Republic<br>\n  Pedro Quaresma, University of Coimbra, Portugal (co-chair)<br>\n  Vanda Santos, CISUC, Portugal<br>\n  Wolfgang Schreiner, Johannes Kepler University, Austria</p>",
