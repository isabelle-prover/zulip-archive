PAAR will be associated with the 7th<br>\nInternational Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning, IJCAR'14 and it<br>\nwill be part of the Vienna Summer of Logic 2014.</p>\n<p>Scope </p>\n<hr>\n<p>PAAR provides a forum for developers of automated reasoning tools to<br>\ndiscuss and compare different implementation techniques, and for users<br>\nto discuss and communicate their applications and requirements. The<br>\nworkshop will bring together different groups to concentrate on<br>\npractical aspects of the implementation and application of automated<br>\nreasoning tools. It will allow researchers to present their work in<br>\nprogress, and to discuss new implementation techniques and<br>\napplications.</p>\n<p>Topics include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>automated reasoning in propositional, first-order, higher-order and<br>\n non-classical logics; </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>implementation of provers (SAT, SMT, resolution, tableau,<br>\n instantiation-based, rewriting, logical frameworks, etc); </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>automated reasoning tools for all kinds of practical problems and<br>\n applications; </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>pragmatics of automated reasoning within proof assistants;</p>\n</li>\n<li>practical experiences, usability aspects, feasibility studies;</li>\n<li>\n<p>evaluation of implementation techniques and automated reasoning<br>\n tools; </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>performance aspects, benchmarking approaches;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>non-standard approaches to automated reasoning, non-standard forms<br>\n of automated reasoning, new applications; </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>implementation techniques, optimisation techniques, strategies and<br>\n heuristics, fairness; </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>support tools for prover development;</p>\n</li>\n<li>system descriptions and demos. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are particularly interested in contributions that help the<br>\ncommunity to understand how to build useful reasoning systems in<br>\npractice, and how to apply existing systems to real problems.</p>\n<p>Paper Submissions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit a short<br>\nabstract of up to 10 pages via EasyChair at<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=paar2014\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=paar2014</a>. Submissions will<br>\nbe refereed by the program committee, which will select a balanced<br>\nprogram of high-quality contributions.</p>\n<p>Submissions should be prepared in LaTeX using the EasyChair<br>\nproceedings style.
