Hughes\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:jfh@cs.brown.edu\">jfh@cs.brown.edu</a>&gt;<br>\nI'd like to be able to do the kind of thing done in most abstract algebra<br>\ntexts when they're introducing groups, namely, say something like \"the<br>\nintegers, with negation and addition, and 0 as the identity element,<br>\nconstitute a group, indeed, an abelian group.\" That's a tiny theorem,<br>\nright? We have to show that there is an identity (easy), that there are<br>\ninverses (again easy), that addition is associative (follows from<br>\nproperties of the integers), and commutative (also easy). So it's easy, but<br>\nit's also something to be proved.</p>\n<p>A little harder is showing that {Z, O, T} , a set of three distinct<br>\nelements (named to remind us of \"zero, one, two\", together with an<br>\n\"inverse\" function (inv(Z) = Z, inv(O) = T, inv (T) = O) and a \"mul\"<br>\nfunction (which I won't write out, but it corresponds to addition mod 3) is<br>\nactually an abelian group. The only real messiness is in proving<br>\nassociativity of the \"multiplication\" operation, for which we can no longer<br>\nrely on properties of the integers.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to state or prove either of these small theorems using, say,<br>\nthe HOL/Groups.thy as a starting point?</p>\n<p>[My real interest is in showing that certain things are projective<br>\ngeometries, but the methods should be very similar, I hope.]</p>\n<p>--John</p>",
