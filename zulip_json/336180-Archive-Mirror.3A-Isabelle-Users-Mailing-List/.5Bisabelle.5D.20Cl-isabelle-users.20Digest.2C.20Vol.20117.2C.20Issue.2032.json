My doctorate is in mathematics, and we <br>\ngot a very thorough lecture on countability (it might have been from <br>\nLeon Henkin). If by a chain you mean a sequence, so a countable set <br>\nof countable sets, then yes, that is countable. For example, the set <br>\nof all ordered pairs of natural numbers, (x, y), is the (countable) <br>\nunion of the sets of all such ordered pairs for fixed x and arbitrary <br>\ny, each one of which is countable. But you can set up an enumeration <br>\n(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 2), (3, 0), (2, 1), (1, <br>\n2), (0, 3), etc.<br>\nI'm not sure that there actually is a least uncountable ordinal <br>\nnumber. In fact, when I was at that lecture, it wasn't known, at that <br>\ntime, whether there were any ordinals between aleph-0 and aleph-1. <br>\nSince then I believe that that question has been shown to be <br>\nunprovable, one way or the other.<br>\nPart of the confusion here, I think is that, on the one hand, every <br>\nset can be well-ordered, but, on the other hand <br>\n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-order\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-order</a>), \"it is possible to show <br>\nthat the ZFC+GCH axioms alone are not sufficient to prove the <br>\nexistence of a definable (by a formula) well-order of the reals (S. <br>\nFeferman: \"Some Applications of the Notions of Forcing and Generic <br>\nSets\", Fundamenta Mathematicae, 56 (1964) 325-345)\".</p>",
