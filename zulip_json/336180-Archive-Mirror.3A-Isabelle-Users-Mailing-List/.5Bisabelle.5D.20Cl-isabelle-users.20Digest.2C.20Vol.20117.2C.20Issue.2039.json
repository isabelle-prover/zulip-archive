I see the problem now. The problem is that at one point I <br>\nwas told that,  &gt;&gt;&gt; when searching Isabelle/Isar documentation for <br>\nsomething including an      &gt;&gt;&gt; underscore, I have to substitute a <br>\nhyphen. Now I find that this is sometimes &gt;&gt;&gt; true and sometimes <br>\nnot. For \"Isabelle/HOL -- Higher-Order Logic,\" it is true; &gt;&gt;&gt; for <br>\n\"Isabelle/Isar Reference Manual,\" it's apparently not true. I was <br>\nsearching for case-names when I should have been searching for <br>\ncase_names.  &gt;&gt; PDF is electronic paper, with some uncertainty of <br>\nreal paper. Some PDF viewers &gt;&gt; also use OCR to find things, but you <br>\nnever know 100% what it is.             &gt;&gt; To make really sure, you <br>\ncan always search the formal sources in<br>\n$ISABELLE_HOME/src/Doc/Isar_Ref/.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Talking about source files I was referring to the default Isabelle <br>\nsource editor,<br>\nwhich is Isabelle/jEdit.  The above $ISABELLE_HOME/src/Doc/Isar_Ref works<br>\nliterally in its file-dialog, even on Windows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Makarius</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I search the PDF file \"Isabelle/Isar Reference Manual,\" it <br>\nsearches the whole manual, which is what I want. I want to see <br>\nwhether certain terms appear <em>anywhere</em> in that manual (sometimes <br>\nthey don't). When I bring up $ISABELLE_HOME/src/Doc/Isar_Ref in the <br>\nfile-dialog of Isabelle/jEdit, I don't get a file which is the whole <br>\nmanual. Instead I get 16 files, from Base.thy through Synopsis.thy . <br>\nTo do my search, it would seem that I have to search each one of <br>\nthese separately, and that appears tedious. The same problem happens <br>\nwhen I try to search \"Isabelle/HOL -- Higher-Order Logic.\" I can <br>\nsearch the PDF file to see whether a term appears there anywhere; but <br>\nsearching the formal sources would seem to involve several dozen <br>\nfiles separately. Is there, anywhere, a single formal source for all <br>\nof \"Isabelle/Isar Reference Manual,\" and/or a single formal source <br>\nfor all of \"Isabelle/HOL -- Higher-Order Logic\"?
