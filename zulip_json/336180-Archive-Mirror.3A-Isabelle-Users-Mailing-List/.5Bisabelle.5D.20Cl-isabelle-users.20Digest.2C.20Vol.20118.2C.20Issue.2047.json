Would you please put the above two <br>\nlines into Isabelle2015 (but call it some name other than aux -- <br>\nperhaps setsum_atLeastAtMost_int or something like that)? For now I'm <br>\ngoing to ask my students to include these two lines without their <br>\neven trying to understand what they mean. But when I update my <br>\nwrite-up to cover Isabelle2015, and they start using that, I will <br>\nwant them to treat this as built in to the system. This will give <br>\nthem a much better handle on proofs by induction (of the kind that <br>\nthey meet in a discrete mathematics course) than they have ever had <br>\nbefore. Many thanks! -WDMaurer</p>",
