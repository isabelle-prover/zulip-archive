It intends to cover all work aiming to explore<br>\ncomputational aspects of classical logic and mathematics.</p>\n<p>The fact that classical mathematical proofs of simply existential<br>\nstatements can be read as programs was established by Goedel and<br>\nKreisel half a century ago.  But the possibility of extracting useful<br>\ncomputational content from classical proofs was taken seriously only<br>\nfrom the 1990s on when it was discovered that proof interpretations<br>\nbased on Goedel's and Kreisel's ideas can provide new nontrivial<br>\nalgorithms and numerical results, and the Curry-Howard correspondence<br>\ncan be extended to classical logic via programming concepts such as<br>\ncontinuations and control operators.</p>\n<p>SCOPE</p>\n<p>This workshop aims to support a fruitful exchange of ideas between the<br>\nvarious lines of research on Classical Logic and Computation.<br>\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to,</p>\n<p>- version of lambda calculi adapted to represent classical logic,<br>\n    - design of programming languages inspired by classical logic,<br>\n    - cut-elimination for classical systems,<br>\n    - proof representation and proof search for classical logic,<br>\n    - translations of classical to intuitionistic proofs,<br>\n    - constructive interpretation of non-constructive principles,<br>\n    - witness extraction from classical proofs,<br>\n    - constructive semantics for classical logic (e.g. game semantics),<br>\n    - case studies (for any of the previous points).</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION</p>\n<p>This is intended to be an informal workshop. Participants are<br>\nencouraged to present work in progress, overviews of more extensive<br>\nwork, and programmatic/position papers, as well as completed<br>\nprojects. We therefore ask for submission both of short abstracts and<br>\nof longer papers.</p>\n<p>In order to make a submission:</p>\n<p>- Format your file using the LNCS guidelines; there is a 15 page limit.<br>\n    - Use the submission links at <a href=\"http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~svb/CLaC08\">http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~svb/CLaC08</a></p>\n<p>Submissions will be refereed at normal standards. A participants'<br>\nproceedings will be distributed at the workshop. A special issue of a<br>\njournal, associated with the workshop, is being considered. It will<br>\ncontain full versions of selected papers.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<p>Helmut Schwichtenberg        LMU Munich<br>\nStephane Lengrand            LIX Polytechnique</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>Steffen van Bakel            Imperial College London<br>\nUlrich Berger                Swansea, chair<br>\nStefano Berardi              Turin<br>\nPaola Bruscoli               Bath<br>\nThierry Coquand              Chalmers<br>\nFernando Ferreira            Lisbon<br>\nMichel Parigot               Paris VII<br>\nAldo Ursini                  Siena</p>\n<p>CONTACT</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:u.berger@swansea.ac.uk\">u.berger@swansea.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p>Kind regards,<br>\nUlrich Berger</p>",
