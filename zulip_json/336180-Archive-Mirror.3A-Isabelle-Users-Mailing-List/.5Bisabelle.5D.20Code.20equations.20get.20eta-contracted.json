Here is a small artificial example:</p>\n<p>declare [[eta_contract = false]]<br>\nconsts foo :: \"'a ⇒ 'a ⇒ 'a\"<br>\nlemma [code equation]: \"foo x y = foldr (λx y. foo (id x) y) [y] x\" sorry<br>\ncode_thms foo</p>\n<p>Here, code_thms displays foo's code equation as</p>\n<p>foo ?x ?y ≡ foldr (λx. foo (id x)) [?y] ?x</p>\n<p>instead of</p>\n<p>foo ?x ?y = foldr (λx y. foo (id x) y) [?y] ?x</p>\n<p>Why is this contraction happening and can I disable it? My problem with the <br>\neta-contraction is that it prevents subsequent [code_unfold] equations from rewriting the <br>\nexpressions because the equations expect a certain number of arguments. My idea was that <br>\nusers can control the rewriting by the number of arguments they state in the code <br>\nequation, but eta contracting the right-hand sides breaks this.</p>\n<p>Andreas</p>",
