Some wicked program switched a key without notifying me and when I <br>\nnoticed that, 4 months of work had been lost. Now I managed to recover <br>\nmy project without external help and was able to have Columbo <br>\nautomatically verify a program, which computes the first terms of the <br>\nsine. A lot of algebra and reduction technique is involved in the sample <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cococo.de/products/windows/Columbo/sample5.html\">http://www.cococo.de/products/windows/Columbo/sample5.html</a> and I would <br>\nbe grateful for comments and suggestions. Also an older example, the <br>\nsymbolic newton method, has been updated <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cococo.de/products/windows/Columbo/sample4.html\">http://www.cococo.de/products/windows/Columbo/sample4.html</a> .</p>\n<p>Jens<br>\nfrom Ahrensburg, Germany,</p>",
