My summary is that the increments were used to ensure that numbers emitted by different sorts of counter would be kept in disjoint sets.  The later commit, updating the code I looked at, actually ensures this by using odd and even numbers (rather than multiples of 2 and 3).</p>\n<p>Michael</p>\n<p>﻿</p>",

I generally welcome this.</p>\n<p>Poly/ML is a great platform, and it is good to see HOL4 make more use of<br>\nits potential. I also recommend to give up the obsolete Moscow ML<br>\nsupport eventually: this will loosen further brakes.</p>\n<p>When copying around sources, it requires the usual care to avoid odd<br>\nclones and old copies from outdated Isabelle modules. Things are<br>\ngradually changing over the years. For example, just a few days ago, I<br>\nhave again reconsidered old questions about the interaction of<br>\ninterrupts, parallel evaluation and lazy evaluation, although I am still<br>\nnot finished with it. BTW, your Susp module in HOL4 is still for<br>\nsequential programming only, without interrupts.</p>\n<p>There are also subtle side-conditions about the overall ML runtime<br>\nenvironment, e.g. default thread parameters for interrupts, and the<br>\navoidance of certain \"standard\" I/O operations that are not thread-safe.</p>\n<p>The \"implementation\" manual explains some of this from the perspective<br>\nof Isabelle/ML users. If there are questions about the implementation<br>\nand design decisions behind that, it is better done in the proper<br>\ncontext, i.e. the HOL mailing list; or the isabelle-dev mailing list if<br>\nit is about ongoing changes on the Isabelle repository.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
