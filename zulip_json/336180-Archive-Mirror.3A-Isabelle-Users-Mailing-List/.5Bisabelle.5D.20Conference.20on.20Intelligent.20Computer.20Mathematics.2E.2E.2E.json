While<br>\ncomputer algebra, automated deduction, mathematical publishing and<br>\nnovel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,<br>\nwe are now seeing increasing opportunities for synergy among these<br>\nareas. The Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics offers a<br>\nvenue for discussing these areas and their synergy.</p>\n<p>The conference will be organized by Serge Autexier and Michael<br>\nKohlhase at Jacobs University in Bremen and consist of five tracks:</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation (AISC)<br>\n   Co-Chairs: John A. Campbell, Jacques Carette<br>\nCalculemus<br>\n   Chair: Gabriel Dos Reis<br>\nDigital Mathematical Libraries (DML)<br>\n   Chair: Petr Sojka<br>\nMathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)<br>\n   Chair: Makarius Wenzel<br>\nSystems and Projects<br>\n   Chair: Volker Sorge</p>\n<p>The overall programme will be organized by the General Program Chair<br>\nJohan Jeuring.</p>\n<p>Invited talks will be given by:</p>\n<p>Yannis Haralambous, Département Informatique, Télécom Bretagne<br>\nConor McBride, Department of Computer and Information Sciences,<br>\n   University of Strathclyde<br>\nCezar Ionescu, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Work in progress</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Work-in-progress submissions are intended to provide a forum for the<br>\npresentation of original work that is not (yet) in a suitable form for<br>\nsubmission as a full or system description paper. This includes work<br>\nin progress and emerging trends. Their size is not limited, but we<br>\nrecommend 5 - 10 pages.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Important dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission deadline:          6 May 2012<br>\nNotification of acceptance:  27 May 2012<br>\nCamera ready copies due:      3 June 2012<br>\nConference:                9-13 July 2012</p>",
