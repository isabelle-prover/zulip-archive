It is known as \"congruence<br>\nclosure\", because you propagate (nontrivial) equalities up through a<br>\nterm. Isabelle does not do this automatically (although for fixed equational<br>\nlaws it could, with some additional work). However, in your case it is<br>\npossible to circumvent the problem: add conj_commte (commutativity of<br>\n&amp;) as a simp rule to simp or auto. The section on permutative simplification<br>\nin the tutorial explains the details.</p>\n<p>Tobias Nipkow</p>",
