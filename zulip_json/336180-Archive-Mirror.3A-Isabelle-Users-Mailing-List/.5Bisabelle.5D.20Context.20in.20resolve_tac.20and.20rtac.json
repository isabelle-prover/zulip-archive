They date from an era before we had any sort of IDE, and even before any of us realise that common commands can be abbreviated within Emacs. The one and only purpose of rtac, dtac, etc., was for typing fewer characters. Given the pervasive role of contexts now, I would guess that these relics should never be used in new code, and should be gradually removed from existing code.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
