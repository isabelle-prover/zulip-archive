In detail, I have</p>\n<p>abs (f (Suc n) - f n) &lt; c / 2 ^ n</p>\n<p>for some fixed c &gt; 0 and all n, and I'd like to prove that f converges, i.e., the limit <br>\n\"lim f\" exists. What is the best way to prove this?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, f is not monotonically increasing, so I cannot use SUP instead of lim.<br>\nOn ereal, I have not found the lemma convergent_ereal, but that did not get me much <br>\nfurther. So I tried to do a case distinction on whether f is always a real and try to <br>\nprove \"Cauchy (real o f)\". but I have not found many useful lemmas about Cauchy either.<br>\nProbably I can prove everything by using metric_CauchyI, but this looks like a lot of <br>\narithmetic on reals. Is there something more abstract?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
