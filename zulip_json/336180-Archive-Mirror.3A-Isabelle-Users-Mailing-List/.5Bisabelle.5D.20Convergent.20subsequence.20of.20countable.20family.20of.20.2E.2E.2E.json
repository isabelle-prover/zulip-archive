Here, f's first argument is the family index and the <br>\nsecond argument is the sequence index. Then, there should be a subsequence of f that <br>\nconverges pointwise for every family index, i.e., a k :: nat =&gt; nat such that subseq k and <br>\n(%n. f j (k n)) converges for every j. (See, e.g., <a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/a/709495\">https://math.stackexchange.com/a/709495</a> <br>\nfor a proof).</p>\n<p>Is there already somewhere in the Isabelle library a proof of this fact? Or something that <br>\nmakes a short proof? Or do I have to formalise the diagonalisation argument myself?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
