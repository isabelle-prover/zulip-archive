The claim that \"Unlike all other existing proof assistants or <br>\nproof checkers, it is a Hilbert-style system\", has to be relativized, since, <br>\ndepending on how strictly a Hilbert-style system is defined, Metamath may be <br>\nconsidered a Hilbert-style system, too:<br>\n    \"Natural Deduction in the Metamath Proof Explorer (MPE)<br>\n    MPE is fundamentally a Hilbert-style system.\"<br>\n<a href=\"http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/mmnatded.html\">http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/mmnatded.html</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another discovery is Cris Perdue's implementation of a natural deduction <br>\nvariant of Peter B. Andrews' logic Q0 at<br>\n<a href=\"http://prooftoys.org\">prooftoys.org</a><br>\nand<br>\n<a href=\"http://mathtoys.org\">mathtoys.org</a><br>\nAlthough the equation solver is quite strong and impressive, Cris Perdue <br>\nconsiders his implementation as \"work in progress\". Interestingly, it seems as <br>\nif independently in same cases for this variant of Q0 exactly the same design <br>\ndecisions were made as for R0, in particular, the replacement of the turnstile <br>\nby the logical implication, and the corresponding implementation of Rule R'.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n<p>Ken Kubota</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ken Kubota<br>\n<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.4444/100\">http://doi.org/10.4444/100</a></p>",
