Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>My main question is: Is it possible to create new fresh logical<br>\nvariables inside a theory?</p>\n<p>I am trying to model a function F that takes a program as input, and<br>\nproduces a quantified formula.  Each assignment v := e in the program<br>\ncorresponds to a quantifier \\&lt;exists&gt; v ... in the formula, which is<br>\nwhy it is important to be able to create a new (logical) variable<br>\ncorresponding to each program variable to quantify over.</p>\n<p>So, for instance, the program \"v := e; assert v=5\" would produce a<br>\nformula like \\&lt;exists&gt; v. v=e /\\ v=5.  Here, e is a free variable.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to model the function F such that it returns a term of<br>\ntype bool?  If this isn't possible, is there any other way to model<br>\nthis inside of Isabelle?</p>\n<p>Thanks for your help,<br>\nEdward Schwartz</p>",
