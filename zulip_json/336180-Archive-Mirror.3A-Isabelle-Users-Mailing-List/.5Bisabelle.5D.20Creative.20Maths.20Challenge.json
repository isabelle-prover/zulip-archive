To participate in our competition Maths Challenge: Creative Solutions Wanted! individuals, or group of individuals, need to find and explain original ways to solve probability problems and send those solutions to us. It is open to everybody and we offer several prizes to winners.</p>\n<p>This competition is organised as part of our project funded by the EPSRC (EP/R030650/1) 'How to (re)represent it?', which aims to build an AI system that adapts itself to users to give better explanations to problems. With your participation, we hope to get closer to our goal of making computer systems communicate with us in more human-like and accessible ways.</p>\n<p>For more information about the Maths Challenge, please visit: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~gg44/rep2rep/\">http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~gg44/rep2rep/</a></p>\n<p>Please note that the deadline is on 9 December.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or require more information from us, please do not hesitate to contact us: <a href=\"mailto:rep2rep@sussex.ac.uk\">rep2rep@sussex.ac.uk</a> </p>\n<p>If you are interested, please participate, or I would be grateful if you pass on the information to your students and colleagues who may be interested.</p>\n<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>\n<p>Kind regards,<br>\nMateja</p>\n<p>mateja jamnik • univ of cambridge computer laboratory<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:mateja.jamnik@cl.cam.ac.uk\">mateja.jamnik@cl.cam.ac.uk</a> • <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201</a></p>",
