After defining rev and app, and giving a<br>\ncouple of simplification rules, I can prove the following lemma with<br>\ninduct and simp:<br>\n   lemma rev_app_1: \"rev (app xs ys) = app (rev ys) (rev xs)\"<br>\nBut not this one:<br>\n   lemma rev_app_2: \"app (rev ys) (rev xs) = rev (app xs ys)\"</p>\n<p>This seems rather strange to me, because all I've done is flipped the<br>\nequation around. I can understand that reorienting a simplification<br>\nrule will affect the behaviour of simp, but why does reorienting the<br>\ngoal make a difference?</p>\n<p>Code follows at the end of this message.
