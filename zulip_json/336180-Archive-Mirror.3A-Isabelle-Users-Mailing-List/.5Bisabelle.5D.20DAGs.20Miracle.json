So they agreed upon &lt;m&gt; being the origin of all good and evil <br>\nthey encountered. They discussed a lot of details in the neighbourhood <br>\nof &lt;n&gt; and were happy for a while. There was also a minority feeling <br>\nsuppressed by the noise of the masses. They did not dare to stir the <br>\nmajority and went their own way. And they all lived happily ever after?</p>\n<p>Does anybody have a proof for this 'big numbers' riddle?</p>\n<p>Smile,<br>\nJens</p>",
