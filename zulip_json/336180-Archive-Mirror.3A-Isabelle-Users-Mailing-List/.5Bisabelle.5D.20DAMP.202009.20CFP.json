DAMP 2009 is<br>\n   co-located with the ACM SIGPLAN - SIGACT Symposium on Principles of<br>\n   Programming Languages (POPL 2009).</p>\n<p>The   emphasis  will  be   on  functional   and  (constraint-)logic<br>\n   programming, but  any programming language ideas that  aim to raise<br>\n   the  level  of  abstraction  are  welcome.  DAMP  seeks  to  gather<br>\n   together   researchers  in   declarative  approaches   to  parallel<br>\n   programming  and  to foster  cross  fertilization across  different<br>\n   approaches.</p>\n<p>For further information, a CFP flyer, and details on paper<br>\n   submissions, see</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~pls/damp09/\">http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~pls/damp09/</a></p>\n<p>Paper submission deadline is 10th October 2008!</p>",
