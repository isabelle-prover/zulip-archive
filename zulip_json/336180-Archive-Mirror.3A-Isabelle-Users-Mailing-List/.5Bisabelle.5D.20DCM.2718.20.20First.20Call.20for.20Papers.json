The proceedings are produced after the meeting, so that authors can incorporate the workshop feedback in the published papers.</p>\n<p>DCM 2018 will take place in Oxford on July 8, as a one-day satellite event of FLoC 2018, associated to LICS’18. This will be the 12th event in the series since 2005 - see the DCM website (<a href=\"http://dcm-workshop.org.uk/\">http://dcm-workshop.org.uk/</a>) for details of previous events. </p>\n<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include all abstract models of computation and their applications to the development of programming languages and systems. This includes (but is not limited to):</p>\n<p>* Functional calculi: lambda-calculus, pattern-calculi, combinatory logic, term and graph rewriting;<br>\n  * Object calculi;<br>\n  * Interaction-based systems: interaction nets, games, agent and multi-agent systems;<br>\n  * Concurrent models: process calculi, action graphs, distributed systems;<br>\n  * Calculi expressing locality, mobility, and active data;<br>\n  * Quantum computational models;<br>\n  * Biological or chemical models of computation;</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION</p>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit a short paper (max 8 pages). Preliminary proceedings will be available at the workshop. Papers should be written in English, and submitted in PostScript or PDF format, using the EPTCS style files (<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org/\">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>). Submission is through the Easychair website. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dcm2018\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dcm2018</a>.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>\n<p>* Submission deadline:           8 April 2018<br>\n   * Notification:                          15 May 2018<br>\n   * Pre-proceedings version:     27 May 2018<br>\n   * Workshop:                            8 July 2018<br>\n   * Full version of paper:           1 October 2018<br>\n   * Notification:                          1 December 2018<br>\n   * Final versions due:               15 December 2018</p>\n<p>After the workshop authors are invited to submit a full paper taking into account the feedback given at their presentation.
