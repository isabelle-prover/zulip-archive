Because of this, AR methods and tools in the past were<br>\nmostly applied to formulae which were already known to be true. If on<br>\nthe other hand a formula is not a theorem, then most traditional AR<br>\nmethods and tools cannot handle this properly (i.e. they will fail,<br>\nrun out of resources, or simply not terminate).<br>\nThe opposite of proving, which we call disproving, particularly<br>\naims at identifying non-theorems, i.e. showing non-validity<br>\nresp. non-provability, and providing some kind of proof of<br>\nnon-validity (non-provability). The proof for example could be a<br>\ncounter model, or an instantiation making the formula false.</p>\n<p>Scope</p>\n<p>In the scope of the workshop is every method that is able to discover<br>\nnon-theorems and, ideally, provides explanation why the formula is not a<br>\ntheorem. Possible subjects are decision procedures, model generation<br>\nmethods, reduction to SAT, formula simplification methods, abstraction<br>\nbased methods, and failed-proof analysis.</p>\n<p>Topics of relevance to the workshop therefore include</p>\n<p>* disproving conjectures in general,<br>\n   * extending standard proving methods with disproving capabilities,<br>\n   * approximate methods for identifying non-theorems,<br>\n   * counterexample generation,<br>\n   * counter model generation,<br>\n   * finite model generation,<br>\n   * decision procedures,<br>\n   * failure analysis,<br>\n   * reparation of non-theorems,<br>\n   * heuristics that help in identifying non-theorems,<br>\n   * applications and system descriptions.</p>\n<p>Workshop Goal</p>\n<p>The DISPROVING workshops are intended as a platform for the exchange<br>\nof ideas between researchers concerned with disproving in the broad<br>\nsense. By discussing approaches across the different communities, the<br>\nworkshop can identify common problems and solutions. Another goal is to<br>\nelaborate known, and discover unknown, connections between other areas<br>\nand disproving. Also, the meeting can enable an exchange of interesting<br>\nexamples for non-theorems. A long term goal is that the workshop series<br>\ncontributes to forming a disproving community within AR, and gives the<br>\nwork on disproving a greater visibility.</p>\n<p>Audience</p>\n<p>Non-theorems are an issue wherever one tries to prove statements which<br>\nare not known to be valid in advance. Therefore, we aim at researchers<br>\nfrom all areas of automated reasoning. The issue of the workshop is<br>\nparticularly relevant for all logics, calculi, and proving paradigms<br>\nwhere non-validity is not covered by the (plain versions of) standard<br>\nmethods. This includes (but is not restricted to) first-order logic<br>\nproving, inductive theorem proving, rewriting based reasoning,<br>\nhigher-order logic proving, logical frameworks, and special purpose<br>\nlogics like for instance program logics. We also target at the model<br>\ngeneration community.</p>\n<p>Beside mature work, we also solicit preliminary work or work in<br>\nprogress to be presented.</p>\n<p>Technical Programme</p>\n<p>The technical program will include presentations of the accepted<br>\npapers, discussions about the state and future of the field, and two<br>\ninvited talks.</p>\n<p>Programme Committee</p>\n<p>* Wolfgang Ahrendt (Organizer)<br>\n   * Peter Baumgartner (Organizer)<br>\n   * Johan Bos<br>\n   * Simon Colton<br>\n   * Christian Fermüller<br>\n   * Bernhard Gramlich<br>\n   * Bill McCune<br>\n   * Hans de Nivelle (Organizer)<br>\n   * Michael Norrish<br>\n   * Renate Schmidt<br>\n   * Carsten Schürmann<br>\n   * John Slaney<br>\n   * Graham Steel<br>\n   * Cesare Tinelli<br>\n   * Calogero Zarba</p>\n<p>Invited Speaker</p>\n<p>* Silvio Ranise, LORIA/INRIA-Lorraine.<br>\n   * Jian Zhang, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<p>Submissions should not exceed 10 pages.</p>\n<p>Please use the electronic submission page at:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/DISPROVING06/\">www.easychair.org/DISPROVING06/</a><br>\nThe submission procedure is electronic only, and only PDF files are <br>\nacceptable.</p>\n<p>The deadline for submission is 26th of May 2006.</p>\n<p>Publication</p>\n<p>The final versions of the selected contributions will be collected in<br>\na volume to be distributed at the workshop and accessible on the web.</p>\n<p>The organizers aim for properly published 'post-workshop' proceedings, <br>\nprobably<br>\nin the form of a journal special issue. They will be based on extended <br>\nversions<br>\nof selected workshop papers, but open to non-participants, in all cases with<br>\nfresh reviewing.
