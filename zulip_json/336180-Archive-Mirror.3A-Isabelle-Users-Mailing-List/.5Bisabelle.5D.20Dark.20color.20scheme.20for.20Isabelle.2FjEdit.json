For color scheme development, I have a very hacky but very useful<br>\nmacro that tells you why something in the edit pane is the color it is<br>\n(sample output attached). It does need a small addition to the Isabelle<br>\nplugin (since jEdit macros use an ancient version of Java that does not<br>\nclick well with Scala HOFs). Let me know if this interests you.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/mEC1FTgjwqQ4CBL7rRv5R8kf/dark_isabelle_jedit_2017-03-08.png\">dark_isabelle_jedit_2017-03-08.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/MoraArYuvMrxG0UewY57_dBp/properties.gz\">properties.gz</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/g24VnlMLu9WEo9TXjI-V6iUM/preferences.gz\">preferences.gz</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ZAmdU3IBwgCPPQ5dGMaIfk1M/jedit_chunk_info.png\">jedit_chunk_info.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/mEC1FTgjwqQ4CBL7rRv5R8kf/dark_isabelle_jedit_2017-03-08.png\" title=\"dark_isabelle_jedit_2017-03-08.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/mEC1FTgjwqQ4CBL7rRv5R8kf/dark_isabelle_jedit_2017-03-08.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ZAmdU3IBwgCPPQ5dGMaIfk1M/jedit_chunk_info.png\" title=\"jedit_chunk_info.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/ZAmdU3IBwgCPPQ5dGMaIfk1M/jedit_chunk_info.png\"></a></div>",
