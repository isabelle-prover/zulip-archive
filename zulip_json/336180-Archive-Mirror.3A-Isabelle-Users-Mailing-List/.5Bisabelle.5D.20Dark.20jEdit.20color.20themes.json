There are <br>\nthree main sources of information for colors and font-styles:</p>\n<p>* jEdit syntax highlight tables</p>\n<p>* isabelle.css and isabelle-jedit.css from the Isabelle distribution</p>\n<p>* hardwired colors in src/Tools/jEdit/src/isabelle_rendering.scala</p>\n<p>All of this is fine-tuned to make colors coincide with jEdit defaults, <br>\ne.g. the typical Slava Pestov hues of blue in the source buffer and the <br>\noutput window, say of 'print_statement'.</p>\n<p>At some stage I would like to have only css specifications of the theme, <br>\nbut it would then also be in conflict with such third party plugins.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the EditorScheme plugin seems to have its own workarounds <br>\nalready: it \"knows\" about certain other plugins and then modifies their <br>\nrespective properties.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
