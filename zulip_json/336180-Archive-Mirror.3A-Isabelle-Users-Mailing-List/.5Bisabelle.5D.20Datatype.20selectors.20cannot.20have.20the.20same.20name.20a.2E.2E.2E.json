For example,</p>\n<p>datatype 'v foo = Foo (foo: 'v)</p>\n<p>For some reason, this raises a type error claiming that \"foo\" was of type 'v foo rather <br>\nthan \"'v foo =&gt; 'v\". As both before and after the datatype declaration, the name foo is <br>\nnot bound, I guess that the name foo is used somewhere internally in the BNF package. Is <br>\nthat right?</p>\n<p>So I'd like to request the feature that selectors in datatypes may have the same name as <br>\nthe type.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",

The name \"foo\" was used for values of that type, without checking whether the name clashed with discriminators or selectors. I have just pushed a change to testboard.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, this gave me the idea of testing this:</p>\n<p>datatype f = f</p>\n<p>This currently gives a failure, because \"f\" is used internally as well (but at another place than the selectors/discriminators). Hm, and I thought I'd go home early tonight!</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
