We<br>\nare making that extension now.  Thus, the new deadlines are as<br>\nfollows.</p>\n<p>Abstracts submission:   July  7, 2018<br>\nPaper submission:       July 14, 2018</p>\n<p>We do not anticipate any further deadline extensions, since the<br>\nreviewers need time to do their work.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nShilpi Goel and Matt Kaufmann<br>\nCo-chairs, ACL2 2018</p>",
