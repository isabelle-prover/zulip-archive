One of the recognised major difficulties is to make the<br>\nsystems<br>\nsafe, as autonomy requires not only avoidance of misbehaviour but also<br>\nassurance<br>\nof availability and reliability. This fact has been acknowledged both<br>\nwithin the<br>\nacademic society, in the form of an increasing interest in this topic, and<br>\nwithin industry, by generally agreeing that these vehicles adhere to the<br>\nhighest<br>\nlevels of international standards, e.g., SIL3/SIL4 for IEC 61508, and<br>\nASIL D for<br>\nISO 26262. These levels imply the consideration of various formal<br>\nmethods in the<br>\ndevelopment, including static code analysis, model checking, and formal<br>\nspecification and verification.</p>\n<p>However, incorporating formal methods into the design of autonomous vehicles<br>\npresents significant new challenges, particularly due to the complex<br>\nintegration<br>\nof discrete and continuous controllers. The main challenges associated<br>\nwith the<br>\nformal design of autonomous vehicles includes modelling, specification,<br>\nverification and synthesis.</p>\n<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the formal<br>\nverification community that are developing formal methods for autonomous<br>\nvehicles and industrial researchers working, e.g., in the area of<br>\ncontrol theory<br>\nor robotics, interested in applying verification techniques for<br>\ndesigning and<br>\ndeveloping of autonomous vehicles.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest of the workshop include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formal models for autonomous systems</li>\n<li>languages and logics for specification and verification</li>\n<li>interactive and automated theorem proving</li>\n<li>model checking</li>\n<li>agent programming languages</li>\n<li>real-time and hybrid systems</li>\n<li>program synthesis</li>\n<li>quantitative and probabilistic verification</li>\n<li>requirement analysis</li>\n<li>verification for learning approaches</li>\n<li>run-time verification</li>\n<li>applications, implementations and case studies</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission Guideline:</p>\n<p>Accepted papers  will appear in the conference proceedings published in the<br>\nElectronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) and must<br>\nbe prepared according to the EPTCS guidelines for authors (see<br>\n<a href=\"http://info.eptcs.org/\">http://info.eptcs.org/</a>).</p>\n<p>Papers must be original work and not be submitted for publication<br>\nelsewhere.<br>\nPapers must be written in English and submitted electronically (in PDF<br>\nformat)<br>\nusing the EasyChair submission page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fvav2017\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fvav2017</a></p>\n<p>The page limitations mentioned below include all text, figures and<br>\nreferences.<br>\nAt least one author of each accepted paper must attend FVAV 2017 to<br>\npresent.</p>\n<p>There are two categories of papers which can be submitted: regular and<br>\nshort papers.<br>\nPapers in each category will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the<br>\nProgramme<br>\nCommittee.</p>\n<p>* <em>Regular Papers</em> (up to 15 pages, including references) should present<br>\n    original unpublished results.
