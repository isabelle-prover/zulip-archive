With the increasing complexity of today's software<br>\nsystems, FESCA aims at addressing two research questions: (1) what<br>\nrole the software architecture can play in systematic addressing of<br>\nthe analytical and modelling challenges, and (2) how formal and<br>\nsemi-formal techniques can be applied effectively to make the issues<br>\neasier to address automatically, with lower human intervention.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS: We are pleased to announce invited speaker and<br>\ntutorial:</p>\n<p>Dr. Steffen Zschaler, from Software Modelling and Applied Logic Group,<br>\nDepartment of Informatics at King's College London (UK), has agreed to<br>\ndeliver the FESCA 2015 keynote speech on the topic:<br>\n\"Building flexible analysis: Modular formal specification of QoS and<br>\nQoS analysis\"</p>\n<p>and Michael Langhammer, from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,<br>\nhas agreed to deliver tutorial on the topic:<br>\n\"Co-Evolution of Component-based Architecture and Code using Vitruvius\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>We encourage submissions on (semi-)formal techniques and their<br>\napplication that aid analysis, design and implementation of software<br>\napplications, including the techniques in the realm of Model-Driven<br>\nDevelopment.<br>\nIn this context, the topics include (but are not limited to):<br>\n    * Modelling<br>\n        - Modelling formalisms;<br>\n        - Models, metamodels and model transformations;<br>\n    * Correctness checking<br>\n        - Temporal properties and their formal verification;<br>\n        - Interface compliance and contractual use of components;<br>\n    * Correctness of models, metamodels and model transformations<br>\n    * Analysis and prediction of quality attributes<br>\n        - Formal prediction and analysis;<br>\n        - Static and dynamic analysis;<br>\n        - Instrumentation and monitoring approaches;<br>\n    * Industrial case studies and experience reports.</p>\n<p>We encourage not only mature research results, submissions presenting<br>\ninnovative ideas and early results of junior researchers are also of a<br>\nparticular interest.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>Three kinds of submissions are solicited:</p>\n<p>* regular papers (up to 15 pages) presenting original and unpublished<br>\nwork related to the workshop topics,<br>\n    * position papers (up to 10 pages) presenting ideas and directions of<br>\ninteresting ongoing and yet unpublished research related to the<br>\nworkshop topics, and<br>\n    * tool demonstration papers (up to 8 pages) presenting and<br>\nhighlighting the distinguishing features of a topic-related tool<br>\n(co-developed by the authors).</p>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p>*  Final versions of accepted regular, position and tool papers<br>\nwill be published in a volume of the Electronic Proceedings in<br>\nTheoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>*    Paper registration: December 17, 2014<br>\n     *    Submission deadline: December 21, 2014<br>\n     *    Notification of acceptance: January 26, 2015<br>\n     *    Final versions due: February 16, 2015<br>\n     *    Workshop date:  April 12, 2015</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE (tentative)</p>\n<p>* Premysl Brada (University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, Czech Republic)<br>\n     * Ivana Cerna (Masaryk University, Czech Republic)<br>\n     * Yanja Dajsuren (Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands)<br>\n     * Antinisca Di Marco (Universita dell'Aquila, Italy)<br>\n     * Petr Hnetynka (Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic)<br>\n     * Samuel Kounev (Universitat Wuerzburg, Germany)<br>\n     * Ralf Kuesters (Universitat Trier, Germany)<br>\n     * Markus Lumpe (Swinburne University of Technology, Australia)<br>\n     * Daniel Menasche (UFRJ, Brazil)<br>\n     * Raffaela Mirandola (Politecnico di Milano, Italy)<br>\n     * Dorina Petriu (Carleton Univesity, USA)<br>\n     * Nadia Polikarpova (ETH Zuerich, Switzerland)<br>\n     * Ralf Reussner (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany)<br>\n     * Cristina Seceleanu (Malardalen University, Sweden)<br>\n     * Catia Trubiani (Gran Sasso Science Institute, Italy)<br>\n     * Steffen Zschaler (King's College London, UK)</p>\n<p>PC CO-CHAIRS</p>\n<p>*     Barbora Buhnova (Masaryk University, Czech Republic)<br>\n     *     Lucia Happe (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany)<br>\n     *     Jan Kofron (Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic)</p>",
