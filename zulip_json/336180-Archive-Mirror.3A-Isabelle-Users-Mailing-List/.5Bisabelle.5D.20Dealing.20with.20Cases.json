In particular, I have <br>\nread about this thing called split, and it sort of makes senses, but I <br>\nhave not been able to use it very well.  In some specific cases I have <br>\nbeen able to use the cases method quite well. Here is a simple one that <br>\nkind of has me stumped though, how do I show this?</p>\n<p>(case X of Blah x y =&gt; f x y)<br>\n= f (case X of Blah x y =&gt; x) (case X of Blah x y =&gt; y)</p>\n<p>I guess that I am not sure how cases work under the hood, so I am not <br>\nsure how I would go about handling this, as splitting twice does not seem <br>\nto quite work the way that I want.</p>",
