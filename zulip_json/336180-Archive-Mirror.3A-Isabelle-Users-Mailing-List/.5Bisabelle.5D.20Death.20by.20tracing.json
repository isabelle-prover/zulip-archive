Thanks.</p>\n<p>Well, I now understand that it makes sense that no more than 1000 <br>\ntracing messages are output, but is it also intended behaviour that I <br>\nnever actually get any result in ML, i.e. that too much tracing seems to <br>\nstop evaluation?</p>\n<p>I noticed this problem when I proved 1024 theorems with the <br>\n‘approximation’ method, which outputs one line of tracing information <br>\nevery time.
