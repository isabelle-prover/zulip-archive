Can someone explain to me<br>\nwhy this might not be so?</p>\n<p>I'm quite happy with the notion that it might not be known to Isabelle<br>\nwhether \"incid P l\" is True or False, and indeed, perhaps in some situation<br>\nwhere \"incid\" is described or characterized peculiarly, it might not be<br>\npossible for Isabelle to determine which of the two values it takes ---<br>\nexactly what Isabelle can compute is still baffling to me. But it seems to<br>\nme that if Isabelle is in fact modeling mathematical functions, then \"incid<br>\nP l\" is either True or False, in which case its negation is either False or<br>\nTrue respectively, hence the disjucntion is always True, and this needn't<br>\nbe an additional axiom. So I'm a little bit mystified.</p>\n<p>--John</p>",

My guess would be that the author comes from<br>\nthe word of constructive type theory (e.g. Coq); the comment about<br>\n\"decidability\" of incidence certainly seems to suggest that. In a system<br>\nlike Coq, the statement \"P x ∨ ¬P x\" is not necessarily true for all P<br>\nand if it is true, it means that P is a decidable predicate.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that the style of this AFP entry is a bit unidiomatic for<br>\nIsabelle/HOL.</p>\n<p>(Disclaimer: I don't actually know very much about Coq and constructive<br>\ntype theory.
