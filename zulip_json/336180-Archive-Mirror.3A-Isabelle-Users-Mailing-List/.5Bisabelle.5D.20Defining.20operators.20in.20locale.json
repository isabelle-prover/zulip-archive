E.g.,</p>\n<p>locale A =<br>\nfixes approx :: \"['a,'a] =&gt; bool\" (infixl \"~~\" 50)<br>\nassumes \"(f::real=&gt;real) ~~ g\"</p>\n<p>fails type unification. But if I had</p>\n<p>consts<br>\napprox :: \"['a,'a] =&gt; bool\" (infixl \"~~\" 50)</p>\n<p>then it goes through fine. It seems when it's defined inside a locale, the<br>\ntype variables can't be instantiated, i.e. \"'a\" can't be instantiated to<br>\n\"real\" so it'd have to be \"(f::'a) ~~ g\". If so, why's that?</p>\n<p>Thanks again!</p>",
