I find the definition of \"Max = foldl max\" strange anyway, as there is no base-case argument for foldl.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And Makarius answered:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that it is fold1 (fold-one).  It is intended for non-empty finite sets.  So it will do the right thing under that assumption.  Otherwise it is also defined, but it might produce non-sense, or we just don't know about what it produces. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@Makarius: Thanks for pointing out the difference between \"one\" and<br>\n\"ell\".  These looked to similar in my font.</p>\n<p>I don't fully understand the definition of fold1, but I'm happy to<br>\nbelieve that it works :-)</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Christoph</p>",
