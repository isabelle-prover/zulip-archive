Then u is included in signal set. The next step I have to<br>\ndefine a set of signals. So I have problem with proving that x ∈ u and also<br>\nu∈ set_of_signals. I tried many lemmas as below:</p>\n<p>definition signal  :: \"_\"<br>\nwhere signal_def : \"signal T R   = {u| u. ∀t∈T. ∃!x∈R. (t,x)∈ u }\"</p>\n<p>definition sos :: \"_\"<br>\n where  \"sos T R = {u | u. u ∈ signal T R }\"</p>\n<p>lemma subset_u: \"u ∈ signal T R \" unfolding signal_def by blast</p>\n<p>Its proved but I think there is problem with using blast as it highlight in<br>\npurple!</p>\n<p>also I tried this, but it doesn't work:</p>\n<p>lemma bb:<br>\nassumes a: \"signal T R   = {u| u. ∀t∈T. ∃!x∈R. (t,x)∈ u }\"<br>\nand \"T={t∈ℝ . (∀t. 0≤t ∧ t&lt;∞ )}\"<br>\nshows   \"u ⊆ signal T R \"<br>\nproof<br>\nfix x<br>\nassume n:\"x∈u\"<br>\nshow \"x∈signal T R \"<br>\nproof<br>\nfrom n have ?thesis by(simp add: signal_def)</p>\n<p>so does the upper statement correct or I have to use something else?</p>\n<p>regards<br>\nOmar</p>",
