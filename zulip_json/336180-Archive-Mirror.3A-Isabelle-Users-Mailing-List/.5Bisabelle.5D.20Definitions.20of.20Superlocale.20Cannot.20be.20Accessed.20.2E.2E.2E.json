        "content": "<p>From: Julian Brunner &lt;<a href=\"mailto:julianbrunner@gmail.com\">julianbrunner@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>\nDear all,</p>\n<p>I recently stumbled upon the following behavior in Isabelle which I<br>\nfind surprising and which affects me negatively. In the attached<br>\ntheory, the locale \"bar\" is interpreted as \"baz\", using a 'for' clause<br>\nto retain the parameter \"x\" of the superlocale \"foo\". When declaring<br>\nanother sublocale \"test\" of \"foo\", it is now impossible to use the<br>\ndefinitions made in \"foo\" in the assumptions of \"test\". However, it is<br>\npossible to use the definitions made in \"foo\" in the body of \"test\".</p>\n<p>My guess is that this has something to do with the fact that the<br>\nlocale \"foo\" is already interpreted in its most general form as part<br>\nof \"baz\", so the constants do not get interpreted again when declaring<br>\n\"test\" can and only be accessed using the prefix \"baz\" (although the<br>\nparameter \"x\" is not yet applied there). However, I do not understand<br>\nwhy they can be accessed in the body of the locale \"test\", but not<br>\nwhile declaring its assumptions.</p>\n<p>What's happening here and how can I access these definitions in the<br>\nassumptions without using the locale prefix and reapplying all the<br>\nparameters?</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\n Julian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/t1LR17V-xbTc4LSid6-AL_D8/DefAssumption.thy\">DefAssumption.thy</a></p>",
