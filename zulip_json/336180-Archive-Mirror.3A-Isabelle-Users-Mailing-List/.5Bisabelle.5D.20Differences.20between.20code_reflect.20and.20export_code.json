However, from my experience, <br>\ncode_reflect is always used to make the code generation process static. <br>\nThat is, when we are building a decision procedure based on <br>\nreflection/code generation, we really don't want the code generation <br>\nprocess to happen every time the decision procedure is called, instead <br>\nwhat we should expect is that the code is generated only once and <br>\nexecuted directly when needed. In this case, the file option is not used <br>\nquite often.</p>\n<p>In short, I believe code_reflect and export_code should be almost the <br>\nsame with the file option, but in general they serve different purposes.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nWenda</p>",
