Now, implementing some functionality that would<br>\nautomatically hide the notification in such cases probably wouldn't make<br>\nsense, as the \"fastest\" proof method depends a lot on the context<br>\n(characteristics of my machine, cache, etc., I guess), and as there is<br>\nnot always a unique fastest method.</p>\n<p>However, I would really find it useful if there were a way of manually<br>\nand selectively suppressing such notifications, or actually locally<br>\ndisabling automation.  That is, I would generally like to see them, but<br>\nwhen I think that lemma foo above already has the best possible proof, I<br>\ndon't want a blue (i) to grab my attention.  I would only want to see<br>\nthis notification on proof steps I have not yet reviewed.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Christoph</p>",
