However, to avoid work in<br>\nparallel, I would like to ask whether somebody out there is working in<br>\nthat direction or has some related stuff in the drawer.</p>\n<p>Any feedback welcome,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/In65hqyvMzPyPDnpiU1RJ7Z9/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",

There is also a simple part about forward differentiation and<br>\nthose operators you need for discrete summation. Basic stuff, no<br>\nhypergeometric summation and the like. Of course in the drawer... I'll<br>\nsend it over.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Amine.</p>\n<p>Florian Haftmann wrote:</p>",
