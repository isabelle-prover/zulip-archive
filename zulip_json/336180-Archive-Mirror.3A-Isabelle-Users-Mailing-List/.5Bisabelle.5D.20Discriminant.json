I'm <br>\ninclined to think that it might be easier for me to prove the <br>\nresults about real quadratics from scratch, by completing the <br>\nsquare.</p>\n<p>I don't expect I'll immediately need any more general results <br>\nabout discriminants of polynomials of higher degree, but (of <br>\ncourse) I'd be happy to use general results if someone's already <br>\nproven them.</p>\n<p>Tim<br>\n&lt;&gt;&lt;<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/OcoSp_ifsSDY-dyexQlMXKar/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
