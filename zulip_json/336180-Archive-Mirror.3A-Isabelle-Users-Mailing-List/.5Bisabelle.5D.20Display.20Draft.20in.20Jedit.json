Since PDF_VIEWER=\"xdg-open\" is now the default on Linux, which <br>\nis asynchronous by itself, some extra workaround is needed.  See <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle-release/rev/21c42b095c84\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle-release/rev/21c42b095c84</a></p>\n<p>Anyway, I rarely use display_drafts or print_drafts these days.  The <br>\nIsabelle/jEdit buffer display quality with the IsabelleText font is <br>\nreasonable, and the standard Print function of jEdit does a surprisingly <br>\ngood job for it.  So in the long run, these latex-based draft commands <br>\nmight well disappear -- I've had to repair them too many times over the <br>\nyears.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
