What I suspect is <br>\nhappening is that in the first case when an exception is explicitly <br>\nraised the compiler can insert the location information into the <br>\nexception packet.  In the second case the exception is raised as part of <br>\nthe evaluation of the \"div\" function.  At best it could provide <br>\ninformation related to where the \"div\" function was defined but because <br>\n\"div\" is built-in it can't even do that so the location information <br>\nassociated with the Div exception packet is empty.</p>\n<p>David</p>",
