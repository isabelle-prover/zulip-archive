In particular, I would like to typeset constants <br>\n(and type constructors) in a different font than that used for <br>\nvariables.  Is there any way that this can be done uniformly?  I know I <br>\ncan globally change the overall font for formulae by using, say, <br>\n\\isabellestyle{tt}, but that changes both variables and constants.  I <br>\ncan change how each individual constant by is typeset by use of the <br>\nnotation construct, together with \\&lt;^raw:_&gt; feature, but this tedious <br>\nand error prone.  It feels like there must be a better way, but I have <br>\nnot been able to fine a description of such in the documentation.<br>\n---Elsa L. Gunter</p>",
