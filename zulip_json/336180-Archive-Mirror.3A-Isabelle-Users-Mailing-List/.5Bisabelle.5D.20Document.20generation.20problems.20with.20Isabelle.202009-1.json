First, I'd like the question marks in printed <br>\ntheorems to disappear. Until now, I just wrote \"reset <br>\nshow_question_marks\" in my ROOT.ML, and all was good. Now, ML won't <br>\naccept reset any more. I found something in the NEWS, saying that <br>\nshow_question_marks is now a flag, and in Pure's term.ML, I found the <br>\nfollowing line:<br>\nval show_question_marks = Unsynchronized.ref true;</p>\n<p>I tried copying this into ROOT.ML and changing true to false, but no <br>\neffect. Keeping false, again no effect. So, how can I change this in my <br>\nROOT.ML? Is there still any possibility?</p>\n<p>Secondly, until now I used @{thm[mode=Rule] ...} to print nice <br>\nderivation rules for my theorems. Also, this does not work any more. The <br>\ndocumentation on the Isabelle website still shows this as the way to go, <br>\nand I found nothing in the NEWS describing this problem...</p>\n<p>I'm glad to accept any advice :)<br>\n..and perhaps the one changing the whole document preperation stuff <br>\nwrites also an updated LaTeXSugar document...</p>\n<p>Regards<br>\n  Daniel<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/UyLmnJP5H6eWbrD6k0S9Pfia/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",

If the problem persists, perhaps I could have a look at<br>\nyour sources to figure out the problem.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/iaajVGeUquHCpXxB6rpg8G4y/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
