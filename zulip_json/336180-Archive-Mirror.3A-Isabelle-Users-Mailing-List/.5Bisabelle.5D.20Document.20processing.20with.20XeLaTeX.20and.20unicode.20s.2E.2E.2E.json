For <br>\nme a sentence with \"able to process\" and \"Unicode\" is an Oxymoron, after <br>\nseveral years of struggling with this constantly changing standard. <br>\nThere are so many things that can go wrong with Unicode.</p>\n<p>In France, there are jokes like <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.apprendre-en-ligne.net/bloginfo/index.php/2009/01/21/151-martine-ecrit-en-utf-8\">http://www.apprendre-en-ligne.net/bloginfo/index.php/2009/01/21/151-martine-ecrit-en-utf-8</a> <br>\nwhich stem from everyday life.  Just last week I got a printed bon at the <br>\nsupermarket with a simular unicode accident.
