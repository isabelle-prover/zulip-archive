Here, I wonder what it means, the  <br>\nbackground remains, I can't imagine the Simplifier (which I wanted on  <br>\npurpose instead of Blast) running forever like this, and the goal seems to  <br>\nbe solved.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/-FdnYllVSQobtxNY_NavYiat/Test.thy\">Test.thy</a></p>",
