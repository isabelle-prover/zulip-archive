There are some good books on academic writing out there, but I wanted to be as concise as possible.</p>\n<p>The real issue with We is that a paper is about your subject matter, not about yourself.  (Consider the difference between “I claim that” and “we can see that” (“we” = “you and I”) or “it follows that”.) Using We instead of I is a very thin disguise, and can sound even more ridiculous. But there are occasions when it is appropriate to refer to “my previous paper\", “my approach\" or “my supervisor\". </p>\n<p>No referee should reject a paper simply because it is shorter than some arbitrary limit. They can complain if it is too concise to be understandable. This can be a problem with complicated mathematical definitions. If you experiment was small, padding out the paper with waffle will only make matters worse.</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",

I absolutely agree with him. But many of our papers are essentially demonstrations of technology (as when we formalise some theorem or verify some system). Then there’s no evident hypothesis, but papers should still be written clearly.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
