The<br>\nfollowing journalistic article may be interesting from a sociological point<br>\nof view.</p>\n<p>Journalistic Article (I do not know if there is some sensationalism):<br>\n<a href=\"http://technionfrance.org/news/lisraelien-qui-a-resolu-une-equation-mathematique-vieille-de-200-ans\">http://technionfrance.org/news/lisraelien-qui-a-resolu-une-equation-mathematique-vieille-de-200-ans</a></p>\n<p>Argument which pretend to be the solution of this millenium problem (I do<br>\nnot spend my time reading such papers): <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10081\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10081</a></p>\n<p>When Gauss was confronted with Abel's proof of the impossibility to solve<br>\nthe 5th degree equation by radials, he did not read it, because he thought<br>\nthat it was a not a serious research. I think that Gauss guessed that the<br>\nauthor of such a proof suffered of what today is known as Dunning–Kruger<br>\neffect : <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a></p>\n<p>For a young mathematician, the best way to show that his/her results are<br>\nserious, and not just the product of Dunning–Kruger effect, is to provide a<br>\ncomputer-verified proof.</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nJosé M.</p>",
