In contrast<br>\nwith user applications, OS kernel software runs in privileged CPU mode<br>\nand is thus highly critical. Large projects such as seL4, VeriSoft,<br>\nCertiKoS and Prosper have invested considerable resources in developing<br>\nformally verified systems such as hypervisors and microkernels,<br>\nsupplying proofs that they satisfy critical properties. Such proofs are<br>\ndelicate in terms of the scale and complexity of real systems, the<br>\nmodels used in performing the proof search, and the relations between<br>\nthe two, which recent vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown have<br>\nshown to be a highly non-trivial issue.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this workshop is to share, compare and disseminate best<br>\npractices, tools and methodologies to verify OS kernels, also setting<br>\nthe stage for future steps in the direction of fully verified systems,<br>\ndealing with issues related to modelling, model validation, and large<br>\nproof maintenance through system evolution. On one hand, we need to make<br>\nlow-level proofs more scalable, modular and cost-effective. On the other<br>\nhand, once certified systems are available, preservation and maintenance<br>\nof their proofs of validity become key questions.</p>\n<p>The goal of the ENTROPY workshop is to provide a forum for researchers<br>\nand practitioners in this space, linking operating systems, formal<br>\nmethods, and hardware architecture, interested in system design as well<br>\nas machine verified mathematical proofs using proof assistants such as<br>\nCoq, Isabelle and HOL4.</p>\n<p>This will be the second edition of the ENTROPY workshop series. The<br>\nfirst workshop was organised by the Pip Development Team at University<br>\nof Lille in 2018.</p>\n<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST</p>\n<p>Specific topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verified kernels and hypervisors</li>\n<li>Verified security architectures and models</li>\n<li>Tools and frameworks for hardware security analysis</li>\n<li>Tools and frameworks for security analysis</li>\n<li>Formal hardware models and model validation techniques</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theorem prover based tools and frameworks for verification<br>\n of low level code</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combinations of static analysis and theorem proving</p>\n</li>\n<li>Theories and techniques for compositional security analysis</li>\n<li>Case studies and industrial experience reports</li>\n<li>Proof maintenance techniques and problems</li>\n<li>Compositional models and verification techniques</li>\n<li>Proof oriented design</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The aim of the workshop is to stimulate innovation and active exchange<br>\nof ideas, so position papers, work-in-progress and industrial<br>\nexperience submissions are welcome.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS (to be extended)</p>\n<p>Frank Piessens, KU Leuven<br>\nPeter Sewell, Univ.
