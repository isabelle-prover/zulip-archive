Horn clause theories are famous<br>\nfor their well-understood declarative semantics, in which models of<br>\nlogic programs are given inductively or coinductively. At the same time,<br>\nHorn clauses give rise to efficient inference procedures, usually involving<br>\nresolution. Logic programming found applications in type inference,<br>\nverification, and AI. While logic programming was originally conceived<br>\nfor describing simple facts, it was extended to account for much more<br>\ncomplex theories. This includes higher-order theories, inductive and<br>\ncoinductive data, and stochastic/probabilistic theories.</p>\n<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers that work on<br>\nextensions of logic programming and inference methods, and to foster an<br>\nexchange of methods and applications that have emerged in different<br>\ncommunities.</p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The central idea of this workshop is to discuss the theory of logic<br>\nprogramming and associated topics that have as well the goal to<br>\nautomatically infer knowledge and proofs. Our intention is to bring<br>\ntogether researchers that work on the numerous topics that contribute to<br>\nautomatic proof inference and foster an exchange that may lead to  advances<br>\nin the theory of logic programming.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p>* Proof theory (e.g. focalised and uniform proofs),<br>\n    * Logic programming beyond the classical Horn clause theories<br>\n      (e.g. coinduction, higher-order Horn clauses, probabilities,<br>\n      categorical logic, inductive LP),</p>\n<p>* Extensions of logic programming (e.g. DataLog, description logic,<br>\n      relational programming),</p>\n<p>* Advanced implementations (e.g. λProlog, ELPI, miniKanren),<br>\n    * Type theory (e.g. polarised λ-calculus, proofs-as-programs,<br>\n       types for logic programming),</p>\n<p>* Semantics (e.g. classical, categorical, algebraic, coalgebraic) , and<br>\n    * Applications.</p>\n<p>Venue and Event</p>\n<hr>\n<p>TEASE-LP 2020 will be held in Dublin, Ireland, co-located with<br>\nETAPS 2020 on 25 April 2020.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Abstract submission    Wednesday, 26 February 2020 AoE<br>\nNotification           Wednesday, 25 March 2020 AoE<br>\nCamera-ready copy      Wednesday, 1 April 2020 AoE<br>\nWorkshop               Saturday, 25 April 2020</p>\n<p>Programme Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Henning Basold (chair), Leiden University, NLD<br>\nWilliam Byrd, University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA<br>\nGopal Gupta, The University of Texas at Dallas, USA<br>\nEkaterina Komendantskaya (chair), Heriot-Watt University, GBR<br>\nDale Miller, INRIA and LIX/Ecole Polytechnique, FRA<br>\nGopalan Nadathur, University of Minnesota, USA<br>\nFrank Pfenning, Carnegie Mellon University, USA<br>\nHiroshi Unno, University of Tsukuba, JPN<br>\nNoam Zeilberger, University of Birmingham, GBR</p>\n<p>Submission Instructions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Since the aim of the workshop is to foster exchange and discussions<br>\non trends, extensions, applications and semantics of logic programming,<br>\nwe invite presentations of possibly already published as well as ongoing<br>\nwork.
