I have  <br>\nproblems with the matching mechanism  for evaluating a term envolving  <br>\nuser-defined functions. I also have problems to do matching with a  <br>\nterm involving user-defined functions. For example, I cannot write a  <br>\nEisbach method with the same functionality of the following Ltac in  <br>\nCoq (the code has been simplified to show only the relevant matters):</p>\n<p>fun f:: 'a =&gt; 'a list := .....</p>\n<p>Ltac apply_R :=<br>\nmatch goal with<br>\n|  |- ( ... H ...) =&gt; let L := eval cbv in f(H)<br>\n                       in match L with<br>\n                        | nil =&gt; apply R<br>\n                        | _ =&gt;  idtac<br>\n                        end<br>\nend.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,<br>\nPaqui</p>",
