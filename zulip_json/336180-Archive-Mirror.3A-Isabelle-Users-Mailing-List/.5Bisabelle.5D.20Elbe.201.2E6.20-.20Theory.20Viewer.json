It has been improved to <br>\nhave batch processing on win machines and some bugs were removed. Also <br>\nthe font Elbian.ttf now works under Win7. Symbols from Elbian.ttf can be <br>\ninserted to *.thy files by using the right mouse click. You can download <br>\nElbe 1.6 from</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cococo.de/Elbe\">http://cococo.de/Elbe</a></p>\n<p>and use it although it is not perfect. It can be used to inspect <br>\nIsabelle2012 files. The navigator can also be sorted to have the lemmata <br>\ndisplayed in lexical order.</p>\n<p>Jens</p>",
