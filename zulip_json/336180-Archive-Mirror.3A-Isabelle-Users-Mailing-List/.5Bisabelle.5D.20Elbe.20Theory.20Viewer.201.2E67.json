The new UI needed some adoptions and also required different  <br>\nlibraries. You can view and print your theories on an Windows machine with  <br>\nthis tool. It's faster than other software, because it's a native code  <br>\nprogram. The download link is<br>\n<a href=\"http://cococo.de/Elbe\">http://cococo.de/Elbe</a></p>\n<p>Happy weekend,<br>\nJens</p>",
