I'm<br>\nsurprised it's not linked from the Documentation page on the main<br>\nsite, even if it does have a long section on shell interaction. None<br>\nof the other documents come close to the level of detail as to how<br>\nIsabelle really works, and none leave me feeling as if I really<br>\nunderstand what I'm doing when I'm executing a proof. It's nice that<br>\neven though I'm not a mathematician (by any means), I was able to read<br>\na few Wikipedia articles for background and understand almost all of<br>\nit.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm a bit slow with all of this, being new to formal math, and<br>\nI'm having trouble understanding how part of elim resolution is<br>\njustified logically. Take the example from ITI 5.3 and 6.1:</p>\n<p>[| P | P ==&gt; P |] ==&gt; P | P --&gt; P</p>\n<p>To prove this, we'd like to apply elim resolution (erule) to the only<br>\nsubgoal with disjE, which reads</p>\n<p>[| Q | R; Q ==&gt; S; R ==&gt; S |] ==&gt; S</p>\n<p>First disjE needs to be lifted:</p>\n<p>[| P | P ==&gt; ?Q | ?R; [| P | P; ?Q |] ==&gt; ?S; [| P | P; ?R |] ==&gt; ?S<br>\n|] ==&gt; (P | P ==&gt; ?S)</p>\n<p>I follow up to this point. Here the book skips right to [| P ==&gt; P; P<br>\n==&gt; P |] ==&gt; P | P --&gt; P. I understand how it was unified, and I<br>\nunderstand how the first subgoal, \"P | P ==&gt; ?Q | ?R\" before<br>\nunification, was discharged automatically as part of elim resolution,<br>\nbut I don't understand how the first assumption \"P | P\" from the two<br>\nremaining subgoals can be eliminated. How is that justified?</p>\n<p>To restate, the book says that elim resolution replaces subgoal phi_i<br>\nof the proof with lifted assumptions psi'_2 ... psi'_m from the<br>\nresolution rule, <em>except with the assumption of psi'_1 deleted</em><br>\n(assuming psi'_1 was solved by assumption). How is that last part<br>\njustified? Unless I'm missing something, the book skips that detail.</p>\n<p>Chris Capel</p>",
