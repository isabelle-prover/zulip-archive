Inside proofs it shows the proof state at the  <br>\nmouse position. While this looks like a cool new feature in PG4, I  <br>\nwould like to be able to turn both the highlighting and the \"tooltips\"  <br>\noff, when I do not need them. However, I was unable to find an option  <br>\nthat achieves this.</p>\n<p>4) There seem to be some bugs in PG 4 by which</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>the command processing gets out of sync (previously rare), indicated  <br>\nby the highlighting ending in the middle of a syntactic token or input  <br>\nsentence,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the highlighting is not properly removed and some bits of processed  <br>\ninput stay yellow, after the mouse is moved away.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>1) and 2) seem to be PG-independent \"features\" of CE 23.2 (does my CE  <br>\n22 config possibly disturb CE 23?), while 3) and 4) are PG-specific.   <br>\nPoint 4) is less of a problem than the others, since it does not occur  <br>\nvery often.</p>\n<p>I would greatly appreciate any help with these issues.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nChristoph</p>",

They were so wide that all I saw was a gray panel in the middle of the screen, which I couldn't close (the close button was like 500000 pixels to the left of the screen). I had to kill the app. This happened often enough to make the application totally unusable.</p>\n<p>This convinced me very quickly to go back to the \"good old\" Aquamacs. Not that I'm a big fan of the beast, but at least I know its bugs and I'm used to work around them.</p>\n<p>In my .bashrc file, I have the lines</p>\n<p>export EMACS=/Applications/Isabelle2009-2.app/Contents/Resources/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs<br>\nalias Isabelle=\"/Applications/Isabelle2011.app/Isabelle/bin/isabelle emacs -p $EMACS\"</p>\n<p>Then I can launch Isabelle2011 with the Aquamacs from Isabelle2009-2 by entering \"Isabelle\" on the command line.</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
