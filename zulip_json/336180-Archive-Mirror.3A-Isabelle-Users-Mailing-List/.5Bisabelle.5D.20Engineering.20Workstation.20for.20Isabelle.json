(I've even met them today at the Linux and Opensource<br>\nconference in Augsburg.)</p>\n<p>The CPU is very fast and very hot, only the Intel i9-9900K model is even<br>\nhotter (Intel tries to compete with AMD again.) It means that running 8<br>\ncores in full turbo mode consumes a lot of power and makes quite some<br>\nfan noise: so I have switched off the turbo in the BIOS and only use it<br>\nin regular 3.6GHz mode; this fits nicely to the extra-fast memory at the<br>\nsame speed. Thus the fan is almost off under normal circumstances, and<br>\nbecomes barely audible when \"isabelle build -a\" starts to crunch.</p>\n<p>The persistant storage helps to speed up loading of these ultra-fat JVM<br>\nartifacts that we are running with Isabelle/jEdit. It also helps a lot<br>\nfor stored heap images of Poly/ML. (I would never go back to an actual<br>\n\"disk\".)</p>\n<p>The extra graphics card (80 EUR) could have been omitted: that Intel CPU<br>\nhas quite capable UHD graphics on-chip, but the mainboard exposed it<br>\nonly as HDMI (30Hz), not as DisplayPort (60Hz) for my fancy Samsung UHD<br>\ndisplay (300 EUR in 2018, 250 EUR in 2019).</p>\n<p>Here are some adhoc numbers from \"isabelle build -g main\" (approximately<br>\nat Isabelle2019-RC0):</p>\n<p>ISABELLE_BUILD_OPTIONS=\"threads=6\"</p>\n<p>ML_PLATFORM=\"x86_64_32-linux\"<br>\n  ML_HOME=\"/home/makarius/.isabelle/contrib/polyml-5.8/x86_64_32-linux\"<br>\n  ML_SYSTEM=\"polyml-5.8\"<br>\n  ML_OPTIONS=\"--minheap 1500\"</p>\n<p>Finished HOL (0:02:12 elapsed time, 0:06:43 cpu time, factor 3.05)<br>\nFinished HOL-Analysis (0:04:09 elapsed time, 0:18:37 cpu time, factor 4.48)<br>\nFinished HOL-Library (0:01:05 elapsed time, 0:05:01 cpu time, factor 4.60)<br>\nFinished HOL-Computational_Algebra (0:00:36 elapsed time, 0:01:44 cpu<br>\ntime, factor 2.89)<br>\nFinished HOL-Algebra (0:00:40 elapsed time, 0:03:33 cpu time, factor 5.24)<br>\nFinished HOL-Probability (0:00:39 elapsed time, 0:03:14 cpu time, factor<br>\n4.94)<br>\nFinished HOL-Number_Theory (0:00:30 elapsed time, 0:02:11 cpu time,<br>\nfactor 4.33)</p>\n<p>I will try this again tomorrow, with all 8 cores, and also with this<br>\nhot/noisy turbo mode.</p>\n<p>(The above looks already like an invitation to Larry to port even more<br>\nHOL-Analysis stuff by John Harrison :-)</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

My personal PC is with a 9700k CPU and a 2080ti GPU (which I believe is much hotter than GT 1030, but it is quite handy when playing around with neural networks). The CPU cooler I use is Dark Rock Pro 4 and the case is Fractal Design Define S2 Mid Tower, both of which are meant for quietness. Though I haven’t properly measured the noise level, I can say it is totally tolerable even when both CPU and GPU are 100% loaded — the CPU cooler is advertised to only have 24.3dB noise even at 100% PWM fan speed. </p>\n<p>In addition, I believe better thermal paste (e.g. Thermal Grizzly) can help with the noise. I only used the paste that came with my cooler: since the noise level is already pretty good, I didn’t upgrade the paste to reduce it further.</p>\n<p>Wenda</p>",
