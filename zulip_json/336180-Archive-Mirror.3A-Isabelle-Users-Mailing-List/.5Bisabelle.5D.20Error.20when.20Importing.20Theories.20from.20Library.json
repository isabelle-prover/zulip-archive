For instance, when<br>\nI type</p>\n<p>\"~~/src/HOL/Library/OptionalSugar\"</p>\n<p>the output windows gives the error \"Bad Theory Name\".<br>\nIt took me a while to find a simple workaround: save<br>\nthe file and reload it.</p>\n<p>This seems to happen in all the latest release candidates,<br>\nbut I bet is an older issue.</p>\n<p>Best!</p>",
