I think the problem is not even a missing dynamic library but a failure to find the dynamic linking program which is usually named as an interpreter, and the error comes from the kernel itself. I might be mistaken. Anyway, there's no easy way to change the unhelpful error message without wrapping the executable in yet another script.</p>\n<p>Yours,<br>\n    Thomas.</p>",
