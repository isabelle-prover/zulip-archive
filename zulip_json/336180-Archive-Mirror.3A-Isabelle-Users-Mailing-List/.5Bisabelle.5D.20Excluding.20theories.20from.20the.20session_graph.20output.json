Unfortunately, there was<br>\nnot always an answer, so let me try again – maybe things have changed<br>\nsince then:</p>\n<p>I have am preparing an AFP submission that should contain a session<br>\ngraph. It also contains a theory (“Everything”) that includes everything<br>\nand will \\input’ed in the introduction, so it is not visible as a Theory<br>\nto the user. Currently, it shows up in the session graph (which is<br>\nconfusing, makes the graph layout less nice and pulls in the also not<br>\ninteresting TaTeXsugar theory).</p>\n<p>Can I prevent isabelle from including that theory in the session graph?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nJoachim<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/-7ur-odqTUU75BBmirGBgA3d/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
