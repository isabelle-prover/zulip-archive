I therefore spent the evening digging <br>\ninto the Isabelle source code for the first time and came up with the <br>\nattached _experimental_ /solution/. It applies the outermost control and <br>\nand prints control symbols for inner ones.</p>\n<p>It works well for my use cases and I didn't observe any problems so far.</p>\n<p>But probably this will break everything somewhere else as I'm not aware <br>\nin which contexts the modified code is used. So Makarius could have a <br>\nlook if he likes. I didn't figure out how update/edit_control_style are <br>\nused and whether that may cause any problems.</p>\n<p>I'll be happy if you give it a test run and have any comments.</p>\n<p>Best<br>\n     Benedikt<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/_MuAilQKrtUqIzNativ4pOgc/BsubEsub.patch\">BsubEsub.patch</a></p>",
