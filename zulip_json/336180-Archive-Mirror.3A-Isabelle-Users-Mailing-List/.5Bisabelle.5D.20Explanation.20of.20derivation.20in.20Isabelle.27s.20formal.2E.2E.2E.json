(I think it is important<br>\nto understand it in full rather than blindly believe in Isabelle's<br>\noutput...)</p>\n<p>The screenshot of \"Program Extraction in simply-typed Higher Order Logic\"<br>\nby Stefan Berghofer is attached to this mail. (or may be found here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://postimg.cc/GBHgDjf5\">https://postimg.cc/GBHgDjf5</a> , I've highlighted parts which are not obvious<br>\nfor me)</p>\n<p>A) What does it mean \"substitute a few atomic types of a constant with a<br>\nfew complex types\"?</p>\n<p>B) What does it mean \"Sigma and c in parenthesis followed by substitution\"?</p>\n<p>C) Are these substitutions are real ones or just sequence of symbols?(like<br>\nsome kind of label) I am sure that 5th is real one, but what about the<br>\nothers?</p>\n<p>Some very simple examples of derivation will help a lot!</p>\n<p>By the way, can one recall what are known theorems about this very<br>\nimportant formal system? I.e. which useful properties it has? (Any<br>\nreferences are highly appreciated!)</p>\n<p>Sincerely yours,</p>\n<p>G D<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ZxroVIRzfGi5e4ea3HTf1kh-/myquestion.png\">myquestion.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ZxroVIRzfGi5e4ea3HTf1kh-/myquestion.png\" title=\"myquestion.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/ZxroVIRzfGi5e4ea3HTf1kh-/myquestion.png\"></a></div>",

        "content": "<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href=\"mailto:makarius@sketis.net\">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>\nThe material by Stefan Berghofer is approx. 20 years old.
