Exploring the Structure of an Algebra Text with <br>\nLocales. Journal of Automated Reasoning, 2019, <br>\n<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10817-019-09537-9\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10817-019-09537-9</a></p>\n<p>At the core of the paper is a case study, which has led to a number of <br>\nimprovements to locales.  A discussion of approaches to algebra in <br>\nIsabelle and HOL provers follows.  The paper provides guidance on using <br>\nlocales and identifies patterns of use.  It complements my earlier <br>\nreport, which was focussed on how locales work:</p>\n<p>Clemens Ballarin. Locales: a module system for mathematical theories. <br>\nJournal of Automated Reasoning, 52(2):123â€“153, 2014, <br>\n<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10817-013-9284-7\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10817-013-9284-7</a></p>\n<p>The case study itself is in the AFP.  Author's versions of the papers <br>\ncan be downloaded from my TUM web page.</p>\n<p>Clemens</p>",
