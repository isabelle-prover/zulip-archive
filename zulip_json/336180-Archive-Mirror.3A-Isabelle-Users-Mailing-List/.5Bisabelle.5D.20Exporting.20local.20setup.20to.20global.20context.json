This can be achieved using local_setup <br>\n(see the code below).Â  Of course, the data inside the Generic_Data is <br>\nonly present in the context of the class. What I want, however, is that <br>\nthe data is also available in the global context with the associated <br>\ntype of the type class being abstracted to a schematic type that has a <br>\ntype class constraint. Apparently, this can be done using theorem <br>\nattributes (e.g. see src/HOL/Orderings.thy under the section \"Reasoning <br>\ntools setup\").</p>\n<p>Is it possible to achieve the same effect without using theorem attributes?</p>\n<p>Lukas</p>",
