These frameworks provide foundations for <br>\nformal specification of systems and programming languages, supporting <br>\ntool development and reasoning.</p>\n<p>The objective of this one-day workshop is to put together theoreticians <br>\nand practitioners to promote new techniques and results, from the <br>\ntheoretical side, and feedback on the implementation and use of such <br>\ntechniques and results, from the practical side.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest to this forum include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* Logical frameworks<br>\n          o Proof theory<br>\n          o Type theory<br>\n          o Automated deduction</p>\n<p>* Semantic frameworks<br>\n          o Specification languages and meta-languages<br>\n          o Formal semantics of languages and systems<br>\n          o Computational and logical properties of semantic frameworks</p>\n<p>* Implementation of logical and/or semantic frameworks<br>\n    * Applications of logical and/or semantic frameworks</p>\n<p>LSFA´07 also aims to be a forum for presenting and discussing work in <br>\nprogress, and therefore to provide feedback to authors on their <br>\npreliminary research. Submissions to the workshop will in the form of <br>\nfull papers. The proceedings are produced only after the meeting, so <br>\nthat authors can incorporate this feedback in the published papers.</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<p>Fairouz Kamareddine, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh (Confirmed)</p>\n<p>Gilles Dowek, École Polytechnique, Paris (Confirmed)</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Mauricio Ayala-Rincón   UnB (Brasília), co-chair<br>\nClemens Ballarin    TUM (München)<br>\nMario Benevides UFRJ (Rio de Janeiro)<br>\nEduardo Bonelli        UNLP (La Plata)<br>\nChristiano Braga    UCM (Madrid)<br>\nClare Dixon             University of Liverpool (Liverpool)<br>\nMarcelo Finger         USP (São Paulo)<br>\nBernhard Gramlich   TU Wien (Vienna)<br>\nDelia Kesner            Paris 7 (Paris)<br>\nClaude Kirchner     Loria (Nancy)<br>\nEdward Hermann Haeusler PUC-Rio (Rio de Janeiro), co-chair<br>\nFairouz Kamareddine Heriot-Watt (Edinburgh)<br>\nJoão Marcos             UFRN (Natal)<br>\nNarciso Martí-Oliet UCM (Madrid)<br>\nPierre-Etienne Moreau   INRIA (Nancy)<br>\nPeter Mosses            Swansea University (Swansea)<br>\nMartín Musicante    UFRN (Natal)<br>\nCésar Muñoz             NIA-NASA (Hampton)<br>\nElaine Pimentel     UFMG (Belo Horizonte)<br>\nRuy de Queiroz         UFPE (Recife)<br>\nSimona Ronchi Della Rocca   Università di Torino (Torino)<br>\nHongwei Xi          Boston University (Boston)</p>\n<p>Organizing Committee</p>\n<p>Mauricio Ayala-Rincón         UnB (Brasília)<br>\nChristiano Braga          UCM (Madrid)<br>\nLucília C.
