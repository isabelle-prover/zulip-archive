The primary motivation for the development of the framework were<br>\nsome of my personal applied formalization efforts. However, while my<br>\nextension of the framework Types-To-Sets has reached a certain level of<br>\nmaturity, I slowly converged on the opinion that I would prefer not to rely<br>\non it in my own applied formalization work (the reasons for converging on<br>\nthis opinion are, primarily, subjective). Moreover, my personal<br>\ncircumstances have changed and I can no longer afford to spend as much time<br>\nworking on it as I was able around this summer.</p>\n<p>Due to what is outlined in the previous paragraph, it no longer seems<br>\nfeasible for me to continue investing a significant amount of time in the<br>\nfurther development of this framework (quite frankly, I have nearly<br>\nabandoned this project at some point in September). Nevertheless, given<br>\nthat others have found Types-To-Sets useful, and I would like to think that<br>\nthe extension that I developed significantly improves the user experience<br>\nfor most of the routine relativization tasks, I am curious whether this<br>\nwork could be considered/recommended for the submission to the AFP, despite<br>\nbeing somewhat rough.</p>\n<p>Complete disclosure: the initial plans for further development included<br>\n(informal) proofs of what I considered to be the critical parts of the<br>\nimplementation, unit testing of the less critical parts, user input<br>\nverification (in conjunction with the proof/unit testing), refactoring the<br>\ncode and improvement of efficiency (the existing implementation is highly<br>\nsuboptimal in almost every aspect), provision of the documentation and<br>\nfurther examples. Given my current circumstances, I would consider<br>\nimproving the user input verification (without any testing or proof and,<br>\ntherefore, without too much confidence) and providing documentation in the<br>\nstyle consistent with the Isabelle/Isar reference manual/tutorials prior to<br>\nthe submission. However, refactoring, proof and/or unit testing would<br>\nrequire more time than I would like to dedicate to further development of<br>\nthis framework.</p>\n<p>I am reasonably impartial as to whether this work will be published on the<br>\nAFP or not. Therefore, the question comes down to whether the authors of<br>\nthe original idea, those who have taken it further in the past and the<br>\nexisting users of Types-To-Sets would consider adopting my implementation.<br>\nMost certainly, I would be keen to provide continuous support in the form<br>\nof bug fixes and explanations of any design decisions/functionality. If I<br>\nreceive sufficient encouragement to submit it to the AFP, then I will<br>\nallocate (approximately) 2 hours every week (perhaps, a little bit more<br>\ntime around Christmas) towards the completion of the development of a<br>\nsystem for the user input verification and the documentation. In this case,<br>\nI will be aiming to prepare it for the submission to the AFP before the end<br>\nof January. However, I expect that most of the code will remain as it<br>\nstands (the only exception being the removal of certain auxiliary and<br>\nunfinished features).</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
