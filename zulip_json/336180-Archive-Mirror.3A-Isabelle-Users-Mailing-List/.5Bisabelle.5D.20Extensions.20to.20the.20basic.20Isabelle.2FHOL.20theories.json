If you are still interested in extending the basic<br>\nIsabelle/HOL theories by lemmata from their users, you might consider to<br>\ninclude the following lemmata, which I needed during my work with Isabelle:</p>\n<p>lemma ex_ivl_less: (EX i:{..&lt;n}. P i) = (EX i&lt;n. P i)<br>\n  and all_ivl_less: (ALL i:{..&lt;n}. P i) = (ALL i&lt;n. P i)<br>\n  by auto</p>\n<p>lemma distinct_takeWhile:<br>\n  \"distinct xs ==&gt; distinct (takeWhile P xs)\"<br>\nproof (induct xs)<br>\n  case (Cons x xs)<br>\n  thus ?case by clarsimp (frule set_take_whileD, clarsimp)<br>\nqed simp</p>\n<p>Moreover, the two following lemmata could be incorporated into the<br>\nlibrary's theory Nat_Infinity:</p>\n<p>instance inat :: \"{linorder}\"<br>\n  by intro_classes (auto simp add: inat_defs split: inat_splits)<br>\nlemma not_Infty_eq: \"(x ~= Infty) = (EX i. x = Fin i)\"<br>\n  by (cases x) auto</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I have enclosed a theory for the summation of a list of<br>\nvalues.  I am not sure, whether you prefer to incorporate the definition<br>\nand proofs in the basic List theory or store it somewhere at the<br>\nlibraries...</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the proofs are checked only in Isabelle/HOL 2005, I hope,<br>\nthey still run through in the newest Isabelle release.</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>Matthias.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/_amkGwdjxCEQIhKrFfnlpGOO/list_sum.thy\">list_sum.thy</a></p>",
