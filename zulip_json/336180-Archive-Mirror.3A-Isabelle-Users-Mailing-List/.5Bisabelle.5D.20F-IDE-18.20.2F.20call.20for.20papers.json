Any standard comes with an assessment process, which<br>\nrequires a complete documentation of the application to ease the<br>\njustification of design choices and the review of code and proofs.</p>\n<p>Ideally, an F-IDE dedicated to such developments should comply with<br>\nseveral requirements. The first one is to associate a logical theory<br>\nwith a programming language, in a way that facilitates the tightly<br>\ncoupled handling of specification properties and program<br>\nconstructs. The second is to offer a language/environment simple<br>\nenough to be usable by most developers, even if they are not fully<br>\nacquainted with higher-order logics or set theory, in particular by<br>\nmaking development of proofs as easy as possible. The third is to<br>\noffer automated management of application documentation. It may also<br>\nbe expected that developments done with such an F-IDE are reusable and<br>\nmodular. Tools for testing and static analysis may be embedded within<br>\nF-IDEs to support the assessment process.</p>\n<p>Topics<br>\n======</p>\n<p>The workshop is open to contributions on all aspects of a system<br>\ndevelopment process, including specification, design, implementation,<br>\nanalysis and documentation. It welcomes the presentation of tools,<br>\nmethods, techniques and experiments. Topics of interest include, but<br>\nare not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>F-IDE building: design and integration of languages, development of<br>\nuser-friendly front-ends</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to make high-level logical and programming concepts palatable to<br>\nindustrial developers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integration of Object-Oriented and modularity features</p>\n</li>\n<li>Integration of static analyzers</li>\n<li>Integration of automatic proof tools, theorem provers and testing tools</li>\n<li>Documentation tools</li>\n<li>Impact of tools on certification</li>\n<li>Experience reports on developing F-IDEs</li>\n<li>Experience reports on using F-IDEs</li>\n<li>Experience reports on formal methods-based assessments in industrial<br>\napplications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important dates<br>\n===============</p>\n<p>Abstract submission: April 23, 2018<br>\n    Paper submission: April 30, 2018<br>\n    Notification: May 15, 2018<br>\n    Camera-ready version: May 25, 2018<br>\n    Workshop date: July 14, 2018</p>\n<p>PC Co-Chairs<br>\n============</p>\n<p>Paolo Masci, HASLab/INESC-TEC and Universidade do Minho<br>\n    Rosemary Monahan, Maynooth University<br>\n    Virgile Prevosto, Institut List, CEA, Université Paris-Saclay</p>\n<p>Steering Committee<br>\n==================</p>\n<p>Catherine Dubois, Samovar / ENSIIE<br>\n    Dominique Méry, LORIA / Université de Lorraine</p>\n<p>Submission Guidelines &amp; Proceedings<br>\n===================================</p>\n<p>Papers can be submitted through EasyChair using the following link:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fide18\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fide18</a></p>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit the following types of contributions:</p>\n<p>Research papers providing new concepts and results<br>\n    Position papers and research perspectives<br>\n    Experience reports<br>\n    Tool presentations</p>\n<p>Papers must describe original contributions whose main results and<br>\nconclusions have not been published or submitted elsewhere.
