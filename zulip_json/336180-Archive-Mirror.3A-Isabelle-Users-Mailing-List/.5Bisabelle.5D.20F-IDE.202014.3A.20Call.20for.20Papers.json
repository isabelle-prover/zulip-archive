Any standard comes with an assessment process, which<br>\nrequires a complete documentation of the application  in order to ease<br>\nthe justification of design choices and the review of code and proofs.</p>\n<p>Ideally, an F-IDE dedicated to such developments  should comply with<br>\nseveral requirements. The first one is to associate a logical theory<br>\nwith a programming language, in a way that facilitates the tightly<br>\ncoupled  handling  of specification properties and program constructs.<br>\nThe second one is to  offer a  language/environment simple enough to be<br>\nusable by most developers, even if they are not fully acquainted with<br>\nhigher-order logics or set theory,  in particular by making development<br>\nof proofs  as easy as possible. The third one is to offer automated<br>\nmanagement of application documentation.  It may also  be expected that<br>\ndevelopments done with such an F-IDE are reusable and modular.<br>\nMoreover, tools for testing and static analysis may be embedded in this<br>\nF-IDE,  to help address most steps of the assessment process.</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>We encourage submissions presenting and discussing research efforts as<br>\nwell as experience returns on design, development, usage of tools aiming<br>\nat making formal methods \"easier\" for non-specialists. </p>\n<p>In this context, the topics include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>F-IDE building : design and integration of languages, compilation</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to make high-level logical and programming concepts palatable to<br>\nindustrial developers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integration of Object-Oriented  and modularity features</p>\n</li>\n<li>Integration of static analysers</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integration of automatic proof tools,  theorem provers and testing<br>\ntools</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Documentation tools</p>\n</li>\n<li>Impact of tools on certification</li>\n<li>Experience reports of developing  F-IDE</li>\n<li>Experience reports of  using F-IDE</li>\n<li>Experience reports of  formal methods-based assessments of industrial<br>\napplications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We encourage not only mature research results, submissions presenting <br>\ninnovative ideas and early results are also of interest.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>Papers  (6-14 pages in length), following EPCTS format are expected.<br>\nThey can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research papers providing new concepts and results</li>\n<li>Position papers and research perspectives</li>\n<li>Experience reports</li>\n<li>Tool presentations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions will be done via Easychair:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fide2014\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fide2014</a></p>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p>Final versions of accepted papers will be published in a volume of the<br>\nElectronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract submission : 18 December, 2013</li>\n<li>Paper Submission : 23 December, 2013</li>\n<li>Notification : 27 January, 2014</li>\n<li>Final version  : 10 February, 2014</li>\n<li>Workshop date:  April 6, 2014</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PC CO-CHAIRS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Catherine Dubois, CNAM - CÃ©dric / ENSIIE, &lt;last name&gt; (at) ensiie<br>\n(dot) fr</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dimitra Giannakopoulou, NASA Ames, &lt;first name&gt; (dot) &lt;last name&gt;<br>\n(at) nasa (dot) gov</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dominique Mery, LORIA / UniversitÃ© de Lorraine, &lt;first name&gt; (dot)<br>\n&lt;last name&gt; (at) loria (dot) fr</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
