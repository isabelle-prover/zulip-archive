Any standard comes with an assessment process, which requires a complete documentation of the application in order to ease the justification of design choices and the review of code and proofs.</p>\n<p>Ideally, an F-IDE dedicated to such developments should comply with several requirements. The first one is to associate a logical theory with a programming language, in a way that facilitates the tightly coupled handling of specification properties and program constructs. The second one is to offer a language/environment simple enough to be usable by most developers, even if they are not fully acquainted with higher-order logics or set theory, in particular by making development of proofs as easy as possible. The third one is to offer automated management of application documentation. It may also be expected that developments done with such an F-IDE are reusable and modular. Moreover, tools for testing and static analysis may be embedded in this F-IDE, to help address most steps of the assessment process.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The workshop is opened to contributions on all aspects of a system development process, including specification, design, implementation, analysis and documentation. It should allow the presentation of tools, methods, techniques and experiments. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p>– F-IDE building: design and integration of languages, compilation<br>\n– How to make high-level logical and programming concepts palatable to industrial developers<br>\n– Integration of Object-Oriented and modularity features<br>\n– Integration of static analyzers<br>\n– Integration of automatic proof tools, theorem provers and testing tools<br>\n– Documentation tools<br>\n– Impact of tools on certification<br>\n– Experience reports of developing F-IDE<br>\n– Experience reports of using F-IDE<br>\n– Experience reports of formal methods-based assessments of industrial applications</p>\n<hr>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Papers must be written in English, not exceed 15 pages in LNCS format, not counting references, and follow the FM 2015 Format and Submission Guidelines.</p>\n<p>They can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research papers providing new concepts and results</li>\n<li>Position papers and research perspectives</li>\n<li>Experience reports</li>\n<li>Tool presentations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers can be submitted through Easychair: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fide2015\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fide2015</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Preliminary proceedings, including all the papers selected for the workshop, will be available electronically at the workshop.</li>\n<li>Post proceedings are under consideration as Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (ETPCS) proceedings.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Abstract submission:  March 24, 2015 (23h59 GMT)<br>\nPaper submission:     March 31, 2015 (23h59 GMT)<br>\nNotification:         April 30, 2015<br>\nCamera-ready:         May 15, 2015<br>\nWorkshop:             June 22, 2015</p>\n<hr>\n<p>PC CO-CHAIRS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Catherine Dubois     ENSIIE, Cedric, catherine (dot) dubois (at) ensiie (dot) fr<br>\nPaolo Masci          Queen Mary University of London, paolo (dot) masci (at) eecs (dot) qmul (dot) ac (dot) uk<br>\nDominique Mery       Université de Lorraine, dominique (dot) mery (at) loria (dot) fr</p>\n<hr>\n<p>PC MEMBERS (to be completed)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bernhard Beckert     Karlsruhe Institute of Technology<br>\nJose     Campos      Universidade do Minho<br>\nPaul     Curzon      Queen Mary University of London<br>\nCarlo Alberto Furia  ETH Zurich<br>\nTherese  Hardin      UPMC<br>\nRustan   Leino       Microsoft Research<br>\nMichael  Leuschel    University of Dusseldorf<br>\nClaude   Marche      INRIA<br>\nStefan   Mitsch      Carnegie Mellon University<br>\nPatrick  Oladimeji   Swansea University<br>\nSuzette  Person      NASA Langley Research Center<br>\nFrancois Pessaux     ENSTA ParisTech<br>\nMarie-Laure Potet    Laboratoire Verimag<br>\nSteve    Reeves      Waikato University<br>\nJohn     Rushby      SRI International<br>\nRene     Thiemann    University of Innsbruck<br>\nBoris    Yakobowski  CEA LIST</p>",
