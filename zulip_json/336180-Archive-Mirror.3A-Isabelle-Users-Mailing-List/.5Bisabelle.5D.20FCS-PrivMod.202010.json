A particular aspect of security is personal<br>\nprivacy, which may be threatened whenever users interact with services<br>\nand devices which are not directly under their control. From a user's<br>\npoint of view, privacy is often seen as a part of security; but from a<br>\nservice provider's point of view, privacy and security are often<br>\nopposites that have to be balanced with each other.</p>\n<p>FCS-PrivMod aims to bring together international researchers<br>\nfrom industry and academia in formal methods, computer security,<br>\nand privacy, to develop advances and new perspectives in security and<br>\nprivacy models and analysis. It comprises the FCS workshop<br>\n(Foundations of Computer Security), a satellite of LICS since 2002,<br>\nand PrivMod (Privacy: Models &amp; Analysis), a new workshop specifically<br>\nabout privacy-supporting protocols and systems.</p>\n<p>We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security<br>\nand privacy and also in more exploratory presentations that examine<br>\nopen questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories,<br>\nas well as in new results on developing and applying automated<br>\nreasoning techniques and tools for the formal specification and<br>\nanalysis of security protocols. We thus solicit submissions of papers<br>\nboth on mature work and on work in progress. Because FCS-PrivMod is<br>\nnot published in archival form, we also welcome papers that overlap<br>\nwith papers recently or simultaneously submitted for publication. In<br>\nsuch cases, overlaps should be clearly cited and the potential to<br>\ngenerate interesting discussion at the workshop will be a factor in<br>\nthe selection process.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>Automated reasoning<br>\nDecidability &amp; complexity<br>\nFormal methods<br>\nFoundations of verification<br>\nInformation flow analysis<br>\nLanguage-based security<br>\nLinkability &amp; traceability<br>\nLogic-based design<br>\nProgram transformation<br>\nSecurity models<br>\nStatic analysis<br>\nStatistical methods<br>\nTools<br>\nTrust management<br>\nVerification    </p>\n<p>for </p>\n<p>Anonymity &amp; pseudonymity<br>\nAccess control and resource usage control<br>\nAuthentication<br>\nAvailability and denial of service<br>\nCloud computing<br>\nCommunication<br>\nConfidentiality<br>\nElectronic voting<br>\nHealth care<br>\nIntegrity and privacy<br>\nIntrusion detection<br>\nMobile computing<br>\nMutual distrust<br>\nPrivacy<br>\nRFID<br>\nSocial networks<br>\nSecurity policies<br>\nSecurity protocols</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION<br>\n==========<br>\nAll submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must<br>\nguarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.</p>\n<p>Submissions should be at most 15 pages (a4 paper, 11pt), including<br>\nreferences in the Springer LNCS style available at the URL<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a></p>\n<p>The cover page should include title, names of authors, coordinates of<br>\nthe corresponding author, an abstract, and a list of<br>\nkeywords. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected<br>\nimmediately. Additional material intended for the referees but not for<br>\npublication in the final version - for example details of proofs - may<br>\nbe placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the<br>\npage limit.</p>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit their papers electronically, as portable<br>\ndocument format (pdf) or postscript (ps); please, do not send files<br>\nformatted for word processing packages (e.g., Microsoft Word or<br>\nWordperfect files). The only mechanism for paper submissions will be<br>\nthrough the dedicated easychair submission web page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fcsprivmod2010\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fcsprivmod2010</a></p>\n<p>PUBLICATION<br>\n===========<br>\nInformal proceedings will be made available in electronic format and<br>\nthey will be distributed to all participants of the workshop.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>\n=================</p>\n<p>* Myrto Arapinis (University of Birmingham, UK)<br>\n  * Kostas Chatzikokolakis (University of Eindhoven, Netherlands)<br>\n  * Liqun Chen (HP Labs Bristol, UK)<br>\n  * Stephen Chong (Harvard University, USA)<br>\n  * Tom Chothia (University of Birmingham, UK)<br>\n  * Veronique Cortier (LORIA INRIA-Lorraine, France; co-chair)<br>\n  * George Danezis (Microsoft Cambridge, UK)<br>\n  * StÃ©phanie Delaune (CNRS - ENS de Cachan, France)<br>\n  * Deepak Garg (Carnegie Mellon University, USA)<br>\n  * Hans HÃ¼ttel (Aalborg University, Denmark)<br>\n  * Steven Murdoch (University of Cambridge, UK)<br>\n  * Catuscia Palamidessi (INRIA and Ecole Polytechnique, France)<br>\n  * Mark Ryan (University of Birmingham, UK; co-chair)<br>\n  * Pierangela Samarati (Universita` degli Studi di Milano, Italy)<br>\n  * Vitaly Shmatikov (University of Texas at Austin, USA; co-chair)<br>\n  * Ben Smyth (University of Birmingham, UK &amp; ENS Paris, France)<br>\n  * Paul Syverson (Naval Research Laboratory, USA)<br>\n  * Gene Tsudik (University of California, Irvine, USA)<br>\n  * Luca Vigano (University of Verona, Italy)</p>",
