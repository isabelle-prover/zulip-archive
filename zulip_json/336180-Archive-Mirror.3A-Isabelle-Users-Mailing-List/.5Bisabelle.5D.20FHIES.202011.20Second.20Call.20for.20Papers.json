The <br>\nuse of software in medical devices is already raising issues in relation <br>\nto safety and efficacy for manufacturers and regulators. Health <br>\ninformation systems raise issues of both privacy and confidentiality, on <br>\nthe one hand, and, increasingly, patient safety on the other. Hospital <br>\nand other information systems raise important issues of efficacy and <br>\ninteroperability. However, to capitalize on the potential of this <br>\ntechnology in reshaping healthcare demands focused research on sound and <br>\nsafe development techniques from software engineering, electronic <br>\nengineering, computing science, information science, mathematics, and <br>\nindustrial engineering.</p>\n<p>Aims<br>\n=====<br>\nThe purpose of the new symposium series on Foundations of Software <br>\nEngineering Health Informatics (FHIES) is to promote a nascent research <br>\narea that aims to develop and apply theories and techniques in computing <br>\nscience and software engineering to modelling, building and certifying <br>\nsoftware based systems in the application domain of healthcare. Many of <br>\nthese systems are already regulated in many jurisdictions and many more <br>\nof them will become regulated in the future.</p>\n<p>Research on theories, techniques and tools of software modelling, <br>\nverification and validation has been an important area of computer <br>\nscience and software engineering, known as Formal Methods. This research <br>\naddresses the challenging problem of design and certification of safety <br>\nor mission critical software systems through abstraction and <br>\ndecomposition techniques based on the use of mathematical modelling <br>\ntheories and sound engineering methods. Formal methods have primarily <br>\naddressed the correctness of systems used in the industrial, financial, <br>\nand defense applications. However, they have recently found application <br>\nin modelling and analysis of complex systems that involve interacting <br>\nbehaviour of many kinds of objects and agents, including software <br>\nsystems, physical objects and humans. The models of these systems have <br>\nboth discrete and continuous behaviour, and both qualitative and <br>\nquantitative (e.g., spatial timing and probabilistic) properties. It is <br>\nbelieved that these methods can be used for modelling problems of health <br>\ninformatics, which presents the challenge of scalability.</p>\n<p>Software plays a critical role in sustainable health care, both as part <br>\nof the solution and as part of the problem. Software intensive <br>\ninformation systems are needed to support the collection and processing <br>\nof vast amounts of data via different devices, and allow policy makers <br>\nto access and share these data, and to support their decision making and <br>\nvalidation. Software systems can be developed for managing, controlling <br>\nand monitoring policies, processes and workflows in medical systems. <br>\nSoftware systems can be developed to help create the sophisticated <br>\nmedical devices that are simply impossible to build without the <br>\nsoftware. On the other hand, the application of software raises <br>\nchallenging issues in safety, security and privacy, and increases the <br>\ncomplexity of healthcare workflows and the need for new business policies.</p>\n<p>Paper Submissions<br>\n==============</p>\n<p>We solicit high quality submissions reporting on</p>\n<p>1. original research contributions (18 pages maximum in LNCS format)<br>\n    2. application experience, case studies and software prototypes (18 <br>\npages maximum in LNCS format)</p>\n<p>3. surveys, comparisons, and state-of-the-art reports (18 pages <br>\nmaximum in LNCS format)</p>\n<p>4. position papers that define research projects with identified <br>\nchallenges and milestones (10 pages maximum in LNCS format)</p>\n<p>5. proposals for panel discussions, with at least three named <br>\npanellists, about a topical question (5 pages maximum in LNCS format).</p>\n<p>All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution <br>\nto the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the <br>\nconference. Submissions should be in English, prepared in the LNCS <br>\nformat (see here for details). Submission constitutes a commitment to <br>\nattend and present a paper, if accepted.</p>\n<p>All accepted papers will be included in the pre-event proceedings of the <br>\nsymposium and considered for EXCEPT FOR the proposals for panel <br>\ndiscussions inclusion in a special issue of the Springer Innovations in <br>\nSystems and Software Engineering (ISSE), following revision and <br>\nre-review..
