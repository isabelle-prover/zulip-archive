The use of software in medical <br>\ndevices is already raising issues in relation to safety and efficacy for <br>\nmanufacturers and regulators. Health information systems raise  issues <br>\nof both privacy and confidentiality, on the one hand, and, increasingly, <br>\npatient safety on the other. Hospital and other information systems <br>\nraise important issues of efficacy and interoperability. However, to <br>\ncapitalize on the potential of this technology in reshaping healthcare <br>\ndemands focused research on sound  and safe development techniques from <br>\nsoftware engineering, electronic  engineering, computing science, <br>\ninformation science, mathematics, and  industrial engineering.</p>\n<p>Aims<br>\n=====<br>\nThe purpose of the new symposium series on Foundations of Software <br>\nEngineering Health Informatics (FHIES) is to promote a nascent research <br>\narea that aims to develop and apply theories and techniques in computing <br>\nscience and software engineering to modelling, building and certifying <br>\nsoftware based systems in the application domain of healthcare. Many of <br>\nthese systems are already regulated in many jurisdictions and many more <br>\nof them will become regulated in the future.</p>\n<p>Research on theories, techniques and tools of software modelling, <br>\nverification and validation has been an important area of computer <br>\nscience and software engineering, known as Formal Methods. This research <br>\naddresses the challenging problem of design and certification of safety <br>\nor mission critical software systems through abstraction and <br>\ndecomposition techniques based on the use of mathematical modelling <br>\ntheories and sound engineering methods. Formal methods have primarily <br>\naddressed the correctness of systems used in the industrial, financial, <br>\nand defence applications. However, they have recently found application <br>\nin modelling and analysis of complex systems that involve interacting <br>\nbehaviour of many kinds of objects and agents, including software <br>\nsystems, physical objects and humans. The models of these systems have <br>\nboth discrete and continuous behaviour, and both qualitative and <br>\nquantitative (e.g., spatial timing and probabilistic) properties. It is <br>\nbelieved that these methods can be used for modelling problems of health <br>\ninformatics, which presents the challenge of scalability. Software plays <br>\na critical role in sustainable health care, both as part of the solution <br>\nand as part of the problem. Software intensive information systems are <br>\nneeded to support the collection and processing of vast amounts of data <br>\nvia different devices, and allow policy makers to access and share these <br>\ndata, and to support their decision making and validation. Software <br>\nsystems can be developed for managing, controlling and monitoring <br>\npolicies, processes and workflows in medical systems. Software systems <br>\ncan be developed to help create the sophisticated medical devices that <br>\nare simply impossible to build without the software. On the other hand, <br>\nthe application of software raises challenging issues in safety, <br>\nsecurity and privacy, and increases the complexity of healthcare <br>\nworkflows and the need for new business policies.</p>\n<p>Paper Submissions<br>\n==============</p>\n<p>We solicit high quality submissions reporting on</p>\n<p>1. original research contributions (18 pages maximum in LNCS format)<br>\n    2. application experience, case studies and software prototypes (18 <br>\npages maximum in LNCS format)</p>\n<p>3. surveys, comparisons, and state-of-the-art reports (18 pages <br>\nmaximum in LNCS format)</p>\n<p>4. position papers that define research projects with identified <br>\nchallenges and milestones (10 pages maximum in LNCS format)</p>\n<p>5. proposals for panel discussions, with at least three named <br>\npanellists, about a topical question (5 pages maximum in LNCS format).</p>\n<p>All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution <br>\nto the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the <br>\nconference.
