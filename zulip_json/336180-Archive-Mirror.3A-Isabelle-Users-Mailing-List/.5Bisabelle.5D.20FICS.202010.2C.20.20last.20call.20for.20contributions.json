The construction and properties of fixed points have been<br>\ninvestigated in many different frameworks such as: design and<br>\nimplementation of programming languages, program logics,<br>\ndatabases. The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for<br>\nresearchers to present their results to those members of the computer<br>\nscience and logic communities who study or apply the theory of fixed<br>\npoints. Previous workshops were held in Brno (1998, MFCS/CSL<br>\nworkshop), Paris (2000, LC workshop), Florence (2001, PLI workshop),<br>\nCopenhagen (2002, LICS (FLoC) workshop), Warsaw (2003, ETAPS<br>\nworkshop), Coimbra (2009, CSL workshop).</p>\n<p>Topics include, but are not restricted to:</p>\n<p>* categorical, metric and ordered fixed point models<br>\n     * fixed points in algebra and coalgebra<br>\n     * fixed points in languages and automata<br>\n     * fixed points in programming language semantics<br>\n     * the mu-calculus and fixed points in modal logic<br>\n     * fixed points in process algebras and process calculi<br>\n     * fixed points in the lambda-calculus,<br>\n         functional programming and type theory</p>\n<p>* fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits<br>\n     * fixed points in logic programming and theorem proving<br>\n     * finite model theory, descriptive complexity theory,<br>\n         fixed points in databases</p>\n<p>Invited speakers</p>\n<p>* Arnaud Carayol, Laboratoire d'informatique Gaspard-Monge.<br>\n     * Panos Rondogiannis, University of Athens.<br>\n     * Dale Miller, INRIA and LIX.</p>\n<p>Contributed talks</p>\n<p>Selection of contributed talks is based on extended abstracts/short<br>\npapers of 3...6 pp formatted with easychair.cls. Submission is via<br>\nEasyChair, by <em>June 13 2010</em>. The authors will be notified of<br>\nacceptance/rejection by July 10 2010.  Camera-ready versions of the<br>\naccepted contributions will be published for distribution at the<br>\nworkshop as a technical report.</p>\n<p>Journal publication</p>\n<p>If the number and quality of submissions and accepted talks warrant<br>\nthis, EDP Sciences will publish a special issue of Theoretical<br>\nInformatics and Applications. With one exception, the special issues<br>\nof the previous FICS editions appeared in this journal. The special<br>\nissue of FICS 2009 will also appear there.</p>\n<p>FICS Program Committee</p>\n<p>Thorsten Altenkirch (University of Nottingham)<br>\nGiovanna d'Agostino (University of Udine)<br>\nPeter Dybjer (Chalmers University of Technology)<br>\nZoltán Ésik (University of Szeged)<br>\nAnna Ingólfsdóttir (Reykjavík University)<br>\nGerhard Jäger (University of Bern)<br>\nRalph Matthes (IRIT, Toulouse)<br>\nAndrzej Murawski (University of Oxford)<br>\nDamian Niwinski (Warsaw University)<br>\nLuigi Santocanale (LIF, Marseille)<br>\nAlex Simpson (University of Edinburgh)<br>\nJean-Marc Talbot  (LIF, Marseille)<br>\nTarmo Uustalu (Institute of Cybernetics, Tallinn)<br>\nYde Venema (University of Amsterdam)<br>\nIgor Walukiewicz (LaBRI, Bordeaux)</p>\n<p>Sponsors</p>\n<p>Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale de Marseille<br>\nUniversité de Provence</p>",
