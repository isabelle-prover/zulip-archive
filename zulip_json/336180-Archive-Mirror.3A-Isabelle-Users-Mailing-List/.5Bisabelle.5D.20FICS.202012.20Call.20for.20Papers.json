The<br>\nconstruction and properties of fixed points have been investigated in many<br>\ndifferent frameworks such as: design and implementation of programming<br>\nlanguages, program logics, databases. The aim of this workshop is to<br>\nprovide a forum for researchers to present their results to those members<br>\nof the computer science and logic communities who study or apply the<br>\ntheory of fixed points. Previous workshops were held in Brno (1998,<br>\nMFCS/CSL workshop), Paris (2000, LC workshop), Florence (2001, PLI<br>\nworkshop), Copenhagen (2002, LICS (FLoC) workshop), Warsaw (2003, ETAPS<br>\nworkshop), Coimbra (2009, CSL workshop) and Brno (2010, MFCS/CSL<br>\nworkshop).</p>\n<p>Topics include, but are not restricted to:</p>\n<p>* categorical, metric and ordered fixed point models<br>\n   * fixed points in algebra and coalgebra<br>\n   * fixed points in languages and automata<br>\n   * fixed points in programming language semantics<br>\n   * the mu-calculus and fixed points in modal logic<br>\n   * fixed points in process algebras and process calculi<br>\n   * fixed points in the lambda-calculus, functional programming and type<br>\ntheory</p>\n<p>* fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits<br>\n   * fixed points in logic programming and theorem proving<br>\n   * finite model theory, descriptive complexity theory, fixed points in<br>\ndatabases</p>\n<p>Invited speakers: TBA</p>\n<p>Submission:</p>\n<p>Selection of contributed talks is based on extended abstracts/short papers<br>\nof 6 pages formatted with easychair.cls. Submission is via EasyChair in<br>\ntwo stages: titles and abstracts by 4 December, and extended<br>\nabstracts/short papers by 11 December. The authors will be notified of<br>\nacceptance/rejection by 21 January 2012. We will distribute the short<br>\npapers presented at the meeting via the open source repository EPTCS.</p>\n<p>Journal publication:</p>\n<p>If the number and quality of submissions and accepted talks warrant this,<br>\na special issue of an internationally recognized journal devoted to the<br>\nevent will be published.</p>\n<p>FICS Program Committee:</p>\n<p>PC co-Chairs:</p>\n<p>* Dale Miller, INRIA-Saclay, France<br>\n   * Zoltan Esik, University of Szeged, Hungary</p>\n<p>PC members:</p>\n<p>* Achim Jung, University of Birmingham, UK<br>\n   * Arnaud Carayol, Institut Gaspard-Monge, France<br>\n   * David Baelde, University of Paris 11, France<br>\n   * Fabio Gadducci, University of Pisa, Italy<br>\n   * Igor Walukiewicz, LaBRI Bordeaux, France<br>\n   * Irene Guessarian, University of Paris 7, France<br>\n   * Jan Rutten, Radboud University, Holland<br>\n   * Julian Bradfield, University of Edinburgh, UK<br>\n   * Luigi Santocanale, Université Aix-Marseille I, France<br>\n   * Ralph Matthes, IRIT Toulouse, France<br>\n   * Stephan Kreutzer, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany<br>\n   * Tarmo Uustalu, Institute of Cybernetics, Estonia<br>\n   * Wan Fokkink, Vrije Universiteit, Holland</p>",
