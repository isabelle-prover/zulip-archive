Certification here means formal,<br>\nmechanized verification of some sort, preferably with production of<br>\nindependently checkable certificates.</p>\n<p>Important dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>- Abstract submission deadline:   Fri 6 Oct 2017<br>\n  - Full paper submission deadline: Wed 11 Oct 2017<br>\n  - Notification:                   Tue 14 Nov 2017<br>\n  - Camera-ready deadline:          Sun 26 Nov 2017<br>\n  - Conference dates:               Mon 8 - Tue 9 Jan 2018</p>\n<p>Topics of interest</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We welcome submissions in research areas related to formal<br>\ncertification of programs and proofs. The following is a suggested<br>\nlist of topics of interests to CPP. This is a non-exhaustive list and<br>\nshould be read as a guideline rather than a requirement.</p>\n<p>- certified or certifying programming, compilation, linking, OS<br>\n    kernels, runtime systems, and security monitors;</p>\n<p>- program logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code;<br>\n  - certified decision procedures, mathematical libraries, and<br>\n    mathematical theorems;</p>\n<p>- proof assistants and proof theory;<br>\n  - new languages and tools for certified programming;<br>\n  - program analysis, program verification, and proof-carrying code;<br>\n  - certified secure protocols and transactions;<br>\n  - certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra,<br>\n    polynomial systems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of<br>\n    interest;</p>\n<p>- certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality,<br>\n    first-order logic, and higher-order unification;</p>\n<p>- certificates for program termination;<br>\n  - logics for certifying concurrent and distributed programs;<br>\n  - higher-order logics, logical systems, separation logics, and logics<br>\n    for security;</p>\n<p>- teaching mathematics and computer science with proof assistants.</p>\n<p>Submission Guidelines</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Papers should be submitted in PDF format through the EasyChair<br>\nsubmission page at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2018\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpp2018</a></p>\n<p>Submitted papers must be formatted following the ACM SIGPLAN<br>\nProceedings format using the acmart format with the sigplan option,<br>\nusing 10 point font for the main text.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/\">http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/</a></p>\n<p>Submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages, including tables and<br>\nfigures, but excluding bibliography. Shorter papers are welcome and<br>\nwill be given equal consideration.</p>\n<p>Abstracts must be submitted by October 6, 2017 (AOE). The deadline for<br>\nfull papers is October 11, 2017 (AOE), and authors have the option to<br>\nwithdraw their papers during the window between the two.</p>\n<p>Submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient detail<br>\nto allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper. They<br>\nshould begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the<br>\nmain results, and a brief explanation of their significance and<br>\nrelevance to the conference, all phrased for the<br>\nnon-specialist. Technical and formal developments directed to the<br>\nspecialist should follow. References and comparisons with related work<br>\nshould be included. Papers not conforming to the above requirements<br>\nconcerning format and length may be rejected without further<br>\nconsideration.</p>\n<p>Whenever appropriate, the submission should come along with a formal<br>\ndevelopment, using whatever prover, e.g., Agda, Coq, Dafny, Elf, HOL,<br>\nHOL-Light, Isabelle, Lean, Matita, Mizar, NQTHM, PVS, Vampire,<br>\netc. Such formal developments must be submitted together with the<br>\npaper as auxiliary material, and will be taken into account during the<br>\nreviewing process.</p>\n<p>The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication<br>\nelsewhere, including the proceedings of other published conferences or<br>\nworkshops. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work<br>\nsubmitted to a conference or journal in advance of<br>\nsubmission. Original formal proofs of known results in mathematics or<br>\ncomputer science are welcome. One author of each accepted paper is<br>\nexpected to present it at the conference.</p>\n<p>For any questions about the formatting or submission of papers, please<br>\nconsult the PC chairs.</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Brigitte Pientka (McGill University, Canada)<br>\n  René Thiemann (University of Innsbruck, Austria)</p>\n<p>CPP’18 invited speakers are generously funded in part by Galois.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Reynald Affeldt (AIST, Japan)<br>\n  June Andronick (Data61, CSIRO and UNSW, Australia), co-chair<br>\n  Lennart Beringer (Princeton University, USA)<br>\n  Jasmin Blanchette (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands)<br>\n  Sandrine Blazy (University of Rennes 1, France)<br>\n  Sylvie Boldo (Inria and Université Paris-Saclay, France)<br>\n  James Cheney (University of Edinburgh, UK)<br>\n  Amy Felty (University of Ottawa, Canada), co-chair<br>\n  Elsa Gunter (University of Illinois, USA)<br>\n  Reiner Hähnle (Technical University Darmstadt, Germany)<br>\n  Marieke Huisman (University of Twente, Netherlands)<br>\n  Warren A.
