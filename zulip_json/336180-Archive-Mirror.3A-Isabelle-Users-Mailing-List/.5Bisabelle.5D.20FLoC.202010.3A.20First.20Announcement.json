It was modeled after the<br>\n  successful Federated Computer Research Conference (FCRC), and synergetically<br>\n  brought together conferences that apply logic to computer science.  The<br>\n  second Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'99) was held in Trento, Italy,<br>\n  in 1999, the third (FLoC'02) was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2002, and<br>\n  the fourth (FLoC'06) was held in Seattle, Washington, USA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We are pleased to announce the fifth Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'10)<br>\n  to be held in Edinburgh, Scotland, U.K. (<a href=\"http://www.edinburgh.org\">www.edinburgh.org</a>), in July 2010,<br>\n  at the School of Informatics at University of Edinburgh (<a href=\"http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk\">www.inf.ed.ac.uk</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The following conferences will participate in FLoC:<br>\n  Int'l Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV)<br>\n  Int'l Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP)<br>\n  Int'l Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR)<br>\n  Int'l Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP)<br>\n  IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)<br>\n  Int'l Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA)<br>\n  Int'l Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pre-conference workshops will be held on July 9-10.  ITP, LICS, RTA, and SAT<br>\n  will be held in parallel on July 11-14, to be followed by mid-conference<br>\n  workshops on July 14-15. CAV, ICLP, and IJCAR will be held in parallel on<br>\n  July 16-19, to be followed by post-conference workshops on July 20-21.<br>\n  Plenary events involving all the conferences are planned. There will be<br>\n  receptions in the Edinburgh Castle and at the National Galleries of Scotland.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The call for workshop proposals can be found at the FLoC web page<br>\n  (<a href=\"http://www.floc-conference.org\">http://www.floc-conference.org</a>).
