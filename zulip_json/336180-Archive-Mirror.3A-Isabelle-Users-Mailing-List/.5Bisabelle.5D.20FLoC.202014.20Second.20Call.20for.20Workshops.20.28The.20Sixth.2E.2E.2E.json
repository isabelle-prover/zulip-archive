Each workshop proposal must indicate at least one <br>\nconference to be affiliated with, and among those exactly one primary <br>\nhosting conference.</p>\n<p>It is suggested that prospective workshop organizers contact the <br>\nrelevant conference Workshop Chair(s) before submitting a proposal.</p>\n<p>Proposals should be submitted electronically to EasyChair at the <br>\nfollowing address:  <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc14cfw\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc14cfw</a></p>\n<p>Proposals should consist of two parts. First, a short scientific <br>\njustification of the proposed topic, its significance, and the <br>\nparticular benefits of the workshop to the community, as well as a list <br>\nof previous or related workshops (if relevant). A second, organizational <br>\npart should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>contact information of the workshop organizers</li>\n<li>\n<p>proposed primary hosting conference (and possibly other affiliated <br>\nconference(s))</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>estimate of the audience size</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>proposed format and agenda (for example, paper presentations, <br>\ntutorials, demo sessions, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>potential invited speakers</p>\n</li>\n<li>procedures for selecting papers and participants</li>\n<li>plans for dissemination, if any (for example, special issues of journals)</li>\n<li>duration (which may vary from one day to two days) and preferred period</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The FLoC Organizing Committee will determine the final list of accepted <br>\nworkshops based on the recommendations from the Workshop Chairs of the <br>\nhosting conferences and subject to the availability of space and facilities.</p>\n<p>Further information can be found at the FLoC 2014 Workshop Guide<br>\n<a href=\"http://vsl2014.at/floc-ws/\">http://vsl2014.at/floc-ws/</a></p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>Submission of workshop proposals: by September 30, 2013<br>\nNotification: by November, 2013<br>\nPre-FLoC workshops: Saturday &amp; Sunday, July 12-13<br>\nMid-FLoC workshops: Thursday &amp; Friday, July 17-18<br>\nPost-FLoC workshops: Wednesday &amp; Thursday, July 23-24</p>\n<p>CONTACT INFORMATION</p>\n<p>Questions regarding workshop proposals should be sent to the workshop <br>\nchairs of conferences that are supposed to host the workshop (see <br>\nabove).
