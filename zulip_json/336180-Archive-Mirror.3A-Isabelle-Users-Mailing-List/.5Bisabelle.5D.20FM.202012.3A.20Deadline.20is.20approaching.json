The symposia have been notably successful in bringing<br>\ntogether innovators and practitioners in precise mathematical methods<br>\nfor software and systems development, industrial users as well as<br>\nresearchers. Submissions are welcomed in the form of original papers<br>\non research and industrial experience, proposals for workshops and<br>\ntutorials, entries for the exhibition of software tools and projects,<br>\nand reports on ongoing doctoral work.</p>\n<p>The FM 2012 Symposium will be based around the theme Interdisciplinary<br>\nFormal Methods</p>\n<p>It will have the goal  of highlighting the development and application<br>\nof formal methods in connection with  a variety of disciplines such as<br>\nmedicine,  biology,  human    cognitive modelling, human    automation<br>\ninteractions  and  aeronautics, among others.   FM  2012  particularly<br>\nwelcomes   papers    on   techniques,    tools   and  experiences   in<br>\ninterdisciplinary frameworks, as well as  on experience with practical<br>\napplications  of formal methods  in  industrial and research settings,<br>\nexperimental validation of tools and  methods as well as  construction<br>\nand evolution of formal methods tools.</p>\n<p>The broad topics of interest for FM 2012 include but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>Interdisciplinary   formal     methods:  techniques,  tools    and<br>\n   experiences   demonstrating  formal methods   in interdisciplinary<br>\n   frameworks; we  encourage  submissions  involving  formal  methods<br>\n   related to maintenance, human automation interaction, human in the<br>\n   loop, system engineering, medicine and biology.</p>\n<p>Formal methods in practice: industrial applications of formal<br>\n   methods, experience with introducing formal methods in industry,<br>\n   tool usage reports, experiments with challenge problems. Authors<br>\n   are encouraged to explain how the use of formal methods has<br>\n   overcome problems, lead to improvements in design or provided new<br>\n   insights.</p>\n<p>Tools for formal  methods: advances in automated  verification and<br>\n   model-checking, integration  of   tools, environments  for  formal<br>\n   methods, experimental validation of  tools. Authors are encouraged<br>\n   to demonstrate empirically    that  the new  tool   or environment<br>\n   advances the state of the art.</p>\n<p>Role  of  formal methods in    software and  systems  engineering:<br>\n   development  processes  with formal  methods, usage guidelines for<br>\n   formal methods,   method integration. Authors  are  encouraged  to<br>\n   demonstrate    that process  innovations  lead  to  qualitative or<br>\n   quantitative improvements.</p>\n<p>Theoretical foundations: all aspects of theory related to<br>\n   specification, verification, refinement, and static and dynamic<br>\n   analysis. Authors are encouraged to explain how their results<br>\n   contribute to the solution of practical problems with methods or<br>\n   tools.</p>\n<p>Teaching formal methods:   original  contributions  that   provide<br>\n   insight, evaluations  and   suggestions  for  courses  of   action<br>\n   regarding the  teaching   of  formal methods, including   teaching<br>\n   experiences,   educational resources,  the   integration of formal<br>\n   methods  into the curriculum, the  definition  of a formal methods<br>\n   body of  knowledge,  etc. Authors are  encouraged to  provide some<br>\n   form of evaluation and assessment  of the content and approach  in<br>\n   the teaching being reported.</p>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSION</p>\n<p>Papers will  be evaluated by at  least three  members of the Programme<br>\nCommittee. They  should be in   Springer LNCS format and  describe, in<br>\nEnglish, original   work  that has  not   been published or  submitted<br>\nelsewhere.</p>\n<p>PDF   versions of  papers should  be  submitted  through  the  FM 2012<br>\nEasyChair web site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=fm2012\">https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=fm2012</a></p>\n<p>We solicit two categories of papers:</p>\n<p>Regular papers  not exceeding  15  pages  (including  appendices),<br>\n   describing fully   developed  work. Authors  of  papers  reporting<br>\n   experimental  work  are     strongly encouraged  to make     their<br>\n   experimental results  available  for use by reviewers.  Similarly,<br>\n   case study papers should describe significant case studies and the<br>\n   complete  development  should  be    made available  for  use   by<br>\n   reviewers.</p>\n<p>Tools papers   of a   maximum   of  4  pages should   describe  an<br>\n   operational  tool and its   contributions;  2 additional pages  of<br>\n   appendices are  allowed   that   will not  be  included    in  the<br>\n   proceedings. Tool papers should explain enhancements made compared<br>\n   to  previously published work.  A tool paper  need not present the<br>\n   theory behind the tool but can focus more on its features, and how<br>\n   it   is used, with  screen  shots  and  examples. Authors of tools<br>\n   papers should make their tool available for use by reviewers.</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION</p>\n<p>Accepted  papers will be  published  in the Symposium Proceedings,  to<br>\nappear in Springer's Lectures Notes in Computer Science.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>\n<p>Submission: March 5th, 2012<br>\nNotification: May 7th, 2012<br>\nCamera ready: June 4th, 2012</p>\n<p>GENERAL CHAIRS:</p>\n<p>Kamel Barkaoui - Cedric, Cnam Paris<br>\nBeatrice Berard - LIP6, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie</p>\n<p>PC CHAIRS:</p>\n<p>Dimitra Giannakopoulou, NASA Ames, Research Center, Moffett Field<br>\nDominique Mery, LORIA et Universite Henri Poincare Nancy 1</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE:</p>\n<p>Yamine Ait Ameur, IRIT/ENSEEIHT France<br>\nKeijiro Araki, Kyushu University, Japan<br>\nJos Baeten, CWI Amsterdam, The Netherlands<br>\nHoward Barringer, The University of Manchester, UK<br>\nSaddek Bensalem, Universite Joseph Fourier, France<br>\nBruno Blanchet, LIENS, France<br>\nAhmed Bouajjani, LIAFA, Universite Paris 7, France<br>\nPatricia Bouyer, LSV, CNRS&amp;   ENS Cachan, France<br>\nVictor Braberman, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina<br>\nMichael Butler, University of Southampton, UK<br>\nAndrew Butterfield, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland<br>\nAna Cavalcanti, University of York, UK<br>\nKrishnendu Chatterjee, Institute of Science and Technology , Austria<br>\nMarsha Chechik, University of Toronto, Canada<br>\nYu-Fang Chen, Academia Sinica, Taiwan<br>\nLeonardo De Moura, Microsoft Research, USA<br>\nDino Distefano, Queen Mary, University of London, UK<br>\nMatt Dwyer, University of Nebraska, USA<br>\nBernd Finkbeiner, Saarland University, Germany<br>\nJohn Fitzgerald, Newcastle University, UK<br>\n(chair) Dimitra Giannakopoulou, NASA Ames, USA<br>\nStefania Gnesi, ISTI-CNR, Italy<br>\nPatrice Godefroid, Microsoft Research, USA<br>\nGanesh Gopalakrishnan, University of Utah, USA<br>\nKim Guldstrand Larsen, Aalborg University, Denmark<br>\nKlaus Havelund, JPL, California Institute of Technology, USA<br>\nIan J.
