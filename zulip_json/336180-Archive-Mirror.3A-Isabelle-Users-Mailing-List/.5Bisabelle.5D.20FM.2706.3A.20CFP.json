The symposia have been notably successful in<br>\nbringing together innovators and practitioners in precise mathematical<br>\nmethods for software development, industrial users as well as<br>\nresearchers.  Submissions are welcomed in the form of original papers on<br>\nresearch and industrial experience, proposals for workshops and<br>\ntutorials, entries for the exhibition of software tools and projects, and<br>\nreports on ongoing doctoral work.</p>\n<p>FM'06 welcomes all aspects of formal methods research, both theoretical<br>\nand practical.  We are particularly interested in the experience of<br>\napplying formal methods in practice.  The broad topics of interest of<br>\nthis conference are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Tools for formal methods: tool support and software engineering,<br>\n  environments for formal methods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical foundations: specification and modelling, refining, static<br>\n  analysis, model-checking, verification, calculation, reusable domain<br>\n  theories.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal methods in practice: experience with introducing formal methods<br>\n  in industry, case studies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Role of formal methods: formal methods in hardware and system design,<br>\n  method integration, development process.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TECHNICAL PAPERS<br>\nFull papers should be submitted via the web site.  Papers will be<br>\nevaluated by the Program Committee according to their originality,<br>\nsignificance, soundness, quality of presentation and relevance with<br>\nrespect to the main issues of the symposium.  Accepted papers will be<br>\npublished in the Symposium Proceedings, to appear in Springer's Lecture<br>\nNotes in Computer Science series, <a href=\"http://www.springeronline.com/lncs\">http://www.springeronline.com/lncs</a> .<br>\nSubmitted papers should have not been submitted elsewhere for<br>\npublication, should be in Springer's format, (see Springer's web site),<br>\nand should not exceed 16 pages including appendices.  A prize for the<br>\nbest technical paper will be awarded at the symposium.</p>\n<p>INDUSTRIAL USAGE REPORTS<br>\nOne day will be dedicated to sharing the experience -- both positive and<br>\nnegative -- with using formal methods in industrial environments.  The<br>\nIndustry Day is organized by ForTIA, the Formal Techniques Industry<br>\nAssociation, <a href=\"http://www.fortia.org\">http://www.fortia.org</a> .  This year's Industry Day<br>\ninvestigates the use of formal methods in security and trust.  Invited<br>\npapers on organizational and technical issues will be presented.<br>\nInquiries should be directed to the Industry Day Chairs; see the web site<br>\nfor details.</p>\n<p>WORKSHOPS<br>\nWe welcome proposals for one-day or one-and-a-half-day workshops related<br>\nto FM'06.  In particular, but not exclusively, we encourage proposals for<br>\nworkshops on various application domains.  Proposals should be directed<br>\nto the Workshop Chair.</p>\n<p>TUTORIALS<br>\nWe are soliciting proposals for full-day or half-day tutorials.  The<br>\ntutorial contents can be selected from a wide range of topics that<br>\nreflect the conference themes and provide clear utility to practitioners.<br>\nEach proposal will be evaluated on importance, relevance, timeliness,<br>\naudience appeal and past experience and qualification of the instructors.<br>\nProposals should be directed to the Tutorial Chair.</p>\n<p>POSTER AND TOOL EXHIBITION<br>\nAn exhibition of both research projects and commercial tools will<br>\naccompany the technical symposium, with the opportunity of holding<br>\nscheduled presentations of commercial tools.  Proposals should be<br>\ndirected to the Poster and Tools Exhibition Chair.</p>\n<p>DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM<br>\nFor the first time, FM'06 will feature a doctoral symposium.  Students<br>\nare invited to submit work in progress and to defend it in front of<br>\n\"friendly examiners\".  Participation for students who are accepted will<br>\nbe subsidized.  Submissions should be directed to the Doctoral Symposium<br>\nChair.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION DATES<br>\nTechnical Papers, Workshops, Tutorials: Friday, February 24, 2006<br>\nPosters and Tools, Doctoral Symposium: Friday, May 26, 2006</p>\n<p>NOTIFICATION DATES<br>\nTechnical Papers: Friday, April 28, 2006<br>\nWorkshops, Tutorials: Friday, March 10, 2006<br>\nPosters and Tools, Doctoral Symposium: Friday, June 9, 2006</p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION<br>\nGeneral Chair: Emil Sekerinski (McMaster)<br>\nProgram Chairs: Jayadev Misra (U.
