In 2005, the bi-annual FMCAD and sister conference CHARME <br>\ndecided to merge to form an annual conference with a unified community. <br>\nThe resulting unified FMCAD provides a leading international forum to <br>\nresearchers and practitioners in academia and industry for presenting <br>\nand discussing groundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical <br>\nresults, and tools for formally reasoning about computing systems, as <br>\nwell as open challenges therein. FMCAD 2007 will include a full day of <br>\ntutorials, and will be co-located with the ACL2 Workshop. Topics of <br>\ninterest for the technical program include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Foundations: advancing industrial-strength technologies in model <br>\nchecking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and <br>\nrefinement techniques, property-preserving reduction techniques, <br>\ncompositional methods, decision procedures, SAT- and BDD-based methods, <br>\ncombining deductive methods with decision procedures, and probabilistic <br>\nmethods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Verification applications: tools, industrial experience reports, and <br>\ncase studies.  We encourage the submission of materials relating to <br>\nnovel and challenging industrial-scale applications of formal methods, <br>\nincluding problem domains where formal methods worked well or even fell <br>\nshort. We also encourage submissions relating to the development and <br>\nexecution of methodologies for formal and informal verification strategies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of formal methods in design: topics relating to the <br>\napplication and applicability of assertion-based verification, <br>\nequivalence checking, transaction-level verification, semi-formal <br>\nverification, runtime verification, simulation and testcase generation, <br>\ncoverage analysis, microcode verification, embedded systems, software <br>\nverification, concurrent systems, timing verification, and formal <br>\napproaches to performance and power.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Model-based approaches: modeling and specification languages, <br>\nsystem-level design and verification, design derivation and <br>\ntransformation, and correct-by-construction methods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal methods for the design and verification of emerging and novel <br>\ntechnologies: nano, quantum, biological, video, gaming, and multimedia <br>\napplications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS<br>\n==========================================================================<br>\nSubmissions must be made electronically in PDF format through the FMCAD <br>\nWeb site,   <a href=\"http://fmcad.org/2007\">http://fmcad.org/2007</a>. The proceedings will be published by <br>\nthe IEEE and will be available online in the ACM Digital Library and the <br>\nIEEE Xplore Digital Library. There are two categories of papers:</p>\n<p>A. REGULAR PAPERS</p>\n<p>Regular papers are limited to 8 pages using the IEEE Transactions format <br>\non letter-size paper with a 10-point font size (see <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html\">http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html</a>). We <br>\nrecommend that self-citations be written in the third person, though <br>\nauthors will be required to identify themselves on their submissions. <br>\nSubmissions must contain original research that has not been previously <br>\npublished, nor concurrently submitted for publication. Any partial <br>\noverlap with any published or concurrently submitted paper must be <br>\nclearly indicated. If experimental results are reported, authors are <br>\nstrongly encouraged to provide adequate access to their data so that <br>\nresults can be independently verified. Papers should contain a short <br>\nabstract of approximately 150 words clearly stating the contribution of <br>\nthe submission. Refer to <a href=\"http://fmcad.org/2007\">http://fmcad.org/2007</a> for evolving submission <br>\ndetails.  A small number of accepted papers will be considered for a <br>\ndistinguished paper award.</p>\n<p>B. SHORT PAPERS</p>\n<p>The page limit is 4 pages using the same format as for regular papers. <br>\nShort papers can describe applications, case studies, industrial <br>\nexperience reports, emerging results, or implemented tools with novel <br>\nfeatures.  A demonstration will be required for accepted tool papers.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION<br>\n==========================================================================<br>\nChairs:               Jason Baumgartner, IBM Corporation, USA<br>\n                       Mary Sheeran, Chalmers University of Technology, <br>\nSweden<br>\nBenchmarks:           Panagiotis Manolios, Georgia Institute of <br>\nTechnology, USA<br>\nLocal Arrangements:   Andy Martin, IBM Corporation, USA<br>\nPanels:               William Joyner, Semiconductor Research <br>\nCorporation, USA<br>\nPublicity:            Alper Sen, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., USA<br>\nTutorials:            Natasha Sharygina, University of Lugano, Switzerland<br>\nWebmasters:           Hari Mony, IBM Corporation, USA<br>\n                       Sandip Ray, University of Texas, USA</p>\n<p>TUTORIALS<br>\n==========================================================================<br>\nRobert Brayton, University of California at Berkeley, USA<br>\nRandal Bryant, Carnegie-Mellon University, USA<br>\nNiklas Een, Cadence, USA<br>\nFarid Najm, University of Toronto, Canada</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>\n==========================================================================<br>\nMark Aagaard, University of Waterloo, Canada<br>\nJason Baumgartner, IBM Corporation, USA<br>\nArmin Biere, Johannes Kepler University, Austria<br>\nPer Bjesse, Synopsys, USA<br>\nDominique Borrione, Grenoble University, France<br>\nGianpiero Cabodi, Politecnico di Torino, Italy<br>\nAlessandro Cimatti, ITC-irst, Trento, Italy<br>\nKoen Claessen, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden<br>\nCindy Eisner, IBM Haifa Research Laboratory, Israel<br>\nSteven German, IBM Research Division, USA<br>\nGanesh Gopalakrishnan, University of Utah, USA<br>\nAarti Gupta, NEC Laboratories America, USA<br>\nAlan J.
