In 2005, the bi-annual FMCAD and sister conference<br>\nCHARME decided to merge to form an annual conference with a unified<br>\ncommunity. The resulting unified FMCAD provides a leading<br>\ninternational forum to researchers and practitioners in academia and<br>\nindustry for presenting and discussing groundbreaking methods,<br>\ntechnologies, theoretical results, and tools for formally reasoning<br>\nabout computing systems, as well as open challenges therein.  Topics<br>\nof interest for the technical program include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* Foundations: advancing industrial-strength technologies in model<br>\n    checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and<br>\n    refinement techniques, property-preserving reduction techniques,<br>\n    compositional methods, decision procedures, SAT- and BDD-based<br>\n    methods, combining deductive methods with decision procedures, and<br>\n    probabilistic methods.</p>\n<p>* Verification applications: tools, industrial experience reports,<br>\n    and case studies.  We encourage the submission of materials<br>\n    relating to novel and challenging industrial-scale applications of<br>\n    formal methods, including problem domains where formal methods<br>\n    worked well or even fell short. We also encourage submissions<br>\n    relating to the development and execution of methodologies for<br>\n    formal and informal verification strategies.</p>\n<p>* Applications of formal methods in design: topics relating to the<br>\n    application and applicability of assertion-based verification,<br>\n    equivalence checking, transaction-level verification, semi-formal<br>\n    verification, runtime verification, simulation and testcase<br>\n    generation, coverage analysis, microcode verification, embedded<br>\n    systems, software verification, concurrent systems, timing<br>\n    verification, and formal approaches to performance and power.</p>\n<p>* Model-based approaches: modeling and specification languages,<br>\n    system-level design and verification, design derivation and<br>\n    transformation, and correct-by-construction methods.</p>\n<p>* Formal methods for the design and verification of emerging and<br>\n    novel technologies: nano, quantum, biological, video, gaming, and<br>\n    multimedia applications.</p>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS<br>\n======================================================================<br>\nSubmissions must be made electronically in PDF format through the<br>\nsubmissions tab of the FMCAD'08 web site, <a href=\"http://www.fmcad.org/2008\">http://www.fmcad.org/2008</a>. The<br>\nproceedings will be published by ACM and will be available online in<br>\nthe ACM Digital Library and the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Two<br>\ncategories of papers can be submitted: regular papers (8 pages),<br>\ncontaining original research that has not been previously published,<br>\nnor concurrently submitted for publication; and short papers (4<br>\npages), describing applications, case studies, industrial experience<br>\nreports, emerging results, or implemented tools with novel features.</p>\n<p>Regular and short papers must use the IEEE Transactions format on<br>\nletter-size paper with a 10-point font size (see<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html\">http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html</a>). We<br>\nrecommend that self-citations be written in the third person, though<br>\nauthors will be required to identify themselves on their submissions.<br>\nSubmissions must contain original research that has not been<br>\npreviously published, nor concurrently submitted for publication. Any<br>\npartial overlap with any published or concurrently submitted paper<br>\nmust be clearly indicated. If experimental results are reported,<br>\nauthors are strongly encouraged to provide adequate access to their<br>\ndata so that results can be independently verified.</p>\n<p>A small number of accepted papers will be considered for a<br>\ndistinguished paper award.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION<br>\n======================================================================<br>\nChairs:             Alessandro Cimatti, FBK-irst, Italy<br>\n                     Robert B.
