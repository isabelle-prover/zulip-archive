FMCAD<br>\nprovides a leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for<br>\npresenting and discussing groundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical<br>\nresults, and tools for reasoning formally about computing systems. FMCAD<br>\ncovers formal aspects of computer-aided system design including<br>\nverification,<br>\nspecification, synthesis, and testing.</p>\n<p>FMCAD employs a rigorous peer-review process. Accepted papers are<br>\ndistributed<br>\nthrough both ACM and IEEE digital libraries. In addition, published articles<br>\nare made available freely on the conference page; the authors retain the<br>\ncopyright. There are no publication fees. At least one of the authors is<br>\nrequired to register for the conference and present the accepted paper. A<br>\nsmall number of outstanding FMCAD submissions will be considered for<br>\ninclusion in a Special Issue of the journal on Formal Methods in System<br>\nDesign (FMSD).</p>\n<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST</p>\n<p>FMCAD welcomes submission of papers reporting original research on advances<br>\nin all aspects of formal methods and their applications to computer-<br>\naided design. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<p>-- Model checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and<br>\n   reduction, compositional methods, decision procedures at the bit- and<br>\n   word-level, probabilistic methods, combinations of deductive methods and<br>\n   decision procedures.</p>\n<p>-- Synthesis and compilation for computer system descriptions, modeling,<br>\n   specification, and implementation languages, formal semantics of<br>\n   languages and their subsets, model-based design, design derivation and<br>\n   transformation, correct-by-construction methods.</p>\n<p>-- Application of formal and semi-formal methods to functional and<br>\n   non-functional specification and validation of hardware and software,<br>\n   including timing and power modeling, verification of computing systems<br>\n   on all levels of abstraction, system-level design and verification for<br>\n   embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, automotive systems and<br>\n   other safety-critical systems, hardware-software co-design and<br>\n   verification, and transaction-level verification.</p>\n<p>-- Experience with the application of formal and semi-formal methods to<br>\n   industrial-scale designs; tools that represent formal verification<br>\n   enablement, new features, or a substantial improvement in the automation<br>\n   of formal methods.</p>\n<p>-- Application of formal methods to verifying safety, correctness,<br>\n   connectivity, and security properties of networks and distributed<br>\n   systems.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmcad17\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmcad17</a></p>\n<p>Two categories of papers are invited: Regular papers, and Tool &amp; Case Study<br>\npapers. Regular papers are expected to offer novel foundational ideas,<br>\ntheoretical results, or algorithmic improvements to existing methods,<br>\nalong with experimental impact validation where applicable. Tool &amp; Case<br>\nStudy papers are expected to report on the design, implementation or use of<br>\nverification (or related) technology in a practically relevant context<br>\n(which need not be industrial), and its impact on design processes.</p>\n<p>Both Regular and Tool &amp; Case study papers must use the IEEE Transactions<br>\nformat on letter-size paper with a 10-point font size. Regular papers can be<br>\nup to 8 pages in length and tool papers up to 4 pages, although there<br>\nis no requirement to fill all pages in either category. Authors will be<br>\nrequired to select the appropriate paper category at abstract submission<br>\ntime. Submissions may contain an optional appendix, which will not appear<br>\nin the final version of the paper. The reviewers should be able to assess<br>\nthe quality and the relevance of the results in the paper without reading<br>\nthe appendix.</p>\n<p>Submissions in both categories must contain original research that has not<br>\nbeen previously published, nor is concurrently submitted for publication.<br>\nAny partial overlap with published or concurrently submitted papers must be<br>\nclearly indicated. If experimental results are reported, authors are<br>\nstrongly encouraged to provide the reviewers access to their data at<br>\nsubmission time, so that results can be independently verified.</p>\n<p>FMCAD 2017 COMMITTEES</p>\n<p>PROGRAM CHAIRS:</p>\n<p>Daryl Stewart, ARM<br>\nGeorg Weissenbacher, TU Wien</p>\n<p>STUDENT FORUM CHAIR:</p>\n<p>Keijo Heljanko, Aalto University</p>\n<p>LOCAL ARRANGEMENTS CHAIR &amp; WEBMASTER:</p>\n<p>Jens Katelaan, TU Wien</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION CHAIR:</p>\n<p>Mitra Tabaei Befrouei, TU Wien</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>Jade Alglave           University College London and Microsoft Research<br>\nChristel Baier         Technical University of Dresden<br>\nRoderick Bloem         Graz University of Technology<br>\nHana Chockler          King's College London<br>\nAndreas Griesmayer     ARM<br>\nArie Gurfinkel         University of Waterloo<br>\nZiyad Hanna            Cadence Design Systems<br>\nFei He                 Tsinghua University<br>\nAlan J.
