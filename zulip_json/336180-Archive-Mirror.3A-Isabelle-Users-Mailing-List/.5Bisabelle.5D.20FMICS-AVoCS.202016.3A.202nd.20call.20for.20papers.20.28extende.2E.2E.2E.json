In 2016, <br>\nFMICS and<br>\nAVoCS join their forces to hold a workshop combining their themes on formal<br>\nmethods and automated verification. For FMICS, this will be the 21st, <br>\nfor AVoCS<br>\nthe 16th edition.</p>\n<p>In particular, FMICS-AVoCS 2016 aims to bring together scientists and <br>\nengineers<br>\nthat are active in the area of formal methods, develop tools and <br>\ntechniques for the<br>\nautomated verification of critical systems, and are interested in <br>\nexchanging their<br>\nexperiences in the industrial usage of these methods and tools.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>Abstract submission for full papers (extended): May 2, 2016<br>\nSubmission of full papers (extended): May 9, 2016<br>\nNotification for full papers: June 19, 2016<br>\nCamera ready versions of full papers: July 10, 2016<br>\nSubmission of research ideas: August 10, 2016<br>\nNotification for research ideas: August 17, 2016<br>\nFMICS-AVoCS workshop: September 26-29, 2016</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<p>Thomas Arts (QuviQ AB, Gothenburg, Sweden)<br>\nJan Peleska (University of Bremen, Germany)</p>\n<p>TOPICS of INTEREST include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Design, specification, refinement, code generation and testing of <br>\ncritical systems<br>\n   based on formal methods</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Methods, techniques and tools to support automated analysis, <br>\ncertification,<br>\n   debugging, learning, optimization and transformation of critical <br>\nsystems, in<br>\n   particular distributed, real-time systems and embedded systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automated verification (model checking, theorem proving, SAT/SMT <br>\nconstraint<br>\n   solving, abstract interpretation, etc.) of critical systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Verification and validation methods that address shortcomings of <br>\nexisting methods<br>\n   with respect to their industrial applicability (e.g., scalability and <br>\nusability issues)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tools for the development of formal design descriptions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies and experience reports on industrial applications of <br>\nformal methods,<br>\n   focusing on lessons learned or identification of new research directions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Impact of the adoption of formal methods on the development process and<br>\n   associated costs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application of formal methods in standardization and industrial forums</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSION and PUBLICATION</p>\n<p>Full paper submissions must describe authors' original research work and <br>\nresults.<br>\nSubmitted papers must not have previously appeared in a journal or <br>\nconference with<br>\npublished proceedings and must not be concurrently submitted to any <br>\nother peer-<br>\nreviewed workshop, symposium, conference or archival journal. Any <br>\npartial overlap<br>\nwith any such published or concurrently submitted paper must be clearly <br>\nindicated.</p>\n<p>Full paper submissions should clearly demonstrate relevance to <br>\nindustrial application.<br>\nCase study papers should identify lessons learned, validate theoretical <br>\nresults<br>\n(such as scalability of methods) or provide specific motivation for <br>\nfurther research<br>\nand development.</p>\n<p>Full paper submissions should not exceed 15 pages formatted according to <br>\nthe LNCS<br>\nstyle (Springer). All submissions will be reviewed by the Program <br>\nCommittee who<br>\nwill make a selection among the submissions based on the novelty, <br>\nsoundness and<br>\napplicability of the presented ideas and results.</p>\n<p>Research ideas: FMICS-AVoCS encourages the submissions of research ideas <br>\nin order to<br>\nstimulate discussions at the workshop. Reports on ongoing work or <br>\nsurveys on work<br>\npublished elsewhere are welcome. The Program Committee will select <br>\nresearch ideas on<br>\nthe basis of submitted abstracts according to their significance and <br>\ngeneral interest.<br>\nAbstracts of research ideas should not exceed 3 pages and they will not <br>\nbe part of<br>\nthe published proceedings.</p>\n<p>Full papers and research ideas must be written in English and should be <br>\nsubmitted as<br>\nPortable Document Format (PDF) files using the EasyChair submission site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmicsavocs2016\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmicsavocs2016</a></p>\n<p>The workshop proceedings will be published by Springer in their LNCS <br>\nseries, while<br>\nauthors of the best full papers will be invited to submit extended <br>\nversions to a<br>\nspecial issue of the International Journal on Software Tools for <br>\nTechnology Transfer.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>General Chair</p>\n<p>Maurice ter Beek (ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy)</p>\n<p>PC Chairs</p>\n<p>Stefania Gnesi (ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy)<br>\nAlexander Knapp (Augsburg University, Germany)</p>\n<p>PC Members</p>\n<p>Maria Alpuente (Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Spain)<br>\nJiri Barnat (Masaryk University, Czech Republic)<br>\nMichael Dierkes (Rockwell Collins, France)<br>\nCindy Eisner (IBM Research Haifa, Israel)<br>\nAlessandro Fantechi (Universita' di Firenze, Italy)<br>\nFrancesco Flammini (Ansaldo STS, Naples, Italy)<br>\nMaria Del Mar Gallardo (University of Malaga, Spain)<br>\nMichael Goldsmith (University of Oxford, UK)<br>\nGudmund Grov (Heriot-Watt University, UK)<br>\nMatthias Gudemann (Systerel, Aix-en-Provence, France)<br>\nMarieke Huisman (University of Twente, The Netherlands)<br>\nGerwin Klein (NICTA and University of New South Wales, Australia)<br>\nPeter Gorm Larsen (Aarhus University, Denmark)<br>\nThierry Lecomte (ClearSy, Aix-en-Provence, France)<br>\nTiziana Margaria (University of Limerick, Ireland)<br>\nRadu Mateescu (INRIA Grenoble - Rhone-Alpes, France)<br>\nDavid Mentre (Mitsubishi Electric R&amp;D Centre Europe, Rennes, France)<br>\nStephan Merz (INRIA Nancy, France)<br>\nManuel Nunez (Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain)<br>\nPeter Olveczky (University of Oslo, Norway)<br>\nCharles Pecheur (Universite catholique de Louvain, Belgium)<br>\nMarielle Petit-Doche (Systerel, Aix-en-Provence, France)<br>\nRalf Pinger (Siemens AG, Braunschweig, Germany)<br>\nJaco van de Pol (University of Twente, The Netherlands)<br>\nMarkus Roggenbach (Swansea University, UK)<br>\nMatteo Rossi (Politecnico di Milano, Italy)<br>\nMarco Roveri (FBK-Irst, Italy)<br>\nThomas Santen (Microsoft Research Advanced Technology Labs Europe, <br>\nAachen, Germany)<br>\nBernhard Steffen (University of Dortmund, Germany)<br>\nJun Sun (University of Technology and Design, Singapore)<br>\nHelen Treharne (University of Surrey, UK)</p>\n<p>MORE INFORMATION</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fmics-avocs.isti.cnr.it/\">http://fmics-avocs.isti.cnr.it/</a></p>",
