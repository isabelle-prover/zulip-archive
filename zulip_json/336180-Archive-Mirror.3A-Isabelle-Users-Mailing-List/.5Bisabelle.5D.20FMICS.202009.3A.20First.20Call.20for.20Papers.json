In particular, these workshops bring<br>\ntogether scientists and engineers that are active in the area of<br>\nformal methods and interested in exchanging their experiences in the<br>\nindustrial usage of these methods.<br>\nThese workshops also strive to promote research and development for the<br>\nimprovement of formal methods and tools for industrial applications.<br>\nTopics include, but are not restricted to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Design, specification, code generation and testing based on formal<br>\n     methods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Methods, techniques and tools to support automated analysis,<br>\n     certification, debugging, learning, optimization and transformation<br>\n     of complex, distributed, real-time systems and embedded systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Verification and validation methods that address shortcomings<br>\n     of existing methods with respect to their industrial applicability<br>\n     (e.g., scalability and usability issues).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tools for the development of formal design descriptions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies and experience reports on industrial applications of formal<br>\n     methods, focusing on lessons learned or identification of new research<br>\n     directions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Impact of the adoption of formal methods on the development process<br>\n     and associated costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application of formal methods in standardization and industrial<br>\n     forums.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>To be announced</p>\n<p>CO-CHAIRS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Maria Alpuente           (Technical University of Valencia, Spain)<br>\nByron Cook               (Microsoft Research, UK)</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Hassan Ait-Kaci          (Ilog, Canada)<br>\nMaria Alpuente           (Technical University of Valencia, Spain)<br>\nThomas Arts              (IT-Universitetet i Goteborg, Sweden)<br>\nDemis Ballis             (Universita degli Studi di Udine, Italy)<br>\nJosh Berdine             (Microsoft Research, UK)<br>\nLubos Brim               (Masarykova Univerzita, Czech Republic)<br>\nDarren Cofer             (Rockwell Collins, USA)<br>\nByron Cook               (Microsoft Research, UK)<br>\nPatrick Cousot           (Ecole Normale Superieure, France)<br>\nSantiago Escobar         (Technical University of Valencia, Spain)<br>\nAzadeh Farzan            (University of Toronto, Canada)<br>\nHubert Garavel           (INRIA Rhone-Alpes, France)<br>\nStefania Gnesi           (ISTI-CNR, Italy)<br>\nAlexey Gotsman           (University of Cambridge, UK)<br>\nHolger Hermanns          (Universitat des Saarlandes, Germany)<br>\nChristophe Joubert       (Technical University of Valencia, Spain)<br>\nDaniel Kroening          (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)<br>\nMichael Leuschel         (Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Germany)<br>\nPedro Merino             (Universidad de Malaga, Spain)<br>\nJuan Jose Moreno-Navarro (Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain)<br>\nCorina Pasareanu         (NASA Ames Research Center, USA)<br>\nJaco van de Pol          (Universiteit Twente, The Netherlands)<br>\nMurali Rangarajan        (Honeywell, USA)<br>\nJakob Rehof              (Technische Universitat Dortmund, Germany)<br>\nAndrey Rybalchenko       (Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Germany)<br>\nMarcel Verhoef           (Chess, The Netherlands)<br>\nMartin Wirsing           (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Germany)<br>\nHongseok Yang            (Queen Mary, University of London, UK)<br>\nGreta Yorsh              (IBM T.J.
