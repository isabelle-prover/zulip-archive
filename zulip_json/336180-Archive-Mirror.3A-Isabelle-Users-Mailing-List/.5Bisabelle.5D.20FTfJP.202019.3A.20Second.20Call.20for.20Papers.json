Modern programming<br>\nlanguages are interesting targets for formal techniques due to their<br>\nubiquity and wide user base, stable and well-defined interfaces and<br>\nplatforms, and powerful (but also complex) libraries. New languages<br>\nand applications in this space are continually arising, resulting in<br>\nnew programming languages (PL) research challenges.</p>\n<p>Work on formal techniques and tools and on the formal underpinnings of<br>\nprogramming languages themselves naturally complement each<br>\nother. FTfJP is an established workshop which has run annually since<br>\n1999 alongside ECOOP, with the goal of bringing together people<br>\nworking in both fields.</p>\n<p>The workshop has a broad PL theme; the most important criterion is<br>\nthat submissions will generate interesting discussions within this<br>\ncommunity. The term “Java-like” is somewhat historic and should be<br>\ninterpreted broadly: FTfJP solicits and welcomes submission relating<br>\nto programming languages in general, beyond Java, C#, Scala, etc.</p>\n<p>Example topics of interest include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Language design and semantics</li>\n<li>Type systems</li>\n<li>Concurrency and new application domains</li>\n<li>Specification and verification of program properties</li>\n<li>Program analysis (static or dynamic)</li>\n<li>Program Synthesis</li>\n<li>Security</li>\n<li>Pearls (programs or proofs)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FTfJP welcomes submissions on technical contributions, case studies,<br>\nexperience reports, challenge proposals, and position papers.</p>\n<h2>Submissions</h2>\n<p>Contributions are sought in two categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Full Papers (6 pages, excluding references) present a technical<br>\n  contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. We welcome<br>\n  both complete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is<br>\n  particularly welcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate<br>\n  interesting discussions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short Papers (2 pages, excluding references) should advocate a<br>\n  promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely<br>\n  to stimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage<br>\n  e.g. established researchers to set out a personal vision, and<br>\n  beginning researchers to present a planned path to a PhD.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the<br>\nworkshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed, and will be evaluated<br>\nbased on their clarity and their potential to generate interesting<br>\ndiscussions. The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP<br>\nis a forum in which a wide range of people share their expertise, from<br>\nexperienced researchers to beginning PhD students.</p>\n<p>Submissions are accepted via <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2019\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2019</a></p>\n<h2>Formatting and Publication</h2>\n<p>Submissions should be in acmart/sigplan style, 10pt font. Formatting<br>\nrequirements are detailed on the SIGPLAN Author Information page<br>\n(<a href=\"https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author\">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author</a>).</p>\n<p>Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library by<br>\ndefault, though authors will be able to opt out of this publication,<br>\nif desired. At least one author of an accepted paper must attend the<br>\nworkshop to present the work and participate in the discussions.</p>\n<h2>Important Dates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission: 21 April (AoE)</li>\n<li>Notification: 2 June</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Program Committee</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Yuyan Bao (Pennsylvania State University)</li>\n<li>James Bornholt (University of Washington)</li>\n<li>Gidon Ernst (Co-Chair; LMU Munich)</li>\n<li>Marie Farrell (University of Liverpool)</li>\n<li>Carlo A.
