Hence \"Programming and <br>\nProving in Isabelle/HOL\" says that the proof style is outdated. Maybe the web <br>\npage should move the tutorial down the list.</p>\n<p>Tobias</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If not, are contributions to it welcome or is it not worth the effort?<br>\nIn particular, at the very least:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While there is a good volume of good stuff in there for instance it<br>\nstill refers to Proof General in its tooltips; these could be<br>\n\"refactored\" into the way it is now done in jEdit with new tips added<br>\nor obsolete non-replaceable removed.</li>\n<li>prog-prove and other docs have appeared over the last few years with<br>\nsome more recent info, so at least these can be all referenced in the<br>\nbeginning in the introduction to direct the reader to those other<br>\nplaces based on their need on datatypes, functions, locales, etc..<br>\nThis is such that the tutorial cold be the starting point for all<br>\nbranching out to other documentation, while the rest is being updated<br>\nor just stays as-is self-contained.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/cjaQAOOlNMtrqRTHoenzn60y/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
