However, often my lemma names have a large<br>\ncommon prefix, so I either have to type this one or scroll through a<br>\nlarge selection of lemmas.</p>\n<p>Eclipse has a nice mechanism for such names: Names and typed text are<br>\nsplit in words (as Camelcase is usual in the Java world, upper-case<br>\nletters signify the beginning of a new word) and the completion suggest<br>\nall those names, for which the typed words are prefixes of the names'<br>\nwords. A few examples:</p>\n<p>* L, LH, LHS, LiHaSet would all include LinkedHashSet<br>\n  * HS would include HashSet, but not LinkedHashSet</p>\n<p>Maybe a similar mechanism (e.g., with underscore taking the role of<br>\nupper-case letters) would be a nice addition for Isabelle's IDEs?</p>\n<p>-- Lars</p>",
