In my experience, that could very well be some memory issue like a null-pointer exception. To get more information, you can use the option [[smt_trace]] just before the invocation of Z3 like so:</p>\n<p>lemma True using [[smt_trace]] by smt</p>\n<p>This will emit some more details about the things that are done in Isabelle to communicate with Z3. In particular you get the data that is sent to Z3. If you provide me with this information, I might have a look if some newer version of Z3 has already solved this issue. Otherwise we can pass the data to the Z3 developers to analyze and resolve this issue.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nSascha</p>",
