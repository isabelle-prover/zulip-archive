Since then I use the method proposed by Jesper <br>\n(<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2010-January/msg00043.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2010-January/msg00043.html</a>); <br>\nthanks btw.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>okay first I wanted to go for Larry's suggestion and not use document <br>\npreparation at all... but then I got ambitious :)</p>\n<p>However, typing lines like</p>\n<p>\"s \\&lt;^raw:\\rstep{&gt;R\\&lt;^raw:}&gt; t\"</p>\n<p>instead of</p>\n<p>\"s -&gt;R t\"</p>\n<p>is really awkward. In the current setting it seems to me, as if only <br>\nthoerems (i.e., the results after a proof) but not the proofs itself are <br>\nnicely supported for document preparation. This is a pity, since the <br>\notherwise very comfortable Isar is somehow damped down.</p>\n<p>Is it planned to also apply 'notation's to statements inside proofs at <br>\nsome point? And if not, what are the reasons?</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",

Isar source text has no concrete representation in the <br>\nsystem, so at the point where enough information is available to <br>\npretty-print the terms, the rest of the text is already lost.</p>\n<p>Since the new UI paradigm is based on sources being annotated with <br>\nsemantic information coming from the prover, this will probably be part <br>\nof the long-term solution...</p>\n<p>Alex</p>",
