Are there better texts to grasp this? Or should I<br>\nread the tutorial and fight with my theorems till I win?</p>\n<p>Right now I'm trying to prove some basic facts about graphs and it's<br>\nreally, really painful to move forward. Is it possible for some more<br>\nadvanced users of isabelle to take a look at what I'm doing and push<br>\nme in the right direction? Can same things be expressed more easily in<br>\nisabelle? I'm attaching the file I'm working on.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/XvSOX-G6DFPjHW6BJPEMvA0o/graph2.thy\">graph2.thy</a></p>",
