The proceedings of ATVA<br>\n2010 will be published by Springer as a volume in the LNCS series.<br>\nKEYNOTE SPEAKERS<br>\nEdmund M. Clarke, Carnegie Mellon University<br>\nThomas A. Henzinger, IST Austria<br>\nIgor Walukiewicz, University Bordeaux-1</p>\n<p>SCOPE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The scope of interest is intentionally kept broad; it includes:</p>\n<p>Theories useful for providing designers with automated support for<br>\nobtaining correct software or hardware systems, including both<br>\nfunctional and non functional aspects, such as: theory of (timed and<br>\nhybrid) automata, process calculi, Petri-nets, concurrency theory,<br>\ncompositionality, model-checking, automated theorem proving,<br>\nsynthesis, performance analysis, correctness-by-construction, infinite<br>\nstate systems, abstract interpretation, decidability results,<br>\nparametric analysis or synthesis.</p>\n<p>Applications of theory in engineering methods and other particular<br>\ndomains and handling of practical problems occurring in tools, such as<br>\nanalysis and verification tools, synthesis tools, model transformation<br>\ntools. Techniques of reducing complexity of verification by<br>\nabstraction, improved representations. Methods and tools in handling<br>\nuser level notations, such as UML. Practice in industrial applications<br>\nto hardware, software or real-time and embedded systems. Case studies,<br>\nillustrating the usefulness of tools or a particular approach are also<br>\nwelcome. Theory papers should be motivated by practical problems and<br>\napplications should be rooted in sound theory. We are interested both<br>\nin algorithms and in methods and tools for integrating formal<br>\napproaches into industrial practice.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be<br>\nconcurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions<br>\nwill be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field,<br>\ntechnical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference.<br>\nATVA 2010 calls for two types of contributions: RESEARCH PAPERS and<br>\nTOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS. Both types of contributions will appear in<br>\nthe proceedings and have oral presentations at the conference. Papers<br>\nshould be written in English in LNCS format.</p>\n<p>Research papers: Research papers should contain original research, and<br>\nsufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the<br>\ncontribution. Submissions reporting on industrial case studies are<br>\nwelcome, and should describe both strengths and weaknesses in<br>\nsufficient depth. Research papers should be no more than 15 pages.</p>\n<p>Tool demonstration papers: Tool demonstration papers present tools<br>\nbased on aforementioned theories or fall into the above application<br>\nareas. Tool demonstration papers allow researchers to stress the<br>\ntechnical and practical side, illustrating how one can apply the<br>\ntheoretic contributions in practice. Tool demonstration papers should<br>\nbe no more than 6 pages.</p>\n<p>Further information and instruction about submission can be found at<br>\nthe conference website <a href=\"http://atva10.comp.nus.edu.sg\">http://atva10.comp.nus.edu.sg</a>.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Abstract submission:        April 5, 2010<br>\nPaper submission:           April 12, 2010<br>\nNotification of acceptance: May 31, 2010<br>\nFinal copy for proceedings: June 18, 2010</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Conference Organizers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>General Chair<br>\nJin Song Dong, National University of Singapore</p>\n<p>Program Chairs<br>\nAhmed Bouajjani, University of Paris<br>\nWei-Ngan Chin, National University of Singapore</p>\n<p>Keynote Speakers<br>\nEdmund M.
