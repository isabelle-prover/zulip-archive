The literature in this field is extensive and includes a variety<br>\nof logics used for reasoning about the strategic abilities of the agents<br>\nin the system. Results stemming from this research have been used in a<br>\nwide range of applications, including robotic teams endowed with<br>\nadaptive strategies, and automatic players capable of beating expert<br>\nhuman adversaries. A common feature in all these domains is the<br>\nrequirement for sound theoretical foundations and tools accounting for<br>\nthe strategies that agents may adopt in the presence of adversaries.</p>\n<p>The SR international workshop series aims to bring together researchers<br>\nworking on different aspects of strategic reasoning in computer science,<br>\nboth from a theoretical and a practical point of view.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest</p>\n<p>The topics covered by the workshop include, but are not limited to, the<br>\nfollowing:</p>\n<p>Logics for reasoning about strategic abilities;<br>\nLogics for multi-agent mechanism design, verification, and synthesis;<br>\nLogical foundations of decision theory for multi-agent systems;<br>\nStrategic reasoning in formal verification;<br>\nAutomata theory for strategy synthesis;<br>\nApplications and tools for cooperative and adversarial reasoning;<br>\nRobust planning and optimization in multi-agent systems;<br>\nRisk and uncertainty in multi-agent systems;<br>\nQuantitative aspects in strategic reasoning.</p>\n<p>Previous Editions</p>\n<p>SR 2013 (satellite event of ETAPS 2013). 16-17 March 2013, Rome.<br>\nSR 2014 (satellite event of ETAPS 2014). 5-6 April 2014, Grenoble.<br>\nSR 2015. 21-22 September 2015. Oxford.</p>\n<p>(All information from previous events are accessible from<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.strategicreasoning.net/\">http://www.strategicreasoning.net/</a>)</p>\n<p>Submissions</p>\n<p>Submitted contributions should not exceed 10 pages using the EPTCS<br>\nformat. If necessary, submitted papers can be supplemented with a<br>\nclearly marked appendix, which will be consulted at the discretion of<br>\nthe program committee. Submitted papers should be formatted in PDF and<br>\nuploaded to</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sr2016\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sr2016</a></p>\n<p>Two types of submission will be considered:<br>\narticles reporting on novel research;<br>\nexpository papers reporting on published work.<br>\nEach submission should be clearly identified as belonging to one<br>\ncategory or the other.</p>\n<p>Novel research abstracts will be held to the usual high standards of<br>\nnovel research publications. In particular, they will be expected to<br>\ncontain enough information to enable the program committee to identify<br>\nthe main contribution of the work, explain the significance of the work,<br>\nits novelty, and its practical or theoretical implications, and include<br>\ncomparisons with and references to relevant literature.</p>\n<p>Expository abstracts, which will be held to similarly high standards,<br>\nmay survey an area or report on a more specific previously published<br>\nwork. Submissions should make clear the relevance to the strategic<br>\nreasoning audience.</p>\n<p>Authors of the contributions accepted for presentation (in both<br>\ncategories) will be invited to publish their work as part of an EPTCS<br>\nvolume to be published around the time of the workshop.</p>\n<p>Submissions from PC members is allowed.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>6 April 2016: Abstract submission deadline.<br>\n8 April 2016: Submission deadline.<br>\n29 April 2016: Acceptance notification.<br>\n15 May 2016: Camera-ready version deadline.<br>\n9-10 July 2016: SR 2016.</p>\n<p>Proceedings</p>\n<p>A volume in the EPTCS will be published as in previous years. Authors of<br>\ncontributions presented at the workshop and previously unpublished will<br>\nbe given an opportunity for the paper to be included. Inclusion in EPTCS<br>\nvolume is not mandatory.</p>\n<p>As in the past, extended and revised versions of the contributions<br>\njudged to be particularly significant will be published in a special<br>\nissue of the International Journal of Information and Computation.</p>\n<p>General Chair</p>\n<p>Moshe Y.
