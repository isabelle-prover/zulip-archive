In   many cases,  interfaces remain relatively   basic and<br>\nunder-designed.</p>\n<p>The User  Interfaces for  Theorem  Provers workshop series  provides a<br>\nforum for researchers  interested in improving human  interaction with<br>\nproof systems.  We  welcome participation  and  contributions from the<br>\ntheorem  proving, formal methods and tools,  and HCI communities, both<br>\nto report on  experience with  existing systems,  and to  discuss  new<br>\ndirections.  Topics covered include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* Application-specific interaction mechanisms or  designs for prover<br>\n    interfaces</p>\n<p>* Experiments and evaluation of prover interfaces<br>\n  * Languages and tools for authoring, exchanging and presenting proof<br>\n  * Implementation techniques (e.g.  web services,  custom middleware,<br>\n    DSLs)</p>\n<p>* Integration of interfaces and tools to explore and construct proof<br>\n  * Representation  and  manipulation   of  mathematical  knowledge or<br>\n    objects</p>\n<p>* Visualisation of mathematical objects and proof<br>\n  * System descriptions</p>\n<p>UITP 2008 is a one-day workshop to be held on Friday, August 22nd 2008<br>\nin     Montreal,    Canada,      as     a      TPHOLS'08      workshop<br>\n[http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~tphols08/TPHOLs2008/]</p>\n<p>FORMAT OF THE WORKSHOP</p>\n<p>The proposed  format of  the workshop  is one  day of presentations of<br>\naccepted regular papers  and system demonstrations  of accepted system<br>\ndescriptions. In addition the program might include an invited talk.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<p>Submissions are encouraged in one of the following two categories:</p>\n<p>- Regular paper:    Submissions  in this category  should   describe<br>\n    previously unpublished  work (completed or in progress), including<br>\n    descriptions of research,  tools, and applications. Papers  should<br>\n    be formated following the ENTCS [http://www.entcs.org/prelim.html]<br>\n    guidelines and  up to 15   pages long (please find  the additional<br>\n    UITP'08-specific macro file at<br>\n    [http://www.entcs.org/files/uitp08/prentcsmacro.sty].</p>\n<p>- System description:   Submissions in this category are intended to<br>\n    describe existing systems. Papers should be formated following the<br>\n    ENTCS [http://www.entcs.org/prelim.html]  guidelines and  up to  5<br>\n    pages long (please find here the additional UITP'08-specific ENTCS<br>\n    macro file [http://www.entcs.org/files/uitp08/prentcsmacro.sty]).</p>\n<p>Submission  of    papers  is  via  the  EasyChair    conference system<br>\n[http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=uitp08].   All submissions<br>\nwill be peer reviewed and final  versions of accepted submissions will<br>\nbe  published  in    an  ENTCS  [http://www.elsevier.com/locate/entcs]<br>\nvolume. In addition,  printed workshop proceedings will be distributed<br>\nat the  workshop.
