Separate  communities  have  developed  to<br>\ninvestigate  and build  computer based  systems for  computer algebra,<br>\nautomated deduction, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user<br>\ninterfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their<br>\nintegration  can   lead  to   synergies  offering   significant  added<br>\nvalue.  The  Conference  on Intelligent  Computer  Mathematics  (CICM)<br>\noffers a  venue for discussing  and developing solutions to  the great<br>\nchallenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.</p>\n<p>CICM has been held annually as a joint meeting since 2008, co-locating<br>\nrelated   conferences  and   workshops  to   advance  work   in  these<br>\nsubjects. Previous  meetings have been  held in Birmingham  (UK 2008),<br>\nGrand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France 2010), Bertinoro (Italy 2011),<br>\nBremen (Germany  2012), Bath (UK  2013), Coimbra (Portugal  2014), and<br>\nWashington DC (USA 2015).</p>\n<p>This  is a  call for  papers  for CICM  2016,  which will  be held  in<br>\nBialystok, Poland, July 25-29, 2016.</p>\n<p>The principal tracks of the conference will be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Track: Calculemus (chair: Leonardo de Moura)</li>\n<li>Track: Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML) (chair: Frank Tompa)</li>\n<li>Track: Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM) (chair: Bruce Miller)</li>\n<li>Track: Systems &amp; Data (chair: Moa Johansson)</li>\n<li>Track: Doctoral Programme (chair: Martin Suda)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like in previous years, project descriptions are welcomed as well.</p>\n<p>The  overall  programme is  organized  by  the General  Program  Chair<br>\nMichael Kohlhase.  The workshop and publicity chair is Serge Autexier.<br>\nThe local arrangements will be coordinated by Adam Naumowicz.</p>\n<p>We plan  to have proceedings  of the  conference as in  previous years<br>\nwith  Springer Verlag  as  a  volume in  Lecture  Notes in  Artificial<br>\nIntelligence (LNAI).</p>\n<p><em>New Important Dates</em> </p>\n<p>Conference submissions</p>\n<p>- Abstract submission deadline:  <em>9.
