What are the deduction techniques?</p>\n<p>in connection with IJCAR'06 at FLoC'06</p>\n<p>August 15-16, 2006, Seattle, USA</p>\n<p>[http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~omega/workshops/Verify06/]</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong><strong>*</strong><strong>*</strong><strong>*</strong>*  Keynote speakers <strong>*</strong><strong>*</strong><strong>*</strong><strong>*</strong><strong>*</strong><strong>*</strong><br>\n<strong>             John Rushby (SRI International)                      </strong><br>\n<strong>             Christoph Walther (TU Darmstadt)                     </strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The formal verification of   critical information systems has  a  long<br>\ntradition as   one  of the  main  areas of  application for  automated<br>\ntheorem  proving.    Nevertheless,  the  area  is  of  still   growing<br>\nimportance as the number of computers affecting  everyday life and the<br>\ncomplexity of  these systems are both increasing.   The purpose of the<br>\nVERIFY workshop  series is to  discuss   problems arising  during  the<br>\nformal  modeling   and  verification  of  information systems  and  to<br>\ninvestigate suitable solutions.   Possible  perspectives include those<br>\nof automated theorem  proving,  tool support, system  engineering, and<br>\napplications.</p>\n<p>The   VERIFY   workshops  aim  at  bringing  together  people  who are<br>\ninterested in the development of safety and security critical systems,<br>\nin formal  methods, in the  development  of automated theorem  proving<br>\ntechniques, and  in  the  development  of  tool   support.   Practical<br>\nexperiences  gained in realistic verifications  are of interest to the<br>\nautomated theorem proving community and new theorem proving techniques<br>\nshould be transferred into   practice.  The overall objective  of  the<br>\nVERIFY workshops is to identify open problems  and to discuss possible<br>\nsolutions under the theme</p>\n<p>What are the verification problems? What are the deduction techniques?</p>\n<p>In  2006,   VERIFY will  specifically   consider issues  regarding the<br>\napplication of \"tool support   for formal modeling,  verification  and<br>\nstepwise  system  development\" without excluding submissions regarding<br>\nother topics in the focus of the  workshop.  Therefore, submissions in<br>\nthis area are especially encouraged.</p>\n<p>Topics include (but are not limited to)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ATP techniques in verification      + Information flow control</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies                        + Refinement &amp; decomposition<br>\n  (specification &amp; verification)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combination of verification systems + Reliability of mobile computing</p>\n</li>\n<li>Integration of ATPs and CASE-tools  + Reuse of specifications &amp; proofs</li>\n<li>Compositional &amp; modular reasoning   + Management of change</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experience reports on using         + Safety-critical systems<br>\n  formal methods        </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gaps between problems &amp; techniques  + Security models</p>\n</li>\n<li>Formal methods for fault tolerance  + Tool support for formal methods</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions are encouraged in one of the following two categories:</p>\n<p>A.  Regular  papers: Submissions  in  this category  should  describe<br>\n     previously unpublished work (completed or in progress), including<br>\n     descriptions of research,  tools, and  applications.  Papers must<br>\n     be formated  following the Springer  LNCS guidelines and  be 6-15<br>\n     pages long.</p>\n<p>B.  Discussion papers: Submissions  in this category are  intended to<br>\n     initiate discussions and should address controversial issues, and<br>\n     may include provocative   statements.   Papers must  be  formated<br>\n     following the Springer LNCS guidelines and be 3-15 pages long.</p>\n<p>Submission of papers is via EasyChair at <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/VERIFY-06/\">www.easychair.org/VERIFY-06/</a>.</p>\n<p>Upon submission, the category (either A or B)  must be indicated.  The<br>\ninformal   workshop proceedings will   be distributed at the workshop.<br>\nFinal versions of accepted papers have to be prepared with LaTeX.</p>\n<p>Following up  the workshop there  will be a  call for submissions to a<br>\nspecial issue of  the Journal of Automated  Reasoning dedicated to the<br>\ntopics   of  VERIFY'06.   Authors   of  accepted   regular papers  are<br>\nespecially encouraged to submit to this special issue.</p>\n<p>Program &amp; WS Co-Chairs <br>\n  S. Autexier   (DFKI &amp; U.
