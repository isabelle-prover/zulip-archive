The forum represents an<br>\nopportunity to interact with different communities sharing an interest in<br>\napplied computing.</p>\n<p>SAC 2019 is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing<br>\n(SIGAPP), and will be hosted by the University of Cyprus, Limassol, Cyprus.</p>\n<p>Software Verification and Testing Track<br>\n=======================================</p>\n<p>The Software Verification and Testing track aims at contributing to the<br>\nchallenge of improving the usability of formal methods in software<br>\nengineering. The track covers areas such as formal methods for verification and<br>\ntesting, based on theorem proving, model checking, static analysis, and run-time<br>\nverification. We invite authors to submit new results in formal verification and<br>\ntesting, as well as development of technologies to improve the usability of<br>\nformal methods in software engineering. Also are welcome detailed descriptions<br>\nof applications of mechanical verification to large scale software. Possible<br>\ntopics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>model checking</li>\n<li>theorem proving</li>\n<li>correct by construction development</li>\n<li>model-based testing</li>\n<li>software testing</li>\n<li>symbolic execution</li>\n<li>static and dynamic analysis</li>\n<li>abstract interpretation</li>\n<li>analysis methods for dependable systems</li>\n<li>software certification and proof carrying code</li>\n<li>fault diagnosis and debugging</li>\n<li>verification and validation of large scale software systems</li>\n<li>\n<p>real world applications and case studies applying software testing<br>\nand verification</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>benchmarks and data sets for software testing and verification</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission Guidelines<br>\n=====================</p>\n<p>Paper submissions must be original, unpublished work. Author(s) name(s) and<br>\naddress(es) must not appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference should<br>\nbe avoided and made in the third person. Submitted paper will undergo a blind<br>\nreview process. Authors of accepted papers should submit an editorial revision<br>\nof their papers that fits within eight two-column pages (an extra two pages, to<br>\na total of ten pages, may be available at a charge). Please comply to this page<br>\nlimitation already at submission time. Accepted papers will be published in the<br>\nACM SAC 2019 proceedings.</p>\n<p>Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of papers, posters, or<br>\nSRC abstracts in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy attending SAC<br>\nMUST present the work. This is a requirement for the presented work to be<br>\nincluded in the ACM/IEEE digital library. No-show of registered papers, posters,<br>\nand SRC abstracts will result in excluding them from the ACM/IEEE digital<br>\nlibrary.</p>\n<p>After the Symposium we will organize a special issue of the Software Quality<br>\nJournal (SQJ) on the topics of SVT.</p>\n<p>Student Travel Award<br>\n====================</p>\n<p>The SIGAPP Student Travel Award Program (STAP) was established to provide<br>\nfinancial support for SIGAPP student members to attend SIGAPP primary conference<br>\n(SAC) to present their accepted work. Student primary authors and co-authors are<br>\neligible to apply for these awards. For details please see:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.sigapp.org/stawards.html\">https://www.sigapp.org/stawards.html</a></p>\n<p>Student Research Competition<br>\n============================</p>\n<p>As previous editions, SAC 2019 organises a Student Research Competition (SRC)<br>\nProgram to provide graduate students the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas<br>\nwith researchers and practitioners in their areas of interest. Guidelines and<br>\ninformation about the SRC program can be found at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/\">http://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/</a>.</p>\n<p>Program Committee Chairs<br>\n========================</p>\n<p>Leonardo Mariani, University of Milano Bicocca<br>\nMatthias Güdemann, Diffblue Ltd.</p>\n<p>Program Committee<br>\n=================</p>\n<p>Marcelo d’Amorim, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil<br>\n Sébastien Bardin, CEA, France<br>\n Ezio Bartocci, TU Vienna, Austria<br>\n Marius Bozga, CNRS, France<br>\n Radu Calinescu, University of York, UK<br>\n Lucas Cordeiro, University of Manchester, UK<br>\n Cristina David, University of Cambridge, UK<br>\n Giovanni Denaro, University of Milano Bicocca, Milano, Italy<br>\n Gidon Ernst, University of Melbourne, Australia<br>\n Yliès Falcone, Univ.
