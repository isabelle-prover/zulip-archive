Aug 2018</p>\n<p>Theme:</p>\n<p>CICM gathers computer mathematicians, and this workshop questions the<br>\nimpact of their doing on education. Computer Mathematics plays an<br>\nimportant role in education -- does this role tend towards enlightenment<br>\nof students or towards incantation by students ? So this workshop<br>\nadresses what \"Intelligent\" in the conference's title might mean:<br>\nraising   \"enlightenment\" (a misleading translation from German<br>\n\"Aufklaerung\") or   raising blind trust in technology and using tools<br>\nfor kinds of   \"incantation\"?</p>\n<p>Looking at the state of the art in educational use of mathematics<br>\nsoftware we see: Computer Algebra Systems are used to widen application<br>\nareas of mathematics by uncaging students from tricky calculations --<br>\nand   by the way tend to shift formal mathematics into mystical<br>\nincantation.   Dynamic Geometry Systems appeal to students' intuition,<br>\nexperts advocate   \"geometrical proof\" -- and by the way bypass the<br>\nchallenge of   demonstrating reliability by mathematical proof. And last<br>\nnot least a   \"new generation of educational mathematics software\" based<br>\non   technologies from Computer Theorem Proving is announced while<br>\nrespective   software for general mathematics education still seems<br>\nunavailable.</p>\n<p>So this workshop will consider recent developments in Computer<br>\nMathematics, discuss potential impact of respective tools and reconsider<br>\ndevelopers' responsibility for such impact.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest:</p>\n<p>Interesting as discussion of \"Enlightenment or Incantation\" in<br>\neducation   might be, it must start from concrete technologies:</p>\n<p>* Technologies for explanation, justification and reasoning,<br>\n  * tools built upon Computer Algebra, Dynamic Geometry, Computer<br>\n    Theorem Proving, etc,</p>\n<p>* case studies: areas of mathematics which particularly benefit from<br>\n    mechanical explanation, justification and reasoning,</p>\n<p>* evidence and proof in Dynamic Geometry Systems,<br>\n  * computer Algebra and reasoning,<br>\n  * automated generation of concrete examples from abstract concepts,<br>\n  * SW mechanisms which make mathematical concepts transparent to<br>\n    users,</p>\n<p>* SW as models of mathematics (interactive, complete and<br>\n    transparent?).</p>\n<p>And from there ask questions like:</p>\n<p>* Where does Computer Mathematics tend towards \"enlightenment\"?<br>\n  * Where does Computer Mathematics tend towards \"incantation\"?<br>\n  * How does increasing use of software tools affect mathematics<br>\n    education?</p>\n<p>* How do software tools affect young people's interest in MINT<br>\n    studies?</p>\n<p>Submissions:</p>\n<p>Authors should prepare their papers in one column style of CEUR-WS<br>\n<a href=\"http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/samplestyles/\">http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/samplestyles/</a>.<br>\nThere are two categories of submissions:</p>\n<p>* Regular papers describing developed work with theoretical results<br>\n    (upto 15 pages)</p>\n<p>* Short papers on experience reports, tools or work in progress with<br>\n    preliminary results or just preparations for discussion (upto 6<br>\n    pages).<br>\nSubmission in PDF at <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmeei18\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmeei18</a>.</p>\n<p>Programme Committee:</p>\n<p>Karl-Josef Fuchs, University of Salzburg<br>\n  Zoltan Kovacs, Private University of Education Diocese Linz<br>\n  Walther Neuper, Graz University of Technology<br>\n  Barbara Sabitzer, Johannes Kepler University Linz<br>\n  Wolfgang Schreiner, Johannes Kepler University Linz</p>",
