They are also becoming more and more important<br>\nin many application domains, including aviation, automotive, railway,<br>\nrobotic, or medical applications, where both safety and security are<br>\nrelevant aspects. To ensure the correct functioning of safety-critical<br>\nsystems it is necessary to model and reason about hardware, software,<br>\ncommunication aspects, physical properties, and the system<br>\nenvironment.</p>\n<p>LfSA’12 is the second workshop on Logics for System Analysis, devoted<br>\nto the systematic theoretical study, practical development, and<br>\napplied use of logics for system analysis. The purpose of the LfSA<br>\nworkshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested<br>\nin studying practically relevant systems or in developing the logical<br>\nfoundations and analysis tools for their study.</p>\n<p>Topics include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Logics for safety-critical systems (real-time, embedded, hybrid,<br>\n  distributed, stochastic, cyber-physical)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logic-based methods for development of safety-critical systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logics to study security aspects of systems or protocols</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>System representations using logics, automata, modeling languages,<br>\n  state charts, Petri nets, dataflow models</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theories, decision procedures, and calculi for system analysis</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Model checking, theorem proving, and systematic testing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies for logical system analysis</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of system analysis to industrial problems</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular, we invite contributions that bridge the gap between<br>\ntheory and practice or that combine different application domains.</p>\n<p>Submission Categories</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Regular papers (up to 15 pages), which should present previously<br>\n  unpublished work (completed or in progress), including descriptions<br>\n  of research, tools, and applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short papers (up to 5 pages), which describe work in progress or aim<br>\n  at initiating discussions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Presentation-only papers, i.e., papers already submitted or<br>\n  presented at a conference or another workshop; such papers will not<br>\n  be included in the LfSA proceedings but will be presented during the<br>\n  workshop.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to informal and electronic workshop proceedings, we<br>\nconsider the option of a special issue in a journal after the workshop</p>\n<p>Workshop/Programme Chairs</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Andre Platzer<br>\n  Carnegie Mellon University</p>\n<p>Philipp Ruemmer<br>\n  Uppsala University</p>\n<p>Programme Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A.
