I can't remember how many times during my Master's I thought<br>\n\"There must already be a lemma for this; I wonder what it's called\", or<br>\n\"I'm sure I've seen a lemma suitable for this, but I can't remember what<br>\nit's called\", or \"Haven't I already proven a lemma that'll work here?  I<br>\nwonder what I called it\".  Find theorems was incredibly useful.</p>\n<p>Tim<br>\n&lt;&gt;&lt;<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/5Y-KjbPsUL6uypf_lCESnBAb/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
