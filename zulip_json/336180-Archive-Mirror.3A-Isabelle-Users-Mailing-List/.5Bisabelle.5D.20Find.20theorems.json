So, the string \"pred\" does not refer to this<br>\nconstant.  This rules out find_theorems as a device to search for<br>\n\"hidden\" constants.</p>\n<p>Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/CNN_KY72if69p3aen7tnXudb/florian_haftmann.vcf\">florian_haftmann.vcf</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/BbeLTToCLpaMiP7seZSKptT-/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
