Sets also occur in the formalization of mathematics,<br>\nas evidenced by the large library of the Mizar proof system, for<br>\nexample. In addition, still in the domain of verification, there is an<br>\nincreasing interest to automate set theory (which is known to be a<br>\ndifficult problem), with some concrete realizations, such as mp (the<br>\n\"main prover\" of Atelier B) or Muscadet (an automated theorem prover<br>\nfor natural deduction, which gives some good performances in set<br>\ntheory). Sets are also the main features of some programming languages<br>\nlike the former SetL language or the more recent {log} language<br>\n(pronounced as setlog).</p>\n<p>The workshop aims at bringing together researchers interested in set<br>\ntheory, especially to design tools for dealing with set theory, such as<br>\ninteractive or automated theorem provers, proof checkers, theories for<br>\ngeneral purpose proof tools, constraint solvers, programming languages<br>\netc. We are interested in specialized tools for set theory as well as<br>\ngeneral-purpose tools where sets coexist with other theories.<br>\nContributions by theoreticians working on the mechanical processing of<br>\n(fragment of) set theory, and by practitioners using set-based tools<br>\nare both welcome. We are also interested in contributions providing<br>\nsome comparisons between set modeling techniques and other formalisms,<br>\nsuch as type theory (and its variants) for instance. Finally, regarding<br>\nthe domains of application, we mainly expect contributions in the<br>\nframework of formal methods, but we are open to, for instance,<br>\ncontributions reporting formalizations of mathematics using set theory.</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of set theory<br>\nand corresponding tools. More specifically, some suggested topics are:</p>\n<p>* Proof tools for sets<br>\n  * Constraint solvers for sets<br>\n  * Set-based programming languages<br>\n  * Automated verification in set theory<br>\n  * Encoding of sets in provers<br>\n  * Set theories for SMT solvers<br>\n  * Use of set-based tools in formal methods<br>\n  * Use of set-based tools in mathematics<br>\n  * Using any of the above tools to teach set theory<br>\n  * Comparison of set-based tools<br>\n  * Comparison between set and type theories<br>\n  * Experience reports</p>\n<p>CONTRIBUTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p>Submitted papers must be 6-15 pages long, following the Springer LNCS<br>\nformat. These submissions may be:</p>\n<p>* Research papers providing new concepts and results<br>\n  * Position papers and research perspectives<br>\n  * Experience reports<br>\n  * Tool presentations</p>\n<p>Proceedings, including all the papers selected for the workshop, will<br>\nbe published as online proceedings in the CEUR workshop proceedings<br>\nseries (<a href=\"http://CEUR-WS.org\">CEUR-WS.org</a>).</p>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSION</p>\n<p>Contributions must be submitted electronically in PDF format using the<br>\nSETS 2018 EasyChair web site at the following address:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sets2018\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sets2018</a></p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>Abstract submission: April 2, 2018<br>\nSubmission deadline: April 9, 2018<br>\nPaper notification:  May 9, 2018<br>\nRevised/final paper: May 16, 2018<br>\nWorkshop:            June 5, 2018</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME CO-CHAIRS</p>\n<p>Maximiliano Cristia (UNR, Argentina)<br>\nDavid Delahaye (Université de Montpellier, France)<br>\nCatherine Dubois (ENSIIE, France)</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>Maximiliano Cristia (Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Argentina)<br>\nDavid Deharbe (Clearsy, France)<br>\nDavid Delahaye (Université de Montpellier, France)<br>\nCatherine Dubois (ENSIIE, France)<br>\nLeo Freitas (Newcastle University, UK)<br>\nCarmen Gervet (Université de Montpellier, France)<br>\nOlivier Hermant (Mines ParisTech, France)<br>\nMichael Leuschel (Universität Düsseldorf, Germany)<br>\nStephan Merz (INRIA Nancy &amp; LORIA, France)<br>\nEugenio Omodeo (Università degli Studi di Trieste, Italy)<br>\nAndrew Reynolds (University of Iowa, USA)<br>\nGianfranco Rossi (Università di Parma, Italy)<br>\nJosef Urban (CIIRC, Czech Republic)<br>\nWolfgang Windsteiger (Johannes Kepler University, Austria)<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/hPmpahXZKvvNxpXjKqdB_gXl/catherine_dubois.vcf\">catherine_dubois.vcf</a></p>",
