Separate communities have developed to investigate and build<br>\ncomputer based systems for computer algebra, automated deduction, and<br>\nmathematical publishing as well as novel user interfaces. While all of these<br>\nsystems excel in their own right, their integration can lead to synergies<br>\noffering significant added value. The Conference on Intelligent Computer<br>\nMathematics (CICM) offers a venue for discussing and developing solutions <br>\nto the great challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.</p>\n<p>CICM has been held annually as a joint meeting since 2008, co-locating<br>\nrelated conferences and workshops to advance work in these<br>\nsubjects. Previous meetings have been held in Birmingham (UK 2008),<br>\nGrand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France 2010), Bertinoro (Italy 2011),<br>\nBremen (Germany 2012), Bath (UK 2013), and Coimbra (Portugal 2014).</p>\n<p>This is a (short version of the) call for papers for CICM 2015, which<br>\nwill be held in Washington, D.C., 13-17 July 2015.</p>\n<p>The full version of the CFP is available from the conference web page at<br>\n<a href=\"http://cicm-conference.org/2015/cicm.php\">http://cicm-conference.org/2015/cicm.php</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The principal tracks of the conference will be:</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Calculemus (Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning)<br>\n  Chair: Jacques Carette</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DML (Digital Mathematical Libraries)<br>\n  Chair: Volker Sorge</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MKM (Mathematical Knowledge Management)<br>\n  Chair: Cezary Kaliszyk</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Systems and Data<br>\n  Chair: Florian Rabe</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Publicity chair is Serge Autexier. The local arrangements will be<br>\ncoordinated by the Local Arrangements Chairs, Bruce R. Miller<br>\n(National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA) and Abdou<br>\nYoussef (The George Washington University, Washington, D.C.), and the<br>\noverall programme will be organized by the General Programme Chair,<br>\nManfred Kerber (U. Birmingham, UK).</p>\n<p>As in previous years, it is anticipated that there will be a number<br>\nco-located workshops, including one to mentor doctoral students giving<br>\npresentations. We also solicit for project descriptions and<br>\nwork-in-progress papers.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Conference submissions:<br>\nAbstract submission deadline:      16 February 2015<br>\nSubmission deadline:               23 February 2015<br>\nReviews sent to authors:            6 April    2015<br>\nRebuttals due:                      9 April    2015<br>\nNotification of acceptance:        13 April    2015<br>\nCamera ready copies due:           27 April    2015<br>\nConference:                     13-17 July     2015</p>\n<p>Work-in-progress and Doctoral Programme submissions:<br>\nSubmission deadline:<br>\n(Doctoral: Abstract+CV)             4 May      2015<br>\nNotification of acceptance:        25 May      2015<br>\nCamera ready copies due:            1 June     2015</p>\n<p>More detailed information, e.g. on submission via EasyChair, can be found on<br>\n<a href=\"http://cicm-conference.org/2015/cicm.php\">http://cicm-conference.org/2015/cicm.php</a></p>",
