It can build on<br>\nexisting validation and verification (V&amp;V) techniques but introduces<br>\nthe notion of explicit software certificates, which contain all the<br>\ninformation necessary for an independent assessment of the<br>\ndemonstrated properties. One such example is proof-carrying code (PCC)<br>\nwhich is an important and distinctive approach to enhancing trust in<br>\nprograms. It provides a practical framework for independent assurance<br>\nof program behaviour; especially where source code is not available,<br>\nor the code author and user are unknown to each other.</p>\n<p>The workshop will address theoretical foundations of logic-based<br>\nsoftware certification as well as practical examples and work on<br>\nalternative application domains. Here \"certificate\" is construed<br>\nbroadly, to include not just mathematical derivations and proofs but<br>\nalso safety and assurance cases, or any formal evidence that supports<br>\nthe semantic analysis of programs: that is, evidence about an<br>\nintrinsic property of code and its behaviour that can be independently<br>\nchecked by any user, intermediary, or third party. These guarantees<br>\nmean that software certificates raise trust in the code itself,<br>\ndistinct from and complementary to any existing trust in the creator<br>\nof the code, the process used to produce it, or its distributor.</p>\n<p>In addition to the contributed talks, the workshop will feature two<br>\ninvited talks.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Two types of submissions are solicited:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard papers (at most 10 pages) describing novel research results.</li>\n<li>Short papers (at most 5 pages) describing a novel idea that is<br>\nwork-in-progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication<br>\nin the final version may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that<br>\nis not included in the page limit.</p>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit their papers electronically, in PDF<br>\nformat via the EasyChair submission web page:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pcc09\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pcc09</a></p>\n<p>All submissions will be fully reviewed.</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Proceedings will be made available in electronic format as a technical<br>\nreport. A follow-up special issue of a journal on the topics of<br>\nproof-carrying code and software certification is under consideration.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>David Aspinall, University of Edinburgh<br>\nGilles Barthe, IMDEA Software<br>\nEwen Denney, RIACS/NASA Ames, co-chair<br>\nBernd Fischer, University of Southampton<br>\nSofia Guerra, Adelard<br>\nKelly Hayhurst, NASA Langley<br>\nThomas Jensen, IRISA/CNRS, co-chair<br>\nDavid Pichardie, INRIA<br>\nGerman Puebla, Technical University of Madrid<br>\nIan Stark, University of Edinburgh</p>",
