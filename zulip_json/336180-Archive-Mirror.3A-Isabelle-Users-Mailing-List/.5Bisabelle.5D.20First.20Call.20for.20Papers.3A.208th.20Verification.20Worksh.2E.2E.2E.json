Nevertheless, the area is of still growing importance<br>\nas the number of computers  affecting everyday life and the complexity<br>\nof  these systems  are  both  increasing. The  purpose  of the  VERIFY<br>\nworkshop  series is  to  discuss problems  arising  during the  formal<br>\nmodeling and  verification of  information systems and  to investigate<br>\nsuitable solutions.  Possible perspectives include those  of automated<br>\ntheorem proving, tool support, system engineering, and applications.</p>\n<p>The VERIFY  workshop series aims  at bringing together people  who are<br>\ninterested in the development of safety and security critical systems,<br>\nin formal  methods, in  the development  of automated  theorem proving<br>\ntechniques,  and  in  the   development  of  tool  support.  Practical<br>\nexperiences gained in  realistic verifications are of  interest to the<br>\nautomated theorem proving community and new theorem proving techniques<br>\nshould  be transferred  into practice.  The overall  objective of  the<br>\nVERIFY workshops is to identify  open problems and to discuss possible<br>\nsolutions under the theme</p>\n<p>What are the verification problems? What are the deduction techniques?</p>\n<p>The 2014 edition of VERIFY aims for extending the verification methods<br>\nfor processes implemented in hard-  and software to processes that may<br>\nwell include computer-assistance, but have  a large part or a frequent<br>\ninteraction  with non-computer-based  process  steps.  Hence the  2014<br>\nedition will run under the focus theme</p>\n<p>Verification Beyond IT Systems</p>\n<p>A  non-exclusive list of application areas  with these characteristics<br>\nare</p>\n<p>* Ambient assisted living<br>\n       * Intelligent home systems and processes<br>\n       * Business systems and processes<br>\n       * Production logistics systems and processes<br>\n       * Transportation logistics<br>\n       * Clinical processes<br>\n       * Social systems and processes (e.g., voting systems)</p>\n<p>The scope of VERIFY includes topics such as</p>\n<p>* ATP techniques in verification<br>\n       * Case studies (specification &amp; verification)<br>\n       * Combination of verification systems<br>\n       * Integration of ATPs and CASE-tools<br>\n       * Compositional &amp; modular reasoning<br>\n       * Experience reports on using formal methods<br>\n       * Gaps between problems &amp; techniques<br>\n       * Formal methods for fault tolerance<br>\n       * Information flow control security<br>\n       * Refinement &amp; decomposition<br>\n       * Reliability of mobile computing<br>\n       * Reuse of specifications &amp; proofs<br>\n       * Management of change<br>\n       * Safety-critical systems<br>\n       * Security models<br>\n       * Tool support for formal methods</p>\n<p>Submissions are encouraged in one of the following two categories:</p>\n<p>A. Regular  paper:  Submissions  in  this  category  should   describe<br>\n   previously unpublished  work (completed or in  progress), including<br>\n   descriptions of research, tools,  and applications.  Papers must be<br>\n   5-14  pages  long (in  EasyChair  style)  or  6-15 pages  long  (in<br>\n   Springer LNCS style).</p>\n<p>B. Discussion  papers: Submissions  in this  category are  intended to<br>\n   initiate discussions and hence should address controversial issues,<br>\n   and may include  provocative statements. Papers must  be 3-14 pages<br>\n   long  (in EasyChair  style) or  3-15 pages  long (in  Springer LNCS<br>\n   style).</p>\n<p>Important dates<br>\n   Abstract Submission Deadline:    April 17th, 2014<br>\n   Paper Submission Deadline:       April 25th, 2014<br>\n   Notification of acceptance:      May 20, 2014<br>\n   Final version due:               May 27, 2014<br>\n   Workshop date:                   July 23–24, 2014</p>\n<p>Submission is via EasyChair:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=verify2014\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=verify2014</a></p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Serge Autexier (DFKI) - chair<br>\n Bernhard Beckert (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) - chair<br>\n Wolfgang Ahrendt (Chalmers University of Technology)<br>\n Juan Augusto (Middlesex University)<br>\n Iliano Cervesato (Carnegie Mellon University)<br>\n Jacques Fleuriot (University of Edinburgh)<br>\n Marieke Huisman (University of Twente)<br>\n Dieter Hutter (DFKI GmbH)<br>\n Reiner Hähnle (Technical University of Darmstadt)<br>\n Deepak Kapur (University of New Mexico)<br>\n Gerwin Klein (NICTA and UNSW)<br>\n Joe Leslie-Hurd (Intel Corporation)<br>\n Fabio Martinelli (IIT-CNR)<br>\n Catherine Meadows (NRL)<br>\n Stephan Merz (INRIA Lorraine)<br>\n Tobias Nipkow (TU München)<br>\n Lawrence Paulson (University of Cambridge)<br>\n Johann Schumann (SGT, Inc/NASA Ames)<br>\n Kurt Stenzel (University of Augsburg)</p>",
