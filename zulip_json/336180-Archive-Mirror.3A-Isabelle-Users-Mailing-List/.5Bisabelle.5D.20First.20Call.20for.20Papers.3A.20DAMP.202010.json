Modern  platforms  are <br>\nbecoming more complex and heterogenous and novel solutions  are needed<br>\nto account for their peculiarities.<br>\nMulticore  architectures will  differ in  significant ways  from their<br>\nmultisocket  predecessors. For example,  the communication  to compute<br>\nbandwidth ratio is  likely to be higher, which  will positively impact<br>\nperformance. More generally, multicore architectures introduce several<br>\nnew  dimensions  of variability  in  both  performance guarantees  and<br>\narchitectural  contracts,  such as  the  memory  model,  that may  not<br>\nstabilize for several generations of product.</p>\n<p>Programs  written  in  functional  or  (constraint-)logic  programming<br>\nlanguages, or in other highly declarative languages  with a controlled  <br>\nuse of side effects, can  greatly simplify parallel  programming. Such <br>\ndeclarative programming  allows  for  a  deterministic semantics  even  <br>\nwhen  the underlying implementation might be highly non-deterministic.  <br>\nIn addition to simplifying programming this can simplify debugging and<br>\nanalyzing correctness.</p>\n<p>DAMP 2010 is the  fifth in  a series of  one-day  workshops seeking to <br>\nexplore  ideas in  declarative  programming  language design that will <br>\ngreatly  simplify programming for  multicore  architectures, and  more <br>\ngenerally  for tightly  coupled parallel  architectures.  The emphasis <br>\nwill  be  on (constraint-)logic and  functional  programming, but  any <br>\ndeclarative programming language ideas that aim to raise the level of <br>\nabstraction are welcome. DAMP seeks to gather together researchers in <br>\ndeclarative approaches to parallel programming and to foster cross <br>\nfertilization across different approaches.</p>\n<p>Specific topics include, but are not limited to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>investigation  of applications  of logic,  constraint logic, and <br>\n   functional programing to multicore programing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>run-time issues of exploitation of parallelism using declarative <br>\n   programming approaches (e.g., garbage collection, scheduling)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>architectural   impact  on  exploitation  of  parallelism   from <br>\n   declarative languages</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>type systems and analysis for accurately detecting dependencies, <br>\n   aliasing, side effects, and impure features</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>language level declarative constructs for expressing parallelism</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>declarative language  specification for  the description of data <br>\n   placement and distribution</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>compilation   and   static analysis   techniques   to    support <br>\n   exploitation  of  parallelism from declarative  languages (e.g., <br>\n   granularity control)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>practical  experiences  and  challenges  arising  from  parallel <br>\n   declarative programming</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>technology for debugging parallel programs</p>\n</li>\n<li>design  and   implementation   of  domain-specific   declarative <br>\n   languages for multicore programming</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission:</p>\n<p>Submitted  papers  papers  should  not  exceed  10  pages  in ACM<br>\n  SIGPLAN conference format.
