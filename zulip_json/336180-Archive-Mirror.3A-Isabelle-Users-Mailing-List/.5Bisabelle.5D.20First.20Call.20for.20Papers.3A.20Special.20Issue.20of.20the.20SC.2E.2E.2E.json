These topics are to be interpreted broadly and inclusively. It covers all aspects<br>\nof automated verification, and typical (but not exclusive) topics of interest are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Model Checking</li>\n<li>Automatic and Interactive Theorem Proving</li>\n<li>SAT, SMT or Constraint Solving for Verification</li>\n<li>Abstract Interpretation</li>\n<li>Specification and Refinement</li>\n<li>Requirements Capture and Analysis</li>\n<li>Verification of Software and Hardware</li>\n<li>Specification and Verification of Fault Tolerance and Resilience</li>\n<li>Probabilistic and Real-Time Systems</li>\n<li>Dependable Systems</li>\n<li>Verified System Development</li>\n<li>Industrial Applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission to this special issue is open. We expect original articles (typically 20-30 pages) that present high-quality contributions,<br>\nhave not been previously published in an archival venue and that must not be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Submissions must be written in English and comply with SCP's author guidelines</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505623/authorinstructions\">http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505623/authorinstructions</a></p>\n<p>Submission is over the SCP website:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ees.elsevier.com/scico/default.asp\">http://ees.elsevier.com/scico/default.asp</a></p>\n<p>which you will have to register for if you do not have an account.<br>\nWhen submitting your paper please choose the article type \"Special issue: AVoCS 2015\".</p>\n<p>Please send any queries you may have to Gudmund Grov (<a href=\"mailto:G.Grov@hw.ac.uk\">G.Grov@hw.ac.uk</a>)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We invite research leaders and ambitious early career researchers to <br>\njoin us in leading and driving research in key inter-disciplinary themes. <br>\nPlease see <a href=\"http://www.hw.ac.uk/researchleaders\">www.hw.ac.uk/researchleaders</a> for further information and how<br>\nto apply.</p>\n<p>Heriot-Watt University is a Scottish charity<br>\nregistered under charity number SC000278.</p>",
