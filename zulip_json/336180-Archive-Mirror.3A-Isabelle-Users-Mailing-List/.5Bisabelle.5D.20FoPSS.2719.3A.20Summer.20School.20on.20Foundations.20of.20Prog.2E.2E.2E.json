Each year the school is focused on a particular, <br>\nactively researched topic.</p>\n<p>Our focus in 2019 are Nominal Techniques in Computer Science. <br>\nFor the introduction and cornerstone contributions to this area <br>\nMurdoch J. Gabbay and Andrew M. Pitts received the 2019 Alonzo Church <br>\nAward. Both of them are among the lecturers of FoPSS 2019.</p>\n<p>The scientific programme of the school is available from our website:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~fopss19/programme.html\">https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~fopss19/programme.html</a></p>\n<p>Registration fee includes lunches, coffee breaks and accommodation <br>\nin a hotel within a walking distance from the school venue. <br>\nWe have a few scholarships available to participants who have difficult <br>\naccess to funding.</p>\n<p>Registration is open!</p>\n<p>==================================================================<br>\nCOLOCATED EVENT:<br>\nHighlights 2019: 7th annual conference on Highlights of Logic, <br>\nGames and Automata<br>\n17-20 September<br>\n(<a href=\"http://highlights-conference.org\">http://highlights-conference.org</a>)</p>",
