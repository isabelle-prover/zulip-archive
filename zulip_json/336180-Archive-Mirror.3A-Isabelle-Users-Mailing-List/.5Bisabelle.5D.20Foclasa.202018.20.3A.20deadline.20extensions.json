Service   coordination  and   self-adaptation<br>\nconstitute   the   core   character    istics   of   distributed   and<br>\nservice-oriented   systems.    Coordination   languages   and   formal<br>\napproaches to  modelling and  reasoning about  self-adaptive behaviour<br>\nhelp to simplify the  development of complex distributed service-based<br>\nsystems, enable functional correctness  proofs and improve reusability<br>\nand maintainability of such systems.  The goal of the FOCLASA workshop<br>\nis  to  gather researchers  and  practitioners  of the  aforementioned<br>\nfields, to share  and identify common problems, and  to devise general<br>\nsolutions in  the context of coordination  languages and self-adaptive<br>\nsystems.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical  models   and  frameworks  for   component  and  service<br>\n  coordination, service composition, service adaptation and concurrent<br>\n  system modeling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications and usability studies for the aforementioned theoretical<br>\n  models,   interaction  and   coordination   challenges  in   various<br>\n  application domains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Languages  and  specification protocols  for  component and  service<br>\n  interaction,   their  semantics,   expressiveness,   validation  and<br>\n  verification,   type   checking,   static  and   dynamic   analysis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"Software as  a service\" models (e.g., cloud  computing) and dynamic<br>\n  software  architectures, such  as self-adaptive  and self-organizing<br>\n  systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tools  and  environments  for  the  development  of  concurrent  and<br>\n  customizable  self-monitoring,   self-adaptive  and  self-organizing<br>\n  applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Algorithms,  mathematical  models  and  realization  frameworks  for<br>\n  quality-of-service  observation, storage, history-based  analysis in<br>\n  self-adaptive systems (queuing  models, load  balancing, analysis of<br>\n  fault-tolerance, machine learning systems).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Practice, experience  and methodologies  from the following  areas are<br>\nsolicited as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business process modelling</li>\n<li>Blockchains</li>\n<li>Cloud/fog/edge computing</li>\n<li>Component-based systems</li>\n<li>Large-scale distributed systems</li>\n<li>(Micro)service-based systems</li>\n<li>Multi-agent systems</li>\n<li>Peer-to-peer systems</li>\n<li>Self-adaptive systems<p>PROCEEDINGS</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The  conference proceedings  will  be published  by  Springer, in  the<br>\nLecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.</p>\n<p>Extended versions of  a selection of the best papers  is planned to be<br>\npublished  in  a special  issue  of  an  international journal  as  in<br>\nprevious issues of FOCLASA.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p>Papers must be submitted electronically in  PostScript or PDF by using<br>\na two-phase online submission process. Registration of information and<br>\nand abstract (max. 250 words) of papers must be completed before April<br>\n22, 2018.  Final submission of papers is  due no later  than April 30,<br>\n2018. All submissions will be handled through the EasyChair conference <br>\nmanagement system, accessible from the conference web site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pages.di.unipi.it/foclasa\">http://pages.di.unipi.it/foclasa</a></p>\n<p>Contributions must  be  written in  English  and  report on  original,<br>\nunpublished work not submitted for publication elsewhere. Full papers<br>\nshould  be  15  pages  long, including  figures  and  references, and<br>\nprepared by using Springer's LNCS style.  Short papers (6 pages long)<br>\ndescribing  preliminary results or work-in-progress are encouraged as<br>\nwell. Submissions not adhering to the above specified constraints may<br>\nbe rejected without any review.  Papers should be submitted as PDF or<br>\nPS via EasyChair.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>Co-Chairs</p>\n<p>Jean-Marie Jacquet       University of Namur, Belgium<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:Jean-Marie.Jacquet@unamur.be\">Jean-Marie.Jacquet@unamur.be</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://staff.info.unamur.be/jmj\">http://staff.info.unamur.be/jmj</a></p>\n<p>Jacopo Soldani           University of Pisa<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:soldani@di.unipi.it\">soldani@di.unipi.it</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://pages.di.unipi.it/soldani/\">http://pages.di.unipi.it/soldani/</a></p>\n<p>Members</p>\n<p>Gul Agha, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA<br>\nPedro Alvarez, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain<br>\nFarhad Arbab, CWI, The Netherlands<br>\nSimon Bliudze, INRIA Lille - Nord Europe, France<br>\nRadu Calinescu, University of York, UK<br>\nJavier Camara, Carnegie Mellon University, USA<br>\nFlavio De Paoli, University of Milano, Italy<br>\nFrancisco J.
