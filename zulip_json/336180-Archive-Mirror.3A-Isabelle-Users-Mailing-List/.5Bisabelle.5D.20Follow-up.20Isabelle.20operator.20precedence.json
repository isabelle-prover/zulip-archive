I think this is<br>\nimportant because they appear mixed with HOL operators frequently, so<br>\nhaving it all in one place is useful and avoids confusion. Just<br>\nbecause an operator is actually from the underlying Pure does not<br>\nchange the fact that it is part of the normal HOL style and workflow,<br>\nso it still belongs in such a list.

Looking at <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/diff/0eaefd4306d7/src/Doc/Main/Main_Doc.thy\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/diff/0eaefd4306d7/src/Doc/Main/Main_Doc.thy</a> and given that you asked for feedback (on Pure)<br>\nI'm wondering why they are ordered in this way (maybe the list <br>\nis automatically generated which would be good from a<br>\nmaintainability perspective), otherwise perhaps just order them<br>\nascending or descending and perhaps add a sentence ``functions<br>\nalways beat relations, relations always beat HOL logic symbols,<br>\nHOL logic symbols always beat Pure'' (maybe I'm oversimplifying ...)<br>\nIf the list is autogenerated then just write that (so a reader<br>\ndoes not have to try to discover any meaning ...). Or briefly explain the <br>\nother ordering principle you applied.</p>\n<p>I'd also second Arthur that Pure would be nice to have too (unless<br>\nit is already elsewhere).
