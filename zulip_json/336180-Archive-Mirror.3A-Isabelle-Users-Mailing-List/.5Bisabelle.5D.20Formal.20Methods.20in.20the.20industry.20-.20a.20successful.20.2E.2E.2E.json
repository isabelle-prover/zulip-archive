In other words, for the ADV class, we have obtained the<br>\nhighest assurance level (EAL7).</p>\n<p>This evaluation has been done following the French scheme (DCSSI) while<br>\ntaking into account the new requirements on the use of Formal Methods,<br>\nin particular, the application notes AIS34 and AIS39 (*) issued by the<br>\nBSI(**). </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From a more technical point of view, the formal models and proofs<br>\ndeveloped in this work ensure the safe execution of any<br>\nbytecode-verified applet on the product. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We will warmly welcome all your questions and/or remarks on this work.</p>\n<p>===============================<br>\nFormal Methods group<br>\nGemalto Technology &amp; Innovation</p>\n<p>(*) AIS34: Evaluation Methodology for CC Assurance Classes for EAL5+ <br>\n    AIS39: Guideline for the Development and Evaluation of formal<br>\nsecurity<br>\n    policy models in the scope of ITSEC and Common Criteria</p>\n<p>(**) The Certification Body of the German Federal Office for Information<br>\nSecurity</p>",
