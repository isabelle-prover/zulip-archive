The syntax of the Isar proof <br>\nscripting language is defined fairly formally in Section 6 of The <br>\nIsabelle / Isar Reference Manual and it is accompanied by an informal <br>\nand high level English explanation of each construct or group of <br>\nconstruct, but I have not yet found a formal description of the <br>\nlanguage, via, say, something like modular structural operational <br>\nsemantics.  I'm not looking for any one particular style of semantics, <br>\nbut I would like something rigorous enough that it could be expressed in <br>\nIsabelle, and rigorous enough so that it would explain why</p>\n<p>lemma fixes A and B shows \"A ⟶ (A ⟶ B) ⟶ B\"<br>\nproof (rule impI)<br>\n  assume A: \"A\"<br>\n  show \"(A ⟶ B) ⟶ B\"<br>\n  proof (rule impI)<br>\n   assume AB: \"A ⟶ B\"<br>\n   from AB and A<br>\n   show \"B\"<br>\n   by (rule mp)<br>\n  qed<br>\nqed</p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p>lemma fixes A and B shows \"A ⟶ (A ⟶ B) ⟶ B\"<br>\nproof (rule impI)<br>\n  assume A: \"A\"<br>\n  show \"(A ⟶ B) ⟶ B\"<br>\n  proof (rule impI)<br>\n   assume AB: \"A ⟶ B\"<br>\n   from AB and A<br>\n   show \"B\"<br>\n   by (rule impE)<br>\n  qed<br>\nqed</p>\n<p>both succeed, but</p>\n<p>lemma fixes A and B shows \"A ⟶ (A ⟶ B) ⟶ B\"<br>\nproof (rule impI)<br>\n  assume A: \"A\"<br>\n  show \"(A ⟶ B) ⟶ B\"<br>\n  proof (rule impI)<br>\n   assume AB: \"A ⟶ B\"<br>\n   from A and AB<br>\n   show \"B\"<br>\n   by (rule mp)<br>\n  qed<br>\nqed</p>\n<p>fails at by (rule mp).</p>\n<p>---Elsa</p>\n<p>Elsa L Gunter<br>\nDepartment of Computer Science<br>\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign</p>",

But you might note the the second proof, using impE is <br>\nwilling to fill in the proof of B ==&gt; B; I did not have to separately <br>\nderive B and supply it explicitly as the third hypothesis, even though <br>\nimpE has three hypotheses/subgoals required.  So sometime proof is <br>\nwilling to look among the available hypotheses to see if a generated <br>\nsubgoal is among them (perhaps it will only do so for assumptions it <br>\njust generated?), but other times (perhaps when they are given through <br>\nfrom?) it will not.  Apparently, the order of the from clauses matter by <br>\nwhy is quite unclear to me.    Anyway, it is my feeling and hope that <br>\nsuch matters can be resolved by reference to a formal semantics and not <br>\nby experimenting with a given implementation.<br>\n---Elsa</p>",
