Please see</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jobs.york.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=3885&amp;p_web_page_id=139452\">https://jobs.york.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=3885&amp;p_web_page_id=139452</a></p>\n<p>and the further particulars available there.  I was wondering if you<br>\nwould have any good students or RAs that might be suitable and<br>\ninterested?  If you could help by advertising the position in your<br>\ninstitution, then I'd be most grateful.</p>\n<p>Many thanks in advance,</p>\n<p>Jim</p>",
