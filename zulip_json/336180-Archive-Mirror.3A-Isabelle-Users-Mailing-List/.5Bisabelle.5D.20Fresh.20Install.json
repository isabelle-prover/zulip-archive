From a Win XP machine <br>\nthere are several ways to migrate (with a 64bit OS as target)</p>\n<p>a) Win XP/32bit --&gt; Win 7/32bit<br>\nb) Win XP/32bit --&gt; Win 7/64bit<br>\nc) Win XP/32bit --&gt; Win 7/32bit --&gt; Win 7/64bit<br>\nd) Win XP/32bit --&gt; Win XP/64bit --&gt; Win 7/64bit</p>\n<p>One problem lies in the availability of familiar packages on Win 7/64 <br>\nbit. I did a) on one machine and now the LyX document processor, based <br>\non MikTex, does not work any longer. MikTex simply does not install on <br>\n64bit Windows. MinGW does install. And also CygWin works on Win 7 and <br>\nthus Isabelle!</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nJens</p>",

I have LyX set up to run <br>\nportable off of a hard drive, using the portable MiKTex. I just compiled <br>\na document with LyX on a Windows 7 32-bit machine.</p>\n<p>If you're doing an upgrade from WinXP to Windows 7, rather than starting <br>\nwith a fresh Windows 7 install, LyX and MiKTeX could have configuration <br>\nfiles set up to look for files in the old XP locations rather than the <br>\nWindows 7 locations. The user document folder and application file <br>\nfolders are different for Windows 7. For example, the user folder on <br>\nWindows 7 is c:\\Users\\your_user_name\\Documents. On Windows 7 32-bit, in <br>\naddition to \"C:\\Program Files\", there's also a \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\".</p>\n<p>You might already know all that. It's been a while, but when I switched <br>\nto Windows 7 and tried to use my old LyX folder with it, it seems LyX <br>\nhad hard coded the WinXP file locations in its config files.</p>\n<p>--JF</p>",
