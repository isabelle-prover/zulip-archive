The other part of your <br>\nreply is the important technical part, and I'm still thinking about that <br>\npart.</p>\n<p>First, I'll make two general statements: (1) There's no good solution. <br>\n(2) With Isabelle, I'm out to cater to the market, however I need to do <br>\nthat.</p>\n<p>I have, at times, put a lot of thought into how I should ask code <br>\nrelated questions here. My short answer is usually, \"Use ASCII\".</p>\n<p>Part of the problem is there are two main markets for proof assistants: <br>\nthe world of mathematics and the world of computer science.</p>\n<p>Those in the world of computer science are, by default, programmers. <br>\nThose in the world of mathematics, by and large, aren't programmers at <br>\nall, or only have basic programming skills; consequently, they can <br>\nsometimes be hostile to unsugarcoated things of a programming nature.</p>\n<p>Trying to keep this short, I think part of my solution to catering to <br>\nthe two markets is to create at least two different THYs, along with the <br>\nPDFs. But then, I can't attach 4 files to every email sent to this list. <br>\nSo maybe I'll put them up somewhere on the web and provide links in the <br>\nemail. I'd have to refine my scripts to create an ASCII version which <br>\nisn't completely non-verbose.</p>\n<p>In the future, if have more suggestions about how I should give you my <br>\ncode, please make those suggestions.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nGB</p>",
