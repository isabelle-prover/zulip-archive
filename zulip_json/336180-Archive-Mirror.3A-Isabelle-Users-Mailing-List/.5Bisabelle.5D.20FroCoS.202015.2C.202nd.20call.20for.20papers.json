Its main goal is to disseminate and promote<br>\n progress in research areas related to the development of techniques<br>\n for the integration, combination, and modularization of formal<br>\n systems together with their analysis.</p>\n<p>FroCos 2015 will be co-located with the 23rd International<br>\n Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related<br>\n Methods (TABLEAUX 2015) to be held also on September 21-24, 2015.<br>\n The local organization of both events is handled by Hans de Nivelle.  </p>\n<p>SCOPE OF CONFERENCE <br>\n In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation,<br>\n program development and verification, artificial intelligence,<br>\n knowledge representation, and automated reasoning, there is an<br>\n obvious need for using specialized formalisms and inference systems<br>\n for selected tasks. To be usable in practice, these specialized<br>\n systems must be combined with each other and integrated into general<br>\n purpose systems. This has led---in many research areas---to the<br>\n development of techniques and methods for the combination and<br>\n integration of dedicated formal systems, as well as for their<br>\n modularization and analysis.</p>\n<p>The International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems<br>\n (FroCoS) traditionally focusses on these types of research questions<br>\n and activities. Like its predecessors, FroCoS 2015 seeks to offer a<br>\n common forum for research in the general area of combination,<br>\n modularization, and integration of systems, with emphasis on<br>\n logic-based ones, and of their practical use.</p>\n<p>Typical topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<p>* combinations of logics (such as higher-order, first-order,<br>\n     temporal, modal, description or other non-classical logics);</p>\n<p>* combination and integration methods in SAT and SMT solving;<br>\n   * combination of decision procedures, satisfiability<br>\n     procedures, constraint solving techniques, or logical <br>\n     frameworks;</p>\n<p>* combinations and modularity in ontologies;<br>\n   * integration of equational and other theories into deductive<br>\n     systems;</p>\n<p>* hybrid methods for deduction, resolution and constraint<br>\n     propagation;</p>\n<p>* hybrid systems in knowledge representation and natural<br>\n     language semantics;</p>\n<p>* combined logics for distributed and multi-agent systems;<br>\n   * logical aspects of combining and modularizing programs and<br>\n     specifications;</p>\n<p>* integration of data structures into constraint logic<br>\n     programming and deduction;</p>\n<p>* combinations and modularity in term rewriting;<br>\n   * applications of methods and techniques to the verification and<br>\n     analysis of information systems.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>\n [TO BE ANNOUNCED]</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION DETAILS<br>\n The proceedings of the symposium will be published in the<br>\n Springer LNAI/LNCS series.</p>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS<br>\n The program committee seeks high-quality submissions describing<br>\n original work, written in English, not overlapping with published or<br>\n simultaneously submitted work to a journal or conference with<br>\n archival proceedings. Selection criteria include accuracy and<br>\n originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and<br>\n quality of presentation. The page limit in Springer LNCS style is 16<br>\n pages.</p>\n<p>Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be<br>\n submitted electronically as PDF files via the EasyChair system at<br>\n the following address:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=frocos2015\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=frocos2015</a>.</p>\n<p>For each accepted paper, at least one of the authors is required to<br>\n attend the symposium and present the work. Prospective authors must<br>\n register a title and an abstract ten days before the paper<br>\n submission deadline. Further information about paper submissions is<br>\n available at the conference website that can be found at the<br>\n beginning of this call for papers.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES <br>\n May 4, 2015: Abstract submission deadline<br>\n May 10, 2015: Full paper submission deadline<br>\n June 22, 2015: Author notification<br>\n July 20, 2015: Camera-ready version due<br>\n September 19-20, 2015: Workshop/Tutorials<br>\n September 21-24, 2015: FroCoS Conference <br>\n September    25, 2015: Workshop/Tutorials</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>\n Alessandro Artale, Free University of Bolzano-Bozen<br>\n Franz Baader, TU Dresden<br>\n Clark Barrett, New York University<br>\n Peter Baumgartner, National ICT Australia (NICTA)<br>\n Christoph Benzmüller, Free University Berlin<br>\n Thomas Bolander, Technical University of Denmark<br>\n Torben Braüner, Roskilde University<br>\n Sylvain Conchon, Université Paris-Sud<br>\n Clare Dixon, University of Liverpool   <br>\n François Fages, Inria Paris-Rocquencourt<br>\n Pascal Fontaine, INRIA, LORIA, University of Lorraine<br>\n Didier Galmiche, LORIA, University of Lorraine<br>\n Silvio Ghilardi, Università degli Studi di Milano   <br>\n Jürgen Giesl, RWTH Aachen<br>\n Guido Governatori, National ICT Australia (NICTA)<br>\n Roman Kontchakov, Birkbeck College London<br>\n Carsten Lutz, University of Bremen [co-chair]<br>\n Till Mossakowski, University of Magdeburg<br>\n Silvio Ranise, Fondazione Bruno Kessler [co-chair]<br>\n Christophe Ringeissen, INRIA, LORIA<br>\n Renate A.
