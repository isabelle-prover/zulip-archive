In order to be<br>\nusable in practice, these specialized systems must be combined with<br>\neach other, and they must be integrated into general purpose<br>\nsystems. The development of general techniques and methods for the<br>\ncombination and integration of special formally defined systems, as<br>\nwell as for the analysis and modularization of complex systems has<br>\nbeen initiated in many areas. The International Workshop on Frontiers<br>\nof Combining Systems (FroCoS) traditionally focuses on this type of<br>\nresearch questions and activities and aims at promoting progress in<br>\nthe field. </p>\n<p>The previous FroCoS workshops were held in Munich (1996), Amsterdam<br>\n(1998), Nancy (2000) and Santa Margherita Ligure (2002). In 2004,<br>\nFroCoS joined IJCAR 2004, the 2nd International Joint Conference on<br>\nAutomated Reasoning. Like its predecessors, FroCoS 2005 offers <br>\na common forum for research activities in the general area of<br>\ncombination, modularization and integration of systems (with emphasis<br>\non logic-based ones), and of their practical use. </p>\n<p>Typical topics of interest to FroCoS include combination of logics;<br>\ncombination of decision procedures, of satisfiability procedures, and<br>\nof constraint solving techniques; combinations and modularity in term<br>\nrewriting; integration of equational and other theories into deductive<br>\nsystems; combination of deduction systems and computer algebra;<br>\nintegration of data structures into CLP formalisms and deduction<br>\nprocesses; model/problem analysis and decomposition; hybrid methods<br>\nfor deduction, resolution and constraint propagation; hybrid systems<br>\nin computational linguistics, knowledge representation, natural<br>\nlanguage semantics, and human computer interaction; logical modelling<br>\nof multi-agent systems; logical aspects of combining and modularizing<br>\nprograms and specifications. </p>\n<p>PROGRAM AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p>FroCoS 2005 will feature the following 4 invited talks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Sociable Interfaces<br>\n   by Luca de Alfaro (Univ. of California, Santa Cruz)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Comprehensive Framework for Combined Decision Procedures<br>\n   by Silvio Ghilardi (Univ. of Milano)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Matching Classifications via a Bidirectional Integration of SAT and<br>\n   Linguistic Resources  <br>\n   by Fausto Giunchiglia (Univ. of Trento &amp; ITC-IRST)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hybrid CSP Solving<br>\n   by Eric Monfroy (Univ. of Nantes &amp; UTFSM/Chile)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover the program includes 1 tutorial and 14 regular contributed<br>\ntalks coveringg a broad range of topics. The scientific part is<br>\ncomplemented by an interesting social program.
