In order to be usable in practice, these specialized systems<br>\nmust be combined with each other, and they must be integrated into<br>\ngeneral purpose systems. The development of general techniques and<br>\nmethods for the combination and integration of special formally defined<br>\nsystems, as well as for the analysis and modularization of complex<br>\nsystems has been initiated in many areas. The International Symposium<br>\non Frontiers of Combining Systems (FROCOS) traditionally focuses on<br>\nthis type of research questions and activities and aims at promoting<br>\nprogress in the field. <br>\nLike its predecessors, FROCOS’09 wants to offer a common forum for<br>\nresearch activities in the general area of combination, modularization<br>\nand integration of systems (with emphasis on logic-based ones), and of<br>\ntheir practical use.  </p>\n<p>RELEVANT TOPICS <br>\nTypical topics of interest include (but are not limited to): </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>combinations of logics such as combined predicate, temporal, modal,<br>\n  or epistemic logics;  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>combinations and modularity in ontologies; </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>combination of decision procedures, of satisfiability procedures,<br>\n  and of CS techniques;  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>combinations and modularity in term rewriting; </p>\n</li>\n<li>integration of equational and other theories into deductive systems; </li>\n<li>combination of deduction systems and computer algebra; </li>\n<li>integration of data structures into CLP formalisms and deduction processes; </li>\n<li>hybrid methods for deduction, resolution and constraint propagation; </li>\n<li>hybrid systems in knowledge representation and natural language semantics; </li>\n<li>combined logics for distributed and multi-agent systems; </li>\n<li>logical aspects of combining and modularizing programs and specifications. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSION <br>\nPapers must describe original work, be written and presented in<br>\nEnglish, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been<br>\npublished or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a<br>\nconference with refereed proceedings. Selection criteria include<br>\naccuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and significance of<br>\nresults, and quality of presentation. All submissions will be subject<br>\nto academic peer review by at least three members of the program<br>\ncommittee.
