Their 2019 editions will be hosted by the Middlesex University in London, from 3 to 6 September 2019. In keeping with the tradition of the two events, we invite proposals for colocated workshops and tutorials on all topics related to logical reasoning: from theoretical aspects, to applications, to tools for interactive or automated reasoning. Workshops and tutorials can target the logical systems community in general, or alternatively focus on a particular system, recent theoretical development or application. Colocated events will take place on 2 and 3 September 2019 (before the start of the conference programs) and will be held on the same premises as the main conferences. Workshop/tutorial-only attendees will enjoy a significantly reduced registration fee. Detailed matters such as the paper submission and review process, or the publication of proceedings, are up to the organizers of individual events. All accepted workshops and tutorials will be expected to have their program ready by 10 August 2019.</p>\n<p>Proposals for workshops and tutorials should contain at least the following pieces of information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>name and contact details of the main organizer(s)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(if applicable) names of additional organizers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>title and organizational style of event (tutorial, public workshop, project workshop, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>preferred length of workshop (between half day and two days)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>estimated number of attendees</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>short description of topic (up to one page)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(if applicable) pointers to previous editions of the workshop, or to similar events</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Proposals are invited to be submitted by email to <a href=\"mailto:chair@frocos2019.org\">chair@frocos2019.org</a> and <a href=\"mailto:chair@tableaux2019.org\">chair@tableaux2019.org</a>, no later than 1 March 2019. Selected events will be notified by 9 March 2019. The workshop/tutorial selection committee consists of the FroCoS and TABLEAUX program chairs and the conference organizers.</p>",
