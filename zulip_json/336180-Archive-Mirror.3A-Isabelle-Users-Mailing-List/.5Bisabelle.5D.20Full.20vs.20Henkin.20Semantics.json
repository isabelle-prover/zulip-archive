(a proper notion of) Henkin semantics. The deduction is of course sound for the full-frame semantics. </p>\n<p>Another note: As far as I see, what the theorem proving community calls \"the HOL logic\" is something quite specific, introduced in Mike Gordon's seminal HOL system: classic higher order logic with infinity, choice, rank-1 polymorphism, constant definitions and a \"typedef\" mechanism for introducing new types by carving out non-empty subsets of existing types. Isabelle/HOL additionally includes overloaded  constant definitions (with possible delay and recursion in the overloading process), which form the basis of type classes.  A proper notion of Henkin semantics needs to account for all these.  </p>\n<p>Best, <br>\n   Andrei </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Please note that Middlesex University's preferred way of receiving all correspondence is via email in line with our Environmental Policy.
