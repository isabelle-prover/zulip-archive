The idea is to have a small number of talks as an antidote to<br>\nmid-term blues, three afternoons a year. The hope is that talks will be<br>\ninformal and fun, and that there will be plenty of scope for discussion and<br>\nchat as well. </p>\n<p>Fun in the Afternoon will be peripatetic. The first meeting will be in<br>\nOxford University Computing Laboratory on Thursday 16th November, and Phil<br>\nWadler of the University of Edinburgh will be opening proceedings. All are<br>\nwelcome, but if you'd like to come, could you please drop me (Jeremy<br>\nGibbons) a line so that I have an idea of numbers?</p>\n<p>If you'd like to give a talk, please also propose a title and a duration.</p>\n<p>We haven't yet fixed the timetable, because it depends in part on what<br>\noffers of talks we get. But our current plan is to have talks 14:00-14:45<br>\nand 15:30-17:00. Brings sandwiches to eat together beforehand, and join us<br>\nfor drinks in a pub afterwards.</p>\n<p>There's a webpage with more information at </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sneezy.cs.nott.ac.uk/fun/\">http://sneezy.cs.nott.ac.uk/fun/</a></p>\n<p>This page also explains how to subscribe to the mailing list, to which all<br>\nfurther announcements will be sent.
