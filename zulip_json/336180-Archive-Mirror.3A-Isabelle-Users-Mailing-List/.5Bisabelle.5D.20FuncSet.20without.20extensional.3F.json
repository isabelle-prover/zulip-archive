I started with<br>\n  \"∃ f. bij_betw f (Pow X) (hom (ℱ\\&lt;^bsub&gt;X\\&lt;^esub&gt;) C2)\"<br>\nand it went relatively well... until I noticed that hom is not suitable<br>\nhere. Group.hom is defined via FuncSet.Pi, which has the following<br>\ndefinition:</p>\n<p>Pi :: \"['a set, 'a =&gt; 'b set] =&gt; ('a =&gt; 'b) set\" where<br>\n  \"Pi A B = {f. ∀x. x ∈ A --&gt; f x ∈ B x}\"<br>\n(With an abbreviation A -&gt; B).</p>\n<p>This means that for example ({} -&gt; {}) is not a one-element-set, but is<br>\nactually the set UNIV::('a -&gt; 'b).</p>\n<p>Right below the definition of Pi, there is a predicate specifying that<br>\nfunctions are undefined outside their definition:</p>\n<p>definition<br>\n  extensional :: \"'a set =&gt; ('a =&gt; 'b) set\" where<br>\n  \"extensional A = {f. ∀x. x~:A --&gt; f x = undefined}\"</p>\n<p>For my current goal, it would be great if this were part of the<br>\ndefinition of Pi. Would this be generally useful? Or are there hard<br>\nreasons not to require \"extensional A\" for function in \"A -&gt; B\"?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nJoachim<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/9liik7aocGn0vMzFlvHQ2XOK/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
