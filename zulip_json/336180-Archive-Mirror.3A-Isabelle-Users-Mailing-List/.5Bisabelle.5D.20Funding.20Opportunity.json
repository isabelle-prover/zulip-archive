The John Templeton Foundation accepts research<br>\nproposals that directly or indirectly address the following questions:</p>\n<p>(1) What are the limits of mathematics in advancing human knowledge?</p>\n<p>(2) What have the difficulties of AI taught us about the nature of<br>\nmind and intelligence?</p>\n<p>Deadline for the initial inquiry is April 15, 2010. Please feel free<br>\nto pass the information on to others who might be interested in the<br>\ngrant opportunity.</p>\n<p>For more information, please view the PDF announcement <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.templeton.org/emails/2010_funding_priorities/foundational_questions_in_the_mathematical_sciences/JTF-FP-Mathematics-n.pdf?utm_source=JTF+E-Mail+List+Manager&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.templeton.org%2Femails%2F2010_funding_priorities%2Ffoundational_questions_in_the_mathematical_sciences%2FJTF-FP-Mathematics.pdf&amp;utm_content=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.templeton.org%2Femails%2F2010_funding_priorities%2Ffoundational_questions_in_the_mathematical_sciences%2FJTF-FP-Mathematics.pdf&amp;utm_campaign=Grant+Opportunity%3A+Foundational+Questions+in+the+Mathematical+Sciences\">http://www.templeton.org/emails/2010_funding_priorities/foundational_questions_in_the_mathematical_sciences/JTF-FP-Mathematics-n.pdf?utm_source=JTF+E-Mail+List+Manager&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.templeton.org%2Femails%2F2010_funding_priorities%2Ffoundational_questions_in_the_mathematical_sciences%2FJTF-FP-Mathematics.pdf&amp;utm_content=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.templeton.org%2Femails%2F2010_funding_priorities%2Ffoundational_questions_in_the_mathematical_sciences%2FJTF-FP-Mathematics.pdf&amp;utm_campaign=Grant+Opportunity%3A+Foundational+Questions+in+the+Mathematical+Sciences</a></p>\n<p>or visit the website at <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.templeton.org/what_we_fund/2010_funding_priorities/foundational_questions_in_the_mathematical_sciences/index.html\">http://www.templeton.org/what_we_fund/2010_funding_priorities/foundational_questions_in_the_mathematical_sciences/index.html</a></p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>\n<p>The Grant Program is co-chaired by Barry Cooper and myself, with Barry<br>\nfocused on the AI component, and myself focused on the LIMITS OF<br>\nMATHEMATICS component.</p>\n<p>I have chosen to add some additional information that may be of some<br>\nuse in your decision to make an initial inquiry by April 15, 2010.</p>\n<p>With regard to question (1): we are interested in funding selected<br>\nresearch projects that address (1) directly or indirectly. Here is a<br>\nsample of some research thrusts that are of interest. But feel free to<br>\npropose your own ideas that genuinely address (1) directly or<br>\nindirectly, in ways not included in A-E below. Proposals will be<br>\njudged according to their relevance to (1), their conceptual and<br>\ntechnical soundness, and their feasibility.</p>\n<p>A. Limits of mathematics within mathematics. This includes exploring<br>\nthe boundary of algorithmic decidability/undecidability of basic<br>\nmathematical problems. This also includes explorations into the<br>\nboundary of provability and unprovability of basic mathematical<br>\nproblems within fundamental formal systems. These are well explored<br>\nareas, so we will emphasis the development of novel ideas.</p>\n<p>B. Limits of mathematics within biology and physics. This includes<br>\ninvestigations as in A above, but related to the behavior of idealized<br>\nbiological and physical systems. The level of biological and physical<br>\nrealism is of particular interest.</p>\n<p>C. Limits of mathematics within probability and statistics. This<br>\nincludes investigations into the logical foundations of probability<br>\nand statistics of the kind that can be used to address limits of<br>\nmathematics.</p>\n<p>D. Limits of computation in mathematical modeling. This includes<br>\ninvestigations into the limits of computational methods in<br>\napproximating physical reality due to round off, instability, and so<br>\nforth.</p>\n<p>E. Limits of mathematics within mathematical economics. This includes<br>\ninvestigations into limits of computational methods and decidability/<br>\nprovability in the realm of game theory and models of economic behavior.</p>\n<p>F. Limits of certainty in mathematics. This includes practical and<br>\ntheoretical investigations into just how certain we are or can be<br>\nabout mathematical assertions.</p>\n<p>G. Limits of certainty in software. This includes practical and<br>\ntheoretical investigations into how certain we are or can be that<br>\nsoftware meets mathematical requirements.</p>\n<p>Sincerely Yours,</p>\n<p>Harvey M. Friedman<br>\nDistinguished University Professor of Mathematics, Philosophy, and<br>\nComputer Science<br>\nThe Ohio State University<br>\nColumbus, Ohio</p>",
