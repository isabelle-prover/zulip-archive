As far as I know, physics<br>\nis mostly about calculus, so the Multivariate Analysis found in<br>\nHOL-light or Isabelle/HOL and the probability theory available in HOL4<br>\nand now also in Isabelle/HOL could be a good starting point.</p>\n<p>Multivariate Analysis does also support non-euclidean spaces, which is<br>\nsurely needed for the theory of relativity, and the probabilty theory<br>\ncould be helpfully when formalizing quantum problems. So formalizing<br>\nsome well established physics should be no problem. But how can<br>\nformalizing physics help when no theories are available for G.U.T.?</p>\n<p>Greetings,<br>\n  Johannes</p>",
