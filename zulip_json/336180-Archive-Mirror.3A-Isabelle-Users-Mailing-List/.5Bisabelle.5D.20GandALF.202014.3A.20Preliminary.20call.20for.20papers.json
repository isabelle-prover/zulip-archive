The idea is to cover an ample spectrum of<br>\nthemes, ranging from theory to applications, and stimulate<br>\ncross-fertilization. Papers focused on formal methods are especially<br>\nwelcome. Authors are invited to submit original research or tool papers on<br>\nall relevant topics in these areas. Papers discussing new ideas that are<br>\nat an early stage of development are also welcome.</p>\n<p>The topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automata Theory</li>\n<li>Automated Deduction</li>\n<li>Computational aspects of Game Theory</li>\n<li>Concurrency and Distributed computation</li>\n<li>Decision Procedures</li>\n<li>Deductive, Compositional, and Abstraction Techniques for Verification</li>\n<li>Finite Model Theory</li>\n<li>First-order and Higher-order Logics</li>\n<li>Formal Languages</li>\n<li>Formal Methods for Systems Biology, Hybrid, Embedded, and Mobile Systems</li>\n<li>Games and Automata for Verification</li>\n<li>Game Semantics</li>\n<li>Logical aspects of Computational Complexity</li>\n<li>Logics of Programs</li>\n<li>Modal and Temporal Logics</li>\n<li>Model Checking</li>\n<li>Models of Reactive and Real-Time Systems</li>\n<li>Program Analysis and Software Verification</li>\n<li>Run-time Verification and Testing</li>\n<li>Specification and Verification of Finite and Infinite-state Systems</li>\n<li>Synthesis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<ul>\n<li>May 10th   Abstract submission</li>\n<li>May 25th   Paper submission</li>\n<li>June 25th  Notification</li>\n<li>July 25th  Camera-ready submission</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*PUBLICATIONS<br>\nThe conference proceedings will be published by Electronic Proceedings in<br>\nTheoretical Computer Science. A special issue of a major international<br>\njournal to publish an extended and revised version of the best symposium<br>\npapers is also under consideration. Revised versions of the selected<br>\npapers from the previous editions lead to one special issue of the<br>\nInternational Journal of Foundation of Computer Science (GandALF 2010),<br>\ntwo special issues of Theoretical Computer Science (GandALF 2011 and<br>\n2012), and one special issue of Information and Computation (GandALF<br>\n2013).</p>\n<p>*SUBMISSIONS<br>\nSubmitted papers should not exceed fourteen (14) pages using EPTCS format,<br>\nbe unpublished and contain original research. For papers reporting<br>\nexperimental results, authors are encouraged to make their data available<br>\nwith their submission. Submissions must be in PDF or PS format and will be<br>\nhandled via EasyChair<br>\n(<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gandalf2014\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gandalf2014</a>).</p>\n<p>*PC CHAIRS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adriano Peron, University Federico II of Napoli, Italy</li>\n<li>Carla Piazza, University of Udine, Italy</li>\n</ul>",
