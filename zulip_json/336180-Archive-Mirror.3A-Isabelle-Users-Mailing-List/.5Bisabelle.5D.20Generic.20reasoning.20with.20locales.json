This family is<br>\ndefined as a state transition system parameterized by a number of parameters<br>\nof generic type.<br>\nSuppose I use a locale to define this family of protocols.</p>\n<p>Now I'd like to prove properties of the composition of two protocols<br>\nbelonging to the family, and in a generic way. I wanted to proceed as<br>\nfollows: get two different generic instances of the family, apply the<br>\ncomposition operator to the two instances, and prove something about the<br>\nresult. But I cannot provide generic parameters when instantiating (using<br>\n\"interpretation\").</p>\n<p>Is there a way to do what I've described using locales?</p>\n<p>For now, I've defined the family as a function from the generic parameters I<br>\nneed to a state transition system. However it quickly gets very cluttered.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading,<br>\nGiuliano</p>",
