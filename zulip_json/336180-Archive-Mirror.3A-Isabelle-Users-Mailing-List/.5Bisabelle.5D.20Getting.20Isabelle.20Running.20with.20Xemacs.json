However, I was able to get it working properly under the <br>\nX11 version of Gnu Emacs 21.2.1.  If you do get Isabelle working with <br>\nXEmacs, I would be interested in the details.  If you would like to try <br>\nthe Gnu Emacs version, I would be willing to give you a hand.<br>\n---Elsa L. Gunter (Elsa)</p>\n<p>clinton lefort wrote:</p>",

The main problem for Isabelle is the lack of X- <br>\nSymbol, but actually I don't think this is <em>too</em> difficult to fix.  A  <br>\nwhile ago I had a try, and I've put some notes now onto the Wiki  <br>\nwhich describe what I did:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/wiki/Main/XSymbolOnMacOSX\">http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/wiki/Main/XSymbolOnMacOSX</a></p>\n<p>Someone who has a bit of time (and a penchant for font formats) could  <br>\nget things working along any of the three lines I describe.  The  <br>\nsecond and third solutions would not be just for Mac: Carbon Emacs is  <br>\nbased on the future Unicode based version of GNU Emacs which supports  <br>\nrendering using Xft.  It seems to work reasonably reliably on Linux,  <br>\nbut you have to build it yourself from CVS.</p>\n<p>- David.</p>",
