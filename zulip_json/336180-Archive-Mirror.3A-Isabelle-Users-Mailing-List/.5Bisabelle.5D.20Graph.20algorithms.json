The  replies  that  I have  gotten  are<br>\nsummarized below.</p>\n<p>In  the meantime,  Gilbert Lee  finished his  MSc thesis  in  which he<br>\nproved  in Mizar  Dijkstra's  SSSP, Prim's  MST and  Floyd-Fulkerson's<br>\nflow.  All  done at the level  of graph operations.  His  thesis is at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~piotr/Mizar/\">http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~piotr/Mizar/</a> and the  Mizar articles are at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.mizar.org\">www.mizar.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Another  student  of  mine,   Broderic  Arneson,  is  now  formalizing<br>\nalgorithms on  chordal graphs following  Golumbic's \"Algorithmic Graph<br>\nTheory and Perfect Graphs\".  If  you know of any effort in formalizing<br>\nsimilar material (or something new in graph theory in general) please<br>\nlet me know.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>",
