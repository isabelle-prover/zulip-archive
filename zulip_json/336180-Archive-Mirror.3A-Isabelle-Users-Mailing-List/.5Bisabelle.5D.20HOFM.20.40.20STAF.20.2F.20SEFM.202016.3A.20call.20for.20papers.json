Other important characteristics such as simplicity,<br>\nlearnability, readability, memorability, ease of use and communication or,<br>\neven support for integrating tools into larger development tool chains are<br>\nignored too often. These nonfunctional properties, however, are key<br>\nattributes of usability and user satisfaction. If usability is compromised,<br>\nmethods are not fit for the purpose of documenting, reproducing and<br>\ncommunicating key design and realization decisions, or analysis results,<br>\nespecially when these need to communicate or mediate between expertise in<br>\ndifferent disciplines, different tool chains or across technological or<br>\norganizational boundaries. For these reasons, many engineers and<br>\npractitioners largely reject formal methods and formal specification<br>\nlanguages as “too hard to understand and use in practice” while admitting<br>\nthat they are powerful and precise.</p>\n<p>With increasing computing power and its consequent automation capabilities,<br>\nthe research and development community however is slowly but definitely<br>\nfocusing on usability in combination with automation. Moreover<br>\npractitioners across numerous domains are increasingly interested in formal<br>\ndomain-specific modelling, simulation and validation, whether in<br>\napplication areas of energy, robotics, health, biology, climate and<br>\nsustainable development, or, for specific technologies of importance such<br>\nas data analytics and user interface specification for an exponentially<br>\ngrowing number of hand-held or wearable devices.</p>\n<p>While there are many applications of formal methods to analyze<br>\nhuman-machine interaction and to construct user interfaces, the field of<br>\napplication of human factors to the analysis and to the optimization of<br>\nformal methods area is almost unexplored.</p>\n<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers, engineers and<br>\npractitioners from academia and industry to baseline the state of the art<br>\nin this increasingly important domain. It also aims to develop a future<br>\nvision and roadmap of usability and automation, focusing especially on<br>\nreadability and ease of use.</p>\n<p><em>Areas of interest include but are not limited to:</em></p>\n<p>• Integration of formal methods in the industrial development life cycle,<br>\napplication of FMs to real-world problems especially in domains listed below<br>\n• Optimization of the development tools based on FMs<br>\n• Readability and usability of specification/modeling notations and tools<br>\n• Human factors of/for FMs<br>\n• Visualization of/in FMs<br>\n• Human error and human factors in software engineering<br>\n• Cross-disciplinary automation and hybrid FMs<br>\n• Usability and scalability of FMs and the corresponding tools<br>\n• Usability evaluation in automated verification and testing<br>\n• Crowd-enabling and gamification for human-centered software development,<br>\nverification and testing, especially based on formal specification and<br>\nmethods<br>\n• Teaching of FMs as a software engineering discipline</p>\n<p><em>Formatting and Submission Guidelines:</em></p>\n<p>All accepted papers will be published as part of the Lecture Notes in<br>\nComputer Science (LNCS) proceedings volume organized by STAF 2016.<br>\nPDF versions of papers should be submitted trough EasyChair submission<br>\nsystem.<br>\nThe maximum size is 15 pages using the LNCS Formatting Guidelines.<br>\nIf you submit a paper and it gets accepted, at least one of the<br>\n(co)author(s) is expected to be present at the workshop to present the<br>\npaper.<br>\nAll papers submitted to the workshop must be unpublished original work and<br>\nshould not be under review or submitted elsewhere while being under<br>\nconsideration.</p>\n<p>We invite submissions in three categories:<br>\n• Research papers reporting innovative and original research in the field.<br>\n• Work-in-Progress/vision describing ongoing research, emerging results and<br>\nfuture ideas&amp;trends.<br>\n• Tool papers describing operational tool and its contributions.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers will be reviewed by 3 members of Program/Organizing<br>\nCommittee (or their sub-reviewers) and selection of accepted papers will<br>\nbased on relevance, quality and originality of the submitted papers.</p>\n<p><em>Program Committee:</em></p>\n<p>Luis Barbosa, University of Minho, Portugal<br>\nDaniel Berry, University of Waterloo, Canada<br>\nAntonio Cerone IMT Inst. for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy<br>\nEitan Farchi IBM Haifa Research Lab, Israel<br>\nPedro Isaías, Universidade Aberta, Portugal<br>\nIrit Hadar, University of Haifa, Israel<br>\nPeter Herrmann, NTNU Trondheim, Norway<br>\nGerwin Klein, NICTA/Data61, UNSW, Australia<br>\nJayprakash Lalchandani, IIIT Bangalore, India<br>\nJames Noble, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand<br>\nSrini Ramaswamy, ABB, USA<br>\nDaniel Ratiu, Siemens AG, Germany<br>\nGuillermo Rodriguez-Navas, Maelardalen University, Sweden<br>\nBernhard Rumpe, RWTH Aachen, Germany<br>\nThomas Santen, Microsoft, Germany<br>\nHeinz Schmidt, RMIT University, Australia – chair<br>\nMaria Spichkova, RMIT University, Australia – chair<br>\nRichard Trefler, University of Waterloo, Canada<br>\nAndreas Vogelsang, TU Munich, Germany<br>\nAnna Zamansky, University of Haifa, Israel</p>\n<p>Workshop Organizers:<br>\nMaria Spichkova (School of Science, RMIT University, Australia)<br>\nHeinz Schmidt (AICAUSE &amp; eResearch, RMIT University, Australia)</p>\n<p>Contact organizer: Maria Spichkova, <a href=\"mailto:maria.spichkova@rmit.edu.au\">maria.spichkova@rmit.edu.au</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Dr. Maria Spichkova<br>\nLecturer, RMIT University<br>\nSchool of Science, RMIT (formerly Computer Science and IT)</p>",
