This does<br>\nnot seem to be a regression either; the same problem occurred in<br>\nIsabelle2016.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>theory Test<br>\nimports Main \"~~/src/HOL/Algebra/Ring\"<br>\nbegin</p>\n<p>lemma<br>\n  fixes a b :: nat<br>\n  shows \"a * b = b * a\" by algebra</p>\n<p>end</p>\n<p>(when the ~~/src/HOL/Algebra/Ring import is removed, everything works)</p>\n<p>Any ideas, anyone?</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",

Still, in my opinion, it<br>\nmay a good idea to resolve this naming conflict.</p>\n<p>For instance, the situation is that currently, proofs using the<br>\n\"algebra\" method break once HOL-Number_Theory is imported (since it<br>\ndepends on some theories from HOL-Algebra)</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",

The intention was for the original “algebra” method to be generalised to include other types of algebraic reasoning. The ideal solution would be for the other method (whatever it does) to extend rather than to replace the original one.</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
