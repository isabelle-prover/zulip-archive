You could<br>\ntry to temporarily add something like</p>\n<p>ML {* proofs := 2 *}</p>\n<p>at the beginning of Higman.thy. In ProofGeneral, proof terms can be switched on for<br>\nthe current session using the Settings menu, but I have no idea how this can be done<br>\nin JEdit :-(</p>\n<p>Greetings,<br>\nStefan</p>",
