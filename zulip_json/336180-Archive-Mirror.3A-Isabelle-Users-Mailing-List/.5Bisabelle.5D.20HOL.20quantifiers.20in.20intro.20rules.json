I agree, it is unfortunate. Generally it’s best to express your theorem in the form that is most convenient in its applications (of which there will probably be many) rather than in the proof of the theorem itself (of which there is only one).</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",

I see the point of relying on the implicit choice of a rule when you are making various attempts to find a proof. But once you find it, you should invest a little effort in making your proof comprehensible to others and more robust against changes, including the precise change to continuous_intros suggested here. At least “safe\" and \"clarify\" are very controlled in what they do, but “rule” could do almost anything.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
