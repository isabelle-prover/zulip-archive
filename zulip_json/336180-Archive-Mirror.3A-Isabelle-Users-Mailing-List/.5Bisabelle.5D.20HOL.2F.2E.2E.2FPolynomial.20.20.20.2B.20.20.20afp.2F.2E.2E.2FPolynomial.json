This specific representation is required <br>\nfor specific algorithms, for instance, the Groebner Bases algorithm.</p>\n<p>After promising trials with both, [1] and [2], we envisage to develop <br>\ntheories for algebraic geometry including efficient polynomial <br>\nalgorithms --- and we have many, many questions. The first question is, <br>\nwhat we consider the most principal one:</p>\n<p>(a) given a type of multi-variate polynomial providing algebraic <br>\nstructure (like [1]) with new properties added<br>\n(b) given several executable representations for polynomials, at least <br>\nrecursive (like \"pCons\" in [1]) and distributive (like \"monom list\" in <br>\n[2]) with respective conversions<br>\n? What is the most succinct way to share the properties from (a) with <br>\nseveral representations (b) in Isabelle (such that generated code <br>\n\"inherits\" properties from (a)) ?</p>\n<p>We are grateful for any input and prepared for not-so-easy suggestions,<br>\nWalther</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/HOL-Library/Polynomial.html\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/HOL-Library/Polynomial.html</a><br>\n[2] <a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Polynomials.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Polynomials.shtml</a><br>\n[3] <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/HOL-Decision_Procs/Reflected_Multivariate_Polynomial.html\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/HOL-Decision_Procs/Reflected_Multivariate_Polynomial.html</a></p>",
