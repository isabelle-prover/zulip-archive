These<br>\nintegrate automatic theorem provers (including SMT solvers) with proof<br>\nassistants.  However, users of proof assistants based on type theories,<br>\nsuch as Agda, Coq, Lean, and Matita, currently miss out on this<br>\nconvenience. The HaTT workshop aims at gathering researchers working<br>\non these and other aspects of \"hammer-style\" automation for type<br>\ntheories, to exchange experiences and foster collaborations, to<br>\nfinally reach end users.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of<br>\ncooperation between automatic theorem provers and proof assistants<br>\nbased on type theory. More specifically, some suggested topics are</p>\n<p>+ translation of formulas from type theory to first-order logic<br>\n  + translation of proofs from first-order logic to type theory<br>\n  + verified proof certification<br>\n  + lemma selection (relevance filtering)<br>\n  + prototypes<br>\n  + applications<br>\n  + case studies<br>\n  + experiments<br>\n  + benchmarks</p>\n<p>Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either<br>\nan extended abstract (2 to 6 pages) or a regular paper (8 to 15 pages).<br>\nSubmissions will be refereed by the program committee. Short<br>\nsubmissions that could stimulate fruitful discussion at the workshop<br>\nare particularly welcome, even if they describe already published<br>\nwork. We expect that one author of every accepted paper will present<br>\ntheir work at the workshop.</p>\n<p>Regular papers should describe previously unpublished work and must<br>\nbe prepared using the LaTeX EPTCS class (see <a href=\"http://eptcs.org/\">http://eptcs.org/</a>).<br>\nPapers will be submitted via EasyChair at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hatt2016\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hatt2016</a></p>\n<p>Accepted regular papers will appear in an EPTCS volume.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>Abstract Submission: April 4, 2016<br>\nFull Paper Submission: April 11, 2016<br>\nAcceptance Notification: May 13, 2016<br>\nCamera-ready papers: May 27, 2016<br>\nWorkshop: July 1, 2016</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Jesper Bengtson (IT-Univeristy of Copenhagen)<br>\nFrédéric Besson (Inria)<br>\nJasmin Christian Blanchette (Inria &amp; MPII Saarbrücken, co-chair)<br>\nArthur Charguéraud (Inria)<br>\nClaudio Sacerdoti Coen (University of Bologna)<br>\nLeonardo de Moura (Microsoft Research)<br>\nJean-Christophe Filliâtre (CNRS)<br>\nLiana Hadarean (Oxford University)<br>\nCătălin Hriţcu (Inria)<br>\nCezary Kaliszyk (University of Innsbruck, co-chair)<br>\nChantal Keller (Université Paris-Sud)<br>\nAssia Mahboubi (Inria)<br>\nLaurent Théry (Inria)<br>\nCesare Tinelli (University of Iowa)<br>\nJosef Urban (Czech Technical University in Prague)</p>",
