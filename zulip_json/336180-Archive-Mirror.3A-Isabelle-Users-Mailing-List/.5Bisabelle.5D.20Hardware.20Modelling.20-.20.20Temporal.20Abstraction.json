I can't help with Isabelle, but did dig up the original HOL<br>\nproofs - which are in the attached compressed tarfile. I hope the<br>\nsequence of lemmas, at least, is of some help.</p>\n<p>I recall that a use of the Well Ordering Property for the naturals was<br>\ncrucial in the proofs. This property ('WOP') is equivalent to<br>\ninduction and is proved in the standard HOL prelude. I'm not sure if<br>\nit's available in Isabelle, but it isn't hard to prove.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nTom<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/TFE4EFLmWHIJXJPJPRbNLXJB/temporal.tar.gz\">temporal.tar.gz</a></p>",
