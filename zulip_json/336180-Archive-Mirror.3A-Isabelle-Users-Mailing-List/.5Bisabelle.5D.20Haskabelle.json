That question is important since<br>\nthere are considerable maintainance efforts required to make it usable<br>\nagain within the contemporary biotope (somewhere around GHC 7.10.3 and<br>\nIsabelle2016-1).</p>\n<p>Being curious for your responses,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/wn6ekkErei18CRhUzY8GE-tF/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
