If there is really a \"proper\"<br>\nuse of this, I have to think about a inner-logical solution to the<br>\nproblem (which is not that difficult).</p>\n<p>If this issue is mission-critical for you now, we can discuss possible<br>\nsolutions separately from the mailing list.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/TNRlsGkqvqxZ2EKEkxVvuszO/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
