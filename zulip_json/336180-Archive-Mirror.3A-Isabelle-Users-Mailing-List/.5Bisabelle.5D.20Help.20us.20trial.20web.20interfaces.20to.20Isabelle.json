One uses Isar, and the other <br>\nuses MathsTiles (a way of writing proofs that vaguely resembles how a <br>\nstudent might write it on paper).  They are hosted as exercises in an <br>\n\"Intelligent Book\" - a kind of web-based textbook.</p>\n<p>The Isar interface is available today, at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.discmath.cl.cam.ac.uk/DiscreteMathsBook\">http://www.discmath.cl.cam.ac.uk/DiscreteMathsBook</a><br>\nUnder the column \"Experiment for Isabelle Experts\". <br>\n(you'll need to register first so we can get a unique name for you)</p>\n<p>The MathsTiles interface will be made available in the next 24 hours or <br>\nso, also at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.discmath.cl.cam.ac.uk/DiscreteMathsBook\">http://www.discmath.cl.cam.ac.uk/DiscreteMathsBook</a><br>\nUnder the column \"Experiment for Everybody\"</p>\n<p>The exercises use Java applets, so you will need the Java plugin version <br>\n1.5 or higher for your browser.  This is available from <a href=\"http://java.sun.com\">java.sun.com</a><br>\nWe have tested on Internet Explorer (Windows) and Mozilla Firefox <br>\n(Windows/Linux), but we haven't tested using Safari.</p>\n<p>Any questions, problems, or bugs, please email me at <a href=\"mailto:whb21@cam.ac.uk\">whb21@cam.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p>Thank you very much if you are willing to help by taking part.</p>\n<p>Will Billingsley<br>\nPhD student<br>\nIntelligent Book project</p>",
