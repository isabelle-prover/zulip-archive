If you want to process a theory that depends on some theory in the AFP using<br>\nIsabelle/jEdit, you can use the following command</p>\n<p>isabelle jedit -d &lt;path to AFP installation directory&gt;/thys My_Theory.thy</p>\n<p>where My_Theory.thy looks e.g. as follows:</p>\n<p>theory My_Theory<br>\n  imports \"Example-Submission.Submission\"<br>\n  begin</p>\n<p>thm very_true</p>\n<p>end</p>\n<p>Greetings,<br>\nStefan</p>",

It even has a template with some comments.</p>\n<p>In particular, you need to use Isabelle path notation, for example:</p>\n<p>/cygdrive/c/Users/wenzelm/afp-2018/thys</p>\n<p>Moreover note that activating all of AFP like that delays the startup of<br>\nthe Isabelle/jEdit application considerably, especially on Windows.</p>\n<p>You can also put specific sub-directories of afp-2017/thys in ROOTS, but<br>\nyou will have to resolve dependencies between entries manually. The<br>\nProver IDE should do this at some point for the user.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
