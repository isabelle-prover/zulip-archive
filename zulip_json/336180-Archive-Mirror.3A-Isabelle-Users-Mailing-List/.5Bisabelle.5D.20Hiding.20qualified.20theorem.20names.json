While the constants are hidden with hide_const (open) to ensure <br>\nthat plain \"map\" resolves to <a href=\"http://List.map\">List.map</a>, the theorems about these map functions are <br>\ntypically not. What bothers me (and Ren√© Thiemann who brought my attention to this issue) <br>\nnow, is that hide_fact (open) does not work for some of these theorems. In detail, the <br>\ntheorem RBT_Impl.map.simps hides List.map.simps whenever one imports RBT_Impl. As <br>\nmap.simps is already a qualified name, one cannot openly hide the one from RBT_Impl.</p>\n<p>How can I hide RBT_Impl.map.simps such that map.simps resolves to List.map.simps?</p>\n<p>I know that \"hide_fact RBT_Impl.map.simps\" achieves this, but then, they are not <br>\naccessible at all.<br>\n(Of course, one could define an alias like map_simps in RBT_Impl first, then hide that <br>\nopenly, and hide RBT_Impl.map.simps fully. But does this really have to be this <br>\ncomplicated? And if so, should we follow this path?)</p>\n<p>Andreas</p>",
