For example, the conditional term Cond t t1 t2 (meaning 'if <br>\nt then t1 else t2') can be defined\" (p. 24).<br>\n\"It must be admitted that the [epsilon]-operator looks rather suspicious.\" (p. <br>\n24)<br>\n\"The inclusion of [epsilon]-terms into HOL 'builds in' the Axiom of Choice <br>\n[...].\" (p. 24)<br>\n<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.27.6103&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.27.6103&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a><br>\nYou also mention that it \"embodies a strong Axiom of Choice.\" (p. 25)<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-130.pdf\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-130.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Andrews has shown that the conditional term can be defined in terms of the <br>\ndescription operator (definition of 'C' and Theorem 5313 in [Andrews, 2002, p. <br>\n235]). The theorem is available online (p. 6) at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/fom.pdf\">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/fom.pdf</a><br>\nand formally verified (pp. 142, 151) at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf\">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/formulae.pdf</a><br>\nThe use of the description operator is the much more elegant solution, as it <br>\ndoesn't imply the Axiom of Choice, and the description operator is the natural <br>\ncounterpart to equality, which is the basic primitive of Andrews' logic Q0 <br>\nhaving \"only two basic constants (identity/equality and its counterpart, <br>\ndescription)\".<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html</a></p>\n<p>So in my opinion Gordon could have circumvented the problems of the epsilon <br>\noperator for HOL by implementing a natural deduction variant of Q0, as did Cris <br>\nPerdue at <a href=\"http://prooftoys.org\">http://prooftoys.org</a> (and <a href=\"http://mathtoys.org\">http://mathtoys.org</a>). Andrews implemented <br>\nthe description operator following Henkin when stating Axiom 5 for Q0: \"Henkin <br>\nremarks at the end of [Henkin, 1963] that when one passes from the theory of <br>\npropositional types to the full theory of finite types, it becomes necessary to <br>\nadd a constant [...] to denote a descriptor function, and an appropriate axiom <br>\ninvolving this constant. We note that for this axiom it suffices to take the <br>\nsimple formula [...].\" [Andrews, 1963, p. 350]<br>\n<a href=\"http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm52/fm52123.pdf\">http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm52/fm52123.pdf</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm52/fm52124.pdf\">http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm52/fm52124.pdf</a><br>\nThe quote with the formulas is also available (p. 4) at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/fom.pdf\">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/fom.pdf</a></p>\n<p>For the references, please see: <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.4444/100.111\">http://doi.org/10.4444/100.111</a></p>\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n<p>Ken Kubota</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ken Kubota<br>\n<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.4444/100\">http://doi.org/10.4444/100</a></p>",
