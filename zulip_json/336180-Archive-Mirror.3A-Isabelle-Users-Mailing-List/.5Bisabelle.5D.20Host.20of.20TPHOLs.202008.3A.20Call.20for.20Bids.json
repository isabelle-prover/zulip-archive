As is the <br>\ntradition, the hosts of the previous conference (i.e. TPHOLs 2007) are <br>\nrunning the process. There are two phases: solicitation of bids and voting. <br>\nThis message concerns the first phase.</p>\n<p>A longstanding convention is that the conference should be held in a continent <br>\ndifferent to the location of the previous meeting, and therefore no bids to <br>\nhost TPHOLs 2008 in Europe will be accepted. TPHOLs is traditionally held in <br>\nAugust or September. Bids should be sent to <a href=\"mailto:tphols2007@informatik.uni-kl.de\">tphols2007@informatik.uni-kl.de</a> <br>\nand should include at least the following information: name and email address <br>\nof a contact person, names of other people involved, address of website for <br>\nthe bid, approximate dates the conference will be held, format of the <br>\nconference and colocation details (if any).</p>\n<p>Previous bids can be accessed through the TPHOLs webpages. Please refer to the <br>\nTPHOLs 2008 Host Selection page </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://rsg.informatik.uni-kl.de/TPHOLs-2007/tphols2008.html\">http://rsg.informatik.uni-kl.de/TPHOLs-2007/tphols2008.html</a></p>\n<p>Deadline for all bids is 15 Jan 2007.</p>\n<p>Shortly after that, the bids will be made public and the voting phase will <br>\ntake place. The people eligible to vote are those who are seriously thinking <br>\nof attending TPHOLs 2008. The voting system used will be Single Transferable <br>\nVote between all received bids.</p>\n<p>Jens Brandt</p>",
