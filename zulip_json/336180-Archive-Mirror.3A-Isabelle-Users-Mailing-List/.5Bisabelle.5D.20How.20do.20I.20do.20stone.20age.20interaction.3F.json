It means two<br>\nthings: a) the language in which most users write specifications and<br>\nproofs, and b) the management layer that interprets the above<br>\nlanguage, but also deals with contexts, data management, system state<br>\nand transactions, theory management etc. Maybe for the latter meaning<br>\none could read 'Isar' as '<em>Is</em>abelle <em>ar</em>chitecture'. It was initially<br>\nintroduced to support the language, but it is now central to the whole<br>\nsystem.</p>\n<p>While it is perfectly reasonable not to use Isar-the-language (in fact<br>\nautomated proof tools typically don't, yet they produce specifications<br>\nand proofs similar to the ones written by users), in recent Isabelle<br>\nversions (starting with ca. 2007/8) there is no way of circumventing<br>\nIsar-the-architecture. Like every architecture, it has its pros and<br>\ncons, but there is no way of ignoring its existence.</p>\n<p>Isar-the-architecture provides the full SML programming language,<br>\nextended with antiquotations to refer to logical entities from static<br>\n(compile time) contexts. To use this, ML code must obey some<br>\nstructuring principles, and the most important one is that contexts<br>\n(i.e. values of type Proof.context, theory, or local_theory, depending<br>\non the application) must be passed around explicitly. Anyone familiar<br>\nwith the notion of pure functional programming should find this very<br>\nnatural. For example, a theorem declaration (in the global theory) is<br>\na function of type \"theory -&gt; theory\", and most tactics that do<br>\nsomething interesting must depend on a context. So does parsing and<br>\npretty printing. Jeremy's example looks like it is very easy to port<br>\nto current Isabelle by using explicit context passing. Many people on<br>\nthis list will be happy to demonstrate this on self-contained<br>\nexamples. Implicit context passing is only provided by<br>\nIsar-the-language.</p>\n<p>As it was said, Isabelle 2005 still supported unmanaged interaction to<br>\nsome extent, and this is what Jeremy is using. I personally don't know<br>\nof any other (active) user of this model, but I would be curious to<br>\nhear about any.</p>\n<p>In other words, the current model is roughly</p>\n<p>(4) Isabelle/ML embedded into Isar</p>\n<hr>\n<p>(3) Isar language</p>\n<hr>\n<p>(2) Isar infrastructure</p>\n<hr>\n<p>(1) Raw ML toplevel (provided by compiler)</p>\n<p>(4) is where you actually work in when interacting in ML, and if you<br>\nwant to ignore (3), you can do so by using the embedded language only.<br>\n From (1) you hardly get anything useful. From what Mark wrote, I<br>\nassume that he is more interested in the logical part of the<br>\ninternals, not so much the management part. IMHO the easiest way to<br>\nexplore this in Isabelle2009-2 is using (4). In Isabelle2005, you can<br>\nstill use (1), but what you get is, of course, an impression of how<br>\nIsabelle2005 worked.</p>\n<p>I think that much confusion comes from confusing (1) and (4). Maybe<br>\nreimlementing (1) in LISP (as in Edinburgh LCF) could solve this<br>\nproblem :-)).</p>\n<p>Alex</p>",

By 1989, we had the basics: higher-order unification as the inference mechanism and higher-order logic as the logical framework. A couple of years later, we had order-sorted polymorphism. By around 2000, with innovations such as axiomatic type classes, inductive and datatype definitions and the classical reasoner, classic Isabelle could be described as mature. Isar represents a new departure, but what is particularly nice is how well it fits on the old logical framework infrastructure. One might imagine that everything had been foreseen at the start, but this isn't true at all. All this is to say that “to understand Isabelle\" could refer to many very different things.<br>\nLarry</p>",
