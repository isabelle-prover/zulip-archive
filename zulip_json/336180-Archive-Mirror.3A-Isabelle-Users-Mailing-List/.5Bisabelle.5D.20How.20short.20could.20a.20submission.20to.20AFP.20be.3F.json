For example, does the submission of only one non-trivial theorem is fine? By nontrivial theorem, I meant a result for which an elegant proof is at least 5000 lines in Isabelle/HOL. I think that short submissions may be useful for beginners and for people for which formalizations in Isabelle/HOL is not their main activity, but still an important part of their research.</p>\n<p>Sincerely yours,<br>\nJosé M.</p>",

We have many quite a few that are below 1000<br>\nlines, and that's okay. We decide this on a case-by-case basis, but I<br>\nwould say that the material should be interesting and it should be<br>\nnon-trivial. So anything below, say, 200 lines is probably not enough.<br>\nAnything about 1000 lines is probably fine (in terms of size), unless,<br>\nthe content is heavily inflated or extremely technical but uninteresting.</p>\n<p>I, for example, have quite a few ‘single-theorem entries’, e.g. the<br>\ntranscendence of e, the transcendence of pi, the irrationality of<br>\nzeta(3). The first one of these only has about 600 lines, but it is an<br>\ninteresting result and it is non-trivial, so I doubt anyone would see an<br>\nissue with its size.</p>\n<p>I'm sure my fellow AFP editors will chime in if they disagree with<br>\nanything I've said.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",

I<br>\nthought about submitting this proof method to the AFP, but now I’m<br>\nconcerned that it would be rejected right away.</p>\n<p>Note that I would consider this development much more complex than a<br>\nproof of the same size. Actually it caused me a lot of headache to<br>\narrive at this result, and I was about to give up during development.<br>\nWhat I want to say is that I guess this proof method could be of value<br>\nto other people out there, as people without experience in low-level<br>\nIsabelle proof methods and Isabelle/ML would probably find it hard to<br>\ncome up with something like this themselves.</p>\n<p>I have also other, more common, developments to submit at some point.<br>\nHowever, I wouldn’t like to submit my proof method as part of one of<br>\nthose other developments, as it is really a general tool, usable in a<br>\nvariety of contexts.</p>\n<p>How is such a situation handled?</p>\n<p>All the best,<br>\nWolfgang</p>",
