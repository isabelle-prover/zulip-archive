For example, from</p>\n<p>ML {*<br>\n   Object_Logic.atomize<br>\n   *}</p>\n<p>we can know that the function Object_Logic.atomize is of type</p>\n<p>val it = fn: Proof.context -&gt; conv</p>\n<p>we can also jump to the definition file of Object_Logic.atomize by <br>\nCTRL+left click at the method name. However, what if I want to know more <br>\nabout the type \"conv\", is there a quick way to jump to the file where <br>\n\"conv\" is declared or defined? An ideal way might be to CTRL+left click <br>\nat \"conv\", but it does not seem to work for now.</p>\n<p>Many thanks,<br>\nWenda</p>",

I've now <br>\ncommitted a change (commit 1956) to Poly/ML SVN which includes location <br>\ninformation for type constructors.
