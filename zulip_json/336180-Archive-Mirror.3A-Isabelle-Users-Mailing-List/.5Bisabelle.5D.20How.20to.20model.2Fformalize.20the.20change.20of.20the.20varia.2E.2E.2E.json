        "content": "<p>From: Alex Meyer &lt;<a href=\"mailto:alex153@outlook.lv\">alex153@outlook.lv</a>&gt;<br>\nHello!</p>\n<p>I posted conceptual question in stackoverflow <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62709073/how-to-model-formalize-the-change-of-the-variable-change-of-world-in-isabelle\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62709073/how-to-model-formalize-the-change-of-the-variable-change-of-world-in-isabelle</a> but I am re-posting here as well. Maybe someone can give us some clarification. Thanks!</p>\n<p>I am trying to formalize business rules in Isabelle/HOL, but business rules involve the change of the values of some variables, like <code>if x=5 =&gt; x=6</code>. <code>=&gt;</code> is not the usual implication there, because x is 5 in one world (interpretation, semantic domain) and after the execution of the rule the x is 6 and it is already a different world (different interpretation, assignment function, semantic domain). So - technically <code>is x=5 =&gt; x=6</code> is not the formula in First Order Logic and it is not also the formula of Higher Order Logic of Isabelle/HOL. More possible is that it is the formula in dynamic/action logic <code>[rule1](x=5)=(x=6)</code> (that defines that upon application of <code>rule1</code> to the formula in some world yields to the truthful formula in some other world (dynamic/action logic is essentially a kind of modal logic and Kripke/possible world semantics can be applied here).</p>\n<p>Now, back to Isabelle/HOL or Coq: FOL/HOL theory is set of formulas in all the worlds or in one particular world. If we stay at FOL/HOL then there is no change of the world, no change of the values of the variables. We should go to the modal logics if we would like to model, reasong about such changes. But can it be done in HOL? This change of world?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://matryoshka.gforge.inria.fr/pubs/fernandez_burgos_bsc_thesis.pdf\">http://matryoshka.gforge.inria.fr/pubs/fernandez_burgos_bsc_thesis.pdf</a> is good work about formalization of sorting algorithms in Isabelle/HOL, functional programming is used there and there is no need of variables and hence - no this change among worlds. But if we try to model Reinforcement Learning, Markov processes, impertative/object oriented programming, business rules in Isabelle/HOL, then we should express this change. How to do that?</p>\n<p>How to express business rule <code>if x=5 =&gt; x=6</code> in Isabelle/HOL?</p>\n<p>Alex</p>\n<p>[https://ipmcdn.avast.com/images/icons/icon-envelope-tick-green-avg-v1.png]&lt;<a href=\"http://www.avg.com/email-signature?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=link&amp;utm_campaign=sig-email&amp;utm_content=webmail\">http://www.avg.com/email-signature?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=link&amp;utm_campaign=sig-email&amp;utm_content=webmail</a>&gt;     Virus-free. www.avg.com&lt;<a href=\"http://www.avg.com/email-signature?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=link&amp;utm_campaign=sig-email&amp;utm_content=webmail\">http://www.avg.com/email-signature?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=link&amp;utm_campaign=sig-email&amp;utm_content=webmail</a>&gt;</p>",
