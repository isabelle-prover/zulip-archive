I am using Isabelle2005/HOL with ProofGeneral, the proof<br>\nis :<br>\n  !! v s1 s2 .<br>\n  [| Subject_user v s1 \\&lt;in&gt; Users v ; Subject_user v s2 \\&lt;in&gt; Users v ;<br>\nSubject_user v s1 = Subject_user v s2<br>\n    Subject_role v s1 \\&lt;in&gt; tRoles v \\/ Subject_role v s1 \\&lt;in&gt; nRoles v ;<br>\n    Subject_role v s2 \\&lt;in&gt; tRoles v \\/ Subject_role v s2 \\&lt;in&gt; nRoles v ;<br>\n    s1 \\&lt;in&gt; tSubjects v \\/ s1 \\&lt;in&gt; nSubjects v;<br>\n    s2 \\&lt;in&gt; tSubjects v \\/ s2 \\&lt;in&gt; nSubjects v;<br>\n    s1 \\&lt;noteq&gt; s2;<br>\n    (Subject_user v s1 , Subject_role v s1) \\&lt;in&gt; URs v;<br>\n    (Subject_user v s2 , Subject_role v s2) \\&lt;in&gt; URs v;</p>\n<p>\\&lt;forall&gt; u r1 r2 .<br>\n     u \\&lt;in&gt; Users v /\\<br>\n     (r1 \\&lt;in&gt; tRoles v \\/ r1 \\&lt;in&gt; nRoles v) /\\<br>\n     (r2 \\&lt;in&gt; tRoles v \\/ r2 \\&lt;in&gt; nRoles v) /\\<br>\n     (EX s1.

(Subject_role v) is a fuction which takes a subject and return its role<br>\n3 . (Subject_user v) is a function which takes a subject and return its user<br>\n4 . (Users v) ,(tRoles v) , (nRoles v) , (tSubjects v) , (nSubjects v) ,<br>\n(URs v) , (DMRs v) are all sets of the record v</p>\n<p>You can see the last one of the premises is a derivation rule, and the<br>\nothers could satisfy the assumption of the rule.<br>\nSo it is supposed to prove the conclusion ,but I failed to unify the<br>\npremises with the rule in the premises.<br>\nCould anyone give me some help on this ? IF POSSIBLE , could you show the<br>\nproof step by step?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n<p>Kun  Chen<br>\n                                                            Foundation<br>\nSoftware Engineer Center<br>\n                                                            Institute of<br>\nSoftware<br>\n                                                            Chinese  Academy<br>\nof  Science</p>",

        "content": "<p>From: Lawrence Paulson &lt;<a href=\"mailto:lp15@cam.ac.uk\">lp15@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>\nThanks for your question. The problem here is that you aren't using  <br>\nIsabelle in the way it's designed to be used, specifically with  <br>\nregard to unification. Your problem would be trivial for first-order  <br>\nautomatic provers. It is perhaps easy enough for Isabelle to prove  <br>\nwith its \"meson\" method, but not using its basic tools.</p>\n<p>To simplify your example considerably, if you have a formula like</p>\n<p>ALL x. P x &amp; (EX y. Q(x,y)) --&gt; R x</p>\n<p>then its natural Isabelle form is</p>\n<p>[| P(x); Q(x,y) |] ==&gt; R(x)</p>\n<p>and this can trivially be used to reduce subgoals of the form R(...).  <br>\nThat is, you need to express your big quantified formula as shown  <br>\nabove and give it to the \"rule\" method.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
