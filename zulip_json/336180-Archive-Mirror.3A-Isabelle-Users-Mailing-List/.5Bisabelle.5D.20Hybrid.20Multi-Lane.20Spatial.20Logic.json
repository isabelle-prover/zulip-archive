The <br>\nsemantic model is an abstraction of a motorway, emphasising local spatial <br>\nproperties, and parameterised by the types of sensors deployed in the vehicles. <br>\nWe use the logic to define controller constraints to ensure safety, i.e., the <br>\nabsence of collisions on the motorway. After proving safety with a restrictive <br>\ndefinition of sensors, we relax these assumptions and show how to amend the <br>\ncontroller constraints to still guarantee safety.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hybrid_Multi_Lane_Spatial_Logic.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hybrid_Multi_Lane_Spatial_Logic.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ibsalRnoYjc70h8j-MOpjMxL/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
