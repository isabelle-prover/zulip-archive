I started learning Isabelle recently to find <br>\nout how maths can be precisely formalized, not to work with it to do <br>\nreal theorem proving. I am aware of two main problems with <br>\nformalization: (1) russel's paradox and (2) meaning of the function <br>\napplication to an argument outside of its domain. I am very interested <br>\nwith how Isabelle copes with these problems. Can anybody tell me or <br>\npoint the related sections of the documentation?</p>\n<p>I have tried \"Set, Functions and Relations\", which states:</p>\n<p>\"Our sets are typed. In a given set, all elements<br>\nhave the same type, say T, and the set itself has type T set.\"</p>\n<p>but I can still see a problem with expressions like this:</p>\n<p>a : { {a, b}, c }</p>\n<p>As I understand the types are:<br>\nset-membership operator (:) is of type \"[alpha, alpha set] =&gt; bool\"<br>\n\"a\", \"b\", \"c\" are of type \"alpha\"<br>\n\"{a, b}\" is of type \"alpha set\"</p>\n<p>What it the type of \"{ {a, b}, c }\"??</p>\n<p>Isn't it a union of types \"alpha set\" and \"alpha set set\", which<br>\nseems like an incorrect typing?</p>\n<p>Even if it were:</p>\n<p>a : { { a, b } }</p>\n<p>the types do not match, because the type of this expression is<br>\n\"[alpha, alpha set set]\" and not \"[alpha, alpha set]\".</p>\n<p>Can anyone explain me where I am wrong?</p>",
