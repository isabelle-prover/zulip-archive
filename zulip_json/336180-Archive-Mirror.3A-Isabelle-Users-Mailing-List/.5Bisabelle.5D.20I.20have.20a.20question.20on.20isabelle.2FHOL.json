I want to know how I can model these<br>\nfunctions in isabelle. And I am also interested in knowing if this protocol has ever been verified by a professional and how.<br>\nSince I tried and as a result of being unexperienced I couldn't be successful in this job.<br>\n<br>\nPlease help e with your valuable information.<br>\n<br>\nSincerely yours<br>\nShadi Shiri</p>",
