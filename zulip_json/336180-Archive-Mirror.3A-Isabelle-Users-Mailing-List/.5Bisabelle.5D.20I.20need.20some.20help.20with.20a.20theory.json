I'm not using Isar<br>\nbecause when I started I though it should be easier to use the apply<br>\nmethod, so I still didn't learn Isar.</p>\n<p>I've been trying to prove Theorem01 inside the attached theory<br>\nPrelude_SortingPrograms_E1.thy, but I have no idea how to go further<br>\nfrom the line \"thm GenSortT1\".<br>\nI think I should make Isabelle match this rule (GenSortT1) with the<br>\ngoal, but I could not do it. I've tried apply(case_tac Lista) to check<br>\nif this way I could use the rule GenSortT1, but I had no success.</p>\n<p>If you can give me any ideas of how to go any further, I'll be very thankful.</p>\n<p>Yours,<br>\nGlauber<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/vZqAPUaUWd5nfdk19dww5I0a/email.zip\">email.zip</a></p>",
