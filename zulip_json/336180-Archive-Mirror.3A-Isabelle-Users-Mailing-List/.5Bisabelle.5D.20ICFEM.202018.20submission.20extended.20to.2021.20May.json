Formal methods for the development of computer systems have been extensively researched and studied. We now have good theoretical understandings of how to describe what programs do, how they do it, and why they work. A range of semantic theories, specification languages, design techniques, verification methods, and supporting tools have been developed and applied to the construction of programs of moderate size that are used in critical applications. The remaining challenge now is how to deal with problems in developing and maintaining large scale and complex computer systems.</p>\n<p>The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial, academic, and government experts, from a variety of user domains and software disciplines, to help advance the state of the art. Researchers, practitioners, tool developers and users, and technology transfer experts are all welcome. We are interested in work that has been incorporated into real production systems, and in theoretical work that promises to bring practical, tangible engineering benefits.</p>\n<p>List of Topics</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions related to the following principal themes are encouraged, but any topics relevant to the field of formal engineering methods and their practical applications will also be considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstraction, refinement and evolution</li>\n<li>Formal specification and modelling</li>\n<li>Formal verification and analysis</li>\n<li>Model checking and theorem proving</li>\n<li>Formal approaches to software testing and inspection Formal methods </li>\n<li>for self-adaptive systems Formal methods for object-oriented systems </li>\n<li>Formal methods for component-based systems Formal methods for </li>\n<li>concurrent and real-time systems Formal methods for cloud computing </li>\n<li>Formal methods for cyber-physical systems Formal methods for software </li>\n<li>safety and security Formal methods for software reliability and </li>\n<li>dependability Development, integration and experiments involving </li>\n<li>verified systems Formal certification of products under international </li>\n<li>standards Formal model-based development and code generation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission and Publication</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference.

A. R. Hoare):</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sir Tony Hoare is a British computer scientist. He developed the sorting algorithm quicksort in 1959/1960. He also developed Hoare logic for verifying program correctness in 1969, and the formal language communicating sequential processes (CSP) to specify the interactions of concurrent processes in 1985. He received the Turing Prize and the Kyoto Prize for his fundamental contributions to the definition and design of programming languages in 1980 and 2000 respectively. Tony Hoare became a professor at Oxford University in 1977 where he is now an Emeritus Professor. Hoare was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society as well as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. A recent personal research goal has been the unification of a diverse range of theories applying to different programming languages, paradigms, and implementation technologies. Tony has been and continue to be an inspiration to many researchers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professor David Basin:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>David Basin is a full professor of Computer Science at ETH Zurich.
