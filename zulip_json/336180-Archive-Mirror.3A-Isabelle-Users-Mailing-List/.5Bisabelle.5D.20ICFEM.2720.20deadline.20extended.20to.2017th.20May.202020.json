Formal Methods <br>\nfor the development of computer systems have been extensively researched <br>\nand studied. We now have good theoretical understandings of how to <br>\ndescribe what programs do, how they do it, and why they work. A range of <br>\nsemantic theories, specification languages, design techniques, <br>\nverification methods, and supporting tools have been developed and <br>\napplied to the construction of programs of moderate size that are used <br>\nin critical applications. The remaining challenge now is how to deal <br>\nwith problems in developing and maintaining large scale and complex <br>\ncomputer systems.</p>\n<p>The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial, academic, <br>\nand government experts, from a variety of user domains and software <br>\ndisciplines, to help advance state of the art. Researchers, <br>\npractitioners, tool developers and users, and technology transfer <br>\nexperts are all welcome. We are interested in work that has been <br>\nincorporated into real production systems, and in theoretical work that <br>\npromises to bring practical, tangible engineering benefits.</p>\n<p>Scope and Topics:<br>\nSubmissions related to the following principal themes are encouraged, <br>\nbut any topics relevant to the field of formal engineering methods and <br>\ntheir practical applications will also be considered:</p>\n<p>• Abstraction, refinement and evolution<br>\n• Formal specification and modelling<br>\n• Formal verification and analysis<br>\n• Model checking<br>\n• Formal approaches to software testing and inspection<br>\n• Formal methods for self-adaptive systems<br>\n• Formal methods for object-oriented systems<br>\n• Formal methods for component-based systems<br>\n• Formal methods for concurrent and real-time systems<br>\n• Formal methods for cloud computing<br>\n• Formal methods for cyber-physical systems<br>\n• Formal methods for software safety and security<br>\n• Formal methods for software reliability and dependability<br>\n• Development, integration and experiments involving verified systems<br>\n• Formal certification of products under international standards<br>\n• Formal model-based development and code generation</p>\n<p>Submission and Publication:<br>\nSubmissions to the conference must not have been published or be <br>\nconcurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will <br>\nbe judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field, <br>\ntechnical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference. The <br>\nproceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer <br>\nScience series.</p>\n<p>Papers should be written in English and should not exceed 16 pages in <br>\nLNCS format. Submissions should be made through the ICFEM 2020 <br>\nsubmission page, handled by the EasyChair conference management system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfem20\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfem20</a></p>\n<p>Workshop or tutorial proposals should be directly sent to the Workshop <br>\nChair via email. Each proposal should include (1) title, scope, and <br>\naims, (2) brief bio of the organizer or lecturer, and (3) postal and <br>\nemail addresses.</p>\n<p>Organising Committee:</p>\n<p>General Chair<br>\nJin Song Dong, National University of Singapore and Griffith University, <br>\nSingapore/Australia<br>\nJim McCarthy, Defence Science and Technology, Australia​</p>\n<p>Program Co-Chairs<br>\nShang-Wei Lin, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>\nZhe Hou, Griffith University, Australia<br>\nBrendan Mahony, Defence Science and Technology, Australia​</p>\n<p>Finance Chair<br>\nYang Liu, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>\nJun Sun, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore</p>\n<p>Workshop Chair<br>\nHadrien Bride, Griffith University, Australia</p>\n<p>Doctoral Symposium Chair<br>\nLei Ma, Kyushu University, Japan</p>\n<p>Program Committee<br>\nYamine Ait Ameur, IRIT/INPT-ENSEEIHT, France<br>\nÉtienne André, Univesrity of Lorraine, France<br>\nCyrille Artho, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden<br>\nChristian Attiogbe, University of Nantes, France<br>\nGuangdong Bai, University of Queensland, Australia<br>\nChristel Baier, TU Dresden, Germany<br>\nRichard Banach, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom<br>\nLuis Barbosa, University of Minho, Portugal<br>\nHadrien Bride, Griffith University, Australia<br>\nMichael Butler, University of Southampton, United Kingdom<br>\nAna Cavalcanti, University of York, United Kingdom<br>\nYuting Chen, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China<br>\nZhenbang Chen, National University of Defense Technology, China<br>\nYu-Fang Chen, Academia Sinica, Taiwan<br>\nYean-Ru Chen, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan<br>\nWei-Ngan Chin, National University of Singapore, Singapore<br>\nRanald Clouston, Australian National University, Australia<br>\nSylvain Conchon, Universite Paris-Sud, France<br>\nFlorin Craciun, Babes-Bolyai University, Romania<br>\nJeremy Dawson, Australian National University, Australia<br>\nFrank De Boer, Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI), Netherlands<br>\nYuxin Deng, East China Normal University, China<br>\nJin Song Dong, Griffith University and NUS, Australia<br>\nNaipeng Dong, University of Queensland, Australia<br>\nZhenhua Duan, Xidian University, China​<br>\nMarc Frappier, Université de Sherbrooke, Canada<br>\nLindsay Groves, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand<br>\nIchiro Hasuo, National Institute of Informatics, Japan<br>\nXudong He, Florida International University, United States<br>\nZhe Hou, Griffith University, Australia<br>\nPao-Ann Hsiung, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan<br>\nFuyuki Ishikawa, National Institute of Informatics, Japan<br>\nFabrice Kordon, LIP6/Sorbonne Universite &amp; CNRS, France<br>\nYi Li, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>\nXuandong Li, Nanjing University, China<br>\nShang-Wei Lin, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>\nYang Liu, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>\nZhiming Liu, Southwest University, China<br>\nShuang Liu, Tianjin University, China<br>\nBrendan Mahony, DSTO, Australia<br>\nJim McCarthy, Defence Science and Technology, Australia​<br>\nDominique Mery, Université de Lorraine, France<br>\nStephan Merz, Inria Nancy, France<br>\nShin Nakajima, National Institute of Informatics, Japan<br>\nJun Pang, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg<br>\nYu Pei, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, China<br>\nShengchao Qin, Teesside University, United Kingdom<br>\nSilvio Ranise, FBK-Irst, Italy<br>\nElvinia Riccobene, University of Milan, Italy<br>\nAdrian Riesco, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain<br>\nDavid Sanan, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>\nKlaus-Dieter Schewe, Zhejiang University, China<br>\nHarald Sondergaard, The University of Melbourne, Australia<br>\nMeng Sun, Peking University, China<br>\nJing Sun, The University of Auckland, New Zealand<br>\nJun Sun, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore<br>\nAlwen Tiu, The Australian National University, Australia<br>\nElena Troubitsyna, KTH, Sweden<br>\nHai H.
