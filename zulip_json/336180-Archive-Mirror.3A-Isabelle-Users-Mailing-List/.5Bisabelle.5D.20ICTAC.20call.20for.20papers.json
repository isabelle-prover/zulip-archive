A further aim is to promote cooperation in research and<br>\neducation between participants and institutions from developing and<br>\nindustrial countries, as in the United Nations University's mandate. The<br>\nprevious four ICTAC events were held in Guiyang, China (2004), Hanoi,<br>\nVietnam (2005), Tunis, Tunisia (2006) and Macau (2007). </p>\n<p>In 2008, topics include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>software specification, refinement, verification and testing</li>\n<li>model checking and theorem proving </li>\n<li>software architectures </li>\n<li>coordination and feature interaction </li>\n<li>integration of theories, formal and engineering methods and tools</li>\n<li>models of concurrency, security, and mobility </li>\n<li>parallel, distributed, and internet-based (grid) computing </li>\n<li>real-time, embedded and hybrid systems </li>\n<li>automata theory and formal languages </li>\n<li>principles and semantics of languages </li>\n<li>logics and their applications </li>\n<li>type and category theory in computer science </li>\n<li>case studies, theories, tools and experiments of verified systems  </li>\n<li>service-oriented architectures: models and development methods</li>\n<li>domain modelling and domain-specific technology: examples, frameworks<br>\nand experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We particularly welcome submissions for a special track on Tool Support<br>\nfor Formal Methods of System Development: from the foundations of tools,<br>\nthrough their design to application and evaluation. </p>\n<p>Paper Submissions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be<br>\nconcurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will<br>\nbe judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field,<br>\ntechnical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference.<br>\nPapers should be in English and should not exceed 15 pages LNCS format<br>\n(see <a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a> for details).<br>\nSubmission constitutes a commitment to attend and present a paper, if<br>\naccepted. </p>\n<p>Proceedings of the previous ICTAC colloquia were published by Springer<br>\nin the LNCS series. We plan to do the same this year. </p>\n<p>Submission Procedure: Further information and instructions can be found<br>\nat the conference website <a href=\"http://www.ictac.net/ictac08\">http://www.ictac.net/ictac08</a></p>\n<p>Tutorials &amp; Workshops: We welcome proposals for tutorials and workshops<br>\nrelevant to the ICTAC themes to take place on 30-31 August 2008.<br>\nProposers should contact the Organising Chair (<a href=\"mailto:yenigun@sabanciuniv.edu\">yenigun@sabanciuniv.edu</a>).<br>\nThe closing date for workshop proposals is 7 April 2008, with<br>\nnotification on 30 April 2008.
