The IJCAR technical program will consist of presentations of high-quality original research papers, system descriptions, and invited talks.</p>\n<p>IJCAR 2016 is a merger of leading events in automated reasoning:</p>\n<p>CADE (Conference on Automated Deduction),<br>\n     FroCoS (Workshop on Frontiers of Combining Systems) and<br>\n     TABLEAUX (Conference on Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods).</p>\n<p>IJCAR 2016 invites submissions related to all aspects of automated reasoning, including foundations, implementations, and applications. Original research papers and descriptions of working automated deduction systems are solicited.</p>\n<p>IJCAR topics include the following ones:</p>\n<p>Logics of interest include: propositional, first-order, classical, equational, higher-order, non-classical, constructive, modal, temporal, many-valued, substructural, description, type theory, etc.<br>\n     Methods of interest include: tableaux, sequent calculi, resolution, model-elimination, inverse method, paramodulation, term rewriting, induction, unification, constraint solving, decision procedures, model generation, model checking, semantic guidance, interactive theorem proving, logical frameworks, AI-related methods for deductive systems, proof presentation, automated theorem provers, combination of decision procedures, SAT and SMT solving, etc.<br>\n     Applications of interest include: verification, formal methods, program analysis and synthesis, computer mathematics, declarative programming, deductive databases, knowledge representation, etc.</p>\n<p>The proceedings of IJCAR 2016 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the LNAI/LNCS series (<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/lncs\">www.springer.com/lncs</a>).</p>\n<p>Submission details</p>\n<p>Submission is electronic, through<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2016\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2016</a></p>\n<p>Authors are strongly encouraged to use LaTeX and the Springer \"llncs\" format, which can be obtained from<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a></p>\n<p>The page limit is 15 pages for full papers, and 7 pages for system descriptions.</p>\n<p>Best paper award</p>\n<p>IJCAR 2016 will offer a best paper award to recognize the most outstanding paper appearing at the conference.</p>\n<p>Program co-chairs<br>\nNicola Olivetti (Aix-Marseille University, LSIS, France)<br>\nAshish Tiwari (SRI International, USA)</p>\n<p>Conference chair<br>\nPedro Quaresma (University of Coimbra)</p>\n<p>Publicity chair<br>\nSandra Marques Pinto (University of Coimbra)</p>\n<p>Workshop chair<br>\nReinhard Kahle (New University of Lisbon)</p>\n<p>Important dates</p>\n<p>Abstract submission deadline: January 18, 2016<br>\nPaper submission deadline: January 25, 2016<br>\nNotification of paper decisions: March 21, 2016<br>\nFinal version of papers due: April 11, 2016<br>\nMain Conference: 27-30 June, 2016<br>\nSatellite Events: 1-2 July, 2016</p>\n<p>Student travel awards</p>\n<p>Travel awards will be available to enable selected students to attend the conference.
