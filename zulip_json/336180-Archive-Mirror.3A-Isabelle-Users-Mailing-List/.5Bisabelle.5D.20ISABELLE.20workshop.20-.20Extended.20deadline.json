With the increasing use<br>\n  of the system and its combination of many automated deduction<br>\n  techniques, it is important to foster collaboration between different<br>\n  researchers. For the developers of Isabelle, meeting users is an<br>\n  important part of focusing development of the system. The workshop will<br>\n  also provide a forum to discuss new technologies and see a wide range of<br>\n  applications for automated reasoning. Discussion of formal theory<br>\n  developments also gives a chance to share knowledge and encourage<br>\n  improvements to the underlying proof tools and definitional machinery.<br>\n  Most formalisations in Isabelle's are in Higher-Order Logic, but we also<br>\n  encourage discussion of developments in other logics.</p>\n<p>Suggested Themes:</p>\n<p>* Formal Theory Developments,<br>\n  * Isar and Interfaces,<br>\n  * Definitional Machinery,<br>\n  * Proof Automation,<br>\n  * Future Directions</p>\n<p>Submissions:</p>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit abstracts for presentation at the<br>\n  workshop. These can concern finished work or work in progress and the<br>\n  length is up to the author. Although there will be no formal refereeing,<br>\n  if a large number of abstracts are received we may change the format so<br>\n  that some speakers give shorter talks.</p>\n<p>Submissions should be made via EasyChair<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/ISABELLE2007/\">http://www.easychair.org/ISABELLE2007/</a></p>\n<p>There will be a programme of short talks and demonstrations. A bound<br>\n  collection of the abstracts will be circulated to participants and made<br>\n  available online.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, please email Moa Johansson:<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:m.k.johansson@sms.ed.ac.uk\">m.k.johansson@sms.ed.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you all in Bremen,<br>\n  The Isabelle workshop organisers,<br>\n  Lucas Dixon, Moa Johansson</p>",
