With the increasing use<br>\nof the system and its combination of many automated deduction<br>\ntechniques, it is important to foster collaboration between different<br>\nresearchers. For the developers of Isabelle, meeting users is an<br>\nimportant part of focusing development of the system. The workshop will<br>\nalso provide a forum to discuss new technologies and see a wide range of<br>\napplications for automated reasoning. Discussion of formal theory<br>\ndevelopments also gives a chance to share knowledge and encourage<br>\nimprovements to the underlying proof tools and definitional machinery.<br>\nMost formalisations in Isabelle's are in Higher-Order Logic, but we also<br>\nencourage discussion of developments in other logics.</p>\n<p>Suggested Themes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formal Theory Developments,</li>\n<li>Isar and Interfaces,</li>\n<li>Definitional Machinery,</li>\n<li>Proof Automation,</li>\n<li>Future Directions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions:</p>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit abstracts for presentation at the<br>\nworkshop. These can concern finished work or work in progress and the<br>\nlength is up to the author. Although there will be no formal refereeing,<br>\nif a large number of abstracts are received we may change the format so<br>\nthat some speakers give shorter talks.</p>\n<p>Submissions should be made via EasyChair<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/ISABELLE2007/\">http://www.easychair.org/ISABELLE2007/</a></p>\n<p>There will be a programme of short talks and demonstrations. A bound<br>\ncollection of the abstracts will be circulated to participants and made<br>\navailable online.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, please email Moa Johansson:<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:m.k.johansson@sms.ed.ac.uk\">m.k.johansson@sms.ed.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you all in Bremen,<br>\nThe Isabelle workshop organisers,<br>\nLucas Dixon, Moa Johansson</p>",
