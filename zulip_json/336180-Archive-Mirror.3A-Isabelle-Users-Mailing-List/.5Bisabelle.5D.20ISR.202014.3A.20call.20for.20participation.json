It has strong links with mathematics, <br>\nalgebra, and logic, and it is the basis of well-known programming <br>\nparadigms like functional and equational programming, which are taught <br>\nat the universitary level in many countries. In these programming <br>\nparadigms and corresponding languages, the notions of reduction, pattern <br>\nmatching, confluence, termination, strategy, etc., are essential. <br>\nRewriting provides a solid framework for understanding, using, and <br>\nteaching all these notions. Rewriting techniques are also used in many <br>\nother areas of software engineering (scripting, prototyping, automated <br>\ntransformation of legacy systems, refactoring, web services, etc.) and <br>\nare implemented in popular systems like Mathematica, Autocad, and <br>\nothers. Rewriting techniques play a relevant role in computing research, <br>\neducation, and industry.</p>\n<p>The International School on Rewriting is promoted by the IFIP Working <br>\nGroup 1.6 Term Rewriting. The school is aimed at master and PhD <br>\nstudents, researchers, and practitioners interested in the study of <br>\nrewriting concepts and their applications.</p>\n<p>Two tracks are offered, including the lectures and the courses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Track A: for newcomers in the field, or just for people who want to <br>\nobtain a new, updated exposure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Track B: for those who want to get deeper in the most recent <br>\ndevelopments and applications of rewriting.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CONFIRMED LECTURERS</p>\n<p>Mauricio Ayala-Rincón, Universidade de Brasília, Brazil<br>\nEduardo Bonelli, Universidad de Quilmes, Argentina<br>\nClaude Kirchner, INRIA, France<br>\nHelene Kirchner, INRIA, France<br>\nAart Middeldorp.
