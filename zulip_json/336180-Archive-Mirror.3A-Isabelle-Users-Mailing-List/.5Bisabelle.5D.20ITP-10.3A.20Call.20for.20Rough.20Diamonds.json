However, we have waived the requirement<br>\nfor abstracts of submissions in the \"rough diamonds\" category; such<br>\nsubmissions will be accepted through Friday, January 22 (the paper<br>\nsubmissions deadline for full papers).  Quoting from the Call for<br>\nPapers:</p>\n<p>In addition to regular submissions, described<br>\n above, there will be a \"rough diamonds\" section.<br>\n Rough diamond submissions are limited to four<br>\n pages and may consist of an extended abstract.<br>\n They will be refereed: they will be expected to<br>\n present innovative and promising ideas, possibly<br>\n in an early form and without supporting<br>\n evidence.  Accepted diamonds will be published<br>\n in the main proceedings.  They will be presented<br>\n at the conference venue in a poster session.</p>\n<p>Please see the above URL for the full Call for Papers, which includes<br>\ninstructions for submission using EasyChair.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nMatt Kaufmann and Larry Paulson (ITP 2010 co-chairs)</p>",
