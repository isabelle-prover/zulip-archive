It combines the communities of two venerable<br>\nmeetings: the TPHOLs conference and the ACL2 workshop.  The inaugural<br>\nmeeting of ITP will be held on 11-14 July 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland,<br>\nas part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC, 9-21 July 2010),<br>\nco-located with the other FLoC conferences (CAV, ICLP, IJCAR, LICS,<br>\nRTA, SAT) and workshops.</p>\n<p>The program committee welcomes submissions on all aspects of<br>\ninteractive theorem proving and its applications.  Examples of typical<br>\ntopics include formal aspects of hardware or software (specification,<br>\nverification, semantics, synthesis, refinement, compilation, etc.);<br>\nformalization of significant bodies of mathematics; advances in<br>\ntheorem prover technology (automation, decision procedures, induction,<br>\ncombinations of systems and tools, etc.); other topics including those<br>\nrelating to user interfaces, education, comparisons of systems, and<br>\nmechanizable logics; and concise and elegant worked examples (\"Proof<br>\nPearls\").</p>\n<p>Submission details:</p>\n<p>All papers must be submitted electronically, via EasyChair:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp10\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp10</a></p>\n<p>Papers may be no longer than 16 pages and are to be submitted in PDF<br>\nusing the Springer \"llncs\" format.  Instructions may be found at<br>\nftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/instruct/authors/typeinst.pdf<br>\nwith Latex source file typeinst.tex in the same directory.<br>\nSubmissions must describe original unpublished work not submitted for<br>\npublication elsewhere, presented in a way that users of other systems<br>\ncan understand.  The proceedings will be published as a volume in the<br>\nLecture Notes in Computer Science series and will be available to<br>\nparticipants at the conference.</p>\n<p>In addition to regular submissions, described above, there will be a<br>\n\"rough diamonds\" section.  Rough diamond submissions are limited to<br>\nfour pages and may consist of an extended abstract.  They will be<br>\nrefereed: they will be expected to present innovative and promising<br>\nideas, possibly in an early form and without supporting evidence.<br>\nAccepted diamonds will be published in the main proceedings.  They<br>\nwill be presented at the conference venue in a poster session.</p>\n<p>Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers at the<br>\nconference, and will be required to sign copyright release forms. <br>\nAll submissions must be written in English.</p>\n<p>Important dates (midnight GMT):</p>\n<p>Abstract submission deadline:         15 January 2010<br>\n Paper submission deadline:            22 January 2010<br>\n Notification of paper decisions:        15 March 2010<br>\n Camera-ready papers due from authors:    9 April 2010<br>\n Conference dates:                     11-14 July 2010</p>\n<p>Web page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.floc-conference.org/ITP-cfp.html\">http://www.floc-conference.org/ITP-cfp.html</a></p>\n<p>Conference co-chairs:</p>\n<p>Matt Kaufmann, University of Texas at Austin, USA<br>\n Larry Paulson, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom</p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>Thorsten Altenkirch, Nottingham University, United Kingdom<br>\n David Aspinall, Edinburgh University, United Kingdom<br>\n Jeremy Avigad, Carnegie Mellon University, USA<br>\n Gilles Barthe, IMDEA, Spain<br>\n Jens Brandt, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany<br>\n Thierry Coquand, Chalmers University, Sweden<br>\n Ruben Gamboa, University of Wyoming, USA<br>\n Georges Gonthier, Microsoft Research, United Kingdom<br>\n David Greve, Rockwell Collins Inc., USA<br>\n Elsa Gunter, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA<br>\n John Harrison, Intel Corporation, USA<br>\n Joe Hurd, Galois Inc., USA<br>\n Matt Kaufmann, University of Texas at Austin, USA<br>\n Gerwin Klein, NICTA, Australia<br>\n Xavier Leroy, INRIA, France<br>\n Assia Mahboubi, INRIA, France<br>\n Panagiotis Manolios, Northeastern University, USA<br>\n John Matthews, Galois Inc., USA<br>\n J Moore, University of Texas at Austin, USA<br>\n Cesar Munoz, NASA, USA<br>\n Tobias Nipkow, TU Muenchen, Germany<br>\n Michael Norrish, NICTA, Australia<br>\n David Pichardie, INRIA Rennes, France<br>\n Brigitte Pientka, McGill University, Canada<br>\n Lee Pike, Galois Inc., USA<br>\n Sandip Ray, University of Texas at Austin, USA<br>\n Jose Luis Ruiz-Reina, Universidad de Sevilla, Spain<br>\n Larry Paulson, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom<br>\n David Russinoff, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., USA<br>\n Peter Sewell, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom<br>\n Konrad Slind, Rockwell Collins Inc., USA<br>\n Sofiene Tahar, Concordia University, Canada<br>\n Christian Urban, TU Muenchen, Germany</p>\n<p>Workshop Chair:</p>\n<p>Michael Norrish, NICTA, Australia</p>\n<p>Local Arrangements:</p>\n<p>David Aspinall, Edinburgh University, United Kingdom</p>",
