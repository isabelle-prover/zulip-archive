The inaugural <br>\nmeeting of ITP was held on 11-14 July 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland, as <br>\npart of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC, 9-21 July 2010).  The <br>\nsecond edition of ITP will take place in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, <br>\non 22-25 August 2011. ITP is the evolution of the TPHOLs conference <br>\nseries to the broad field of interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs <br>\nmeetings took place every year from 1988 until 2009. </p>\n<p>The program committee welcomes submissions on all aspects of<br>\ninteractive theorem proving and its applications.  Examples of typical<br>\ntopics include formal aspects of hardware or software (specification,<br>\nverification, semantics, synthesis, refinement, compilation, etc.);<br>\nformalization of significant bodies of mathematics; advances in<br>\ntheorem prover technology (automation, decision procedures, induction,<br>\ncombinations of systems and tools, etc.); other topics including those<br>\nrelating to user interfaces, education, comparisons of systems, and<br>\nmechanizable logics; and concise and elegant worked examples (\"Proof<br>\nPearls\").</p>\n<p>Submission details:</p>\n<p>All papers must be submitted electronically, via EasyChair:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2011\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2011</a></p>\n<p>Papers may be no longer than 16 pages and are to be submitted in PDF<br>\nusing the Springer \"llncs\" format.  Instructions may be found at<br>\nftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/instruct/authors/typeinst.pdf<br>\nwith Latex source file typeinst.tex in the same directory.<br>\nSubmissions must describe original unpublished work not submitted for<br>\npublication elsewhere, presented in a way that users of other systems<br>\ncan understand.  As for the last edition, the proceedings will be published<br>\nas a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series and will <br>\nbe available to participants at the conference.</p>\n<p>In addition to regular submissions, described above, there will be a<br>\n\"rough diamonds\" section.  Rough diamond submissions are limited to<br>\nsix pages and may consist of an extended abstract.  They will be<br>\nrefereed: they will be expected to present innovative and promising<br>\nideas, possibly in an early form and without supporting evidence.<br>\nAccepted diamonds will be published in the main proceedings.  They<br>\nwill be presented at the conference venue in a poster session.</p>\n<p>Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers at the<br>\nconference, and will be required to sign copyright release forms. <br>\nAll submissions must be written in English.</p>\n<p>Important dates (midnight GMT):</p>\n<p>Abstract submission deadline:           13 February 2011<br>\nPaper submission deadline:              20 February 2011<br>\nNotification of paper decisions:        18 April 2011<br>\nCamera-ready papers due from authors:   15 May 2011<br>\nConference dates:                       22-25 August 2011</p>\n<p>Web page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://itp2011.cs.ru.nl/\">http://itp2011.cs.ru.nl/</a></p>\n<p>Invited Speakers:</p>\n<p>Don Batory, University of Texas at Austin<br>\nGeorges Gonthier, Microsoft Research<br>\nMike Kishinevsky, Intel</p>\n<p>Conference co-chairs:</p>\n<p>Marko Van Eekelen, <br>\nRadboud University Nijmegen/Open University of the Netherlands<br>\nHerman Geuvers, <br>\nRadboud University Nijmegen<br>\nJulien Schmaltz, <br>\nOpen University of the Netherlands/Radboud University Nijmegen<br>\nFreek Wiedijk, <br>\nRadboud University Nijmegen</p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>David Aspinall (Univ. of Edinburgh, UK)<br>\nJeremy Avigad (CMU, USA)<br>\nStefan Berghofer (TUM, Gremany)<br>\nYves Bertot (INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, France)<br>\nSandrine Blazy (IRISA, France)<br>\nJens Brandt (Univ. of Kaiserslautern, Germany)<br>\nJared Davis (Centaur, USA)<br>\nAmy Felty (Univ. of Ottawa, Canada)<br>\nJean-Christophe Filliatre (INRIA Saclay, France)<br>\nHerman Geuvers - co-Chair (Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands)<br>\nGeorges Gonthier (Microsoft Research, USA)<br>\nElsa Gunther (UIUC, USA)<br>\nJohn Harrison (Intel, USA)<br>\nReiner HÃ¤hnle (Chalmers Univ. of Technology, Sweden)<br>\nMatt Kaufmann (Univ. of Texas at Austin, USA) <br>\nGerwin Klein (NICTA, Australia)<br>\nAssia Mahboubi (LIX, France) <br>\nPanagiotis Manolios (Northeastern Univ., USA)<br>\nJohn Matthews (Galois, USA) <br>\nPaul Miner (NASA, USA)<br>\nJ Moore (Univ. of Texas at Austin, USA) <br>\nGreg Morrisett (Harvard Univ., USA)<br>\nMagnus O.
