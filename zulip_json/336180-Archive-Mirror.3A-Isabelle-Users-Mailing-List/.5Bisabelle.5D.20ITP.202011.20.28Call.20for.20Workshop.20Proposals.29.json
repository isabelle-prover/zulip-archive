The second edition of ITP will <br>\ntake place in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, on 22-25 August 2011. <br>\nITP is the evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to the broad <br>\nfield of interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place <br>\nevery year from 1988 until 2009.</p>\n<p>Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals <br>\nfor workshops on topics relating to interactive theorem proving. <br>\nWorkshops can target the ITP community in general or be focused<br>\nto one particular ITP system. </p>\n<p>Possible dates for workshops are 26 and 27 August 2011 (two days after ITP). <br>\nThe duration of workshops can be one or two days. </p>\n<p>Important dates:</p>\n<p>Submission deadline:                    13 February 2011<br>\nNotification:                           13 March 2011</p>\n<p>Workshop proposals should be submitted per email to <a href=\"mailto:itp2011@easychair.org\">itp2011@easychair.org</a>.</p>\n<p>All accepted workshops will be expected to have the programme ready by<br>\nJuly 1st 2011.</p>\n<p>The workshop selection committee consists of the ITP chairs:</p>\n<p>Marko Van Eekelen, Radboud University Nijmegen/Open University of the Netherlands<br>\nHerman Geuvers, Radboud University Nijmegen<br>\nJulien Schmaltz, Open University of the Netherlands/Radboud University Nijmegen<br>\nFreek Wiedijk, Radboud University Nijmegen</p>",
