It combines the communities of two venerable<br>\nmeetings: the TPHOLs conference and the ACL2 workshop.  The inaugural<br>\nmeeting of ITP was held on 11-14 July 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland,<br>\nas part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC, 9-21 July 2010).<br>\nITP is the evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to the broad field <br>\nof interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year <br>\nfrom 1988 until 2009.</p>\n<p>The final programme will include 26 regular paper presentations and 7<br>\nrough diamonds presentations. It will also include 3 invited talks by<br>\nrenown speakers from industry and academia and 2 tutorials. ITP 2013 has <br>\n2 affiliated workshops.
