This message concerns the first<br>\nphase. A long-standing ITP/TPHOLs convention is that the conference<br>\nshould be held in a continent different from the location of the<br>\nprevious meeting. For 2013, we therefore solicit bids from prospective<br>\nhosts located outside North America. Similar to previous years, we<br>\nexpect bids to propose a date in July, August or September.</p>\n<p>Bids should be sent to itp2012 at <a href=\"http://easychair.org\">easychair.org</a> and should include at least<br>\nthe following pieces of information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>name and email address of a contact person</li>\n<li>names of other people involved</li>\n<li>address of website for the bid</li>\n<li>approximate dates of the conference</li>\n<li>\n<p>structure (e.g., k workshop days and n days of presentations followed<br>\n  by excursion...)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>advantages of the proposed venue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example of previous winning bids are here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://itp2011.cs.ru.nl/ITP2011/Bid_ITP11.html\">http://itp2011.cs.ru.nl/ITP2011/Bid_ITP11.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/itp2012/bid.html\">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/itp2012/bid.html</a></p>\n<p>Deadline for all bids is Monday, 27 February 2012. Shortly after that,<br>\nall admitted bids will be made public and the voting phase will take<br>\nplace.  The people eligible to vote are those who are seriously<br>\nthinking of attending ITP 2013. The voting system used will be Single<br>\nTransferable Vote between all received bids.</p>\n<p>Andrew Appel<br>\nLennart Beringer<br>\nAmy Felty</p>",
