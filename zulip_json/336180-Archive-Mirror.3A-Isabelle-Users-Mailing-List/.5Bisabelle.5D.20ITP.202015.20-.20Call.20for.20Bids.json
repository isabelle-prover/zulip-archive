This message concerns the first phase. A long-standing<br>\nITP/TPHOLs convention is that the conference should be held in a continent<br>\ndifferent from the location of the previous meeting. For 2015, we therefore<br>\nsolicit bids from prospective hosts located outside Europe. Similar to<br>\nprevious years, we expect bids to propose a date in July, August or September.</p>\n<p>Bids should be sent to itp2014 at <a href=\"http://easychair.org\">easychair.org</a> and should include at least<br>\nthe following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>name and email address of a contact person</li>\n<li>names of other people involved</li>\n<li>address of website for the bid</li>\n<li>approximate dates of the conference</li>\n<li>structure (e.g., k workshop days and n days of presentations, excursion etc)</li>\n<li>advantages of the proposed venue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example of previous winning bids are these:<br>\n<a href=\"http://itp2011.cs.ru.nl/ITP2011/Bid_ITP11.html\">http://itp2011.cs.ru.nl/ITP2011/Bid_ITP11.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/itp2012/bid.html\">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/itp2012/bid.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.irisa.fr/celtique/blazy/bid-itp13.html\">http://www.irisa.fr/celtique/blazy/bid-itp13.html</a></p>\n<p>The deadline for bids is Monday, 24 February 2014. Shortly after, all admitted<br>\nbids will be made public and the voting phase will take place. The people<br>\neligible to vote are those who are seriously thinking of attending ITP 2015.<br>\nThe voting system used will be Single Transferable Vote between all received<br>\nbids.</p>\n<p>Gerwin Klein<br>\nRuben Gamboa</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
