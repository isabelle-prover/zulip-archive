The seventh ITP conference, ITP 2016, will be held at Inria<br>\nNancy - Grand-Est and LORIA between 22 and 26 August 2016.</p>\n<p>ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of<br>\ninteractive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics include but<br>\nare not limited to the following:</p>\n<p>+ formal aspects of hardware and software<br>\n  + formalizations of mathematics<br>\n  + improvements in theorem prover technology<br>\n  + user interfaces for interactive theorem provers<br>\n  + formalizations of computational models<br>\n  + verification of security algorithms<br>\n  + use of theorem provers in education<br>\n  + industrial applications of interactive theorem provers<br>\n  + concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)</p>\n<p>Papers should be no more than 16 pages in length and are to be submitted in<br>\nPDF format via CoCon, a new conference management system with verified<br>\nnon-leakage guarantees. See</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itp2016.inria.fr/submission/\">https://itp2016.inria.fr/submission/</a></p>\n<p>for the instructions. Submissions must conform to the LNCS style in LaTeX. The<br>\nproceedings are to be published as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer<br>\nScience series and will be available to participants at the conference.<br>\nAuthors of accepted papers are expected to present their paper at the<br>\nconference and will be required to sign copyright release forms.</p>\n<p>In addition to regular papers, described above, there will be a \"rough<br>\ndiamond\" section. Rough diamond submissions are limited to 6 pages and may<br>\nconsist of an extended abstract. They will be refereed and be expected to<br>\npresent innovative and promising ideas, possibly in an early form and without<br>\nsupporting evidence. Accepted diamonds will be published in the main<br>\nproceedings and will be presented as short talks.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>Submission of title and abstracts: 29 February 2016<br>\nSubmission of full papers: 4 March 2016<br>\nAuthor notification: 6 May 2016<br>\nCamera-ready papers: 27 May 2016<br>\nMain conference: 22 to 25 August 2016<br>\nWorkshops: 26 (and possibly 25, 27) August 2016</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Andrea Asperti  (University of Bologna)<br>\nJeremy Avigad  (Carnegie Mellon University)<br>\nYves Bertot  (Inria Sophia Antipolis - Méditerranée)<br>\nLars Birkedal  (Aarhus University)<br>\nJasmin Christian Blanchette  (Inria Nancy - Grand-Est, LORIA &amp; MPII Saarbrücken, co-chair)<br>\nAdam Chlipala  (MIT)<br>\nNils Anders Danielsson  (University of Gothenburg &amp; Chalmers University of Technology)<br>\nAmy Felty  (University of Ottawa)<br>\nHerman Geuvers  (Radboud University Nijmegen)<br>\nGeorges Gonthier  (Microsoft Research)<br>\nJohn Harrison  (Intel)<br>\nHugo Herbelin  (Inria Paris - Rocquencourt)<br>\nCătălin Hriţcu  (Inria Paris - Rocquencourt)<br>\nCezary Kaliszyk  (University of Innsbruck)<br>\nMatt Kaufmann  (University of Texas at Austin)<br>\nGerwin Klein  (NICTA &amp; UNSW)<br>\nXavier Leroy  (Inria Paris - Rocquencourt)<br>\nAndreas Lochbihler  (ETH Zurich)<br>\nFrédéric Loulergue  (LIFO  (Université d'Orleans)<br>\nAssia Mahboubi  (Inria Saclay - Île-de-France)<br>\nPanagiotis Manolios  (Northeastern University)<br>\nStephan Merz  (Inria Nancy &amp; LORIA, co-chair)<br>\nMagnus O.
