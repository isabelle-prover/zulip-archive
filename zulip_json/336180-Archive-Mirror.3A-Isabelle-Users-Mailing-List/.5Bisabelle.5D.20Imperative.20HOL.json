Is it available? Are the<br>\nexamples available?</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\n  Peter</p>",

If you are interested, we can give you those files.<br>\nIf you want to continue working on those, i.e. the SAT checker would be <br>\na perfect example for the new Collection framework (e.g. the clauses are <br>\nsets implemented by sorted lists at the moment), I would suggest to turn <br>\nthese files into a new AFP entry.</p>\n<p>Happy Easter wishes,</p>\n<p>Lukas</p>\n<p>Peter Lammich wrote:</p>",
