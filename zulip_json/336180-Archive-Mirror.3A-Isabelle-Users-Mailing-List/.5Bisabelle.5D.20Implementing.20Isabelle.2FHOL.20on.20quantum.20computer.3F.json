Does quantum community call those algorithms somehow differently or have different perspective? Or maybe quantum speedup is not available for the type of reasoning that is done by Isabelle/HOL?</p>\n<p>Alex</p>",

It has a lot of binary search trees and similar in its memory. There's not a lot of interesting numerical calculations. This is challenging to optimise. Existing CPUs and cache architectures are fairly well tuned for pointer chasing. I don't think that quantum or FPGAs or GPUs would be good for this workload as is: too much state and not enough computation. I'm no expert, perhaps I'll turn out to be dead wrong.</p>\n<p>It might be possible to do surgery on Isabelle to speed up some of its common calculations, but be warned about correctness. A change which sped up the Isabelle kernel but made it less obviously correct would probably be rejected.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Thomas.</p>",

        "content": "<p>From: Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href=\"mailto:unruh@ut.ee\">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;<br>\nI think implementing Isabelle/HOL (as a whole) on a quantum computer is <br>\nnot a very meaningful task. (Quantum computers shine at very specific <br>\ncomputational tasks but one would not write a whole application on it.) <br>\nHowever, I think it would be conceivable to use a quantum computer in <br>\nthe implementation of certain tactics. For example, a tactic for solving <br>\nSAT (not SMT) problems could be implemented by outsourcing to a quantum <br>\nSAT solver to get a polynomial speedup. (See <br>\n<a href=\"https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/\">https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/</a>, section on \"Algorithm: Constraint <br>\nSatisfaction\".) There exist also quantum algorithms for speeding up <br>\nbacktracking (see same section), this could, hypothetically, be used to <br>\nreimplement some tactics that backtrack a lot (I think auto, simp, <br>\nblast, force, ... all do). I say hypothetically because a na√Øve approach <br>\nof implementing them on a quantum computer would work only in the QRAM <br>\nmodel (which assumes a random access in superposition of many different <br>\nmemory locations) which I think is not a realistic cost model even for <br>\nlong-term quantum computers. (This is because of the \"pointer chasing\" <br>\nthat Thomas mentioned.) But maybe there are some cases where even a more <br>\nrealistic memory model can be used. But this is far from obvious (at <br>\nleast to me).</p>\n<p>One note: Quantum computers tend to be noisy (i.e., make errors). But at <br>\nleast for the ideas I'm mentioning above, this would not be a problem <br>\nfor the soundness of Isabelle because the tactics would produce <br>\nclassically checkable certificates.</p>\n<p>Other note: I was here taking a long-term view on quantum computation. <br>\nIf we are talking about NISQ (near-term), then I don't think there are <br>\nany speedups useful for Isabelle (but I would be curious to be proven <br>\nwrong on this point).</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",
