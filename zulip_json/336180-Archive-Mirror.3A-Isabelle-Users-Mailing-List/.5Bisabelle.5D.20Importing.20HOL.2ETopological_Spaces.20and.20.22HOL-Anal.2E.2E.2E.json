Without this constraint, the type variable ‘a in the constant open :: \"'a set ⇒ bool\" is of sort open, but with this constraint it is constrained to be a topological_space. Your lower_topology is defined upon the ‘open’ class, and this class introduced the constant ‘open’ that caused this incompatibility. </p>\n<p>I am not sure why this constraint is introduced in the first place. As long as you are willing to strengthen the typeclass ‘open’ to topological_space, the incompatibility can disappear: </p>\n<p>class lower_topology = order + topological_space</p>\n<ul>\n<li>assumes open_generated_order: \"open = generate_topology (range (λJ. {K. ¬J≤K}))\"<br>\nbegin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>subclass topological_space<br>\n unfolding open_generated_order<br>\n by (rule topological_space_generate_topology)</p>\n<p>end</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nWenda</p>",
