In HOL-Probability<br>\n(~~/src/HOL/Probability) there is also the Lebesgue integral and the<br>\nBochner integral. Especially, the theory Interval_Integral contains a<br>\nlot of stuff to relate improper and proper integrals also in with a<br>\nFTC.</p>\n<p>As far as I know there is not much for relating the improper and proper<br>\nintegral of the Heinstock-Kurzweil integral in HOL-MV_A. Of course, you<br>\nneed to add the necessary integrability and boundedness assumptions to<br>\nprove your goals. Also, it maight be easier to replace at_top by<br>\nsequentially: sequentially allows you to directly use dominated<br>\nconvergence with at_top you need to fiddle around with the limits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Johannes</li>\n</ul>",
