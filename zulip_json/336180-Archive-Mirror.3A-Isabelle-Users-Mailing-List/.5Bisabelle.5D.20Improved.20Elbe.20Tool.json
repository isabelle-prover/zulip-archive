[Elbe is a language tool for navigation and <br>\npretty printing of source files and a simple batch runner.] I corrected <br>\nthe Isabelle.ttf font and called it Elbian.ttf and with that font the <br>\nAcrobat export now works. Also two languages have been added: Fortran and <br>\nVHDL. The main improvement is a navigator, which makes the language files <br>\neasier to investigate, so that one can see at once, what is contained in a <br>\nsource like e.g. rationals.thy. Those who are interested can download it <br>\nfrom<br>\n<a href=\"http://cococo.de/Context_IT_GmbH/index.jsp?content=elbe\">http://cococo.de/Context_IT_GmbH/index.jsp?content=elbe</a><br>\nHave a successful week,<br>\nJens</p>",
