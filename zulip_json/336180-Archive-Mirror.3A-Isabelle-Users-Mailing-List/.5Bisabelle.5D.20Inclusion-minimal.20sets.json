Perhaps this should then be separate from the \"normal\" Min/Max, <br>\nsince one would not be able to generate code for Min/Max on non-linear <br>\norders due to the non-unique nature of the definition.</p>\n<p>Another perhaps less problematic way would be to define the set of /all/ <br>\nmaximal elements w.r.t. an order (perhaps even an order specified as a <br>\npredicate, not a typeclass) I already have something like this in my <br>\nformalisation of Social Choice Theory anyway.</p>\n<p>Getting /some/ maximal element is then trivial and one has separated the <br>\narbitrary choice from the maximality-related stuff.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have no objection in principle, but they way Max is defined would have<br>\nto be reorganized considerably and you should talk to Florian about that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess I'll put it on my queue then.</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
