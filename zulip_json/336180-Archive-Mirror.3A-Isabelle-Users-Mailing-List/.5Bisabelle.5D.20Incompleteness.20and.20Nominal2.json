I tried it myself and found that the entry makes<br>\nuse of Nominal2, but Nominal2 is not an AFP entry itself, nor is it<br>\navailable anywhere else. All I found is an old version that works with<br>\nIsabelle 2014.</p>\n<p>Strangely, when clicking ‘Browse theories’ in the Incompleteness AFP<br>\nentry, some Nominal2 theories show up, but when downloading the .tar.gz<br>\n(‘Download this entry’), they are not in the archive.</p>\n<p>What is the current status of Nominal2, especially in combination with<br>\nIncompleteness? Having an AFP entry online that does not work when you<br>\ndownload it and load it into Isabelle seems highly undesirable to me.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",

It is definitely in the mercurial repository, but it doesn’t appear as an individual entry. This means that you have to download the entire AFP, all 144 MB, if you want to get it. I think that this has been the situation for a considerable time.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning that Incompleteness takes several minutes to run, even on a fast machine.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
