The following example illustrates my problem:</p>\n<p>inductive foo where<br>\n   \"foo some_very_long_term\"<br>\n   if \"some_condition\"<br>\n| \"foo bar\" if \"baz\"</p>\n<p>The above is what looks like a reasonable layout to me. Unfortunately, Isabelle likes to <br>\nhave it differently, namely:</p>\n<p>inductive foo where<br>\n   \"foo some_very_long_term\"<br>\nif \"some_condition\"<br>\n| \"foo bar\" if \"baz\"</p>\n<p>Moreover, if I indent the if the way I like, auto-indent will now also indent the <br>\nsubsequent | when I type it. So I end up with the following</p>\n<p>inductive foo where<br>\n   \"foo some_very_long_term\"<br>\n   if \"some_condition\"<br>\n   | \"foo bar\" if \"baz\"</p>\n<p>which is not better either. IMO the \"if\" in an rule is subordinate to the | separating the <br>\nrules and should therefore be indented at least as far as the conclusion of the rule. Is <br>\nmy understanding just wrong or is the above just an unlucky artefact of sub-optimal <br>\nindentation rules?</p>\n<p>Andreas</p>",
