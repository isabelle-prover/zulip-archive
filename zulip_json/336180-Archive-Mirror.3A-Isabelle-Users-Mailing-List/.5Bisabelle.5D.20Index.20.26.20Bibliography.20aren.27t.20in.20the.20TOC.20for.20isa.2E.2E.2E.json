I was looking at <br>\nthe table of contents to see what was there, and I've seen in the past <br>\nthat many of the documentation PDFs don't have an index.</p>\n<p>In general, \"References\", \"Index\", and \"Bibliography\" don't show up in <br>\nthe table of contents for many of the PDFs in your documentation.</p>\n<p>But, \"Bibliography\" and \"Index\" are in the table of contents for <br>\n\"implementation.pdf\". I guess you need to add some \"\\addcontentsline\"s <br>\nto the other PDFs.</p>\n<p>If you're taking requests for your use of the LaTeX hyperref package, <br>\nplease add \"\\hypersetup{bookmarksnumbered=true}\" so that the PDF <br>\nsections in the bookmarks also get numbered.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nGB</p>",
