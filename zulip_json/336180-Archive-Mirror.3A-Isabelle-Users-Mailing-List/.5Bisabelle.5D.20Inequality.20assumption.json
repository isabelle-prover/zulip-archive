Moreover, extending the domain of a partial function does not affect any statements that are confined to the original domain. We can use any values we please, but in the case of division, the choice of zero is best in that it allows a number of well-known laws to hold unconditionally. An example is (x + y) / z = x/z + y/z.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
