If you just list the leaves of the theory <br>\ndependency graph, then the imported theory will show up in some random topological sort of <br>\ndependency order. By specifying intermediate theories, you can pin down that order. Note, <br>\nhowever, that you cannot get an order that would be in conflict with the dependencies.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
