Maybe, it helps to adjust the initial heap size. <br>\nYou can do so by changing the value of -H in Isabelle's ML_OPTIONS variable. Go to <br>\n~/.isabelle/Isabelle2013/etc and add a file with name \"settings\" with the following line <br>\nas content:<br>\nML_OPTIONS=\"-H 500\"</p>\n<p>AFAIK, 500 is Isabelle's default value for the initial size of the heap. Try to increase <br>\nor decrease that value and see if it works.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nAndreas</p>",

        "content": "<p>From: David Matthews &lt;<a href=\"mailto:dm@prolingua.co.uk\">dm@prolingua.co.uk</a>&gt;<br>\nHi Antoine,<br>\nThe quick answer is: remove the -H option completely by setting <br>\nML_OPTIONS=\"\".  This works for me in a 512Mbyte virtual machine. <br>\nHowever, you may find 500Mbytes very tight for Isabelle.</p>\n<p>The slightly longer answer is that you've fallen foul of a bug in <br>\nPoly/ML 5.5.  Prior to 5.5 the -H option had an important role to play <br>\nin setting the heap size and adjusting the size once the program was <br>\nrunning.  Poly/ML 5.5 has a much more sophisticated heap sizing <br>\nalgorithm and -H is retained just as a way of setting the initial size. <br>\n  The default maximum size is calculated from the memory size and if the <br>\nmemory size is smaller or similar to the -H option the bug is triggered.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nDavid</p>",
