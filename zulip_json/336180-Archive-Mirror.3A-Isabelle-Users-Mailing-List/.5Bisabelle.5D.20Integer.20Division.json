More <br>\nprecisely with an extension called quantifier elimination with answers.</p>\n<p>Quantifier elimination for this formula (which is in Presburger <br>\narithmetic) just tells you that it is equivalent to \"true\". Quantifier <br>\nelimination with answers tells you it is equivalent to True and you that <br>\none such an i is \"(r - 1) div 2\". These answers can be obtained from <br>\ne.g. Reddy and Loveland's algorithm (or any \"equivalent\", like <br>\nWeispfenning's 1990 etc...). These algorithms construct an \"elimination <br>\nset\" which contains all possible answers (i.e. if there is an i at all, <br>\nit must be one of them). From there you can find the answer.</p>\n<p>If the problems are not very complicated (their logical structure) then <br>\nyou might consider integer programming (there, however, everything <br>\nshould be existentially quantified, i.e. r too in the example below). <br>\nThe stength of QE with answers is that you can keep parameters in your <br>\n(existential) problem.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nAmine.</p>\n<p>Jens Doll wrote:</p>",
