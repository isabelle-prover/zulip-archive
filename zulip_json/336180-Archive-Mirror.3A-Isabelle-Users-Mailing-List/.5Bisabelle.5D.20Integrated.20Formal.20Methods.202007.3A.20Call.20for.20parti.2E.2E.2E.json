Formal<br>\nmethods - languages, tools, and techniques with a sound, mathematical<br>\nbasis - can be used to develop a thorough understanding, and to support<br>\nrigorous examination.</p>\n<p>Further research into effective integration is required if these<br>\nmethods are to have a significant impact outside academia. The IFM<br>\nseries of conferences seeks to promote that research, to bring<br>\ntogether the researchers carrying it out, and to disseminate the<br>\nresults of that research among the wider academic and industrial<br>\ncommunity.</p>\n<p>This is the sixth IFM conference.  It will be held in the historic<br>\nuniversity town of Oxford, at St Anne's College - one of the larger<br>\ncolleges of the University, with excellent new conference<br>\nfacilities. Oxford is easily reached from most UK cities, and is 70<br>\nminutes from the country's largest airport.  Earlier conferences in<br>\nthe series were held at York (1999), Schloss Dagstuhl (2000), Turku<br>\n(2002), Kent (2004), and Eindhoven (2005).</p>\n<p>The conference runs for three full days, 3rd to 5th July. Invited<br>\nspeakers include Jifeng He on \"UTP Semantics for Web Services\" and<br>\nDaniel Jackson on \"Recent Advances in Alloy\"; a third invited speaker<br>\nis yet to be confirmed. There are 32 contributed papers, including a<br>\nspecial session on Unifying Theories of Programming. In addition,<br>\nthere are four satellite events, taking place on 2nd and 3rd July -<br>\nthree workshops:</p>\n<p>* Refinement Workshop<br>\n  * C/C++ Verification <br>\n  * MeMoT (Methods, Models and Tools for Fault Tolerance) </p>\n<p>and a tutorial:</p>\n<p>* KeY (Integrating OO Design and Deductive Verification of Software)</p>\n<p>The full programme is available at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifm2007.org/programme-ifm.html\">http://www.ifm2007.org/programme-ifm.html</a></p>\n<p>Registration for the conference is now open, at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifm2007.org/registration.html\">http://www.ifm2007.org/registration.html</a></p>\n<p>Special early-registration fees apply until 1st June 2007. <br>\nFor more information, visit the conference web page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifm2007.org/\">http://www.ifm2007.org/</a></p>\n<p>or contact the local organisers:</p>\n<p>Jim Davies        <a href=\"http://www.softeng.ox.ac.uk/Jim.Davies\">http://www.softeng.ox.ac.uk/Jim.Davies</a><br>\n  Jeremy Gibbons    <a href=\"http://www.softeng.ox.ac.uk/Jeremy.Gibbons\">http://www.softeng.ox.ac.uk/Jeremy.Gibbons</a></p>",
