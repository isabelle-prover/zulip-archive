As I recall, there was a minor change connected with problems of that general sort. That particular example is unfortunate, but it is easily provable using other proof methods, including auto, fast and best.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",

The change made on 10 June 2016 causes blast to ignore goals than consist of a Boolean logical variable or its negation. Such variables typically cause uncontrolled branching, resulting in non-termination. Your example is a lucky case that worked anyway before that change. However, blast is a first-order prover, so such problems are out of scope.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your report.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
