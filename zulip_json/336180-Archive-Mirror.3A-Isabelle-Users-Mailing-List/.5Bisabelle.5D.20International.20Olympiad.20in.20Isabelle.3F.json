You mean<br>\n\"Isabelle/ML\", which is properly integrated into Isabelle/Isar for more<br>\nthan 10 years. In the past, end-users were accustomed to the Poly/ML<br>\nbootstrap environment, which is still available in \"isabelle process\"<br>\nand \"isabelle console\" today, but rarely used directly in applications.</p>\n<p>Moreover note that the brief discussion about the 'sorry' command vs.<br>\nchecking oracle tags in thm values is unfounded. Neither the Isabelle<br>\ndocumentation nor the implementation supports that claim.</p>\n<p>Concerning the general mental model of a bullet-proof checker that can<br>\nrun unattended and cannot be abused: I don't believe that Isabelle can<br>\never deliver that. It was not constructed with that idea in mind: after<br>\ndecades of following a model of benevolent users that don't shoot<br>\nthemselves in the foot, it is infeasible to do differently in a posthoc<br>\nfashion. You need a different proof checker for that, but I don't know a<br>\nsuitable system.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
