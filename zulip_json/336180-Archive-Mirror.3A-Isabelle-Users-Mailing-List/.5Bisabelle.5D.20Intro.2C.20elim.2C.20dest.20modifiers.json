I'm pretty sure that the [intro], [elim] and [dest] <br>\nmodifiers for theorems govern how the theorem will be used by the <br>\nreasoner.  I'm having a hard time finding specific documentation on how <br>\nthese modifiers work (include the differences between intro, and intro! <br>\n).  If someone could point me to a document that would explain this, I <br>\nwould really appreciated it.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,<br>\n    Jason</p>",
