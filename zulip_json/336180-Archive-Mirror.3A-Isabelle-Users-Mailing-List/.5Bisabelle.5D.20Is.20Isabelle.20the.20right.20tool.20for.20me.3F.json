Isabelle supports a number of different logics, including higher order logic (Isabelle/HOL) and axiomatic set theory (Isabelle/ZF).</p>\n<p>It isn't immediately clear from your message whether by \"set theory\" you are referring to heavy-duty set theoretic concepts such as ordinals and cardinals, or only simpler ones like unions and power sets. The other crucial question is whether you want your set theory to be typed or not. Higher order logic is essentially first order logic extended with functions and a simple typed set theory. For untyped, heavy-duty set theory, choose Isabelle/ZF; otherwise, choose Isabelle/HOL.<br>\nLarry Paulson</p>",
