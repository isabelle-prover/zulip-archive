For example, suppose I have an equality lemma:</p>\n<p>lemma rule_eq:\"A = B\" sorry</p>\n<p>so I can replace term A by term B in any goal state by \"unfolding <br>\nrulq_eq\". As I generally prefer B to A, I have to unfold rule_eq all the <br>\ntime. An ideal way might be something like syntactic abbreviations using <br>\ncommand \"abbreviation\", but unfortunately this doesn't work for equality <br>\nrules.</p>\n<p>Many thanks,<br>\nWenda</p>",
