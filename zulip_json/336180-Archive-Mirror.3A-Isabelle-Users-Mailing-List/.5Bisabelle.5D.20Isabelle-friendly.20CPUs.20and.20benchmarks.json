So as the general trend of multi/many-core hardware goes, <br>\nmemory bandwidth becomes the main issue.  Luckily, Poly/ML 5.5.x is pretty <br>\ngood and making this fast for the large immutable heaps we have in <br>\nIsabelle.</p>\n<p>My impression from practical work with Poly/ML and Isabelle is that <br>\nhigh-end Intel chips work best, something like current i5/i6 with 4-16 <br>\ncores and good memory sub-system. Hyperthreading also helps a bit to make <br>\nup for memory wait-cycles: on 8 core * hyperthreaded Xeon, I've seen a <br>\npeak speedup of 10 in isolated situations (overall wall-clock speedup is a <br>\nslightly different thing).</p>\n<p>As complete systems, the Mac Pro is particularly nice, because everything <br>\nfits together without having to spend extra on system-software <br>\nconfiguration -- you do spend extra money, though.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

Looking for a small (&lt;= 14 inch, no useless num <br>\nblock to carry around) laptop looking out for 3612QM and 3632QM was helpful <br>\nin my case (they come on slightly smaller dies than their 3610QM/3630QM <br>\ncousins).  For the record, in the benchmarklist mentioned in the initial<br>\npost (up to quadcore), the best (affordable) mobile 3612QM rated at 86945 dhrystones <br>\nvs the best desktop at 136990 (3820QM), consistent with the specified<br>\nprocessor speeds (the 3632QM is out since this Oct, slightly faster than <br>\n3612QM, and was not yet on the list).</p>\n<p>Best,</p>",
