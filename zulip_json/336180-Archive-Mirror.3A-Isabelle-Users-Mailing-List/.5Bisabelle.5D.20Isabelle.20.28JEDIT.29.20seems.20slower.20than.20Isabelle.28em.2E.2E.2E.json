In 2007/2008 I've spent a long <br>\ntime to investigate the general possibilities, and the JVM turned out the <br>\nbest option (compared to everything else).  This does not mean that it is <br>\nparticulary elegant or pretty, but it does the job.</p>\n<p>Note that \"nativeness\" has nothing to do with performance.  In recent <br>\ndecades major programming language environments have at last moved away <br>\nfrom the inherent problems of bare-metal program execution (as still seen <br>\nin C/C++), e.g. see MS .NET \"managed code\".</p>\n<p>The JVM is just a relatively early example of that, and not the best <br>\nimplementation of the concept.  Emacs is actually of the same kind, but <br>\nsome generations before: it is an interpreted LISP machine, with some <br>\nediting support.  So Emacs is actually dead-slow: interpreted or <br>\nbyte-interpreted, and single-threaded.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
