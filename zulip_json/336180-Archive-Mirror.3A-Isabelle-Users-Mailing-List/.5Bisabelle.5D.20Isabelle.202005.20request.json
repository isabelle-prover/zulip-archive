This was a new version<br>\nonce, when I first did proofs in this area.  Unfortunately new<br>\nversions are highly incompatible, like a different prover with the<br>\nsame name, so I'm stuck with the old one.  As the reviewer has<br>\ndiscovered, the developers have also at some time stopped making the<br>\n2005 version and installation instructions available on their archive.</p>\n<p>However I have just installed it on a borrowed computer in London,<br>\nrunning Linux, with the following details:</p>\n<p>Linux <a href=\"http://robotpc3-temp.cs.ucl.ac.uk\">robotpc3-temp.cs.ucl.ac.uk</a> 3.6.11-4.fc16.i686.PAE #1 SMP Tue Jan 8 21:18:14 UTC 2013 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux</p>\n<p>So here are instructions for what I did (from memory, unfortunately,<br>\nas the computer I've borrowed erases user files on reboot(!)).  </p>\n<p>That computer does have 32-bit libraries installed!</p>\n<p>Doing (from the directory where you unpack polyml-4.1.4.tar) cd<br>\npolyml-4.1.4/x86-linux ldd poly may make it clear whether you need to<br>\ninstall them</p>\n<p>Go to <br>\n<a href=\"http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jeremy/isabelle/\">http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jeremy/isabelle/</a><br>\nDownload Isabelle2005.tar and polyml-4.1.4.tar  </p>\n<p>Choose a directory to work (it's /home/users/jeremy in my own case)</p>\n<p>Put the tar files into that directory and unpack them (tar xvf filename.tar)</p>\n<p>In Isabelle2005/etc/settings you need to edit it by changing<br>\n/home/users/jeremy to whatever directory you have chosen to use</p>\n<p>Then type <br>\n/home/users/jeremy/Isabelle2005/bin/isabelle (changed as necessary).<br>\nwhich should start Isabelle 2005</p>\n<p>If this works you can type <br>\n[sym, refl, trans] ;<br>\nand it will display the text of those three theorems.</p>\n<p>For the specific work of the paper you need to download a lot of files from<br>\n<a href=\"http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jeremy/isabelle/2005/gen/\">http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jeremy/isabelle/2005/gen/</a></p>\n<p>Easiest to download just gen.tar and unpack it, to create a whole lot of files<br>\nin your directory (which you need to create) isabelle/2005/gen/<br>\n(or choose another directory if you like)</p>\n<p>Get into this directory and start Isabelle as above by <br>\n/home/users/jeremy/Isabelle2005/bin/isabelle (changed as necessary).</p>\n<p>Then<br>\nuse_thy \"tripartite\" ;<br>\nshould run a lot of preliminary proofs then the results of the paper<br>\n(of which the last is wf_rearr_n)</p>\n<p>Issue (2) - the url in the paper had not been updated.  Mea culpa.<br>\nWhat can I say, except that it's my fault, not my co-authors'. <br>\nAnd to compliment the referee(s) - I think most don't try to check on the<br>\nproof files.  Of course it's just Murphy's Law that this happens when I'm <br>\nnot able to fix it right away.  And I'm sorry if the half-baked attempts to <br>\nfix it by email led to wasting more of their time.</p>\n<p>Issue (3) - this theorem is the last in tripartite.ML, and the last <br>\nto show when</p>",

I would usually ask Jeremy<br>\nDawson to answer your question but he is traipsing around Europe<br>\nsomewhere on a well-deserved holiday with his wife, and is unable to<br>\nhelp.</p>\n<p>I tried to install Isabelle2005 myself to no avail. Apparently there<br>\nis something wrong with the \"build\" script and it is unable to find<br>\nthe right files. I have searched on the web and found some relevant<br>\nlinks, but nothing that allows the installation to complete.</p>\n<p>Jeremy suggested that I just copy his Isabelle2005 directory to my<br>\npublic home page and send you the link, so I have done that. It is at:<br>\n<a href=\"http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rpg/Isabelle2005.tar.gz\">http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rpg/Isabelle2005.tar.gz</a></p>\n<p>I am afraid that this is the best that I can do for now. </p>\n<p>best wishes,<br>\nraj</p>\n<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>",
