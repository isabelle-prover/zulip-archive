Unfortunately that part of the book was not written<br>\nwith sustainability in mind, i.e. no antiquotations, and hence it is virtually<br>\nimpossible to keep it up-to-date. But since the proofs in there do not reflect<br>\nthe state of the art anymore either, let's just say that anything in that<br>\ntutorial needs to be taken with a grain of salt.</p>\n<p>Tobias</p>",
