As Peter already mentioned a few months ago (here or on<br>\nisabelle-dev), when a tactic fails, it prints all subgoals, independent<br>\nof the goals_limit option (I tried setting it with \"declare\" before the<br>\nproof and with \"using\" in the proof).</p>\n<p>When the goal is large (in my current example: 41 subgoals, with up to<br>\n60-70 lines each), these take very long to print (around 6 minutes on my<br>\n8-core i7 machine).</p>\n<p>As a work-around, I modified src/Pure/Isar/proof_display.ML, setting<br>\n\"limit = true\" in the function \"string_of_goal\", thus making it honour<br>\nthe goal_limit option.</p>\n<p>-- Lars<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/8L9e9gJzXMpAtGzMW9611V7j/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
