I had not found the earlier discussion in my<br>\nsearch (I only checked back to May 2015; I should have dug a little<br>\ndeeper).

The point is that \\&lt;subset&gt; and<br>\n\\&lt;subseteq&gt; do not work for multisets in Isabelle2015; they are<br>\nrestricted to sets. This also applies to your next paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So far, there are two different orders over multisets: the multiset<br>\ninclusion (Isabelle2015: ⊂, Isabelle2016: ⊂#) and the multiset ordering<br>\n (since Isabelle2015: #⊂#).
