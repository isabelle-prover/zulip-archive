Right now it is just a scribbling <br>\nboard for<br>\npeople who were discontent with some of the official READMEs or <br>\nmanuals, and<br>\neven that is often pointless already due to continuous updates of the<br>\nofficial versions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't see why isabelle user communication should change from the (in <br>\nmy opinion) very well working mailing lists to anywhere else. I did <br>\nnever use stackoverflow or stackexchange myself (i.e., have no account) <br>\nbut of course occasionally arrive there via web searches. Today I read <br>\ntheir \"about\" section and it seems to be mostly their goal that <br>\nquestions get professional answers fast. I would say that is exactly <br>\nwhat is currently happening on the mailing lists.</p>\n<p>Of course this is specific to Isabelle. And some of the suggestions in <br>\nearlier e-mails did more sound like building a more general community <br>\n(e.g., all users of any kind of proof assistant). In principle that <br>\nsounds good. A good thing about the current setting is that it is <br>\nfocused (I do not have enough reading capacity to go through answers <br>\nconcerning other proof assistants while being concerned with some <br>\nisabelle specific question). Of course if questions occurred (on one of <br>\nthe isabelle lists or any list of another proof assistant) that were not <br>\ntool specific, they could be forwarded to this overflow/exchange thingy <br>\n(after that was established).</p>\n<p>To summarize my opinion. There are the following different issues:</p>\n<p>1) Isabelle user communication, including Q&amp;A. (I think: well covered by <br>\nthe current lists.)</p>\n<p>2) Isabelle community content (potentially, tips and tricks, tutorials, <br>\nresources, ...) which is currently maintained in a wiki and could be <br>\nimproved.</p>\n<p>3) Building a more general community (not Isabelle specific).</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",

In contrast, the Isabelle Wiki [2], to my <br>\nmind, looks out-of-date and unappealing. Also, compared to the <br>\nmailing-list, code snippets in SE can be formatted as code snippets, and <br>\nmath symbols can be formatted properly too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I think SE might be less intimidating to beginners. Maybe it's just me, <br>\nbut I think the idea of sending a newbie question to any mailing-list, <br>\nknowing that it will appear in hundreds of people's inboxes, is <br>\nsignificantly scarier than just posting it on a website (yes, even if those <br>\nsame people subscribe to the website's feed).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ability to edit questions and answers would be quite useful. Among <br>\nother benefits, questions can be later tagged with keywords, making them <br>\nmore likely to show up in Google searches.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The reputation system might be quite fun.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As Gottfried has pointed out, the SE idea would only work if <em>all</em> the <br>\nsupport migrates over from the mailing-list. This would be quite a radical <br>\nchange, and as Chris says, the mailing-list does generally work very well.</p>\n<p>A lightweight way to implement this change would be just to start asking <br>\nand answering Isabelle questions on Stack Overflow, e.g. here: <br>\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/isabelle\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/isabelle</a></p>\n<p>Alternatively, one could propose a dedicated Isabelle SE site, e.g.:<br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.stackexchange.com/\">http://isabelle.stackexchange.com/</a></p>\n<p>cheers,<br>\nJohn</p>",
