However, the entry<br>\nbarrier for users to program on the ML-level of Isabelle is still unbearably<br>\nhigh. We have money to change this state of affairs and want to provide a cook<br>\nbook about ML-coding in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>If you familiar with the ML-level of Isabelle, then then we can offer money<br>\nfor writing small parts of this documentation. Please get in contact with us.<br>\nIf you are not familiar, but like to know more about the bits and pieces that<br>\nmake up the Isabelle code, then let us know what you are interested in or what<br>\nproject you like to implement. Above all we like to help future users and<br>\ndevelopers of Isabelle; we do not want to end up with some \"artificial<br>\ndocumentation\" that is of nobody's help. We have outlined some possible<br>\ntopics of interest at</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/nominal/activities/idp/\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/nominal/activities/idp/</a></p>\n<p>but we are more than welcome to the Isabelle community's input.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Christian Urban<br>\nLarry Paulson<br>\nMichael Norrish</p>",
