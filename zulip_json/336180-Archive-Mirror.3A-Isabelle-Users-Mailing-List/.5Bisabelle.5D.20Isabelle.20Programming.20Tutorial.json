However, a few people already found<br>\nthe current draft quite useful. A big thanks to Stefan<br>\nBerghofer, Sacha BÃ¶hme, Jeremy Dawson, Alexander Krauss,<br>\nArmin Heller and Christian Sternagel, who contributed to<br>\nthe tutorial.</p>\n<p>The tutorial is aimed at students to become familiar with<br>\nthe Isabelle code as quickly as possible. To improve the<br>\ntutorial further and close the gaps, WE NEED YOUR HELP!<br>\nIf you are familiar with the ML-level of Isabelle, then<br>\nwe can offer some money in order for you to write small parts<br>\nof the tutorial. Please get in contact with us (see addresses<br>\non the webpage). If you are not familiar, but like to know<br>\nmore about the bits and pieces that make up the Isabelle<br>\ncode, then let us know what you are interested in or what<br>\nproject you like to implement. Any constructive feedback<br>\nwill be highly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Anyway, enjoy the tutorial!</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nChristian (on behalf of Larry and Michael)</p>",
