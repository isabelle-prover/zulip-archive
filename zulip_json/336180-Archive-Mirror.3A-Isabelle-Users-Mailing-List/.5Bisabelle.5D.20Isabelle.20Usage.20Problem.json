It was working<br>\nfine for some time. However, now I find Isabelle to be<br>\nvery slow in processing the theories and giving<br>\nresults. Is there any way to improve this performance?</p>\n<p>Now I have installed Isabelle in a Linux Fedora Core 2<br>\nplatform and I am having some problems in using it.<br>\nWhen I try to use Isabelle for processing some theory,<br>\nI am getting the following message.  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>[root@jitter bin]# ./isabelle<br>\n/usr/local/Isabelle2007/../polyml/x86-linux/poly:<br>\nerror while loading shared lib raries: libstdc++.so.6:<br>\ncannot open shared object file: No such file or<br>\ndirector y<br>\nUnknown logic \"HOL\" -- no heap file found in:<br>\n  /root/isabelle/heaps/Isabelle2007/polyml_x86-linux<br>\n  /usr/local/Isabelle2007/heaps/polyml_x86-linux</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I tried looking at the exising topics and using the<br>\nsuggestions regarding this issue, but still I am<br>\nunable to resolve it. I think the problem is ployml is<br>\nlooking for some library, which it is not able to<br>\nfind. Is polyml dependent on some libraries which<br>\nneeds to be installed? It would be of great help to me<br>\nif some one can provide me a solution for this<br>\nproblem. </p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nRajesh</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________________________________<br>\nNever miss a thing.

I understand that basically I need to update my Linux to the latest version. But I have a problem with that, as I am using Isabelle in my University machine, I am not sure if I will be able to update it. Is it possible to use my existing Linux version and update the required libraries that will make Poly/ML work? If yes, can someone please let me know where can I get the libraries? </p>\n<p>Thanks again,<br>\nRajesh</p>\n<p>Yes, the Poly/ML binary needs version 6 of libstdc++, any reasonably <br>\nup-to-date Linux distribution should be able to provide that.</p>\n<p>Fedora Core 2 is a bit old (4 years?).

The configuration will pick up whatever <br>\nversion of libc++ is available, but it might just fail to build.  See <br>\n<a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=148318\">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=148318</a> for the <br>\nofficial polyml.5.1.tar.gz and the following README how it is usually <br>\ncompiled for the Isabelle distribution (without requiring root access).</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This distribution of Poly/ML 5.1 has been compiled from the original<br>\nsources (available from <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyml/\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyml/</a>) as<br>\nfollows:</p>\n<p>tar xvzf polyml.5.1.tar.gz<br>\n  cd polyml.5.1<br>\n  ./configure --prefix=/tmp/polyml --without-x<br>\n  make<br>\n  make install</p>\n<p>Now /tmp/polyml/bin/* and /tmp/polyml/lib/* are moved to the<br>\nplatform-specific target directory (e.g. polyml-5.1/x86-linux).
