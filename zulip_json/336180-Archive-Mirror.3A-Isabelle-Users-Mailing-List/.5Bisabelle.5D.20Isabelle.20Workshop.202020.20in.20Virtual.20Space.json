Here is the official statement of the organizers of<br>\nour associated conferences (according to <a href=\"https://ijcar2020.org\">https://ijcar2020.org</a> from today):</p>\n<p>\"\"\"<br>\nThe organizing and steering committees of IJCAR and FSCD have decided that the<br>\n2020 edition of both the conferences will become virtual and will be held at a<br>\ndistance. The proceedings of both IJCAR and FSCD will be published as usual.<br>\nWe are also working with workshop organizers in order to virtualize satellite<br>\nevents too. More details on the modalities of this virtualization will be<br>\npublished ASAP.<br>\n\"\"\"</p>\n<p>To give people the opportunity to flush their pipeline of papers, we extend<br>\nthe deadline by 2 weeks:</p>\n<p>Paper submission deadline: 16-Apr-2020<br>\n  Notification of acceptance: 15-May-2020</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://sketis.net/isabelle/isabelle-workshop-2020\">https://sketis.net/isabelle/isabelle-workshop-2020</a> for further<br>\ndetails, and eventually the accepted papers.</p>\n<p>Note that there is no formal publication. It is possible to submit drafts of<br>\npapers that have been formally submitted elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Please submit title + abstract as soon as possible, so that we get an idea<br>\nwhat is coming: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=isabelle2020\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=isabelle2020</a></p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
