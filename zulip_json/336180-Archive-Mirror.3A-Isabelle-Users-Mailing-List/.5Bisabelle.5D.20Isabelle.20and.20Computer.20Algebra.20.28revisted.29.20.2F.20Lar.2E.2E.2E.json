Is there an recent<br>\nand working (best compatible with Isabelle version 2008) interface from<br>\nIsabelle to a computer algebra system? As Lutz already mentioned<br>\nsearching the web for \"Isabelle\" and \"Computer Algebra\" only reveals<br>\npapers on a very old interface (pre-2003).</p>\n<p>My second question is regarding large proof goals, in fact large sets of<br>\n assumptions. Currently Isabelle is not able to find contradictions like<br>\n[|...; x &lt; 0; ...; 0 &lt; x; ... |] ==&gt; 1 = -1 in this set of assumptions,<br>\nand I need to derive these contradictions basically by hand. I never<br>\ncounted them completely, but I seem to have about 150 assumptions.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\n Dominik</p>",
