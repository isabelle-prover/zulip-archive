Is that correct?</p>\n<p>I found isabelle process and isabelle console, but it seems, they are<br>\nnot intended for manual use. :)</p>\n<p>What would be the best approximation to a REPL interface (e.g. like the one<br>\nthat coqtop provides), for isabelle/hol?</p>\n<p>Or maybe I overlooked something and a interactive system can be<br>\neasily instanciated from isabelle console?</p>\n<p>Thank you very much,</p>\n<p>Holger</p>",

Even if it were possible, you would be taking a massive hit on productivity. The closest approximation is that you can work in a completely batch style, editing proofs in a plain text editor and then compiling them. Be a very slow and frustrating business.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
