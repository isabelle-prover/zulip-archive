I manage a fairly large<br>\nSML project called Quantomatic, so I thought I'd have a go at getting<br>\na setup to work. I've got a setup now that I am pretty happy with, so<br>\nI thought I'd share my results. Hopefully other people will find this<br>\nhelpful.</p>\n<p>Quantomatic is fairly unique in that it is designed to run inside of<br>\nIsabelle or as a standalone project. As a result, the whole codebase<br>\nis implemented on top of an Isabelle/ML-like environment, obtained by<br>\nimporting chunks of the ML code in Pure. This can be done by copying<br>\nsrc/Pure from Isabelle 2014 into an SML project and using this file:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Quantomatic/quantomatic/blob/integration/core/isabelle_env.ML\">https://github.com/Quantomatic/quantomatic/blob/integration/core/isabelle_env.ML</a></p>\n<p>In the past, we used a slightly hacked-up version of Pure, but for the<br>\nsake of maintainability, we now use an exact copy.</p>\n<p>The project itself is loaded with special \"thy\" files that only<br>\ncontain comments and \"ML_file\" commands. These can be run from inside<br>\nIsabelle/jEdit (in the \"real\" Isabelle/ML environment), or they can be<br>\nimported in poly/ML with the function \"use_thy\":</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Quantomatic/quantomatic/blob/integration/core/use_thy.ML\">https://github.com/Quantomatic/quantomatic/blob/integration/core/use_thy.ML</a></p>\n<p>This implements a baby version of the outer syntax parser, which<br>\nignores imports and translates the ML_file commands into use<br>\nstatements. This makes the external ROOT.ML tiny and easy to maintain:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Quantomatic/quantomatic/blob/integration/core/ROOT.ML\">https://github.com/Quantomatic/quantomatic/blob/integration/core/ROOT.ML</a></p>\n<p>This can be executed with, e.g. \"poly --use ROOT.ML\"</p>",
