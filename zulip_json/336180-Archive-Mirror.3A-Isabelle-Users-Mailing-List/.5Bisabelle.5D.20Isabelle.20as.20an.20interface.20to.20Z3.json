Could you explain a little bit more what kind of tweaking you are doing at the SMT-LIB level, and what you are trying to achieve?

However, if your quantifiers happen to range over uninterpreted sorts (types), finite model techniques can be used. See e.g. Andrew Reynolds's Ph.D. thesis or the SMT Workshop 2015 paper he wrote with Cesare Tinelli and me and which I mentioned in the previous email.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>lemma \"EX P.

You might have a little bit more success with Nitpick (and, hopefully one day, Nunchaku):</p>\n<p>lemma \"EX P.
