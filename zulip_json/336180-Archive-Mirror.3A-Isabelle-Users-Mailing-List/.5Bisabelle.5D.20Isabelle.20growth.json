It's somewhat approximate in that the distributions were not  <br>\nequally spaced, but the trend is clearly linear. Most of this  <br>\nmaterial consists of proofs rather than ML code.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/LHOz09sVNCzLA2i4plSWPal7/isabelle-growth.jpg\">isabelle-growth.jpg</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/LHOz09sVNCzLA2i4plSWPal7/isabelle-growth.jpg\" title=\"isabelle-growth.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/LHOz09sVNCzLA2i4plSWPal7/isabelle-growth.jpg\"></a></div>",
