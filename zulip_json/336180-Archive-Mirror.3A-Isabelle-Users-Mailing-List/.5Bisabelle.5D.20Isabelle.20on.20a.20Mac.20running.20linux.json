You need to change the file  <br>\netc/settings so that in the first section (# Poly/ML 4.x/5.x  <br>\n(automated settings)) one of the options is the directory of Poly/ML;  <br>\nthe automated settings are not correct.  For instance, in my system,  <br>\neverything lives in /usr/local (i.e. Isabelle directory, ProofGeneral  <br>\ndirectory, Poly/ML directory are all in this folder), so I added the  <br>\nline</p>\n<p>\"/usr/local/polyml/\"</p>\n<p>as one of the places it looks for ML_HOME.  Then it should work  <br>\nfine.  (NOTE I run my Mac under OSX, but I don't think it should make  <br>\na difference, since it's the exact same error message I got)</p>\n<p>Peter</p>",
