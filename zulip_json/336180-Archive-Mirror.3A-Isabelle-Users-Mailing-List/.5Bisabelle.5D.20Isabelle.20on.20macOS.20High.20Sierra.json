This is probably due to HTML GUI<br>\nrendering problems that Oracle and/or Apple still need to sort out (the<br>\nupdate from Java 8u144 to current Java 8u152 did not help).</p>\n<p>Are there more serious problems encountered in practical work?</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

(See attached pictures comparing Mac OS X and Metal, w.r.t. the selected Documentation Panel docked at the right.) But I guess this is rather a more general problem of jEdit.</p>\n<p>Dmitriy</p>",
