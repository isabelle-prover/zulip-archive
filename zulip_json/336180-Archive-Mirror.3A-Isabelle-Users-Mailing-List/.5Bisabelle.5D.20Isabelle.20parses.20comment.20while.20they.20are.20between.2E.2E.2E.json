It has already been severely restricted by<br>\nremoving commenting out from inner syntax, but I was not aware that it<br>\nalso ceased to work in outer syntax.</p>\n<p>FEATURE REQUEST: Provide a proper way to \"comment out\" arbitrary<br>\ncontent, in inner and outer syntax. Proper means that Isabelle makes no<br>\nassumptions on the \"commented out\" content, apart from basic lexical<br>\nproperties like balanced begin-comment end-comment symbols or balanced<br>\ncartouches.</p>",

I have to type \"\\cancel&lt;tab&gt;\\open&lt;tab&gt;\" at the<br>\nbeginning, and \"\\close&lt;tab&gt;\" at the end of the comment. These are 14<br>\nkeystrokes compared to 4 keystrokes for (**).
