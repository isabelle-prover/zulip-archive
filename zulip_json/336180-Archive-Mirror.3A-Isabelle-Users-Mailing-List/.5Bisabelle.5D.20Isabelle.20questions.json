But I stunk when I realized the size of trouble it would become, becouse I must create some genniously way to structuraly represent this (I can give more details if asked).So I change quest to something easier. My task is now to prove a simple property of proposicional logic:Any meta-formula has one or any negation(s) in front of it. I mean, ~~~~P is equivalent to P. The simplicity is rouge, saw if there's 2-multiple negations in front of a formula so there is no negations before it, else there is one.The problem: the prove must be completely structural, I have to use induction, and no numbers must be involved.A had many ideas, but any of them corresponding with I really want (if somebody shows intersted I shall give more details).Problem 2:I have some theory, then I need to add Main to fild \"imports\" of my theory, but when I apply it some unespected troubles begin to appear, and I don't know why!Fallow the link with my theory.http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/21934/Lucas Cavalcante</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Obtenha o novo Windows Live Messenger!<br>\n<a href=\"http://get.live.com/messenger/overview\">http://get.live.com/messenger/overview</a></p>",
