If so, please direct me to it<br>\nand I'll post this there.</p>\n<p>When cloning the Isabelle bitbucket repo and attempting to use it as per<br>\nREADME_REPOSITORY, it doesn't work if your working directory is in an<br>\nencrypted mount. I get the attached results. Somewhere in the mess of<br>\nerror output is \"File name too long.\" I've seen this issue before with<br>\nanother tool that was generating temporary files in my (encrypted) home<br>\ndirectory. The standard Ubuntu home encryption setup stores per-file<br>\nmetadata in your home directory in a path derived by extending the name<br>\nof the original file. If the original filename is quite long, extending<br>\nit will exceed the limits of the underlying file system. I believe<br>\nthat's what is happening here.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to resolve this issue in the repository?</p>\n<p>OS: Ubuntu 12.04<br>\nuname -r: 3.2.0-35-generic<br>\nhg id: c633700b2d9f</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nMatt</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
