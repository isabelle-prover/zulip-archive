Isabelle in my<br>\ngraduate course this fall.  We will be using the tutorial book on<br>\nIsabelle 2002 (Springer).  I have seen there is an updated tutorial<br>\nonline, but I have already committed to having students buy the Springer<br>\nbook.  I would like to know whether it is recommended to use Isabelle<br>\n2002 to go along with this tutorial, or a more recent Isabelle.<br>\nApologies if this question is addressed somewhere on the Isabelle web<br>\nsite or in the documentation, but I could not find an answer after<br>\nlooking those places.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nAaron Stump</p>",

Thus it is probably better to use the old version. I <br>\nsuspect that for novices the lack of the new features is less crucial <br>\nthan for power users.</p>\n<p>Tobias</p>\n<p>Aaron Stump schrieb:</p>",
