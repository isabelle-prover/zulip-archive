GSoC provides funding for students to work<br>\n|  full-time on Isabelle during a three-month period from mid May<br>\n|  until mid August.  Besides earning up to 5.000 USD, students<br>\n|  completing their project will get a cool GSoC t-shirt.<br>\n|<br>\no  We are now looking for interested and motivated students willing<br>\n|  to spend their summer in improving Isabelle.  There is no<br>\n|  restriction on eligible students, except that they must be<br>\n|  enrolled in some university at April 25 (but see [1] for further<br>\n|  details).<br>\n|<br>\no  A list of suggested Isabelle project ideas can be found at:<br>\n|<br>\n|    <a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/gsoc-ideas.html\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/gsoc-ideas.html</a><br>\n|<br>\n|  Although we would really like to see these ideas implemented,<br>\n|  interested students are not bound to them.
