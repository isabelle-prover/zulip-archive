One is simply called \"Isabelle\" and<br>\nincludes \"simp\", \"blast\", \"auto\", \"fast\", \"best\", \"force\", \"fastforce\", \"meson\",<br>\n\"smt\" (with CVC3 and Z3), Sledgehammer (with E, SPASS, Vampire, and Z3), and<br>\nNitpick (for exhaustively checking finite problems) -- the last three tools are<br>\ninvoked without proof reconstruction. The second Isabelle version,<br>\n\"Isabelle-HOT\", is for demonstration only (i.e. it cannot get us a trophy): It<br>\nincludes LEO-II and Satallax as Sledgehammer backends.</p>\n<p>Congratulations Jasmin!<br>\nTobias</p>",
