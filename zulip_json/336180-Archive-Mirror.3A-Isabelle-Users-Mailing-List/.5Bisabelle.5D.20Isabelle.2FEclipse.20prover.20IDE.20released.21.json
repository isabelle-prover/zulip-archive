It started as a port of Isabelle/jEdit to integrate with<br>\nEclipse IDE. Today Isabelle/Eclipse is available as a standalone prover<br>\nIDE, as well as plug-ins for integration with Eclipse IDE of your choice.</p>\n<p>Learn more about Isabelle/Eclipse and download it from its website:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://andriusvelykis.github.io/isabelle-eclipse/\">http://andriusvelykis.github.io/isabelle-eclipse/</a></p>\n<p>In many ways Isabelle/Eclipse mirrors Isabelle/jEdit, but aims to provide<br>\nEclipse-native functionality to use Isabelle. The integration uses common<br>\nEclipse components to provide theory editing, correct symbols, completion<br>\nassistance, prover output and other features. By building on Eclipse it<br>\ninherits various IDE goodies out of the box. Learn more about<br>\nIsabelle/Eclipse features on the website. Check out the list of closed<br>\nissues to see what has been implemented and fixed in this release:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://github.com/andriusvelykis/isabelle-eclipse/issues?state=closed\">http://github.com/andriusvelykis/isabelle-eclipse/issues?state=closed</a></p>\n<p>Before you start Isabelle/Eclipse, I advise reading the \"Getting started\"<br>\npage on the website. Also make sure you are using Java 7 and Isabelle 2013.</p>\n<h1>Reporting issues &amp; contributing</h1>\n<p>Note that Isabelle/Eclipse still has several known issues, notably no<br>\nsupport for sub/super-script, bold and other control symbols, as well as<br>\nlack of nice UI to configure certain Isabelle options. You can view all<br>\nopen issues for Isabelle/Eclipse here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://github.com/andriusvelykis/isabelle-eclipse/issues?state=open\">http://github.com/andriusvelykis/isabelle-eclipse/issues?state=open</a></p>\n<p>Please report any bugs, feature requests, questions and other issues you<br>\nencounter using the link above - I will appreciate your input!</p>\n<p>Isabelle/Eclipse is open-source and the source code is available on GitHub:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://github.com/andriusvelykis/isabelle-eclipse\">http://github.com/andriusvelykis/isabelle-eclipse</a></p>\n<p>I welcome all contributions and help - if you see an open issue that you<br>\nwant to hack at, feel free to!</p>\n<p>Isabelle/Eclipse started as an attempt to get Isabelle working from within<br>\nEclipse IDE. There are a number of formal methods tools building on the<br>\nEclipse platform and I hope that Isabelle/Eclipse will be useful to<br>\nintegrate them with the Isabelle theorem prover.</p>\n<p>Great thanks to Makarius for his assistance, input and all the work on<br>\nIsabelle and Isabelle/Scala.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nAndrius Velykis<br>\nNewcastle University / AI4FM project<br>\n<a href=\"http://andrius.velykis.lt\">http://andrius.velykis.lt</a></p>",

The 32/64 bit<br>\ndifference is at the end of the file name, see:<br>\nisabelle-eclipse-ide-1.2.0-win32.win32.x86_64.zip.
