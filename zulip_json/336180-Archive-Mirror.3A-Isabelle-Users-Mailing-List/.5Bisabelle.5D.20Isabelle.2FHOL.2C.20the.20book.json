However, as it's a bit expansive (my  <br>\naverage price range for books is in €15 to €25), I would like to know  <br>\nabout its content before any attempt to get it. I clicked on the cover  <br>\npicture as it says “Click to look inside”, but nothing happened (no  <br>\npreview).</p>\n<p>So I would like to know if someone here already get that book and if it's  <br>\nworth the price.</p>\n<p>Thanks for any advices.</p>\n<p>P.S. As a question aside, if there are exclusive contents in this book, is  <br>\nthere an electronic version planned? (may be an electronic version would  <br>\nbe more affordable and I'm planning to get an ebook reader sooner of later  <br>\nthis year).</p>",
