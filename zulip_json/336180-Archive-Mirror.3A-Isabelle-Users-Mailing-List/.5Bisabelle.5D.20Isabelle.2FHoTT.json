HoTT uses all CIC, but UniMath, which was Voevodsky’s approach, only uses the Martin-Lof part of CIC and they avoid, as an informal convention among users, the problematic parts of CIC according to Voevodsky’s system.</p>\n<p>Voevodsky said in an interview (available in his website) that he learned Isabelle very quickly, but he experienced a very hard time with Coq. Why he used Coq in place of Isabelle? Maybe Voevodsky did not know about the existence of Isabelle/CTT and he used Coq as a temporary solution for his UniMath library. Anyway, Voevodsky’s main contribution to the foundations of mathematics, the so-called synthetic homotopy, is independent of Coq in the same sense that Euclidean Geometry is independent of Coq.</p>\n<p>Jose M.</p>",
