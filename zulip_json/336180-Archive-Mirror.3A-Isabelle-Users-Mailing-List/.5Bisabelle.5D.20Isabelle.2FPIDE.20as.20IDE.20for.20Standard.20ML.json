It could help the <br>\ngeneral cause of Standard ML (the best unknown programming language in the <br>\nworld) and in particular Poly/ML (the best unknown implementation of SML).</p>\n<p>Here is the corresponding entry on my new website/blog:<br>\n<a href=\"http://sketis.net/?p=103\">http://sketis.net/?p=103</a></p>\n<p>This is a permanent link that can be used elsewhere, despite the slightly <br>\nodd name, which is normal in WordPress, I think.  Of course, enthusiastic <br>\nusers are encouraged to publish their own texts about the SML IDE.</p>\n<p>My blog mentions a sister entry on Stackoverflow: <br>\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2036744/ml-ide-and-compiler-for-windows-or-linux-or-mac\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2036744/ml-ide-and-compiler-for-windows-or-linux-or-mac</a></p>\n<p>I don't want to bribe anybody, but maybe we could collect a few more votes <br>\nfor that article so that it is higher ranked.  This is relevant, because <br>\nGoogle presently places it first for a query like \"SML IDE\".</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"http://stop-ttip.org\">http://stop-ttip.org</a>  906,830 people so far</p>\n<hr>",
