Current Isabelle2015-RC2 has a bit of folding support, <br>\naccording to Isar proof structure (although I need to look at once again <br>\nbefore the release really happens).</p>\n<p>jEdit has its own built-in mechanisms for plain text indentation: it <br>\nsupports theory editing to a limited extent. I usually do most of it <br>\nmanually by the convenient shift/indent operations, e.g. see \"Tabbing and <br>\nIndentation\" in the original jEdit User's guide in our Documentation <br>\npanel.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
