It would be better to throw out all mutable state, <br>\nthreads and locks, but that is not realistic right now.</p>\n<p>I guess that the same problem is behind other obscure deadlocks that were <br>\noccasionally seen in the past few months on isabelle-dev.</p>\n<p>I've reworked this now in <br>\n<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/commits/4f72b00d9952\">https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/commits/4f72b00d9952</a> <br>\nso it should work better in the next release candidate.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
