When I close Isabelle/jEdit with a number of unsaved theory files, I get a popup <br>\nthat asks me which of those I want to save. Then, I first select a subset of the files to <br>\nbe safed and click on \"safe selected\" and they disappear from the list. Unfortunately, <br>\nthere is immediately a new popup that asks me whether I want to load the theories that I <br>\nhave just eliminated from the list. To me, this popup is bogus, because I am trying to <br>\nshutdown jEdit and therefore do not want to load any theories. I just want to continue to <br>\nsave or discard my changes. Instead, I have to get rid of this popup first. It would be <br>\ngreat if this popup does not show up in the next release.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
