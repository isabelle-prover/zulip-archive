The Output <br>\nwindow uses a relatively modest HTML component that lacks search <br>\nfacilities.  What I usually do in such situations is to copy-paste the <br>\ntext into a regular jEdit buffer and then use the existing tools of the <br>\neditor for that. (Conceptually, Isabelle/Scala makes sure that text is <br>\nrepresented natively according to the underlying platform, here it is <br>\nUTF-16 on JVM.  So it can be moved back and forth both on the JVM and wrt. <br>\nother applications via the system clipboard.)</p>\n<p>Note that copy-paste of HTML Output works via very basic mouse and <br>\nkeyboard operations (with plain C-c), not the jEdit vocabulary that is a <br>\nbit more advanced.</p>\n<p>Anyway, lets hope that Larry Ellison will deliver JavaFx 2.x/3.x for Linux <br>\nand Mac OS X as promised.  Then the Output window can be made a <br>\nfully-featured HTML5 Webkit browser with all the expected functionality <br>\n(including video streaming within printed lambda terms :-).</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
