This is <br>\nalso the case for the official Isabelle2013 and so frequent that I can <br>\nno longer use jEdit for proper developments (or to be more precise, I <br>\nhave to switch to a different window manager - that has a lot of other <br>\nissues - to do Isabelle stuff).</p>\n<p>Just out of curiosity: Is there anybody else who can reproduce this issue?</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",
