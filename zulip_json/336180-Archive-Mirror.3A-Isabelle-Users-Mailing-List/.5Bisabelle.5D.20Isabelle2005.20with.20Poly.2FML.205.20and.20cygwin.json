And really, I was<br>\nable to install it with little effort under cygwin.</p>\n<p>Now I'm trying to use it together with Isabelle2005. But there seem to<br>\nbe compatibility issues between Poly/ML 5 and Isabelle2005. I don't<br>\nunderstand the interaction between Isabelle and Poly/ML in detail, but<br>\nfor example Poly/ML 5 seems to not use `data bases' any more (at least<br>\nI didn't find a word about them and how to get ML_dbase in the<br>\nannouncement). Nevertheless, David wrote on his web page that Makarius<br>\nwas able to run Isabelle with Poly/ML 5 after some bug fixes. I guess<br>\nthat these bug fixes have been applied to the development version of<br>\nIsabelle. Does anybody know, if a backport of these fixes to<br>\nIsabelle2005 is feasible?</p>\n<p>Best Regards,</p>",

The next official Isabelle release will <br>\ncertainly support Poly/ML 5.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
