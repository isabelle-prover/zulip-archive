You can <br>\nuse the same one for Isabelle2008 and Isabelle2009, which is still 3.7.1 <br>\nas offered on the Isabelle2009 download site.  Thus the explanations on <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/installation.html\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/installation.html</a> also apply, as far as Emacs is <br>\nconcerned.</p>\n<p>XEmacs is a dying platform, but some versions on some platforms still <br>\nhappen to work with PG 3.7.1.  E.g. XEmacs 21.4.20 or similar, but only on <br>\nLinux.  There are many problems on Mac OS and Cygwin.</p>\n<p>GNU Emacs 22 usually works best.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
