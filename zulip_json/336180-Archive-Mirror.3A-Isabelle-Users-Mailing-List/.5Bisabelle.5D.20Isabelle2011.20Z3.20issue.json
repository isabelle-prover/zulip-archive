Unfortunately, we just found that for some theories, the Z3 problem preparation last \"forever\" and uses a lot of CPU.</p>\n<p>So if you notice that after calling Sledgehammer you get no report from \"z3\" or \"remote_z3\" and the \"poly\" process takes 100% CPU, you might be a victim of this problem. Workaround: Decrease the monomorphization limit by adding</p>\n<p>declare [[smt_monomorph_limit = 2]]</p>\n<p>or even \"= 1\" at the beginning of your theory (or in an included theory), or disable Z3 by adding</p>\n<p>sledgehammer_params [provers = e spass remote_vampire remote_sine_e]</p>\n<p>(or whatever values make sense to you). Invoking Sledgehammer in synchronous mode, using</p>\n<p>sledgehammer [blocking]</p>\n<p>or (to change the default)</p>\n<p>sledgehammer_params [blocking]</p>\n<p>should also do the trick.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry for the trouble caused by this issue. Strangely enough, we never had any problems with the 1500 goals from nine theories we used for testing, including the largish Jinja.</p>\n<p>If you work with the repository version, expect a fix in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
