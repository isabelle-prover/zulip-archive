Everything works fine<br>\n(it is quite fast, indeed) up to<br>\nProof General behavior<br>\n(at least to my expectations). The usual locked processed region is now with<br>\na very faint blue (not the<br>\nusual classic one), which for me is almost impossible to see. Now we have a<br>\n(kind of)<br>\nblack cursor at the left of the<br>\nwindow showing the next part of the buffer to be processed (?).</p>\n<p>At the beginning I thought it was something to do with PG 4.1, but when I<br>\nuse Isabelle2009-2 with PG 4.1,  that<br>\nlovely stronger blue is back.</p>\n<p>Can anybody help me to get back that good-old fashioned PG stronger blue<br>\nwhen using Isabelle2011?<br>\nIt is so catchy, at least for me, and without it ,the whole experience<br>\nbecomes very questionable :-).</p>\n<p>Thanks anyway!</p>\n<p>PS: I expect it to be something very simple and almost silly.</p>",
