Release candidate #1 is now available here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2012-RC1\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2012-RC1</a></p>\n<p>Some parts of the website are not finished yet, notably the announcement with list of main novelties, but NEWS is already in shape -- with a bit more than 1000 lines of user-relevant changes.<br>\n[...]<br>\nPlease try it on your machine, and report any problems either on the mailing list or to me personally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I tried Nitpick and Sledgehammer on Mac OS X 10.6 and a Windows XP VirtualBox. On Mac OS X, everything went with both PIDE and PG. The only slightly strange thing I noticed is that one needs to click the \"Update\" button explicitly to get the right output for \"ML {* ... *}\" commands.</p>\n<p>On Win XP, I first got the error: \"Failed to start Isabelle process\". The error message started with \"perl 3396! _pinfo::dup_proc_pipe: DuplicateHandle failed\". The second time around it worked, but when I tried Sledgehammer on a very easy goal E just timed out. Sometimes clicking the Isabelle icon pops up the Isabelle splash screen and then just silently dies. All these issues appear to be due to some low-level system failure, probably related to the little resources allocated to that VirtualBox installation.</p>\n<p>For the record: I tried with \"overlord\" on; then the first line in \"~/.isabelle/Isabelle2012-RC1/prob_e_1\" gives the exact command line. I copy pasted it into a Cygwin terminal and it worked perfectly well (i.e. E output a proof ending with \"SZS output end CNFRefutation\").</p>\n<p>I hope somebody else with a (perhaps more modern) Windows installation can check whether E works. The simple property I tried is</p>\n<p>lemma \"hd [a] = hd [b] ==&gt; a = b\"<br>\n    sledgehammer</p>\n<p>and a proof should be found very quickly by all available provers (E, SPASS, remote Vampire, remote E-SInE).</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
