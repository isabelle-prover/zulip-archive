Here we are essentially gambling<br>\nto have it work by accident for the majority of users: binaries are <br>\ncompiled on some Linux system that is neither too new nor too old.</p>\n<p>For Isabelle2012 that was Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, from April 2010.  According to <br>\nwikipedia, CentOS 5.4 from 2009, so it is plausible that it provides an <br>\nolder libc that does not work with our binaries.</p>\n<p>See also <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/Isabelle2012/Admin/PLATFORMS\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/Isabelle2012/Admin/PLATFORMS</a> <br>\nfor the internal explanations how Isabelle distributions are made as <br>\nplatform-independent as possible.</p>\n<p>Of course, you could try to recompile binaries that we ship, but that will <br>\ntake a lot of time to reconstruct.  It is easier to install a more recent <br>\nLinux, such as Ubuntu 12.04.1 or anything else in the 2011-2012 range.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
