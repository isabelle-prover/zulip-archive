Before actual <br>\nlift-off we have approx. 5 weeks of public testing of release candidates.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release\">https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release</a> for the main <br>\nwebsite where this is organized.  There is also a link to an issue tracker on <br>\nthe same Bitbucket site.</p>\n<p>The website with downloads etc. is <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013-1-RC1\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013-1-RC1</a></p>\n<p>Observations from testing release candidates may be discussed here on <br>\nisabelle-users (not isabelle-dev), on the bitbucket tracker, or via private <br>\nmail.</p>\n<p>Active participation in testing is important to iron out small problems, <br>\nand raise the overall quality of the system for everybody. There is a <br>\nparticular challenge to make all platforms work smoothly: Linux, Windows, <br>\nMac OS X.  The Isabelle quality standards and user expectations have <br>\ncontinously increased in recent years, while all major operating system <br>\nvendors and distributors are on a slight downwards curve.</p>\n<p>The time to sort out issues is now.  Note that I will myself be on <br>\nvacation from 17-Oct to 04-Nov and make the final launch afterwards.  In <br>\nthe meantime we have time for 2-3 release candidates.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
