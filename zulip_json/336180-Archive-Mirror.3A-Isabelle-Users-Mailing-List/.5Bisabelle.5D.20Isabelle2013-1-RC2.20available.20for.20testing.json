(Why is \"elim\" typeset as <br>\nit is? Should this refer to the name of the fact, or the \"elim\" attribute?)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the example lemma, how about the more \"canonical\"</p>\n<p>lemma<br>\n   assumes \"list_to_option xs = y\"<br>\n   shows \"P\"<br>\n using assms<br>\n proof (rule list_to_option.elims)<br>\n   fix x<br>\n   assume \"xs = [x]\" and \"y = Some x\"<br>\n   then show \"P\" sorry<br>\n next<br>\n   assume \"xs = []\" and \"y = None\"<br>\n   then show \"P\" sorry<br>\n next<br>\n   fix a b xs'<br>\n   assume \"xs = a # b # xs'\" and \"y = None\"<br>\n   then show \"P\" sorry<br>\n qed</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>instead of using the old-school \"erule\"?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In general, why is the name \"f.elims\" (rather than \"f.elim\")? Won't <br>\nthis be a single rule in most cases? Only for mutually recursive <br>\nfunctions there are more? Or do I miss something? (Sorry if this was <br>\ndiscussed before.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Btw: A few words on what happens for mutually recursive functions <br>\nmight be helpful (e.g., with the \"standard\" definition of \"even\"/\"odd\" I <br>\nend up with 3 rules in each of \"even.elims\" and \"odd.elims\").</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",

Isabelle2013-1-RC1:</p>\n<p>* Explicit binary executable even for Linux -- modern desktops no longer<br>\n     consider an executable script as executable to be clicked on.</p>\n<p>* Mac OS X Snow Leopard is de-facto discontinued.  Normally we support<br>\n     the 3 latest Mac OS X versions, and Mavericks is not available yet,<br>\n     but current versions of Java 7 and jEdit appear to have fundamental<br>\n     problems with this old operating system that Oracle never intended to<br>\n     support in the first place.</p>\n<p>* Various re-adjustments in the dynamics of Sledgehammer, both the<br>\n     implicit \"auto\" mode and the explicit GUI panel.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release\">https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release</a> for the <br>\nmain website where the final stage before Isabelle2013-1 is organized. <br>\nThere is also a link to an issue tracker on the same Bitbucket site.</p>\n<p>Observations from testing release candidates may be discussed here on <br>\nisabelle-users (not isabelle-dev), on the bitbucket tracker, or via <br>\nprivate mail.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
