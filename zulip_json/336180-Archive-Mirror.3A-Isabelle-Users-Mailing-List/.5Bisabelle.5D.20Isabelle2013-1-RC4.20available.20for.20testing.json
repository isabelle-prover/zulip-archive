Isabelle2013-1-RC3:</p>\n<p>* Minimal tuning of Isabelle/HOL library and tools.</p>\n<p>* Minimal tuning of some Isabelle/jEdit GUI aspects.</p>\n<p>* More documentation for Isabelle/jEdit (25 pages manual).</p>\n<p>* Proper join of forked diagnostic commands in Proof General theory<br>\n     loader.</p>\n<p>* Update to Poly/ML 5.5.1 with commits 1869 (fix two optimiser bugs) and<br>\n     1875 (allow IO request of zero characters).</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release\">https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release</a> for the main <br>\nwebsite where the final stage before Isabelle2013-1 is organized. There is also <br>\na link to an issue tracker on the same Bitbucket site.</p>\n<p>Observations from testing release candidates may be discussed here on <br>\nisabelle-users (not isabelle-dev), on the bitbucket tracker, or via private <br>\nmail.</p>\n<p>It only makes sense to test the <em>latest</em> release candidate.  People who <br>\nhave provided some form of feedback should update and check how that <br>\naspect is now treated -- sometimes a last-minute attempt to improve things <br>\nactually goes into the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>Major operating system vendors have now released their latest versions as <br>\nwell: Ubuntu 13.10, Windows 8.1, Mac OS X 10.9.  So this is an opportunity <br>\nto see that everything fits nicely together.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

Can you give it a quick try?  You know how to work with <br>\nrepository versions.</p>\n<p>The documentation for the change is like this:</p>\n<p>\\item The system option @{system_option<br>\n   jedit_completion_dismiss_delay} determines an additional delay (0.0<br>\n   by default), before dismissing an earlier completion popup.  A value<br>\n   like 0.1 is occasionally useful to reduce the chance of loosing key<br>\n   strokes when the speed of typing exceeds that of repainting GUI<br>\n   components.</p>\n<p>My impression is that Linux users who type very quickly are apt to see the <br>\nproblem with some probability.  On Windows, the Java GUI performance is <br>\nmuch better, but I've seen the same when running a remote Windows session <br>\nover a slow connection.</p>\n<p>The next time I pass by the completion mechanisms, I will remove any <br>\nattempts to do a GUI focus change.  After studying the AWT/Swing <br>\ndocumentation and sources quite some time, I came to the conclusion that <br>\nthis is inherently difficult to get right, despite some explicit <br>\nmechanisms to queue/dequeue \"typeahead key events\" in the AWT event <br>\nhandler.</p>\n<p>What I actually wanted to do last summer was to provide context-sensitive <br>\ncompletion, based on information provided by the prover.  Then I got stuck <br>\nwith many such GUI issues, and these timing problems are just the last <br>\nbits of it.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

The problem is <br>\nthat \"type-ahead\" buffering only works for one new GUI component at a <br>\ntime.  The Isabelle/jEdit can open and close many of them in a row rather <br>\nquickly.  Thus queue events may get redirected to already closed popups.</p>\n<p>This is why I've added jedit_completion_dismiss_delay right after <br>\nIsabelle2013-1-RC4.</p>\n<p>I am merely waiting for at least one guy who types very fast to confirm <br>\nthat jedit_completion_dismiss_delay=0.1 prevents the problem most of the <br>\ntime.
