Isabelle2013-1, which means <br>\neverybody who is already on the latest release can try out the new release <br>\ncandidate without any extra efforts.</p>\n<p>Ongoing changes were motivated by a really stable release of <br>\nIsabelle/jEdit, but such delicate details of Isabelle command execution <br>\ncan also affect TTY and Proof General.  I've have made some basic tests of <br>\nthe latter, but have problems recalling how manual script management used <br>\nto work.</p>\n<p>Observations from testing release candidates may be discussed here on <br>\nisabelle-users (not isabelle-dev), on the bitbucket tracker <br>\n<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/issues\">https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/issues</a> or via <br>\nprivate mail.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

So the situation is greatly improved compared to RC1. <br>\nI then waited for about 5 minutes without any change, then after <br>\nremoving the non-terminating command it required waiting about 2 minutes <br>\nuntil the command was finally interrupted and interaction came back.</p>\n<p>Best<br>\n      Benedikt</p>\n<p>P.s. This isn't a regression but when hovering over items in the <br>\nSidekick panel the height of the status bar changes and causes half of <br>\nthe UI to 'jump' around.</p>",

And <br>\nhopefully, there is not another serious problem waiting at the bottom of <br>\nit.</p>\n<p>I've experimented myself a bit with (intro TrueE): after several seconds, <br>\nwhen the process exceeds 1-2 GB heap size, it takes really long to react <br>\non interrupts.  This is probably due to garbage collection and value <br>\nsharing of Poly/ML, trying to catch up with this non-terminating <br>\nallocation process.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

I have to click on another row,  <br>\nthen click on the former again. I guess that's because jEdit can't know if  <br>\nthe document is still opened, and probably it supposes it still is, and in  <br>\nsuch a case, a click on the row which is already selected, is probably  <br>\nsupposed to result into the document opened twice. So, may be an option  <br>\ncould be to be able to reopen a document whose row is already selected,  <br>\nwith a double‑click, instead of a single‑click (and to keep the  <br>\nsingle‑click to open a document whose row is not selected).</p>\n<p>Note: I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32 bits, if ever that matters and as I  <br>\ndon't know if the behaviour I described above occurs on all platforms.</p>",
