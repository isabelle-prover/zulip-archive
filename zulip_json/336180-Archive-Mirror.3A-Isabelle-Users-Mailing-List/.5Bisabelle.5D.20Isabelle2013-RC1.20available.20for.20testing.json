For example, if I type \\&lt;ta I get the only hint for the greek letter \\&lt;tau&gt;. <br>\nIt used to be that if I pressed enter at this point it was interpreted as selection and the text \\&lt;ta was replaced by the full text \\&lt;tau&gt;in the source. Now jedit just puts the cursor in the new line. To select \\&lt;tau&gt; I have to point and click the mouse.<br>\nSimilarly, if I type \\&lt;in I get a couple of possibilities. If I point the cursor (with arrows on the keyboard) to the symbol \\&lt;in&gt; and press enter, again this just puts me in the new line instead of selecting \\&lt;in&gt;. I would prefer not to have to switch between keyboard and mouse every time I want to select a symbol from the hints.

E.g. <br>\nwhen you type \"fix x :: nat\" or \"foo:\" and then press RETURN.</p>\n<p>Moreover the popup passes almost all key strokes back to the main editor <br>\nwindow, so it should get in the way much less than before.</p>\n<p>Since the timing is also much more aggressive by default, it could break <br>\ndown, loosing focus or whatever.  So frequent users should keep an eye on <br>\nit, to see if it behaves badly.  Often the problem is one of the <br>\nunderlying platform or the platform look-and-feel of Java/Swing.
