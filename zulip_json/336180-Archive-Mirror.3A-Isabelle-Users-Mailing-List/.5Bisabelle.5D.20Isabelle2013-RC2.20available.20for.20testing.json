Avast did not find<br>\nany problem with the following<br>\nprogram:</p>\n<p>C:\\Isabelle2013-RC1\\contrib\\cygwin\\bin\\peflags.exe</p>\n<p>2) Avast it is however still very suspicious (considering them of low<br>\nreputation) with these ones, allowing<br>\nthem to execute in sandbox mode though (after scrutinizing each file for<br>\nabout half a minute):</p>\n<p>C:\\Isabelle2013-RC1\\Isabelle2013.exe<br>\nC:\\Users\\AlfioMartini\\Isabelle2013-RC2\\contrib\\polyml-5.5.0-3\\x86-cygwin\\poly.exe<br>\nC:\\Users\\AlfioMartini\\Isabelle2013-RC2\\contrib\\exec_process-1.0.3\\x86-cygwin\\exec_process.exe</p>\n<p>3) Old style of processing documents (via IsaMakefiles) is now working<br>\nagain in this version (see image<br>\nattached)</p>\n<p>4) Executing</p>\n<p>isabelle build -o document=pdf -g doc</p>\n<p>still shows the error when compiling the \"Programming and Proving\"<br>\ntutorial. Maybe the LaTeX setup<br>\nshould be updated to include the package \"eulervm.sty\" or, as you suggest<br>\nin a previous e-mail,<br>\nthat this package should not be used (or something else be used in its<br>\nplace). See image attached.</p>\n<p>5) Most important, those ambiguous and strange error messages (as discussed<br>\nin another live<br>\nthread) in the output window are<br>\nstill present.

If I run 24 ATPs <br>\ntogether, then it seems to cause some of the ATPs to time out or <br>\nterminate when they otherwise wouldn't, but they terminate in a normal <br>\nmanner by returning an error message.</p>\n<p>Getting analytical about the output panel, I'd say there are two types <br>\nof information, primary information and secondary information.</p>\n<p>With Sledgehammer set for a 60 second timeout, the output is always <br>\ngoing to be primary information, meaning that I'm always going to want <br>\nto look at the output from the time I start the command until the <br>\ncommand finishes.</p>\n<p>It turns out that I've switched today to using the tooltip window to <br>\nlook at the Sledgehammer window, since it doesn't get overwritten with <br>\nnew data while Sledgehammer is running.</p>\n<p>The cycle is something like this:</p>\n<p>1) Start Sledgehammer.</p>\n<p>2) Hover over \"sledgehammer\".</p>\n<p>3) When the tooltip window pops up, click on the \"Detach tooltip window\" <br>\nicon so that it's a normal window and doesn't disappear if I click <br>\nsomewhere else.</p>\n<p>4) Scroll to the bottom to see if there's any new output there to think <br>\nabout, and maybe go ahead and click on a proof to insert it and <br>\nterminate Sledgehammer.</p>\n<p>5) Close the window.</p>\n<p>6) Loop through items 2 through 5 until sledgehammer finishes, and then <br>\ndo it one last time.</p>\n<p>So, I use whatever features are there to be used. If the output panel <br>\nwent away, I obviously wouldn't use it.</p>\n<p>But some information you want to look at a lot, and some information you <br>\nonly want to look at on an as need basis.

Next release ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wow, great! :) I was wishing this. Before I came to Isabelle, at the time  <br>\nI didn't knew any prover system, I tried to imagine such things, and in my  <br>\nmind, this was always coming with this: “if it automate some proof or  <br>\nproof step, the user should be able to learn what the steps was, it should  <br>\nbe visible in some way”. That's important, as the matter, I feel, is not  <br>\nonly about the prover understanding a proof, but also about the human  <br>\nauthor and human reader, understanding it too.</p>\n<p>Many thanks for the great point!</p>",

Fully automated <br>\nreasoning is used in different spots.</p>\n<p>Until proper IDE feedback for \"rule\" steps arrives you can use rule_trace <br>\nas crude approximation:</p>\n<p>notepad<br>\nbegin<br>\n   note [[rule_trace]]</p>\n<p>have \"A ∧ B\"<br>\n   proof  -- trace<br>\n     show A sorry<br>\n     show B sorry<br>\n   qed</p>\n<p>from <code>A ∧ B</code> obtain A and B ..-- trace</p>\n<p>end</p>\n<p>This gives you the unfiltered uninstantiated candiates that the method <br>\nguesses from the situation.</p>\n<p>(In Isabelle2012 the trace output needs to be enabled by the check-box in <br>\nthe output panel; in Isabelle2013 it is always there.)</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
