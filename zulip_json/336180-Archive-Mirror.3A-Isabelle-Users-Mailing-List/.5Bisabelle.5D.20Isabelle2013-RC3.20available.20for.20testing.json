I normally capture Java VM error output from the terminal, which <br>\nwould mean Cygwin-Terminal for you and the command \"isabelle jedit\".</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can try the jEdit menu \"Utilities / Troubleshooting / <br>\nActivity Log\".

There is also a link to an issue tracker on <br>\nthe same Bitbucket site.</p>\n<p>The main Isabelle2013-RC3 download page is <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013-RC3\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2013-RC3</a></p>\n<p>* Windows users: please check again that it all works.  Former problems<br>\n     with Cygwin file permissions should no longer happen.</p>\n<p>* Mac OS X users: please check if you can quit Isabelle/jEdit properly.<br>\n     There is now a handler for COMMAND-Q according to Apple, but it might<br>\n     be in conflict with Oracle.</p>\n<p>* Everybody: please check if you can scale the Isabelle/jEdit font-size<br>\n     up and down like in Firefox (C-PLUS/MINUS or C-ADD/SUBTRACT on the<br>\n     keypad).</p>\n<p>Observations from testing release candidates may be discussed here on <br>\nisabelle-users, on the bitbucket tracker, or via private mail.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
