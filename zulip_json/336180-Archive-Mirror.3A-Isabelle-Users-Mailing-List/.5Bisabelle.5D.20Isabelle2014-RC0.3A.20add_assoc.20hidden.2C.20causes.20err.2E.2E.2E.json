So, what's in <br>\nNEWS about \"add.assoc\" wouldn't have meant anything to me without a <br>\nlittle help about this.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I kind of understanding the use of class with class, and that <br>\nclass is a locale, and the use of locale with locale, but I haven't <br>\nunderstood the mixing of \"locale\" with \"class\" in Groups.thy, so if I <br>\nget a chance to work through Groups.thy, it could be I'll understand it <br>\nbetter with this knowledge.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nGB</p>",
