People who have reported anything for previous release <br>\ncandiates should check again if the situation has indeed improved.</p>\n<p>Ambitious users may already start updating their existing applications to <br>\nwork with Isabelle2014-RC2 -- it should be hardly distinguishable from <br>\nfinal Isabelle2014.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

I cleared them manually until all error markers were <br>\ngone. Then when I restarted Isabelle/jEdit I got more error markers of <br>\nthe same kind, cleared them again manually until all were gone.

I could enable it by moving my settings manually but the GUI <br>\nsupport to changing this setting seems to be gone, at least I couldn't <br>\nfind it any more.</p>\n<p>Best<br>\n     Benedikt</p>",
