Also the wmname trick as e.g. mentioned in</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2013-December/msg00175.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2013-December/msg00175.html</a></p>\n<p>does not help anymore.</p>\n<p>To be more precise (I'm on Fedora 20 x86_64 with Gnome): When I start <br>\nIsabelle/jEdit  for the first time its window does not use the full <br>\nscreen size (at this point menus and C-hover still works). So I usually <br>\ndouble-click on the title bar in order to make the window as big as the <br>\nscreen. After that the mouse-pointer has an offset for all menus (i.e., <br>\nI have to point somewhat lower and more to the right of the screen in <br>\norder to \"hit\" with the mouse). That alone would not be so bad. But also <br>\nnow C-hover does not work anymore. More specifically, the word I point <br>\nat is still highlighted by a gray rectangle, as usual, but no popup <br>\nshows up.</p>\n<p>With Isabelle2013-2 this issue does not occur (after using the wmname <br>\ntrick). I did not check with RC1 or RC2 since I did not have them <br>\nreadily available on my machine.</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",
