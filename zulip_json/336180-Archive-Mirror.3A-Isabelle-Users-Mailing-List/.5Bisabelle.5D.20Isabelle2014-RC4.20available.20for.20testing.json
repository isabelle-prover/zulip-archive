See:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2014-RC4\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2014-RC4</a></p>\n<p>Notable changes to Isabelle2014-RC3:</p>\n<p>* Update to latest jdk-7u67</p>\n<p>Oracle says: \"This release addresses a regression introduced in the<br>\n     most recent security update.\"</p>\n<p>* Update to recent Cygwin 1.7.31-3<br>\n     Corinna Vinschen says: \"This is another bugfix release to fix the<br>\n     bugfix release.\"</p>\n<p>* More convenient reports on low-level Isabelle/PIDE failures via Syslog<br>\n     panel, instead of awkward Raw Output panel.</p>\n<p>* More robust treatment of removed PIDE document versions (after 3 years<br>\n     of routine use).</p>\n<p>Observations and problems of release candidates may be discussed here on <br>\nisabelle-users (using an informative subject for the mail thread), or via <br>\nprivate mail to the person who is responsible (when that is obvious).</p>\n<p>The final release is will be published next week, before the end of the <br>\nmonth.  It will be really final: problems that are not reported now are <br>\ndoomed to remain.  This is the very last chance to participate in testing, <br>\nand thus improving the overall quality of the release.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
