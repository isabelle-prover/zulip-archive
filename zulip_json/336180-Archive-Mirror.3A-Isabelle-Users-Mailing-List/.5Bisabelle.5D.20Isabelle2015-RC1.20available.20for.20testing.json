This gives us several weeks for <br>\nthorough testing of at least 3 release candidates. To start this process <br>\nformally, Isabelle2015-RC1 is now available here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2015-RC1\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2015-RC1</a></p>\n<p>With ever increasing size and complexity of the system and its many add-on <br>\ntools, it is important to take testing of release candidates seriously. <br>\nProblems can be solved before the release, not after it!</p>\n<p>The main forum for discussion is here on isabelle-users, but it is also <br>\npossible to contact the person who is responsible for particular Isabelle <br>\ntools via private mail -- better than keeping potential problems private.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
