So <br>\nfar there were only minor issues, which indicates that really tough <br>\ntesting has not happened yet.</p>\n<p>The main forum for discussion is here on isabelle-users, but it is also <br>\npossible to contact the person who is responsible for particular Isabelle <br>\ntools via private mail -- better than keeping potential problems private. <br>\nWhen reporting problems, the subject line should be changed to something <br>\nmeaningful.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
