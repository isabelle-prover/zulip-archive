Sometimes, when changing<br>\nstuff in the middle of a theory, Isabelle starts reprocessing all loaded<br>\ntheories (everything becomes pink again).</p>\n<p>I observed this first when there where quite a numbers of failed proofs<br>\non the way to the position I changed. But I could also trigger this<br>\nbehavior if all proofs go through.</p>\n<p>This often happened shortly after I did a hypersearch over all open<br>\nbuffers while Isabelle was busy (but this observation might be<br>\nconfirmation-biased).</p>\n<p>-- Lars</p>",
