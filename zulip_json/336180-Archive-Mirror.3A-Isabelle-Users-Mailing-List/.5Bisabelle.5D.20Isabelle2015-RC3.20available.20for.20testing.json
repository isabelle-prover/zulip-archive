Now we’re back at 14 MB.</p>\n<p>I have prepared a new component and a corresponding change for “isabelle-release”. The binary comes from Mathias, but we haven’t tested the full loop yet.</p>\n<p>Mathias, now that the component is ready, could you apply the following change to your Isabelle (e.g. using “qimport” and “qpush” or even just modifying the two files manually or with the “patch” program)? Then the acid test in Isabelle is something like</p>\n<p>lemma “rev (rev xs) = xs”<br>\n    sledgehammer [cvc4, debug]</p>\n<p>Check that the minimizer starts with “Testing 1 fact”, not “Testing N facts” for some large N. If this works, please tell us so that Makarius can include the change to “isabelle-release”.</p>\n<p>Makarius, if you are impatient, you can try out the change yourself and tell us how that went.</p>\n<p>I’m sorry for the last-minute trouble with this. This won’t solve all the issues Alfio reported (I’ll come back to them later), but it will certainly give a boost to Sledgehammer on Windows.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/qU54x1uZZfXmsViHdk1cLiI0/new_cvc.export\">new_cvc.export</a></p>",
