While Sledgehammer was running the \"apply <br>\nauto\" or \"using\" right in front of it suddenly was underlined orange and <br>\na couple of \"ignoring duplicate rewrite rule\" warnings (listing local <br>\nfacts) popped up in the output. After Sledgehammer finished running the <br>\nwarning disappeared again.</p>\n<p>Another small focus problem which I find confusing: When the <br>\nSledgehammer panel isn't in focus you can mouse over a suggested proof <br>\nand it will be highlighted but when you click on it nothing happens <br>\nbesides switching focus.</p>\n<p>Best<br>\n     Benedikt</p>",
