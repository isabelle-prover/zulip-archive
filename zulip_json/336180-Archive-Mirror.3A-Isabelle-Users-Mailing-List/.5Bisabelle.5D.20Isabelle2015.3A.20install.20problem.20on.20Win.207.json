The <br>\nresult is stored in the USER_HOME environment variable in Cygwin notation, <br>\ne.g. /cygdrive/u/.isabelle/Isabelle2015 for the above.</p>\n<p>You can change that globally for all applications of your user account in <br>\nthe Windows Control Panel for \"Environment Variables\".

You can use any <br>\nother directory that you see fit, but note that it will be the location <br>\nfor \"~\" in Isabelle path specifications.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
