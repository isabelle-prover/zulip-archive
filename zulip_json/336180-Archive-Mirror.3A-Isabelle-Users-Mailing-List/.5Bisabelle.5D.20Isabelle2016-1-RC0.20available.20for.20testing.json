Here it is the<br>\nbacktracking from \"transfer\" to \"simp\", which is invoked afresh each<br>\ntime, with repeated reports. Thus the IDE is busy stacking up duplicate<br>\nmarkup trees, and reactivity of interrupts is generally delayed -- it<br>\nshould stop eventually, though.</p>\n<p>The same happens in Isabelle2016 already, and probably several earlier<br>\nreleases. It is unclear to me, why the problem has now more impact in<br>\npractice.</p>\n<p>Anyway, in changesets<br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/2efc128370fa\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/2efc128370fa</a> and<br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/681fae6b00b5\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/681fae6b00b5</a> I have<br>\nreworked that a bit to produce PIDE markup exactly once.</p>\n<p>This can be tried out with the nightly snapshot from<br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/devel\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/devel</a> (produced in approx. 2h when all works<br>\nwell).</p>\n<p>There will be also a formal release candidate Isabelle2016-1-RC1,<br>\nprobably within 24h.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

In particular, when I have a non-terminating proof command like</p>\n<p>subgoal by transfer simp</p>\n<p>and (due to some changes in the theory above) the proof loops, then I have found no way to <br>\ninterrupt the proof. Even when I delete the whole line, PolyML and the JVM keep running at <br>\n100% for minutes and I don't get any updates in the output or state buffer any more. I <br>\nreally have to shut down Isabelle/jEdit and restart to get back to work. This never <br>\nhappened to me with Isabelle2016 in the past six months.</p>\n<p>In the test, I ran Isabelle with the default settings on a quad core Intel from 4 years <br>\nago with 16GB of RAM under Ubuntu 14.04.</p>\n<p>Andreas</p>",

While this<br>\nimproves the workflow when typing, it complicates it when committing: it<br>\ntends to introduce trailing spaces.</p>\n<p>For example, when I finish a sub-proof like this:</p>\n<p>have \"...\" ...&lt;Enter&gt;<br>\n  &lt;Enter&gt;<br>\n  ...</p>\n<p>Now, the middle line contains two trailing spaces. This is mildly<br>\nannoying, because I want to avoid checking in trailing spaces into<br>\nversion control.</p>\n<p>The workaround I'm employing currently is the \"WhiteSpace\" plugin<br>\n(&lt;<a href=\"http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?WhiteSpace\">http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?WhiteSpace</a>&gt;) which allows to purge<br>\ntrailing spaces on save. It can also be configured to just show them and<br>\nnot purge them automatically.</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nLars</p>",

But I've <br>\nattached a small example that shows the problem. The lemma has a pointless assumption, but <br>\nthis is only to get the theorem sufficiently large such that transfer runs for a while</p>\n<p>As is, the proof of the lemma goes through, but if you delete the declaration of <br>\nmap_concat as a simp rule, then it will not, but keep running for quite some time (if your <br>\npatience is longer than mine, just add a few more universal quantifiers in the assumptions <br>\nof the lemma; the backtracking in transfer grows exponentially with the number of <br>\nquantifiers). What I then typically do is to change the non-terminating line of proof, <br>\nusually by adding a space somewhere in transfer (i.e., \"by tra nsfer simp\") or completely <br>\ndeleting it.</p>\n<p>But despite these changes, the proof method keeps running and Isabelle/jEdit does no <br>\nlonger update the Output and State panels any more.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/lYwORsnZrIBEnvhykwUQ_9jh/Scratch.thy\">Scratch.thy</a></p>",
