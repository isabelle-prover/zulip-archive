There's the general remark that setsum has been renamed to sum and that all <br>\ntheorems have changed their names accordingly. But a bit later, it says</p>\n<p>* The following theorems have been renamed:</p>\n<p>setsum_left_distrib ~&gt; setsum_distrib_right<br>\n     setsum_right_distrib ~&gt; setsum_distrib_left</p>\n<p>This is no longer up-to-date, because one has to apply the renaming of setsum to the <br>\nright-hand side again. I would find it less confusing if these lines were the following:</p>\n<p>* The following theorems have been renamed:</p>\n<p>setsum_left_distrib ~&gt; sum_distrib_right<br>\n     setsum_right_distrib ~&gt; sum_distrib_left</p>\n<p>Andreas</p>",
