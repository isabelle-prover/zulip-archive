It will lead to an overall improvement.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

This structure was<br>\nlost in a later (undocumented) experiment. The highlighting as<br>\n\"improper\" reverses that to some extent, although it would have been<br>\nbetter to remove that feature altogether.</p>\n<p>What is particularly bad about \"moreover then have\" is the implicit fork<br>\nof the flow of facts. I find it very hard to read and maintain such<br>\nproofs, so they are now formally marked as non-Isar. (The old experiment<br>\nto allow that intermittendly was based on the claim \"Isar allows<br>\narbitrarily bad proofs anyway\".)</p>\n<p>Isar is generally based on the principle \"structure emerges from taking<br>\narbitrariness away\". The brush-up of Isar 2016 was a good opportunity to<br>\nemphasize this principle again (and more).</p>\n<p>As usual, it might require some efforts to discontinue old habits, but<br>\nthe Isar 2016 style as a whole leads to better structured and more<br>\nconcise proofs in all examples that I have cleaned up recently.</p>\n<p>It might actually help to proceed under the assumption that Isar 2016 is<br>\na new proof language for Isabelle, not just 10-20 small add-ons and<br>\nreforms to the old one.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
