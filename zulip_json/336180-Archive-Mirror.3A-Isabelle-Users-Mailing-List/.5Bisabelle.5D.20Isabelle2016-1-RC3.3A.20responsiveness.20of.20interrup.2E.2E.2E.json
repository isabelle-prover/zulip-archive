(There also seems to be a tendency<br>\nto finish theories whose processing has been started.)</p>\n<p>I'm observing this with IsaFoR, but I expect that any proof development<br>\nof nontrivial size suffers from this phenomenon.</p>\n<p>The increased delay is quite annoying, especially now that we're<br>\nupdating theories to the RC. A typical workflow is to load a leaf<br>\ntheory, watch the theory panel for errors, and then jump to the first<br>\nerror that appears; this jump has a similar effect to disabling<br>\n\"continuous checking\", because everything up to the error point has<br>\nalready been processed. But one cannot interact effectively with the<br>\ntheorem prover before the continuous checking ceases completely, so the<br>\nincreased waiting time matters.</p>\n<p>As far as I can see, this is not a matter of the number of cores; I've<br>\nencountered the same behaviour with 6 threads and with just 2.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Bertram</p>",
