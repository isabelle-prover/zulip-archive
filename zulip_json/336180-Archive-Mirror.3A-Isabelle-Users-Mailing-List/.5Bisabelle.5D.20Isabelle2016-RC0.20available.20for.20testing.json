Some <br>\ndocumentation is still lagging behind, notably the Isabelle/jEdit manual. <br>\nThere are further fine points still to be sorted out.</p>\n<p>When discussing problems, observations, suggustions, etc. the mail subject <br>\nline should be changed to something meaningful (but the release candidate <br>\nnumber still given in the message body).</p>\n<p>As usual it is important to keep general laws of causality in mind: <br>\nrelease candidates may still change, but the final release is final. <br>\nAlthough this is tautological, in the past few releases we've often had <br>\ncomplaints right after final lift-off, when it was too late.</p>\n<p>So the best time to start testing is now.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

It is able to re-use an<br>\nexisting Isabelle installation, too, but automatic download &amp; unpacking<br>\nis very useful for non-Isabelle users, e.g. when Leon users want to try<br>\nout the Isabelle backend without knowing anything about Isabelle. The<br>\nexisting code in libisabelle supports that for Isabelle2014 and 2015<br>\nunder Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nLars</p>",
