It's quite difficult to use,<br>\nalthough turning up the font size in the editor as I've done helps somewhat.<br>\nThe larger text in the image I consider comfortable but small, whereas the<br>\nsmaller text is near unreadable.</p>\n<p>I realize this is more of a platform/jdk concern -- I found<br>\n<a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8055212\">https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8055212</a> and<br>\n<a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8137571\">https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8137571</a>, which are slated for<br>\ninclusion in the JDK9.

I estimate <br>\nthat Oracle will require 1-2 more years to make Java 9 practically <br>\navailable for everyone.  For Isabelle2016 we are shipping Java 8 for the <br>\nfirst time, and I am still hoping for further consolidation next week.</p>\n<p>As I am using a 3840x2160 display myself since Dec-2014, I've spent a lot <br>\nof time during last year to make jEdit 5.3.0 work properly with that. <br>\nThis is used for Isabelle2016-RC0, and its NEWS file advertizes improved <br>\n4K display support explicitly.</p>\n<p>These changes are mainly relevant for Windows 7, 8.1, 10, due to the way <br>\nthe system DPI configuration is applied to its native GUI in AWT/Swing.</p>\n<p>For Linux, the approach to GUI scaling works the same for Isabelle2015 and <br>\nIsabelle2016, as described in the Isabelle/jEdit manual section \"2.1.2 <br>\nDisplays with very high resolution\".  The manual is not yet updated in <br>\nIsabelle2016-RC0, so the text and the screenshot is still that of <br>\nIsabelle2015.
