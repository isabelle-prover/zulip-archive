The situation is explained in the <br>\nIsabelle/jEdit manual as follows:</p>\n<p>paragraph ‹Encoding.›</p>\n<p>text ‹Technically, the Unicode view on Isabelle symbols is an ∗‹encoding›<br>\n   called ▩‹UTF-8-Isabelle› in jEdit (not in the underlying JVM). It is<br>\n   provided by the Isabelle/jEdit plugin and enabled by default for all source<br>\n   files. Sometimes such defaults are reset accidentally, or malformed UTF-8<br>\n   sequences in the text force jEdit to fall back on a different encoding like<br>\n   ▩‹ISO-8859-15›. In that case, verbatim <code>▩‹α›'' will be shown ithtext\n   buffer instead of its Unicode rendering </code>‹α›''. The jEdit menu operation<br>\n   ∗‹File~/ Reload with Encoding~/ UTF-8-Isabelle› helps to resolve such<br>\n   problems (after repairing malformed parts of the text).<br>\n›</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>New symbols entered in the problematic theory file using the symbols <br>\npanel are displayed as Unicode glyphs, but, upon saving the file, they <br>\nresult in Unicode characters in the raw source file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is indeed a bit confusing.  I will refine the Symbols panel to insert <br>\nuninterpreted Isabelle symbols instead, when the Isabelle encoding is off.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using auto-completion results in uninterpreted symbols begin displayed <br>\nby Isabelle/jEdit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This works as intended: absence of Isabelle encoding means you see symbols <br>\nliterally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Editing the raw source file to get rid of all Unicode characters and <br>\nreloading does not fix the problem, but copying the files somewhere else <br>\nin the file-system fixed it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>jEdit has a persistent store for that in recent.xml of the so-called <br>\nsettings directory, e.g. see the menu Utilities / Settings Directory.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the global default of UTF-8-Isabelle is ignored.  It might be <br>\ninteresting to see why it happened in this particular file.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
