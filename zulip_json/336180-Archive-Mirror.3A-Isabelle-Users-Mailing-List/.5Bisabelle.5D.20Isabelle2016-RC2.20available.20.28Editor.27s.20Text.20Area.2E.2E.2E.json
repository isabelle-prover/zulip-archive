I have to select it from the drop-down buffer list  switcher<br>\nin order to make it visible<br>\nin the edit pane's text area. The image attached shows that the text area<br>\nstill shows the file \"Scratch.thy\"<br>\n right after I open \"wf_induction.thy\". At first, I thought that the<br>\nloading process was taking too long<br>\nand it took me some time to realize what was going on. Hope it is easy to<br>\nfix this.</p>\n<p>OS info: Windows 10, Memory: 8GB, Processor: Intel i5-5200U, 2.20 GHz</p>\n<p>The snapshot version from  23/12/2015 does not exhibit this behaviour.</p>\n<p>Best<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/kAVHQLGRy3o2stPExjve1E4i/rc2_text_01.PNG\">rc2_text_01.PNG</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/kAVHQLGRy3o2stPExjve1E4i/rc2_text_01.PNG\" title=\"rc2_text_01.PNG\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/kAVHQLGRy3o2stPExjve1E4i/rc2_text_01.PNG\"></a></div>",
