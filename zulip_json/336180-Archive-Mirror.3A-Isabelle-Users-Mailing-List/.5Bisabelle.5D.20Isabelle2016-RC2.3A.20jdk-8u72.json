Oracle has delivered its scheduled Java 8 <br>\nupdate on time, and it looks generally quite good.  More details are here: <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/2col/8u72-bugfixes-2775805.html\">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/2col/8u72-bugfixes-2775805.html</a></p>\n<p>For example, the broken Nimbus scrollbar \"thumb\" works again (see also <br>\n<a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8134828\">https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8134828</a>). Nonetheless, the <br>\ndefault look-and-feel on Linux remains Metal, since that can be more <br>\neasily used with very high resolution displays (\"UHD\" or \"4K\" or more).</p>\n<p>There is always a hope that other platform specific problems have now <br>\ndisappeared, but it needs proper testing, especially on Mac OS X.</p>\n<p>I've also removed overly ambitious JVM GC options: the situation is back <br>\nto Isabelle2015 in that respect.  This might impact system stability, e.g. <br>\non Windows.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
