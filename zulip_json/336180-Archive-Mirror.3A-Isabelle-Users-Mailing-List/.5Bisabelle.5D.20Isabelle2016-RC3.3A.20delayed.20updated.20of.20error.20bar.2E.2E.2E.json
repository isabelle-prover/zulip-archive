As soon as <br>\nan error occurs (indicated by a red bar in the theory panel), I then would like to click <br>\non the red line in the bar on the right of the main text area to immediately jump to the <br>\nerror and make the necessary adaptations. Unfortunately, in Isabelle2016-RC3, the bar does <br>\nnot seem to get updated as regularly as in Isabelle2015, the update only happens if <br>\nprocessing approaches the end of my theory (which can take a while). If there is an error <br>\nfairly at the beginning, then after having fixed this, I again have to wait until most of <br>\nit is processed until I find the next error. Is there some configuration to have the bar <br>\nupdated more frequently?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
