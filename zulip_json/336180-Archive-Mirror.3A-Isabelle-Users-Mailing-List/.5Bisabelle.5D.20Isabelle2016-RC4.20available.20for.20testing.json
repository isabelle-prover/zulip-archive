This <br>\nmeans we are converging to Isabelle2016 -- this is probably the last <br>\nrelease candidate before final lift-off.</p>\n<p>People who have used earlier release candidates should upgrade now. Local <br>\nsettings can be preserved by copying $ISABELLE_HOME_USER in a suitable <br>\nmanner: renaming the last component of the directory name to <br>\nIsabelle2016-RC4 before starting the new version.</p>\n<p>When discussing problems, observations, suggestions, etc. the mail subject line <br>\nshould be changed to something informative (but the release candidate number <br>\nstill given in the message body).</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
