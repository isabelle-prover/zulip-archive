This is the last chance to point out problems, before <br>\nIsabelle2016 becomes final next week.</p>\n<p>People who have used earlier release candidates should upgrade now. Local <br>\nsettings can be preserved by copying $ISABELLE_HOME_USER in a suitable <br>\nmanner: renaming the last component of the directory name to <br>\nIsabelle2016-RC5 before starting the new version.</p>\n<p>When discussing problems, observations, suggestions, etc. the mail subject <br>\nline should be changed to something informative (but the release candidate <br>\nnumber still given in the message body).</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
