Anyways, yes - it was MaSh, after<br>\ncopying the old mash_state over all the proofs are found again. So as a<br>\ndata point, MaSh does help a lot in my case :)</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nOgnjen</p>",

Is this a normal consequence of a fresh MaSh<br>\ninstallation? Can I just copy the old mash_state over (it's about twice<br>\nthe size of the new one)? I like my automated proofs :)</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nOgnjen</p>",
