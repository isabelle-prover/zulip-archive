For example if<br>\nthe cursor is on 123, and I push ctrl-left until the cursor is at the<br>\nbeginning of <em>term</em>, and then I press backspace, I would (given the<br>\nvisuals) expect the space to vanish. Instead, <em>term</em> becomes \\&lt;term&gt; (the ^<br>\ngoes away). This is logical given that <em>term</em> is actually \\&lt;^term&gt;, but<br>\nsince it is not visually represented that way, I would expect ctrl-left to<br>\njump before the \\.</p>\n<p>I don't know anything about jEdit interna, so perhaps this is very hard to<br>\nchange. But if it can be changed, I think editing would be smoother if<br>\n<em>term</em> were interpreted as a single word for the purpose of ctrl-left,<br>\nctrl-right.</p>\n<p>Similar problems happen when highlighting <em>term</em> via a doubleclick.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",
