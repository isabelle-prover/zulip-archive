The first official release candidate is now available<br>\nfor general testing: <a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2018-RC1\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2018-RC1</a></p>\n<p>The corresponding repository versions of Isabelle and AFP are<br>\n<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/commits/cf01d04e94d7\">https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/commits/cf01d04e94d7</a><br>\nand <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/isa-afp/afp-devel/commits/2af750da996c\">https://bitbucket.org/isa-afp/afp-devel/commits/2af750da996c</a></p>\n<p>The website, NEWS, ANNOUNCE etc. are already up-to-date, but some<br>\ndocumentation still requires update.</p>\n<p>The ongoing release process is continuously documented on my blog:<br>\n<a href=\"https://sketis.net/2018/release-candidates-for-isabelle2018\">https://sketis.net/2018/release-candidates-for-isabelle2018</a></p>\n<p>When discussing observations about release candidates, please provide<br>\na mail Subject line that fits to the content, not just a clone of the<br>\nannouncement.</p>\n<p>The time for testing and reporting problems is now! After the release<br>\nhas been finalized and published, it is too late to change anything.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

It<br>\nrequires everyone to look closely, and to provide tangible problem reports.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
