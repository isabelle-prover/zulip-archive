However, of course, I cannot be certain if the<br>\nduplicates were provided intentionally. The only difference between the<br>\ntheorems seems to be in the use of the abbreviation trivial_limit. However,<br>\nthe theorems seem to be exactly identical, except for the names of the<br>\nschematic variables. In particular, Topological_Spaces.Lim_in_closed_set<br>\nseems to be equivalent to Elementary_Topology.Lim_in_closed_set and<br>\nTopological_Spaces.Lim_ident_at seems to be equivalent to<br>\nElementary_Topology.netlimit_within. Also, if the use of duplicates is<br>\nintentional, I would like to understand what are the reasons behind this.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n<p>Message: 2</p>",

It should be possible to get rid of those great easily.</p>\n<p>In many cases there are a number of names for the same theorem, but with a single proof. Thatâ€™s for the sake of compatibility, but personally I prefer to get rid of those as well.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",

An informal snapshot Isabelle2019-RC0 for experimentation is<br>\nalready available here: <a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2019-RC0\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2019-RC0</a></p>\n<p>I have already updated the website content, including ANNOUNCE and NEWS,<br>\nbut a few things will still change. Some documentation also needs to<br>\nupdated.</p>\n<p>The blog entry<br>\n<a href=\"https://sketis.net/2019/release-candidates-for-isabelle2019\">https://sketis.net/2019/release-candidates-for-isabelle2019</a> is<br>\ndynamically updated to follow the release process.</p>\n<p>In the past few years, we have routinely seen very odd non-causalities:<br>\npeople looking at the release only after its final publication. But<br>\nfinal really means final (i.e. immutable, without further changes), and<br>\nproblem reports that come too late need to wait 8-10 month for the next<br>\nrelease.</p>\n<p>When discussing observations about release candidates, please provide a<br>\nSubject: line that fits to the content, not just a clone of the<br>\nannouncement.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
