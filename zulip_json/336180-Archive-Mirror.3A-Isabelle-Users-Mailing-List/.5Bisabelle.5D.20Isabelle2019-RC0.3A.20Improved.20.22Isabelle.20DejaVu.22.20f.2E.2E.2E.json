The line<br>\nmetrics and overall rendering quality is closer to original DejaVu.<br>\nINCOMPATIBILITY with display configuration expecting the old<br>\n\"IsabelleText\" font: use e.g. \"Isabelle DejaVu Sans Mono\" instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Isabelle fonts render \"\\&lt;inverse&gt;\" properly as superscript \"-1\".</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>* Isabelle/jEdit Prover IDE </strong>*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fonts for the text area, gutter, GUI elements etc. use the \"Isabelle<br>\nDejaVu\" collection by default, which provides uniform rendering quality<br>\nwith the usual Isabelle symbols. Line spacing no longer needs to be<br>\nadjusted: properties for the old IsabelleText font had \"Global Options /<br>\nText Area / Extra vertical line spacing (in pixels): -2\", now it<br>\ndefaults to 0.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OpenJDK 11 has quite different font rendering, with better glyph<br>\nshapes and improved sub-pixel anti-aliasing. In some situations results<br>\nmight be <em>worse</em> than Oracle Java 8, though.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>* System </strong>*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update to OpenJDK 11: the current long-term support version of Java.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(There is actually a small mistake above: the line-spacing default is<br>\nnow 1 instead of 0.)</p>\n<p>The change to OpenJDK 11 --- after Java 8 has been officially declared<br>\nat \"end-of-live\" in Jan-2019 --- follows the normal routine of phasing<br>\nout old technologies. Moreover, Java 8 had already shown its old age in<br>\nIsabelle applications on high-end hardware: it is very inefficient on<br>\nmachines with many cores (20-80), and does not quite work with<br>\nquasi-containers (e.g. Docker). Java 11 solves these and other problems.<br>\nIt even provides better font rendering, but that requires proper HiDPI<br>\ndisplays (which are commonplace today).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, very nostalgic users may still do their own private<br>\ntinkering to return to Java 8 -- even with the old \"IsabelleText\" font<br>\nwith its various flaws. I will not support this, though. Big companies<br>\nnormally provide expensive support plans for continued support of legacy<br>\ntechnologies, but I am not doing this.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
