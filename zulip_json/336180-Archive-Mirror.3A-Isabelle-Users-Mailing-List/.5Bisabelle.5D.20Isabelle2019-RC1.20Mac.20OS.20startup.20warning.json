So I have simply removed it from the<br>\n\"MacOSX\" plugin, see<br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/3e45a3cf1059\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/3e45a3cf1059</a></p>\n<p>This also means that when there is another \"illegal reflective access\"<br>\nwarning (only the first one is shown), something else needs to be<br>\nupdated to Java 11. I've gone through this approx. 5 times already ...</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
