So far, I even thought that this was part of the Isabelle experience. </p>\n<p>I see things like that on a daily base (both on macOS and linux) â€” at least when I use Isabelle/jEdit. I am forced to restart Isabelle at least once a day due to issues like that. In my experience, it is independent of the base session and waiting does not help (it is faster to restart Isabelle/jEdit, whatever the size of the development).</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nMathias</p>",

I think problems were caused by non-terminating <br>\ncommands (somewhere below my current edits).</p>\n<p>I tried to reproduce this with the attached Scratch.thy, and the <br>\nbehavior seems similar.</p>\n<p>Below is a trace of my edits, where I stands for an edit that <br>\ninvalidates most of the buffer (\"lemma\" -&gt; \"le mma\") and V stands for <br>\nreversing that edit. I took a screenshot of the Heap-Monitor panel after <br>\n750s, then Reset the panel and continued with edits for another 650 seconds.<br>\nEspecially after 750s, performance degrades a lot. Also the graph looks <br>\nvery different (e.g., the blue size_allocation does not decrease anymore).</p>\n<p>The performance degradation is probably just general memory pressure on <br>\nthe system, but what I find disturbing is that the end of this <br>\nexperiment, I am left with a \"theory Scratch imports Pure begin end\" <br>\nthat does not seem like it will reduce the size_heap of 14GB anymore and <br>\nis almost impossible to work with.</p>\n<p>I am using Windows 10 on a laptop with a 6-core i7 processor and 32GB of <br>\nRAM.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nFabian</p>\n<p>12: V<br>\n75: I<br>\n133: V<br>\n230: I<br>\n240: V<br>\n330: I<br>\n340: V<br>\n410: I<br>\n412: V<br>\n690: I<br>\n715: V<br>\n750: I<br>\nScreenshot 1<br>\nReset<br>\n15: V<br>\n115-230: I, no response<br>\n265: V<br>\n280: I<br>\nno response until 295<br>\n320: V<br>\n340: I, no response for 3 s<br>\n360: V<br>\n365: I<br>\n380: V<br>\n400: I, no response for 40 s<br>\n485: V<br>\n490: I<br>\n505: V<br>\n510: I<br>\n560: V<br>\n600-650: I, no response<br>\n750: Screenshot 2<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/T5UR6p6pg6KIYt3sjejDSFPn/Scratch.thy\">Scratch.thy</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/z59RXUWkk-vBus8NjpwO7V_W/Screenshot-2.PNG\">Screenshot 2.PNG</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/uGDjPWJ38GwC8gzqARyEh-5m/Screenshot-1.PNG\">Screenshot 1.PNG</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/h7ssT_2b4ZWLKHdr92nMzcXC/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/z59RXUWkk-vBus8NjpwO7V_W/Screenshot-2.PNG\" title=\"Screenshot 2.PNG\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/z59RXUWkk-vBus8NjpwO7V_W/Screenshot-2.PNG\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/uGDjPWJ38GwC8gzqARyEh-5m/Screenshot-1.PNG\" title=\"Screenshot 1.PNG\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/uGDjPWJ38GwC8gzqARyEh-5m/Screenshot-1.PNG\"></a></div>",
