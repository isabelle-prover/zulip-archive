This is not explicitly mentioned by the NEWS entry.</p>\n<p>* The ML-Level interface of intro_locales_tac changed. The new <br>\n  \"strict\" and \"eager\" flags are not documented at all, I figured out<br>\nthe right combination for me by trial and error.</p>\n<p>* Finally, the option Syntax_Trans.eta_contract_raw disappeared. Its<br>\nnow just eta_contract, and properly typed!</p>\n<p>* A few proofs involving {auto,fastforce} and combinations of split:<br>\nand split!: stopped to work, and had to be re-done more explicitly. I<br>\nhave not figured out the exact reason.</p>\n<p>* My project involves a custom code generator. I am still using an<br>\nimplementation that I adapted from the 2018 standard code generator for<br>\ngenerating files relative to the theory folder. This still works, but I<br>\nunderstand that I have to port it to the new VFS idiom.</p>\n<p>The following (already reported) issues remain:<br>\n  * The fonts still look more blurry than in 2018, on my full HD screen<br>\n  * The NEWS file does not specify any replacement for old style inner<br>\ncomments (* *). The entry for Isabelle-2018 says to use \\comment or<br>\n\\cancel. However, content of \\comment is interpreted as latex text,<br>\ncausing trouble with unknown antiquotations when e.g. trying to comment<br>\nout \"{1,2}@{a,b}\". Moreover, \\cancel used to occur in \"striked out\"<br>\nstyle in Latex output, at least when used in outer syntax. Is this also<br>\nthe case for inner-syntax \\cancel? Can I make parts of inner syntax<br>\ndisappear from latex output?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\n  Peter</p>",

This is not explicitly mentioned by the NEWS entry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>this relates to a post of mine on this mailing list from May 3rd:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is relevant for the next release:\n* The traditional entry point HOL-Word.Word is supposed to be<br>\nmeta-stable: there might be issues due to things like additional simp<br>\nrules and oscillating full theorem names etc. as not uncommon for new<br>\nreleases, but there are no intentional changes in scope there.\n* HOL-Word.More_Word is an additional »sumo« enty point into HOL-Word.\n* Other theories in HOL-Word have undergone a massive internal<br>\nre-structuring and re-grouping of material, absorbing material from AFP<br>\nsessions, particulary Native_Word.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The mere amount of material plus the absence of any deliberate change<br>\nmade it difficult to distill a conclusive NEWS entry from that.  But if<br>\nyou have specific observations (e. g. reoccurring proof-breaking<br>\npatterns), I am happy to mention them there (or maybe amend HOL-Word<br>\naccordingly).</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/xXtOixzQr8Rc0ughiU6fD77o/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
