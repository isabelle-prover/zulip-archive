The other files are<br>\nstill displayed in the theory panel, and only go away later when<br>\nopening another theory file.</p>\n<p>How to reproduce:<br>\n  open Isabelle with a file that imports many theories<br>\n  wait until theory panel shows all prerequisite files and starts<br>\nprocessing.<br>\n  close file in buffer and press purge</p>",
