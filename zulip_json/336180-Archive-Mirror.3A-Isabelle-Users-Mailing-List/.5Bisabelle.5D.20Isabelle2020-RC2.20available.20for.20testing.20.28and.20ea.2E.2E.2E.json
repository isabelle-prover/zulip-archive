From now on there will be no further incompatibilities, unless something<br>\nis really wrong.</p>\n<p>See the blog entry<br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/phame/post/view/5/release_candidates_for_isabelle2020\">https://isabelle-dev.sketis.net/phame/post/view/5/release_candidates_for_isabelle2020</a><br>\nfor further details.</p>\n<p>People who have tested Isabelle2020-RC1 should update now to see if everything<br>\nstill works, or have become even better.</p>\n<p>When discussing observations about Isabelle2020 release candidates on the<br>\nmailing list, please provide a \"Subject:\" line that fits to the content, not<br>\njust a clone of this announcement.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

When switching to any<br>\nsubpixel mode, the problem goes away, and scrolling works at normal<br>\nspeed.</p>\n<p>The default font sizes for menu etc have been increased. This makes it<br>\nmore usable on 4k screens, BUT LESS USABLE on low-resolution screens<br>\n(like my laptop). Can I tune these settings myself (ideally while the<br>\nIDE is running, second best by a command-line argument or config-file<br>\nsetting.)</p>",

So I ended up with<br>\nstrange situations such as tabs with two different font sizes appearing on<br>\nthe same tabbed pane.  This resolved after restarting.</p>",
