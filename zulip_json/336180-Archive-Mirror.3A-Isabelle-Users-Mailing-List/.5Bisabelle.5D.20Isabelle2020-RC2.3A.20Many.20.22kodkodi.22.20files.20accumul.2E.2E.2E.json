I.e. I would expect roughly the same<br>\nbehaviour in Isabelle2019, Isabelle2018 etc. --- there can always be<br>\nunexpected effects from totally different changes elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Attached is a small adhoc change to use Jasmin's remove_temporary_files more<br>\nrobustly in the face of interrupts or other exceptions.</p>\n<p>To try that out, you merely need to change this single line manually in<br>\n$ISABELLE_HOME/src/Tools/Nitpick/kodkod.ML and restart Isabelle/jEdit to let<br>\nit rebuild the HOL image.</p>\n<p>Makarius<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/UZgxUeXJdmLrA8ur98FNxvec/ch\">ch</a></p>",
