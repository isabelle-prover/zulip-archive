Usually, this error goes away after a<br>\nfew seconds, and Isabelle starts loading the prerequisite theories<br>\n(they are, e.g., shown in the Theory panel). This behavior is normal,<br>\nalso for older Isabelles. However, sometimes, the error will not go<br>\naway, and no prerequisite theories will be loaded, even after waiting<br>\nfor minutes. Also reloading the current file does not help. I have to<br>\nquit jedit, and restart.</p>\n<p>Anyone observed this behavior?

        "content": "<p>From: Mikhail Chekhov &lt;<a href=\"mailto:mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com\">mikhail.chekhov.w@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>\nDear All,</p>\n<p>I wanted to mention that I observed this behavior for the first at some<br>\npoint after I started using Isabelle2020-RC2 (I believe, also since I<br>\nstarted using Isabelle2020-RC4). Since then it reoccurred several times,<br>\nbut I did not find a way to reproduce it reliably. Therefore, I decided not<br>\nto post anything about it at the time.</p>\n<p>I should mention that I have been using Isabelle consistently for over a<br>\nyear and, therefore, I used both the stable releases and the release<br>\ncandidates for Isabelle-2019, as well as the stable release of<br>\nIsabelle-2018. I believe that my workflow has not changed since I started<br>\nusing the software regularly (note that I usually start Isabelle from the<br>\ncommand line). Given that (to the best of my knowledge) it is the first<br>\ntime that I see this issue, it would be plausible to assume that there was<br>\nsome regression.</p>\n<p>As a side remark, I noticed that the issue seems to never occur if the<br>\nfirst theory that I open after starting Isabelle does not import any<br>\ntheories that were not built and made available persistently. This is the<br>\npractice that I have been following to avoid this issue since I encountered<br>\nit several weeks ago. However, upon encountering this issue, the only<br>\nsolution that I found was to restart Jedit (I believe that I tried closing<br>\nand reopening the files and changing/editing the names of the imported<br>\ntheories).</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nMikhail Chekhov</p>",
