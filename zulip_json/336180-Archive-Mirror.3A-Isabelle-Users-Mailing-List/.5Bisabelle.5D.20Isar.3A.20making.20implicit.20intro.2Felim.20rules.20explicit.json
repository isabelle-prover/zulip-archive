As stated in the<br>\npaper, the \"proof\" command is short for \"proof (rule elim-rules<br>\nintro-rules)\", where \"elim-rules\" and \"intro-rules\" are selected by<br>\nIsar automatically based on the context.  Is there a way to see Isar's<br>\nchoices for \"elim-rules\" and \"intro-rules\" (and also \".\" and \"..\")?<br>\nIn other words, is there a way to turn a proof that uses implicit<br>\nproof methods into a proof where all the proof methods are explicit?</p>\n<p>I can see how implicit proof methods make proofs easier to read and<br>\nwrite, but seeing these things explicitly would be very helpful in<br>\nlearning Isar.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nDavid</p>",
