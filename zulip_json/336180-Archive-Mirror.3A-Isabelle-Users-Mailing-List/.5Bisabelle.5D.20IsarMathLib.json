However, Nitpick's successor, Nunchaku, is currently being developed, and we aim at targeting set theory as well (Isabelle/TLA and Isabelle/ZF), so that it could be used in conjunction with IsarMathLib. As for Sledgehammer, we also want to generalize in the same direction, but have currently no financing or student working on that.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
