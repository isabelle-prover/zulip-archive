As a result I can no <br>\nlonger work in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>The problem has been posted on StackOverflow for four months (it <br>\nhappened already with a previous machine) and hasn't received an answer:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53116986/jedit-plugin-error-while-loading-isabelle\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53116986/jedit-plugin-error-while-loading-isabelle</a></p>\n<p>Please let me know if there is a fix for this problem.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>Rodrigo Raya</p>",
