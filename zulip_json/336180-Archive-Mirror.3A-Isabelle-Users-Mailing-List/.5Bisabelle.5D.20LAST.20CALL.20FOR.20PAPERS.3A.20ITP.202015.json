It<br>\nrepresents the natural evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to<br>\ninclude research related to all other interactive theorem provers.</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.inf.kcl.ac.uk/staff/urbanc/itp-2015/\">http://www.inf.kcl.ac.uk/staff/urbanc/itp-2015/</a>  *</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Title &amp; Abstract Submission:  9 March 2015<br>\nFull Paper Submission:       13 March 2015<br>\nAuthor Notification:           15 May 2015<br>\nCamera-Ready Papers due:       5 June 2015<br>\nConference:            24 - 27 August 2015<br>\nSubmission Page:       <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2015\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2015</a></p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<hr>\n<p>ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects<br>\nof interactive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics<br>\ninclude but are not limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formal aspects of hardware and software,</li>\n<li>formalizations of mathematics,</li>\n<li>improvements in theorem prover technology,</li>\n<li>user interfaces for interactive theorem provers,</li>\n<li>formalizations of computational models,</li>\n<li>verification of security algorithms,</li>\n<li>use of theorem provers in education,</li>\n<li>industrial applications of interactive theorem provers, and</li>\n<li>concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (\"Proof Pearls\").</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers should be no more than 16 pages in length and are to be<br>\nsubmitted in PDF format. They must conform to the LNCS style<br>\npreferably using LaTeX. The proceedings are to be published as a<br>\nvolume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series and will be<br>\navailable to participants at the conference.</p>\n<p>Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their paper at the<br>\nconference.</p>\n<p>In addition to regular papers, described above, there will be a \"rough<br>\ndiamond\" section. Rough diamond submissions are limited to 6 pages and<br>\nmay consist of an extended abstract. They will be refereed and be<br>\nexpected to present innovative and promising ideas, possibly in an<br>\nearly form and without supporting evidence. Accepted diamonds will be<br>\npublished in the main proceedings, and will be presented as short<br>\ntalks.</p>\n<p>Programme Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Andrea Asperti       University of Bologna, Italy<br>\nJesper Bengtson      IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark<br>\nStefan Berghofer     Secunet Security Networks AG, Germany<br>\nYves Bertot          INRIA, France<br>\nLars Birkedal        Aarhus University, Denmark<br>\nSandrine Blazy       University of Rennes, France<br>\nBob Constable        Cornell University, USA<br>\nThierry Coquand      University of Gothenburg, Sweden<br>\nXinyu Feng           University of Science and Technology, China<br>\nRuben Gamboa         University of Wyoming, USA<br>\nHerman Geuvers       Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands<br>\nMike Gordon          Cambridge University, United Kingdom<br>\nElsa Gunter          University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA<br>\nJohn Harrison        Intel Corporation, USA<br>\nHugo Herbelin        INRIA, France<br>\nMatt Kaufmann        University of Texas at Austin, USA<br>\nGerwin Klein         NICTA, Australia<br>\nCesar Munoz          NASA Langley Research Center, USA<br>\nTobias Nipkow        TU München, Germany<br>\nMichael Norrish      NICTA, Australia<br>\nScott Owens          University of Kent, United Kingdom<br>\nRandy Pollack        Harvard University, USA<br>\nCarsten Schürmann    IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark<br>\nKonrad Slind         Rockwell Collins, USA<br>\nAlwen Tiu            Nanyang Technological University, Singapore<br>\nChristian Urban      King's College London, United Kingdom (co-chair)<br>\nDimitrios Vytiniotis Microsoft Research Cambridge, United Kingdom<br>\nXingyuan Zhang       PLA University of Science and Technology, China (co-chair)</p>\n<p>Organizers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Xingyuan Zhang <br>\nChunhan Wu <br>\nJinshang Wang <br>\nChristian Urban</p>",
