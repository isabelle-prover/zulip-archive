Though termination of<br>\nprocesses is often a strict requirement, it may be hard to establish. Classical<br>\nresults state the undecidability of various termination problems, so<br>\nresearch focuses on automated methods that prove termination or<br>\nnon-termination in practical cases. The topic is challenging both in theory<br>\n(mathematical logic, proof theory) and practice (software development, formal<br>\nmethods), and many interesting ramifications are yet to be explored.</p>\n<p>The 9th International Workshop on Termination will delve into all aspects of<br>\ntermination. It will continue the sequence of successful workshops held in St.<br>\nAndrews (1993), La Bresse (1995), Ede (1997), Dagstuhl (1999), Utrecht (2001),<br>\nValencia (2003), Aachen (2004), and Seattle (2006). We hope to attain the same<br>\nfriendly atmosphere as those past workshops. The intent is to bring together, in<br>\nan informal setting, researchers interested in various aspects of termination,<br>\nwhether this interest be practical or theoretical, primary or derived. The<br>\nworkshop is hoped to provide a ground for cross-fertilisation of ideas from term<br>\nrewriting and from programming.</p>\n<p>Contributions from the imperative, object-oriented, constraint, functional, and<br>\nlogic programming communities, and papers investigating new applications of<br>\ntermination are particularly welcome.</p>\n<p>Paper Submissions:<br>\nExtended abstracts in the prescribed format, not exceeding 4 pages, should be<br>\nsubmitted electronically through EasyChair's WST 2007 submission site<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/WST2007/\">http://www.easychair.org/WST2007/</a>.<br>\nA common workshop style file will be made available on the WST'2007 web site.<br>\nPapers should be submitted in PostScript or PDF format. We expect proceedings to<br>\nbe made available through the Computing Research Repository, CoRR.</p>\n<p>The Termination Competition:<br>\nThe competition will run again in 2007, and entries are strongly encouraged.<br>\nDetailed instructions for submission of problems and programs will be made<br>\navailable at the competition website<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.lri.fr/~marche/termination-competition/2007/\">http://www.lri.fr/~marche/termination-competition/2007/</a></p>\n<p>Program Committee<br>\nNachum Dershowitz (Tel Aviv, Israel)<br>\nDaniel De Schreye (Leuven, Belgium)<br>\nSamir Genaim (Madrid, Spain)<br>\nJuergen Giesl (Aachen, Germany)<br>\nIsabelle Gnaedig (Nancy, France)<br>\nDieter Hofbauer (Kassel, Germany), co-chair<br>\nAart Middeldorp (Innsbruck, Austria)<br>\nEtienne Payet (La Reunion, France)<br>\nAlexander Serebrenik (Eindhoven, The Netherlands), co-chair</p>\n<p>Termination Competition Committee<br>\nClaude Marche (Paris, France)<br>\nJohannes Waldmann (Leipzig, Germany)<br>\nHans Zantema (Eindhoven, The Netherlands)</p>\n<p>Workshop Themes (non-exhaustive list)<br>\nTermination of programs<br>\nTermination of rewriting<br>\nNormalization of lambda calculi<br>\nImplementation of termination methods<br>\nChallenging termination problems and proofs<br>\nApplication of termination methods, e.g. to program transformation and<br>\ncompilation<br>\nComparison and classification of termination methods<br>\nNon-termination detection<br>\nTermination methods for theorem provers<br>\nTermination in distributed systems<br>\nTermination proof methods for liveness and fairness<br>\nDerivational complexity<br>\nWell-quasi-orderings and ordinal notations</p>\n<p>Important Dates:<br>\nDeadline for electronic submission of papers :  April 23, 2007<br>\nNotification of acceptance                   :  May 14, 2007<br>\nDeadline for final versions                  :  May 27, 2007</p>\n<p>Competition Deadlines:<br>\nSubmission of public problems     :  May 1, 2007<br>\nRegistration of termination tools :  May 21, 2007<br>\nSubmission of secret problems     :  June 1, 2007<br>\nSubmission of termination tools   :  June 1, 2007<br>\nStart of competition              :  June 4, 2007</p>\n<p>Workshop Venue and Related Events:<br>\nWST 2007 is part of the Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and<br>\nProgramming 2007.
