This is the fourth<br>\njoint workshop in the series.</p>\n<p>Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for<br>\nrepresenting, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of<br>\ndeductive systems of interest in logic and computer science.  LFMTP<br>\n2009 will provide researchers with a forum to review state-of-the-art<br>\ntechniques and to present progress in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>the automation and implementation of the meta-theory of programming<br>\n  languages and related calculi, particularly work which involves<br>\n  variable binding and fresh name generation;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the design of proof assistants, automated theorem provers, and<br>\n  formal digital libraries building upon logical framework technology;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>theoretical and practical issues concerning the encoding of variable<br>\n  binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning about,<br>\n  datatypes defined from binding signatures;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>case studies of meta-programming, and the mechanization of the<br>\n  (meta) theory of descriptions of programming languages and other<br>\n  calculi.  Papers focusing on logic translations and on experiences<br>\n  with encoding programming languages theory will be particularly<br>\n  welcome.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TOPICS: Papers are solicited on topics including, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>logical framework design</li>\n<li>meta-theoretic analysis</li>\n<li>applications and comparative studies</li>\n<li>implementation techniques</li>\n<li>efficient proof representation and validation</li>\n<li>proof-generating decision procedures and theorem provers</li>\n<li>proof-carrying code</li>\n<li>substructural frameworks</li>\n<li>semantic foundations</li>\n<li>methods for reasoning about logics</li>\n<li>formal digital libraries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS: Three categories of papers are solicited:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Category A: Detailed and technical accounts of new research: up to<br>\n  eight pages including bibliography.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Category B: Shorter accounts of work in progress and proposed<br>\n  further directions, including discussion papers: up to six pages<br>\n  including bibliography and appendices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Category C: System descriptions presenting an implemented tool and<br>\n  its novel features: up to four pages.  A demonstration is expected<br>\n  to accompany the presentation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions will be accepted electronically. Authors are required to<br>\nsubmit a paper title and a short abstract one week before submitting<br>\nthe paper.  For further information and submission instructions, see<br>\nthe LFMTP web page: <a href=\"http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfmtp\">http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfmtp</a>.<br>\nAccepted papers will be published electronically as part of the ACM<br>\nInternational Conference Proceedings Series.</p>\n<p>Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their paper at the<br>\nworkshop.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE:<br>\n  Frederic Blanqui (INRIA)<br>\n  James Cheney, Co-Chair (University of Edinburgh)<br>\n  Adam Chlipala (Harvard University)<br>\n  Amy Felty, Co-Chair (University of Ottawa)<br>\n  Martin Hofmann (LMU Munich)<br>\n  Conor McBride (University of Strathclyde)<br>\n  Marino Miculan (University of Udine)<br>\n  Alberto Momigliano (University of Edinburgh)<br>\n  Gopalan Nadathur (University of Minnesota)<br>\n  Michael Norrish (NICTA)</p>",
