Their<br>\ndesign and implementation on the one hand and their use in reasoning<br>\ntasks ranging from the correctness of software to the properties of<br>\nformal computational systems on the other hand have been the focus of<br>\nconsiderable research over the last two decades. This workshop will<br>\nbring together designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss<br>\nvarious aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical<br>\nframeworks, including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and<br>\nco-inductive reasoning techniques and the expressivity and lucidity of<br>\nthe reasoning process.</p>\n<p>The broad subject areas of LFMTP'11 are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming<br>\n   languages and related formally specified systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of<br>\n   variable binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning<br>\n   about, datatypes defined from binding signatures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and<br>\n   associated reasoning techniques.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies of meta-programming, and the mechanization of the<br>\n   (meta)theory of descriptions of programming languages and other<br>\n   calculi. Papers focusing on logic translations and on experiences<br>\n   with encoding programming languages theory are particularly<br>\n   welcome.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Topics include, but are not limited to</p>\n<p>* logical framework design<br>\n    * meta-theoretic analysis<br>\n    * applications and comparative studies<br>\n    * implementation techniques<br>\n    * efficient proof representation and validation<br>\n    * proof-generating decision procedures and theorem provers<br>\n    * proof-carrying code<br>\n    * substructural frameworks<br>\n    * semantic foundations<br>\n    * methods for reasoning about logics<br>\n    * formal digital libraries</p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>Claudio Sacerdoti Coen    (University of Bologna)<br>\nHerman Geuvers             (Radboud University Nijmegen)<br>\nJames McKinna              (Radboud University Nijmegen)<br>\nGopalan Nadathur           (University of Minnesota)<br>\nFrank Pfenning               (Carnegie Mellon University)<br>\nAlwen Tiu                       (Australian National University)<br>\nChristian Urban               (TU Munich)</p>\n<p>Submission of papers is electronic and must be completed through the<br>\nEasyChair server that can be accessed through the workshop web<br>\nsite. The actual paper submission must be preceded by the submission<br>\nof a title and a short abstract---see the important dates indicated<br>\nalongside.  Submissions to the workshop can take several forms, such<br>\nas system descriptions, short accounts of work in progress, and<br>\ndetailed, technical presentations of new results. Different categories<br>\nof submissions will be judged differently, the main common criteria<br>\nbeing the content of the ideas and their ability to stimulate<br>\ndiscussions at the workshop. Submissions must be in PDF format<br>\nprepared in LaTeX using the EPTCS macro package<br>\n(<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org\">http://style.eptcs.org</a>) and must not exceed 15 pages including<br>\nreferences.</p>\n<p>Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop by their<br>\nauthors. Revised versions of these papers will be included in the<br>\nproceedings that will be published as an Electronic Proceedings in<br>\nTheoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) via <a href=\"http://eptcs.org\">http://eptcs.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Workshop organizers:</p>\n<p>Herman Geuvers                                  Gopalan Nadathur<br>\nIntelligent Systems, iCIS                      Computer Science and<br>\nEngineering<br>\nFaculty of Science                               University of Minnesota<br>\nRadboud University Nijmegen, NL          Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:herman@cs.ru.nl\">herman@cs.ru.nl</a>                        Email: <a href=\"mailto:gopalan@cs.umn.edu\">gopalan@cs.umn.edu</a></p>",
