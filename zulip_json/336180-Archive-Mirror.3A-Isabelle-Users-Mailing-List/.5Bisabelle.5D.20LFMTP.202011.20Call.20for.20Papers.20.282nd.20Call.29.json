Their<br>\ndesign and implementation on the one hand and their use in reasoning<br>\ntasks ranging from the correctness of software to the properties of<br>\nformal computational systems on the other hand have been the focus of<br>\nconsiderable research over the last two decades. This workshop will<br>\nbring together designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss<br>\nvarious aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical<br>\nframeworks, including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and<br>\nco-inductive reasoning techniques and the expressivity and lucidity of<br>\nthe reasoning process.</p>\n<p>The broad subject areas of LFMTP'11 are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming<br>\n   languages and related formally specified systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of<br>\n   variable binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning<br>\n   about, datatypes defined from binding signatures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and<br>\n   associated reasoning techniques.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies of meta-programming, and the mechanization of the<br>\n   (meta)theory of descriptions of programming languages and other<br>\n   calculi. Papers focusing on logic translations and on experiences<br>\n   with encoding programming languages theory are particularly<br>\n   welcome.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission and other details concerning the workshop can be found at<br>\nits website at <a href=\"http://lfmtp11.cs.umn.edu\">http://lfmtp11.cs.umn.edu</a>.</p>",
