Their design and implementation on the one hand and their use<br>\nin reasoning tasks ranging from the correctness of software to the<br>\nproperties of formal computational systems on the other hand have been<br>\nthe focus of considerable research over the last two decades. This<br>\nworkshop will bring together designers, implementers, and<br>\npractitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure<br>\nand utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable<br>\nbinding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the<br>\nexpressivity and lucidity of the reasoning process.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Jesper Bengtson<br>\n   Session Types Meet Separation Logic</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edwin Brady<br>\n   Idris: Implementing a Dependently Typed Programming Language</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gopalan Nadathur<br>\n   A Framework for the Verified Transformation of Functional Programs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LFMTP 2014 PROGRAM:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/smart-program/VSL2014/LFMTP-program.html\">http://www.easychair.org/smart-program/VSL2014/LFMTP-program.html</a></p>\n<p>REGISTRATION AND ACCOMMODATION:<br>\n<a href=\"http://vsl2014.at/registration/\">http://vsl2014.at/registration/</a></p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you in Vienna!</p>\n<p>The LFMTP 2014 organizers:<br>\nAmy Felty<br>\nBrigitte Pientka</p>",
