Their<br>\ndesign and implementation on the one hand and their applications in<br>\nfor example proof-carrying code have been the focus of considerable<br>\nresearch over the last two decades. This workshop will bring together<br>\ndesigners, implementors, and practitioners to discuss all aspects of<br>\nlogical frameworks and variable binding.</p>\n<p>The broad subject areas of LFMTP'08 are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The automation and implementation of the meta-theory of programming<br>\n   languages and related calculi, particularly work which involves<br>\n   variable binding and fresh name generation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The theoretical and practical issues concerning the encoding of<br>\n   variable binding and fresh name generation, especially the<br>\n   representation of, and reasoning about, datatypes defined from binding<br>\n   signatures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies of meta-programming, and the mechanization of the<br>\n   (meta)theory of descriptions of programming languages and other<br>\n   calculi.  Papers focusing on logic translations and on experiences<br>\n   with encoding programming languages theory are particularly welcome.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Topics include, but are not limited to</p>\n<p>* logical framework design<br>\n     * meta-theoretic analysis<br>\n     * applications and comparative studies<br>\n     * implementation techniques<br>\n     * efficient proof representation and validation<br>\n     * proof-generating decision procedures and theorem provers<br>\n     * proof-carrying code<br>\n     * substructural frameworks<br>\n     * semantic foundations<br>\n     * methods for reasoning about logics<br>\n     * formal digital libraries</p>\n<p>Invited Speaker:</p>\n<p>Dale Miller         (Laboratoire d'Informatique, INRIA Saclay)</p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>Andreas Abel        (LMU Munich)<br>\nPeter Dybjer        (Chalmers University of Technology)<br>\nAlberto Momigliano  (University of Edinburgh)<br>\nBrigitte Pientka    (McGill University)<br>\nRandy Pollack       (University of Edinburgh)<br>\nCarsten Schuermann  (IT University of Copenhagen)<br>\nPeter Sewell        (University of Cambridge)<br>\nAaron Stump         (Washington University)<br>\nChristian Urban     (TU Munich)</p>\n<p>Three categories of papers are solicited:</p>\n<p>* Category A: Detailed and technical accounts of new research: up<br>\n     to fifteen pages including bibliography.</p>\n<p>* Category B: Shorter accounts of work in progress and proposed<br>\n     further directions, including discussion papers: up to eight<br>\n     pages including bibliography and appendices.</p>\n<p>* Category C: System descriptions presenting an implemented tool<br>\n     and its novel features: up to six pages.
