Their<br>\ndesign and implementation on the one hand and their use in reasoning<br>\ntasks ranging from the correctness of software to the properties of<br>\nformal computational systems on the other hand have been the focus of<br>\nconsiderable research over the last two decades. This workshop will<br>\nbring together designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss<br>\nvarious aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical<br>\nframework. The broad subject areas of LFMTP'13 are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming<br>\nlanguages and related formally specified systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable<br>\nbinding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and<br>\nassociated reasoning techniques.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New theory contributions: canonical frameworks, contextual<br>\nframeworks, functional programming over logical frameworks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This year's invited speaker is Dale Miller. In addition, this year<br>\nLFMTP will celebrate the twenty years anniversary of the publication<br>\nof:</p>\n<p>Robert Harper, Furio Honsell and Gordon Plotkin. A Framework For<br>\nDefining Logics. Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery,<br>\n40(1):143-184, 1993</p>\n<p>Program Committee:<br>\n=================</p>\n<ul>\n<li>David Baelde, ENS</li>\n<li>James Cheney, Edinburgh</li>\n<li>Adam Chlipala, MIT</li>\n<li>Dan Licata, CMU/IAS</li>\n<li>Alberto Momigliano, Milano (organizer)</li>\n<li>Brigitte Pientka, McGill (organizer)</li>\n<li>Nicolas Pouillard ITU</li>\n<li>Randy Pollack, Harvard (organizer)</li>\n<li>Andrei Popescu, TUM</li>\n<li>Florian Rabe, Bremen</li>\n<li>Stephanie Weirich, UPenn</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission Details:<br>\n============</p>\n<p>In addition to regular papers, we also solicit \"work in progress\"<br>\nreport, in a broad sense. Those do not need to report original or<br>\nfully polished research results, but should be interesting for the<br>\ncommunity at large.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers should be in PDF, formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN<br>\nstyle guidelines (9pt format, more details appear on the symposium web<br>\npage). The length is restricted to 12 pages, except for \"Work in<br>\nProgress\" papers, which are restricted to 6 pages.</p>\n<p>Submission is via EasyChair:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lfmtp2013\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lfmtp2013</a></p>\n<p>Proceedings:<br>\n============</p>\n<p>Accepted (regular) papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library.<br>\nAuthors are encouraged to publish auxiliary material with their paper<br>\n(technical appendixes, source code, scripts, test data, etc.).</p>\n<p>Travel Support:<br>\n===============</p>\n<p>Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant<br>\nto help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as<br>\nfor child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for<br>\ncompanions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for<br>\ntravel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details<br>\non the PAC program, see its web page (<a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm\">http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm</a>).</p>",
