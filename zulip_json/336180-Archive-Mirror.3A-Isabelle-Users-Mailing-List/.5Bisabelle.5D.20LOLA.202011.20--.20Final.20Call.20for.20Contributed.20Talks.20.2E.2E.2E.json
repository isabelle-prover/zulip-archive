Yet low level languages, such as machine code,<br>\nand the compilation of high level languages into a low level ones<br>\nhave traditionally been seen as having little or no essential<br>\nconnection to logic.</p>\n<p>However, a fundamental discovery of this past decade has been<br>\nthat low level languages are also governed by logical principles.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From this key observation has emerged an active and fascinating<br>\nnew research area at the frontier of logic and computer science.<br>\nThe practically motivated design of logics reflecting the structure<br>\nof low level languages (such as heaps, registers and code pointers)<br>\nand low level properties of programs (such as resource usage)<br>\ngoes hand in hand with the some of the most advanced contemporary<br>\nresearches in semantics and proof theory, including classical<br>\nrealizability and forcing, double orthogonality, parametricity,<br>\nlinear logic, game semantics, uniformity, categorical semantics,<br>\nexplicit substitutions, abstract machines, implicit complexity<br>\nand sublinear programming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The LOLA workshop, affiliated with LICS, will bring together<br>\nresearchers interested in the various aspects of the relationship<br>\nbetween logic and low level languages and programs.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>- Typed assembly languages<br>\n     - Certified assembly programming<br>\n     - Certified and certifying compilation<br>\n     - Proof-carrying code<br>\n     - Program optimization<br>\n     - Modal logic and realizability in machine code<br>\n     - Realizability and double orthogonality in assembly code,<br>\n     - Implicit complexity, sublinear programming and Turing machines<br>\n     - Parametricity, modules and existential types<br>\n     - General references, Kripke models and recursive types<br>\n     - Closures and explicit substitutions<br>\n     - Linear logic and separation logic<br>\n     - Game semantics, abstract machines and hardware synthesis<br>\n     - Monoidal and premonoidal categories, traces and effects</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>* Nick Benton (MSR Cambridge)<br>\n     * Josh Berdine (MSR Cambridge)<br>\n     * Lars Birkedal (IT University of Copenhagen, co-chair)<br>\n     * Xinyu Feng (University of Science and Technology of China)<br>\n     * Greg Morrisett (Harvard University)<br>\n     * Xavier Rival (INRIA Roquencourt and ENS Paris)<br>\n     * Zhong Shao (Yale University, co-chair)<br>\n     * Nicolas Tabareau (INRIA - EMN)<br>\n     * Jérôme Vouillon (CNRS)<br>\n     * Noam Zeilberger (University of Paris VII)</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p>LOLA is an informal workshop aiming at a high degree of<br>\nuseful interaction  amongst the participants, welcoming<br>\nproposals for talks on work in progress, overviews of larger<br>\nprogrammes, position presentations and short tutorials as well<br>\nas more traditional research talks describing new results.</p>\n<p>The programme committee will select the workshop presentations<br>\nfrom submitted proposals, which may take the form either of<br>\na short abstract or of a longer (published or unpublished) paper<br>\ndescribing completed work.</p>\n<p>The submissions should be made by easychair at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lola2011\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lola2011</a></p>",
