Yet low level<br>\nlanguages, such as machine code, and the compilation of high level<br>\nlanguages into a low level ones have traditionally been seen as having<br>\nlittle or no essential connection to logic.</p>\n<p>However, a fundamental discovery of this past decade has been that low<br>\nlevel languages are also governed by logical principles.  From this<br>\nkey observation has emerged an active and fascinating new research<br>\narea at the frontier of logic and computer science.  The practically<br>\nmotivated design of logics reflecting the structure of low level<br>\nlanguages (such as heaps, registers and code pointers) and low level<br>\nproperties of programs (such as resource usage) goes hand in hand with<br>\nthe some of the most advanced contemporary researches in semantics and<br>\nproof theory, including classical realizability and forcing, double<br>\northogonality, parametricity, linear logic, game semantics,<br>\nuniformity, categorical semantics, explicit substitutions, abstract<br>\nmachines, implicit complexity and sublinear programming.</p>\n<p>The LOLA workshop, affiliated with LICS, will bring together<br>\nresearchers interested in the various aspects of the relationship<br>\nbetween logic and low level languages and programs.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nick Benton (MSR Cambridge)</li>\n<li>Josh Berdine (MSR Cambridge)</li>\n<li>Lars Birkedal (IT University of Copenhagen, co-chair)</li>\n<li>Xinyu Feng (University of Science and Technology of China)</li>\n<li>Greg Morrisett (Harvard University)</li>\n<li>Xavier Rival (INRIA Roquencourt and ENS Paris)</li>\n<li>Zhong Shao (Yale University, co-chair)</li>\n<li>Nicolas Tabareau (INRIA - EMN)</li>\n<li>Jérôme Vouillon (CNRS)</li>\n<li>Noam Zeilberger (University of Paris VII)</li>\n</ul>",
