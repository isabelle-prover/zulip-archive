LOPSTR<br>\nis open to contributions in logic-based program development in any<br>\nlanguage paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively,<br>\nfriendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. Formal<br>\nproceedings are produced only after the symposium so that authors can<br>\nincorporate this feedback in the published papers.</p>\n<p>The 21st International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and<br>\nTransformation (LOPSTR 2011) will be held in Odense, Denmark; previous<br>\nsymposia were held in Hagenberg, Coimbra, Valencia, Lyngby, Venice,<br>\nLondon, Verona, Uppsala, Madrid, Paphos, London, Venice, Manchester,<br>\nLeuven, Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve, and Manchester (you<br>\nmight have a look at the contents of past LOPSTR symposia). LOPSTR<br>\n2011 will be co-located with PPDP 2011 (International ACM SIGPLAN<br>\nSymposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming).</p>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<p>Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development,<br>\nall stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-<br>\nin-the-small and programming-in-the-large. Papers describing<br>\napplications in these areas are especially welcome. Contributions are<br>\nwelcome on all aspects of logic-based program development, including,<br>\nbut not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>specification</li>\n<li>synthesis</li>\n<li>verification</li>\n<li>transformation</li>\n<li>analysis</li>\n<li>optimisation</li>\n<li>specialization</li>\n<li>partial evaluation</li>\n<li>inversion</li>\n<li>composition</li>\n<li>program/model manipulation</li>\n<li>certification</li>\n<li>security</li>\n<li>transformational techniques in SE</li>\n<li>applications and tools</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Survey papers, that present some aspect of the above topics from a new<br>\nperspective, and application  papers, that describe experience with<br>\nindustrial applications, are also welcome. Papers must describe<br>\noriginal work, be written and presented  in English, and must not<br>\nsubstantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are<br>\nsimultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed<br>\nproceedings. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally<br>\npublished workshops proceedings may be submitted.</p>\n<p>Following past editions, the formal post-conference proceedings will<br>\nbe published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)<br>\nseries.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper submission: March 27,  2011</li>\n<li>Extended abstract submission: April 3, 2011</li>\n<li>Notification (for pre-proceedings): May 16, 2011</li>\n<li>Camera-ready (for pre-proceedings): June 12, 2011</li>\n<li>Symposium: July 18-20, 2011</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions can either be (short) extended abstracts or (full) papers<br>\nwhose length should not exceed 9 and 15 pages (including references),<br>\nrespectively. Submissions must be formatted in the Lecture Notes in<br>\nComputer Science style (excluding well-marked appendices not intended<br>\nfor publication). Referees are not required to read the appendices,<br>\nand thus papers should be intelligible without them. Short papers may<br>\ndescribe work-in-progress or tool demonstrations.</p>\n<p>Both short and full papers can be accepted for presentation at the<br>\nsymposium and will then appear in the LOPSTR 2011<br>\npre-proceedings. Full papers can also be immediately accepted for<br>\npublication in the formal proceedings to be published by Springer<br>\nin the LNCS series. In addition, after the symposium, the programme<br>\ncommittee will select further short or full papers presented<br>\nin LOPSTR 2011 to be considered for formal publication. These authors<br>\nwill be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions in the<br>\nlight of the feedback solicited at the symposium. Then after another<br>\nround of reviewing, these revised papers can also be published in the<br>\nformal proceedings.</p>\n<p>Invited speakers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>John Gallagher, Roskilde University, Denmark  </li>\n<li>Fritz Henglein, University of Copenhagen, Denmark  (shared with PPDP)</li>\n<li>Vitaly Lagoon, Cadence Design Systems, Boston, USA (shared with PPDP)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>Elvira Albert (Complutense University of Madrid, Spain)<br>\nMalgorzata Biernacka (University of Wroclaw , Poland)<br>\nManuel Carro (Technical University of Madrid, Spain)<br>\nMichael Codish (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel)<br>\nDanny De Schreye (K.U.Leuven, Belgium)<br>\nMaribel Fernandez (King's College London, UK)<br>\nRaul Gutierrez (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA)<br>\nMark Harman (University College London, UK)<br>\nFrank Huch (C.A.U.
