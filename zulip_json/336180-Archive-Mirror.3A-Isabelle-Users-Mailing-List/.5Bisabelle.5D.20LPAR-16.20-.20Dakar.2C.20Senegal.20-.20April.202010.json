The 16th <br>\nedition will be held in Dakar, Senegal.</p>\n<p>Logic is a fundamental organizing principle in nearly all areas in Computer <br>\nScience. It runs a multifaceted gamut from the foundational to the applied. <br>\nAt one extreme, it underlies computability and complexity theory and the <br>\nformal semantics of programming languages. At the other, it drives billions <br>\nof gates every day in the digital circuits of processors of all kinds. Logic <br>\nis in itself a powerful programming paradigm but it is also the quintessential <br>\nspecification language for anything ranging from real-time critical systems <br>\nto networked infrastructures. Logical techniques link implementation and <br>\nspecification through formal methods such as automated theorem proving and <br>\nmodel checking. Logic is also the stuff of knowledge representation and <br>\nartificial intelligence. Because of its ubiquity, logic has acquired a <br>\ncentral role in Computer Science education.</p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<hr>\n<p>New results in the fields of computational logic and applications are welcome. <br>\nAlso welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open <br>\nquestions and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories and practices.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* Automated reasoning<br>\n   * Verification<br>\n   * Interactive theorem proving and proof assistants<br>\n   * Model checking<br>\n   * Implementations of logic<br>\n   * Satisfiability modulo theories<br>\n   * Rewriting and unification<br>\n   * Logic programming<br>\n   * Satisfiability checking<br>\n   * Constraint programming<br>\n   * Decision procedures<br>\n   * Logic and the Web<br>\n   * Ontologies and large knowledge bases<br>\n   * Logic and databases<br>\n   * Modal and temporal logics<br>\n   * Program analysis<br>\n   * Foundations of security<br>\n   * Description logics<br>\n   * Non-monotonic reasoning<br>\n   * Specification using logics<br>\n   * Logic in artificial intelligence<br>\n   * Logic and types<br>\n   * Logical foundations of programming<br>\n   * Logical aspects of concurrency<br>\n   * Logic and computational complexity<br>\n   * Knowledge representation and reasoning<br>\n   * Logic of distributed systems</p>\n<p>Programme Chairs</p>\n<hr>\n<p>* Ed Clarke<br>\n   * Andrei Voronkov</p>\n<p>Programme Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>* Rajeev Alur<br>\n   * Matthias Baaz<br>\n   * Peter Baumgartner<br>\n   * Armin Biere<br>\n   * Nikolaj Bjorner<br>\n   * Iliano Cervesato<br>\n   * Agata Ciabattoni<br>\n   * Hubert Comon-Lundh<br>\n   * Nachum Dershowitz<br>\n   * Juergen Giesl<br>\n   * Guillem Godoy<br>\n   * Georg Gottlob<br>\n   * Jean Goubault-Larrecq<br>\n   * Reiner Haehnle<br>\n   * Claude Kirchner<br>\n   * Michael Kohlhase<br>\n   * Konstantin Korovin<br>\n   * Laura Kovacs<br>\n   * Orna Kupferman<br>\n   * Leonid Libkin<br>\n   * Aart Middeldorp<br>\n   * Luke Ong<br>\n   * Frank Pfenning<br>\n   * Andreas Podelski<br>\n   * Andrey Rybalchenko<br>\n   * Helmut Seidl<br>\n   * Geoff Sutcliffe<br>\n   * Ashish Tiwari<br>\n   * Toby Walsh<br>\n   * Christoph Weidenbach</p>\n<p>Submission Details</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions of two kinds are welcome:</p>\n<p>* Regular papers containing new results;<br>\n  * Experimental papers describing implementation or evaluation of systems.</p>\n<p>All submitted papers must be original, and not submitted concurrently to a <br>\njournal or another conference.
