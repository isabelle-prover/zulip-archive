The 2008 edition will be held in Doha, <br>\nQatar, on the premises of the Qatar campus of Carnegie Mellon <br>\nUniversity.</p>\n<p>Logic is a fundamental organizing principle in nearly all areas in <br>\nComputer Science. It runs a multifaceted gamut from the foundational <br>\nto the applied. At one extreme, it underlies computability and <br>\ncomplexity theory and the formal semantics of programming languages. <br>\nAt the other, it drives billions of gates every day in the digital <br>\ncircuits of processors of all kinds. Logic is in itself a powerful <br>\nprogramming paradigm but it is also the quintessential specification <br>\nlanguage for anything ranging from real-time critical systems to <br>\nnetworked infrastructures. It is logical techniques that link <br>\nimplementation and specification through formal methods such as <br>\nautomated theorem proving and model checking. Logic is also the stuff <br>\nof knowledge representation and artificial intelligence. Because of <br>\nits ubiquity, logic has acquired a central role in Computer Science <br>\neducation.</p>\n<p>New results in the fields of computational logic and applications are <br>\nwelcome. Also welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may <br>\nexamine open questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing <br>\ntheories and practices. Topics of interest include, but are not <br>\nlimited to:</p>\n<p>* Automated reasoning<br>\n     * Interactive theorem proving<br>\n     * Implementations of logic<br>\n     * Proof assistants<br>\n     * Program and system verification<br>\n     * Model checking<br>\n     * Rewriting and unification<br>\n     * Logic programming<br>\n     * Constraint programming<br>\n     * Logic and databases<br>\n     * Modal and temporal logics<br>\n     * Proof-carrying code<br>\n     * Translation validation<br>\n     * Logic for the semantic web<br>\n     * Foundations of security<br>\n     * Description logics<br>\n     * Non-monotonic reasoning<br>\n     * Specification using logics<br>\n     * Logic in artificial intelligence<br>\n     * Lambda calculus<br>\n     * Constructive logic and type theory<br>\n     * Computional interpretations of logic<br>\n     * Logical foundations of programming<br>\n     * Logical aspects of concurrency<br>\n     * Logic and computational complexity<br>\n     * Knowledge representation and reasoning<br>\n     * Reasoning about actions<br>\n     * Proof planning<br>\n     * Effectively presented structures<br>\n     * Logic of distributed systems</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It has been a tradition of LPAR to invite some of the most influential <br>\nresearchers in the focus areas to discuss their work and their vision <br>\nfor their fields. We are honored that the following members of the <br>\ncommunity have accepted this invitation.</p>\n<p>* Edmund Clarke, Carnegie Mellon University (USA)</p>\n<p>Other invited speakers will be announced soon</p>\n<p>Submission Instructions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions must not substantially overlap papers that have been <br>\npublished or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a <br>\nconference with proceedings. Papers should be submitted in Portable <br>\nDocument Format (PDF); papers submitted in a proprietary word <br>\nprocessor format such as Microsoft Word cannot be considered. <br>\nSubmissions can be of two types:</p>\n<p>* Regular papers are meant to describe solid new research <br>\nresults. They can be up to 15 pages long in LNCS style, including <br>\nfigures, bibliography and appendices.</p>\n<p>* Short papers are intended to report on interesting work in <br>\nprogress. They can be at most 5 pages long in the LNCS style.</p>\n<p>Papers can be electronically submitted by visiting <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlpar2008\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlpar2008</a><br>\n. Prospective authors are required to register a title and an abstract <br>\na week before the paper submission deadline (see below).</p>\n<p>As with the previous editions, the accepted regular papers of LPAR'08 <br>\nwill be published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in<br>\nComputer Science series. They will be available at the conference.</p>\n<p>Programme Committe Chairs</p>\n<hr>\n<p>* Iliano Cervesato (Carnegie Mellon University, Qatar)<br>\n     * Helmut Veith (Technische Universit=E4t Darmstadt, Germany)<br>\n     * Andrei Voronkov (University of Manchester, UK)</p>\n<p>Participation</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of <br>\nthem will be present at the conference. Papers that do not adhere to <br>\nthis policy will be removed from the proceedings.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Abstract submission deadline:   26 May 2008<br>\nPaper submission deadline:  06 June 2008<br>\nNotification of acceptance:     29 August 2008<br>\nCamera-ready papers:    19 September 2008<br>\nLPAR'08 Workshops:  22 November 2008<br>\nLPAR 2008:  23-27 November 2008</p>",
