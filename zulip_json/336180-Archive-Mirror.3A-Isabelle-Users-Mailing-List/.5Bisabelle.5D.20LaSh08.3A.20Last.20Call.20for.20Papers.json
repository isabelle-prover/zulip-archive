Such objects are often represented as<br>\n(finite) structures, which are implicitly specified by means of<br>\ntheories in some logic. Thus, languages are needed to describe<br>\nstructures, and algorithms to extract them from these implicit<br>\ndescriptions. Propositional Satisfiability (SAT), Constraint<br>\nProgramming (CP), and Answer Set Programming (ASP) are arguably the<br>\nthree most prominent areas that develop such languages and techniques.</p>\n<p>Each of these areas has been proposed as a declarative programming<br>\napproach to solving NP-complete combinatorial problems. Such problems<br>\nabound in computer science, engineering, operations research<br>\ncomputational biology and other fields. In many cases, progress is<br>\nlimited by the difficulty of designing implicit representations of<br>\nstructures (modeling), which hinders common acceptance of the aproach,<br>\nand the inability to solve sufficiently large instances of the<br>\nproblems in practical time bounds (search algorithms). Therefore,<br>\nthese three areas have as a major goal the development of practical<br>\nmodeling languages and methodologies that support the modeling, and<br>\nalgorithms and tools for efficient problem solving.</p>\n<p>Despite the similar goals of these areas, in many respects SAT, ASP and<br>\nCP develop as three independent disciplines, focusing on rather different<br>\nparticular problems or questions.  There are few, if any, researchers<br>\nwho are experts in all three areas. To date, we are not aware of any<br>\nmeeting which specifically aims at bringing these three areas together.</p>\n<p>Objectives<br>\n==========</p>\n<p>LaSh08 aims to offer a discussion forum for research in SAT, ASP and<br>\nCP that focuses on the computation of structures from declarative<br>\ndescriptions.  We invite contributions on modeling languages,<br>\nmethodologies, theoretical analysis, techniques, algorithms and<br>\nsystems. The forum is an occasion to exchange ideas on the<br>\nstate-of-the-art; to discuss specific technical problems; to formulate<br>\nchallenges and opportunities ahead; to analyse differences and<br>\nsimularities between the different areas; to study opportunities for<br>\nsynergy and integration.</p>\n<p>In particular, we would like to foster exchange at least on the<br>\nfollowing topics:</p>\n<p>-- integrations of  SAT, ASP and/or CP technologies<br>\n -- comparisons of modeling languages <br>\n -- criteria for choice of modeling languages <br>\n     (for modeling convenience or efficiency) <br>\n -- new algorithm directions<br>\n -- efficient modeling  strategies <br>\n -- new  applications <br>\n -- complexity results, tractable subsets  <br>\n -- completeness results (e.g. capturing complexity classes)<br>\n -- methods for taking advantage of tractability results<br>\n -- SAT modulo theories<br>\n -- solver implementation techniques,<br>\n -- algorithms for grounding <br>\n -- modeling languages and constructs <br>\n    (aggregates, global constraints,..)<br>\n -- search control and heuristics in the context of model generation<br>\n -- symmetry breaking in model construction<br>\n -- optimisation problems in model construction: <br>\n        -- languages for optimality criteria; <br>\n        -- algorithms for computing optimal models</p>\n<p>Systems and Tools:<br>\n===================</p>\n<p>LaSh08 will also provide an opportunity for presentation of implemented<br>\nsystems and tools at a demo session. Thus, we invite submissions of<br>\nsystems and tools that reflect the above ideas, and aim at facilitating<br>\ndeclarative problem solving, and making it practical and used.</p>\n<p>Workshop format:<br>\n================</p>\n<p>The workshops objective is to create an informal, stimulating<br>\natmosphere for exchange of ideas. We invite also reports of work in<br>\nprogress. There will be informal proceedings. </p>\n<p>Invited speakers<br>\n=================</p>\n<p>* Pascal Van Hentenryck, Brown University, <br>\n      \"Constraint Programming at Work \".</p>\n<p>* Robert Nieuwenhuis, Technical University of Catalonia, <br>\n      \"The Barcelogic approach to search: fast and robust but expressive\".</p>\n<p>Organizing Committee <br>\n====================</p>\n<p>* Enrico Giunchiglia,  University of Genova<br>\n    * Victor Marek,  University of Kentucky<br>\n    * David Mitchell,   Simon Fraser University<br>\n    * Eugenia Ternovska  Simon Fraser University <br>\n    * Mirek Truzczynski,  University of Kentucky<br>\n    * Marc Denecker, K.U.Leuven </p>\n<p>Program Chair<br>\n=============</p>\n<p>* Marc Denecker, K.U.Leuven</p>\n<p>Program Committee<br>\n=================</p>\n<p>* Peter Baumgartner, The Australian National University<br>\n    * Francesco Calimeri, University of Calabria<br>\n    * Koen Claessen,  Chalmers University of Technology<br>\n    * Thomas Eiter, Vienna University of Technology<br>\n    * Wolfgang Faber, University of Calabria<br>\n    * Pierre Flener, Uppsala University<br>\n    * Alan Frisch, University of York<br>\n    * Enrico Giunchiglia, University of Genova<br>\n    * Daniel LeBerre,  Universite d'Artois<br>\n    * Fangzen Lin, Hong kong University of Science and Technology<br>\n    * Ines Lynce, Universidade Tecnica de Lisboa<br>\n    * Tony Mancini, Sapienza Universita di Roma<br>\n    * Victor Marek, University of Kentucky<br>\n    * David Mitchell, Simon Fraser University<br>\n    * Pierre Marquis, Universite d'Artois<br>\n    * Ilkka Niemela, Helsinki University of Technology<br>\n    * Karem Sakallah, University of Michigan<br>\n    * Torsten Schaub, University of Potsdam<br>\n    * Barry O'Sullivan, University College Cork<br>\n    * Eugenia Ternovska  Simon Fraser University<br>\n    * Mirek Truszcznski, University of Kentucky<br>\n    * Pascal Van Hentenryck, Brown University <br>\n    * Toby Walsh, University of New South Wales</p>\n<p>Local organisation<br>\n====================</p>\n<p>* Marc Denecker, K.U.Leuven<br>\n    * Joost Vennekens, K.U.Leuven </p>\n<p>Location <br>\n=========</p>\n<p>The workshop will take place in the Beguinage of Leuven,<br>\nBelgium.
