P}. Is this behavior intended?</p>\n<p>I prepared a small example theory showing what I mean:</p>\n<p>theory Test<br>\nimports Main \"~~/src/HOL/Library/LaTeXsugar\"<br>\nbegin<br>\ndatatype fool = Fool</p>\n<p>fun silly::\"fool ⇒ nat set\" where<br>\n   \"silly Fool = {x. x≤7}\"</p>\n<p>text{*<br>\nIn the above function definition,  the set expression on the<br>\nright side of the equation is not processed by LaTeXsugar, while<br>\nhere, @{term \"{x. x≤ 7}\"} it is.<br>\n*}<br>\nend</p>\n<p>Best!</p>",

If you were to write @{thm silly_def} in the same text block, it would show the set comprehension as you expect.</p>\n<p>The literal proof text above the “text {*” block is printed exactly as written without any pretty printing.</p>\n<p>What I usually do for papers is to use only antiquotations and no literal proof text.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
