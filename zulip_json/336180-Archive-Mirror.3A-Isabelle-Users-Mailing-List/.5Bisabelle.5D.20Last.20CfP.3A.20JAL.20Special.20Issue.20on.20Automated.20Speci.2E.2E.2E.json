Both participants of the workshop and other<br>\nauthors are invited to submit contributions.</p>\n<p>The increased complexity of Web sites and the explosive growth<br>\nof Web-based applications has turned their design and<br>\nconstruction into a challenging problem. Nowadays, many<br>\ncompanies have diverted their Web sites into interactive,<br>\ncompletely-automated, Web-based applications (such as Amazon,<br>\non-line banking, or travel agencies) with a high complexity<br>\nthat requires appropriate specification and verification<br>\ntechniques and tools. Systematic, formal approaches to the<br>\nanalysis and verification can address the problems of this<br>\nparticular domain with automated and reliable tools that also<br>\nincorporate semantic aspects.</p>\n<p>We solicit original papers on logic-based methods and<br>\ntechniques applied to Web sites, Web services or Web-based<br>\napplications, such as:</p>\n<p>* Rule-based approaches to Web systems analysis, certification,<br>\n    specification, verification, and optimization</p>\n<p>* Algebraic methods for verification and certification of Web<br>\n    systems</p>\n<p>* Formal models for describing and reasoning about Web systems<br>\n  * Model-checking, synthesis and debugging of Web systems<br>\n  * Abstract interpretation and program transformation applied to<br>\n    the semantic Web</p>\n<p>* Intelligent tutoring and advisory systems for Web<br>\n    specifications authoring</p>\n<p>* Web quality and Web metrics<br>\n  * Web usability and accessibility<br>\n  * Testing and evaluation of Web systems and applications</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We expect original articles (typically 15-25 pages; submission<br>\nof larger papers will be evaluated depending on editorial<br>\nconstraints) that present high-quality contributions that have<br>\nnot been previously published and that must not be<br>\nsimultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Submissions must comply with JAL's author guidelines. They must<br>\nbe written in English and should be prepared using the Elsevier<br>\nLaTeX package.</p>\n<p>Submissions are encouraged via the EasyChair submission system:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jalwwv2010\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jalwwv2010</a>.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<hr>\n<p>* Submission of papers: March 7, 2011.<br>\n  * Notification: June 6, 2011.</p>\n<p>GUEST EDITORS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>* Laura Kov√°cs (Vienna University of Technology)<br>\n  * Temur Kutsia (RISC, Johannes Kepler University Linz)</p>",
