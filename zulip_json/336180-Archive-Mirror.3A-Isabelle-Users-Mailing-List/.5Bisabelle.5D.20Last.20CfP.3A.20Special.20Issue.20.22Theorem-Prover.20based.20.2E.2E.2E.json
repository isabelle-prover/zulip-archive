This year's conference held in Novi Sad,<br>\nSerbia, leads to a special issue with this scope:</p>\n<p>Recently and largely unnoticed in public, applications in science and<br>\ntechnology drove the development of automated and interactive theorem<br>\nproving technologies, which have become of major importance for mathe-<br>\nmatics and computer science in academia and in industry. However,<br>\ntheir potential for a wide-spread education technology is unexplored,<br>\nin spite of the fact, that TP exhibits features relevant for  educati-<br>\nonal systems:<br>\n. TP supports automated checks of user-input: since input states a<br>\n   lemma to be proved within the logical context of a proof, a cal-<br>\n   culation or a geometric construction, TP checks user-input without<br>\n   specific code for large classes of input. Such automation brings<br>\n   systems for step-wise problem solving within reach.<br>\n. TP covers the whole problem solving process: since TP implements<br>\n   reasoning -- the core of mathematical thinking, it supports all steps<br>\n   in problem solving (mathematising, comparing specifications, reason-<br>\n   ing and arguing, trying various strategies, until a solution can be<br>\n   verified).<br>\n. TP has underlying knowledge in a human readable format (following<br>\n   the LCF-paradigm): mathematics  knowledge is mechanized down to<br>\n   \"first principles\" beginning from basic axioms and definitions; so<br>\n   presenting explanations to learners is not an issue of implementa-<br>\n   tion but an issue of filtering off details.<br>\nThese features are distinguished from present educational mathematics<br>\nsoftware, from CAS, DGS, Spreadsheets etc. such that they promote a<br>\nnew generation of educational math assistants. Several prototypes are<br>\nunder construction in academic R&amp;D for geometry, algebra and appli-<br>\ncations in engineering disciplines. So it seems in time to publish<br>\nTP's potential and expected impact on educational practice in a<br>\nspecial issue.</p>\n<p>===Important Dates</p>\n<p>Deadline:                 September 15, 2012<br>\nSubmission:               16 pages pdf<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cadgme12-edutps\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cadgme12-edutps</a>  <br>\nPreliminary notification: October 22, 2012<br>\nFinal notification        due to eJMT referees<br>\nExpected publication:     Spring 2013</p>\n<p>===Submission Details</p>\n<p>We expect original articles (typically 12-18 pages) that present high-<br>\nquality contributions that have not been previously published in an<br>\narchival venue and that must not be simultaneously submitted for<br>\npublication elsewhere.<br>\nGuidelineshttps://php.radford.edu/~ejmt/SubmissionGuidelines.php</p>\n<p>===Program Committee</p>\n<p>Roman Has(ek, University of South Bohemia<br>\nZlatan Magajna, University of Ljubljana<br>\nFilip Maric, University of Belgrade<br>\nWalther Neuper, Graz University of Technology<br>\nPavel Pech, University of South Bohemia<br>\nRein Prank, University of Tartu<br>\nto be completed</p>\n<p>===Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>. Features of TP which have specific potential for innovating educati-<br>\n   onal software<br>\n.Descriptions of systems which implement TP components, and expected<br>\n   impact on innovating education<br>\n.Reports from field-tests for TP-based systems<br>\n. What are novel promises of TP for open learning scenarios in class,<br>\n   independent learning at home, in renewed math and science education?<br>\n. How can TP provide additional challenges for gifted and interested<br>\n   students as well as extra tuition to catch up on, particularly for<br>\n   \"slow but rigorous thinkers\"?<br>\n. What is the gain for designing curricula, when respective math know-<br>\n   ledge can be mechanized and is available \"from first principles\"?<br>\n. What is the gain for evaluation and assessment, when the same soft-<br>\n   ware can be used for learning as well as for assessment (because for<br>\n   the latter only supportive functionality needs to be reduced)?<br>\n. How can TP-based systems support and enforce continuity between<br>\n   \"intuitive\" math at high-school and \"formal\" math at university?<br>\n. Are there ideas for open price competitions addressing the public in<br>\n   interactive mathematical challenges via \"cloud computing\"?</p>",
