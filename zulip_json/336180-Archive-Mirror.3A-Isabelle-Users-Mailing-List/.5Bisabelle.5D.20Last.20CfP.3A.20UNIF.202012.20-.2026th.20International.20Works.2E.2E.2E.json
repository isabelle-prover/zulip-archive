Previous editions of UNIF <br>\nhave taken place mostly in Europe, but also in USA and Japan. <br>\nFor more details on previous UNIF workshops, please see the UNIF <br>\nhomepage at &lt;<a href=\"http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~treinen/unif/\">http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~treinen/unif/</a>&gt;.</p>\n<p>The aim of UNIF 2012, as that of the previous meetings, is to <br>\nbring together researchers interested in unification theory and <br>\nrelated topics, to present recent (even unfinished) work, and <br>\ndiscuss new ideas and trends in this and related fields. This <br>\nincludes scientific presentations, but also descriptions of <br>\napplications and software using unification as a strong component.</p>\n<p>A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes: unification <br>\nalgorithms, calculi and implementations, equational unification <br>\nand unification modulo theories, unification in modal, temporal <br>\nand description logics, admissibility of inference rules, narrowing,<br>\nmatching algorithms, constraint solving, combination problems, <br>\ndisunification, higher-order unification, type checking and <br>\nreconstruction, typed unification, complexity issues, query answering,<br>\nimplementation techniques and applications of unification.</p>\n<p>Submissions and Publication: Before the workshop, authors are <br>\ninvited to submit an extended abstract (max. 5 pages) to be <br>\nformatted in LNCS style through the EasyChair submission site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=unif2012\">https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=unif2012</a></p>\n<p>Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop and included <br>\nin the preliminary proceedings, available at the workshop. We <br>\nenvisage publication of a special issue of a journal dedicated to <br>\nUNIF after the event.</p>\n<p>Important Dates:</p>\n<h1>Submission: April 27</h1>\n<h1>Notification: May 18</h1>\n<h1>Final version: June 1</h1>\n<h1>Workshop: July 1</h1>\n<p>Programme Committee:</p>\n<h1>Franz Baader, TU Dresden, Germany</h1>\n<h1>Christoph Benzmueller, Free University Berlin, Germany</h1>\n<h1>Santiago Escobar, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Spain (co-chair)</h1>\n<h1>Maribel Fernandez, King's College London, UK</h1>\n<h1>Silvio Ghilardi, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Italy</h1>\n<h1>Rosalie Iemhoff, Utrecht University, The Netherlands</h1>\n<h1>Konstantin Korovin, University of Manchester, UK (co-chair)</h1>\n<h1>Jordi Levy, IIIA - CSIC, Spain</h1>\n<h1>Christopher Lynch, Clarkson University, USA</h1>\n<h1>George Metcalfe, Vanderbilt University, USA</h1>\n<h1>Paliath Narendran, University at Albany, USA</h1>\n<h1>Vladimir Rybakov, Manchester Metropolitan University, UK (co-chair)</h1>\n<p>For more information, please contact any of the three chairs<br>\nSantiago Escobar, Konstantin Korovin, Vladimir Rybakov</p>",
