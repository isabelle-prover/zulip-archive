Module systems help with the tedious tasks of<br>\norganizing, sharing, and maintaining libraries.  In the view of the<br>\never increasing complexity of this network of information, module<br>\nsystems offer many of the answers to the practical problems that proof<br>\nassistant system developers face today and can therefore be seen as an<br>\nemerging research for the automated deduction community.</p>\n<p>The proposed workshop aims to attract and bring together researchers<br>\nand practitioners with background and experience in module systems from<br>\ndifferent logic based systems, such as theorem provers, proof<br>\nassistants, and programming languages.  Because it is affiliated with<br>\nCADE, the workshop will provide the fertile venue for the exchange of<br>\nideas and experiences and has the potential to impact the way we organize<br>\nproofs and programs in the future.</p>\n<p>The broad aim of the proposed workshop is to run a short, but highly<br>\nfocused meeting, which will provide researchers with a forum to review<br>\nstate-of-the-art results and techniques, from theory to practice of<br>\nmodule systems and to present recent and new progress in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The design of module systems for programming languages and proof<br>\n  systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The implementation of formal digital libraries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>System descriptions of existing module systems, for example ML<br>\n  modules, type classes, Coq's, or Agda's module system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies regarding information retrieval, sharing, and<br>\n  management of change.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experience reports of industrial practitioners, using HOL,<br>\n  Isabell/HOL, PVS, or other proof assistants.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>* Stefan Berghofer, Technische Universität München, Germany<br>\n    * Derek Dreyer, MPI-SWS, Saarbruecken, Germany<br>\n    * Hugo Herbelin, INRIA, France<br>\n    * Conor McBride, University of Nottingham, Great Britain<br>\n    * Till Mossakowski, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence<br>\n    * Ulf Norell, Chalmers University, Sweden<br>\n    * Randy Pollack, University of Edinburgh, Great Britain<br>\n    * Florian Rabe, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany<br>\n    * Carsten Schuermann, IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark</p>\n<p>Paper Submissions:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mlpa09\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mlpa09</a></p>\n<p>Three categories of papers are solicited:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Category A: Detailed and technical accounts of new research: up to<br>\n  fifteen pages including bibliography.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Category B: Shorter accounts of work in progress and proposed<br>\n  further directions, including discussion papers: up to eight pages<br>\n  including bibliography and appendices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Category C: System descriptions presenting an implemented tool and<br>\n  its novel features: up to six pages.
