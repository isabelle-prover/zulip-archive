Left and right limits are a special case. For<br>\nexample, you can express the limits of your function f at zero like<br>\nthis:</p>\n<p>definition f :: \"real =&gt; real\" where \"f x = x / abs x\"<br>\nterm \"(f ---&gt; 1) (at 0 within {0..})\"<br>\nterm \"(f ---&gt; -1) (at 0 within {..0})\"</p>\n<p>The \"within\" operator is defined in src/HOL/Limits.thy. It was based<br>\non a similar operation in John Harrison's formalization of<br>\nmultivariate analysis in HOL-Light.</p>\n<p>I don't know if there are very many useful lemmas for reasoning about<br>\n\"within\"; you might find some more in the HOL/Multivariate_Analysis<br>\ndirectory.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If not, I need to define this for my formalization.

Again, I believe this is also based on Harrison's<br>\nHOL-Light theories, and uses similar notation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brian</li>\n</ul>",
