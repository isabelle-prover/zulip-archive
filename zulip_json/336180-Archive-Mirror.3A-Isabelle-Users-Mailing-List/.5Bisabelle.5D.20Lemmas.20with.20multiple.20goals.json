Suppose that I have a lemma of<br>\nthe form</p>\n<p>lemma X:<br>\n  assumes \"Assumption\"<br>\n  shows \"Goal1\" and \"Goal2\"<br>\nsorry</p>\n<p>Now, suppose that I want to apply this argument and prove</p>\n<p>lemma \"Goal1\" and \"Goal2\"</p>\n<p>Something that I would like to have is</p>\n<p>lemma \"Goal1\" and \"Goal2\"<br>\nproof (rule X)<br>\n   show \"Assumption\"<br>\n     sorry<br>\nqed</p>\n<p>However, this does not work (it seems that only X(1) is applied). Of<br>\ncourse, I could write a proof like</p>\n<p>lemma \"Goal1\" and \"Goal2\"<br>\nproof-<br>\n  have \"Assumption\"<br>\n    sorry<br>\n  thus \"Goal1\" and \"Goal2\"<br>\n    using X<br>\n    by auto<br>\nqed</p>\n<p>but the first proofs structure seems most natural so I was wandering is<br>\nthere a way to apply it. BTW, since there is no ?thesis when multiple<br>\ngoals are present, is there a way of not retyping \"Goal1\" and \"Goal2\" in<br>\nthe second proof?</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nFilip</p>",
