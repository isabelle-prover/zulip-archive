Moreover, ML quoted<br>\n     inside Isar can antiquote logic/Isar expressions.

The other extreme is to explicitly write every single step <br>\nin Isar (as I know from myself and many students I taught, mostly <br>\nbeginners use this kind of proofs... of course it also depends on your <br>\nintended audience).</p>\n<p>In my opinion both extremes are bad. It is an art (as is often pointed <br>\nout in Isar related manuals) to write Isar proofs that are readable yet <br>\nnot too verbose. But if you master this art, the gain is that others can <br>\nactually read your proofs and follow the steps without even starting <br>\nIsabelle (which is definitely not the case with the technique shown by <br>\nJeremy; so I would rather use that technique that are considered <br>\n\"trivial\" by humans... but then again humans are often wrong in their <br>\ninitial judgment of what is trivial ;)).</p>\n<p>I guess what I want to say is that no, proofs do not have to be <br>\nexceedingly long in many cases, but sometimes long versions (or rather <br>\nversions of appropriate length) are much better to read and maintain.</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",
