The front-ends <br>\nthen tranform (and keep) things in their own \"native\" format, i.e. some <br>\nsubset of unicode that is empirically known to work most of the time, <br>\nespecially in copy-paste between different front-end programs.</p>\n<p>For HTML one has to cope with a range of browsers and details about system <br>\nfonts, so it is less ambitious in rendering the infinitely many prover <br>\nsymbols in unicode.  Isabelle/jEdit does more here, according to what is <br>\npossible on the JVM, but there are also some dropouts like \\&lt;A&gt; in jEdit <br>\ndue to the imbecile \"surrogate characters\" of the UTF-16 standard.</p>\n<p>For Java 7.x/8.x and JavaFx 2.x/3.x Oracle has a certain strategy to make <br>\nhigh-quality HTML5 rendering available as part of the standard <br>\ndistribution of the Java Runtime Environment.  This technology is based on <br>\nWebkit, which is also used by Apple for Safari, for example.  Thus there <br>\nare reasons to believe that within 2 years we can be more ambitious in <br>\nusing Unicode in HTML presentation, by using the JVM browser instead of <br>\npotentially old MS Explorers or Firefoxes that users might have already. <br>\nThis will also allow to unify browser and editor views further.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
