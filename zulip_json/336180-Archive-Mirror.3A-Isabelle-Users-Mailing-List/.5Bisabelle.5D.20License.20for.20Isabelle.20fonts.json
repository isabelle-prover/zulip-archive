I did not find a clear <br>\nlicense for these fonts, so I am wondering if this is permitted. There <br>\nis a README file in the Isabelle fonts directory describing all the <br>\n(free) licenses of the fonts they are made of, so I guess Isabelle fonts <br>\nare meant to be free, but I would prefer to have something more explicit <br>\n(especially if this ends up being published in a journal).</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nSebastien</p>",

I should probably have<br>\nchanged the README as well.</p>\n<p>BTW, \"Isabelle code\" is an unfitting term for the formal document<br>\nsources that we have in Isabelle/Isar. Historically, \"code\" is something<br>\nthat is only machine readable, but the point of Isar is to make it both<br>\nmachine-readable and human-readable.</p>\n<p>The general trend is to make Isabelle source more and more look like the<br>\nactual document, such that it can be printed mostly verbatim. E.g. see<br>\nthe recent addition of fancy markdown list notation.</p>\n<p>To this end, I intend to replace the hand-edited Isabelle fonts by a<br>\nlittle Isabelle/Scala front-end to fontforge that turns suitable base<br>\nfonts into ones containing our Isabelle symbols. In particular, I would<br>\nlike to see non-monospaced Isabelle fonts for really high-quality<br>\nprinting of Isabelle document sources.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
