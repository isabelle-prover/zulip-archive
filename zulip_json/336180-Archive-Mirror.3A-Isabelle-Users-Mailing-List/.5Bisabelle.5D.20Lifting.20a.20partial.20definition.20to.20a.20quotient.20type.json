Yes, I agree, I could certainly change disj_union to be a fully defined operator. It's just that the textbook definition, to which I'm trying to be faithful, says \"We write $S \\uplus T$ for the union of two sets S and T known or assumed to be disjoint\".</p>\n<p>Just to make sure that I understand the totality of HOL as well as I think I do, I'll argue against your point that my disj_union is equivalent to union. I can prove \"{a} union {a} = {a}\", but I can't prove \"{a} disj_union {a} = {a}\".</p>\n<p>john</p>",
