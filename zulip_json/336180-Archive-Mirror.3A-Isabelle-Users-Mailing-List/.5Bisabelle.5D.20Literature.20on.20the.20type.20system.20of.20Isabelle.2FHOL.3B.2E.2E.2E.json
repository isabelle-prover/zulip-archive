Andrews, 2002, p. 205], or, vice versa, the reducibility of <br>\nmathematics to a minimal set of primitive rules and symbols. [...] For the <br>\nphilosopher it is not proof automation but expressiveness that is the main <br>\ncriterion, such that the method with the least amount of rules of inferences, <br>\ni.e., a Hilbert-style system, is preferred, and all other rules become derived <br>\nrules.\"<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-July/msg00028.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-July/msg00028.html</a></p>\n<p>Similarly, the HOL4 document argues in favor of definitions instead of <br>\nintroducing new axioms: \"The advantages of postulation over definition have <br>\nbeen likened by Bertrand Russell to the advantages of theft over honest toil. <br>\nAs it is all too easy to introduce inconsistent axiomatizations, users of the <br>\nHOL system are strongly advised to resist the temptation to add axioms, but to <br>\ntoil through definitional theories honestly.\" [p. 33]<br>\nIn the same manner, I wrote: \"One consequence [...] is to avoid the use of <br>\nnon-logical axioms. [...] The appropriate way to deal with objects of certain <br>\nproperties is to create a set of objects with these properties.\" [Kubota, 2015, <br>\np. 29]<br>\nFor this reason, in the R0 implementation, the group axioms are expressed not <br>\nas axioms, but as properties in the definition of \"Grp\" (wff 266):<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.kenkubota.de/files/R0_draft_excerpt_with_definitions_and_groups.pdf\">http://www.kenkubota.de/files/R0_draft_excerpt_with_definitions_and_groups.pdf</a> (p. 359)</p>\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n<p>Ken Kubota</p>\n<p>Sources</p>\n<p>[S1] The Isabelle/Isar Reference Manual (February 17, 2016)<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle2016/doc/isar-ref.pdf\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle2016/doc/isar-ref.pdf</a></p>\n<p>[S2] Reference in the e-mail written by Corey Richardson<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-July/msg00070.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-July/msg00070.html</a></p>\n<p>Dmitry Traytel / Andrei Popescu / Jasmin C.

In addition, online <br>\navailability of the 1985 version (UCAM-CL-TR-68) is desirable, as it is still <br>\nof historical interest.</p>\n<p>Also, I would like to thank Tom Melham for bringing to my attention his <br>\napproach of implementing in the HOL logic the idea of explicit quantification <br>\nover type variables as presented by Andrews in 1965: \"I have found Andrews' <br>\nbook [1] invaluable in working out many of the technical details of the <br>\nextension to HOL proposed here.\"<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/tom.melham/pub/Melham-1994-HLE.pdf\">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/tom.melham/pub/Melham-1994-HLE.pdf</a> (p. 15)</p>\n<p>I have addressed this issue and discussed details in my draft: \"It has to be <br>\nnoted that already in his PhD thesis 'A Transfinite Type Theory with Type <br>\nVariables' published in 1965 Andrews is very near to developing a dependent <br>\ntype theory. [...] In the system Q with type variables the universal quantifier <br>\n(โ) becomes a true variable binder in the case of types, but in the case of <br>\nterms (objects) a definition depending on ฮป.\" [Kubota, 2015, p. 31] However, <br>\nfor some reason Andrews refrained from directly using lambda as type variable <br>\nbinder, which would exhibit the reducibility of the variable binders to a <br>\nsingle one, as was done in R0.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>In the LOGIC part of the documentation of the current HOL system, reference <br>\nis made to Rule R of Andrews' logic Q0: \"From a logical point of view it would <br>\nbe better to have a simpler substitution primitive, such as 'Rule R' of <br>\nAndrews' logic Q0, and then to derive more complex rules from it.\"<br>\n<a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10-logic.pdf</a> (p. 27)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Is it possible to figure out the author of this sentence? I am considering <br>\nquoting it and would like to credit authorship in such a case.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Preferring definitions over the use of non-logical axioms as discussed at<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-August/msg00046.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-August/msg00046.html</a><br>\nhas a major advantage to be mentioned. If the conditions are not introduced as <br>\naxioms, but as properties within the definition, and these conditions later <br>\nturn out to be contradictory, they do not render the system inconsistent as a <br>\nwhole, but only demonstrate that no mathematical object (\"model\") can satisfy <br>\nthese conditions, which is formally expressed by the emptiness of the defined <br>\nset, which is the desired result (in the simplest case concerning the types, <br>\ni.e., a unary predicate; otherwise tuples may be used).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For this reason, and for other reasons, such as not constraining expressiveness <br>\nof the system, instead of postulating a (non-logical) Axiom of Infinity <br>\n(usually over the type of individuals), the Peano axioms should be part of the <br>\ndefinition of natural numbers (which can be expressed without axioms quite <br>\nsimply and naturally in dependent type theory), that guarantees the set to be <br>\ninfinite: \"Actually, any set satisfying postulates P1-P4 must be infinite.\" <br>\n[Andrews, 2002, p. 259] Then there is no need to add an Axiom of Infinity as <br>\nAxiom 6, which extends Q0 to Q0^inf [cf. Andrews, 2002, p. 259].</p>\n<p>For the same reasons, the use of language elements which make implicit use of <br>\naxioms should be avoided. Gordon correctly states: \"The inclusion of <br>\n[epsilon]-terms into HOL 'builds in' the Axiom of Choice [...].\" Somewhat <br>\nearlier on the same page, he quite frankly confesses: \"It must be admitted that <br>\nthe [epsilon]-operator looks rather suspicious.\"<br>\n<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.27.6103&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.27.6103&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a> (p. 24)<br>\nImplicit use of the Axiom of Choice can be avoided by using the description <br>\noperator instead, like in Q0 and R0, where it is the counterpart to identity <br>\n(equality) [cf. Andrews, 2002, pp. 211, 213; Kubota, 2015].<br>\nFor example, the \"conditional term Cond t t_1 t_2 (meaning 'if t then t_1 else <br>\nt_2')\" \"defined using the [epsilon]-operator\" at<br>\n<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.27.6103&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.27.6103&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a> (p. 24)<br>\ncan be defined using the description operator [cf. Andrews, 2002, pp. 235 f. <br>\n(5313)]; software verification of the formal proof has been provided in <br>\n[Kubota, 2015, pp. 165-174]. The (verification of the) formal proof and the <br>\naxioms for R0 have now been made available online at:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.kenkubota.de/files/R0_draft_excerpt_with_axioms_and_proof_of_C_function.pdf\">http://www.kenkubota.de/files/R0_draft_excerpt_with_axioms_and_proof_of_C_function.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Please note that in Axiom 5 (Axiom of Descriptions) and throughout the whole <br>\nsystem the primitive symbol for identity (equality) 'Q' used in Q0 [cf. <br>\nAndrews, 2002, pp. 211, 213] was eliminated and replaced by the identity symbol <br>\n'=' in R0, as the symbol 'Q' syntactically doesn't have an own independent <br>\nfunction:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.kenkubota.de/files/R0_draft_excerpt_with_axioms_and_proof_of_C_function.pdf\">http://www.kenkubota.de/files/R0_draft_excerpt_with_axioms_and_proof_of_C_function.pdf</a> (pp. 351 f.)<br>\nIt then becomes even more obvious that description is the counterpart to <br>\nidentity, extracting the single element from a singleton (unit set), and <br>\neliminating the identity symbol '='.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Rule R is indeed presented by Andrews as the \"single rule of inference\" <br>\n[Andrews, 2002, p. 213] of Q0. However, already on the following page, a <br>\nvariant, Rule R', is specified [cf. p. 214], which also takes into account a <br>\nset of hypotheses. Hence, logically, one might regard Rule R' as the general <br>\nrule and Rule R only as the special case in which the set of hypotheses is <br>\nempty.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Technically, both Rule R and Rule R' are implemented in the dependent type <br>\ntheory R0 as two different routines due to the access to different parts of the <br>\nformulae, but both routines then use the same subroutine. Rule R and Rule R' <br>\nare called ยงs and ยงs' in R0, where the section sign (ยง) indicates a rule, and <br>\n's' stands for substitution:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.kenkubota.de/files/R0_draft_excerpt_with_definitions_and_groups.pdf\">http://www.kenkubota.de/files/R0_draft_excerpt_with_definitions_and_groups.pdf</a> (pp. 362 f.)</p>\n<p>Rule ยง\\ ('\\' stands for lambda) denotes lambda-conversion (or more <br>\nspecifically, beta-conversion), which in Andrews' Q0 is obtained as theorem <br>\n5207 [cf. Andrews, 2002, p. 218 f.] from Axiom Schemata 4_1 - 4_5. Since some <br>\nof the Axiom Schemata 4_1 - 4_5 contain restrictions, lambda-conversion was <br>\nimplemented as a rule in R0. As the active elements, rules may contain <br>\nrestrictions, but not theorems (including axioms/axiom schemata), which are <br>\npassive elements. This alternative method of implementing lambda-conversion was <br>\nalready considered by Andrews in a paragraph to which he directed my attention <br>\nwhen I met him and which is already contained in the first edition (1986): <br>\n\"5207 could be taken as an axiom schema in place of 4_1 - 4_5, and for some <br>\npurposes this would be desirable, since 5207 has a conceptual simplicity and <br>\nunity which is not apparent in 4_1 - 4_5.\" [Andrews, 1986, p. 165; Andrews, <br>\n2002, p. 214]</p>\n<p>The fact that lambda-conversion is actually a process (i.e., active, dynamic, <br>\nand hence, a rule), and not only a (passive, static) theorem, axiom, or axiom <br>\nschema, becomes obvious in the online presentation of Q0, where Axiom Schemata <br>\n4_1 - 4_5 are replaced by 5207 as new Axiom Schema 4 which makes use of a <br>\nfunction \"SubFree\" denoting the process of substitution (of all free <br>\noccurrences of a variable):<br>\n<a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/type-theory-church/#ForBasEqu\">http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/type-theory-church/#ForBasEqu</a></p>\n<p>Similarly, in Church's simple theory of types, lambda-conversion <br>\n(beta-conversion) is implemented as the second (beta-reduction, also called <br>\nbeta-contraction) and third (beta-expansion) of altogether six rules of <br>\ninference [cf. Church, 1940, p. 60].</p>\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n<p>Ken Kubota</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Andrews, Peter B.
