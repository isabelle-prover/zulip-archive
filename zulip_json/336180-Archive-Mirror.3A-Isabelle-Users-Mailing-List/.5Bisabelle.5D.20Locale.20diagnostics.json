Also, there <br>\nis only a single invocation in the entire Isabelle distribution and AFP. <br>\n  So it looks like these commands can indeed be removed for Isabelle <br>\n2020.  As announced, the intended replacement is already available for <br>\nevaluation in the Isabelle development snapshot.</p>\n<p>Clemens</p>",

They are diagnostic commands and <em>shouldn’t</em> be there even if they were used every day.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",
