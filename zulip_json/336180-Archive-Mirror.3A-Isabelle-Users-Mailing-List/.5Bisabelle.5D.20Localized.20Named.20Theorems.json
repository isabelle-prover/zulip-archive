What I mean <br>\nby that is that after setting up a name, e.g., \"my_thms\", I want to be <br>\nable to retrieve specific versions of those theorems. Consider</p>\n<p>locale l = ...<br>\n   begin</p>\n<p>lemma A [my_thms] ...</p>\n<p>thm my_thms</p>\n<p>end</p>\n<p>thm l.my_thms</p>\n<p>interpretation my_l!: l ...</p>\n<p>thm my_l.my_thms</p>\n<p>I shortly considered bundles, but as far as I see, those cannot be <br>\nextended incrementally. Are there any other ways of achieving something <br>\nsimilar?</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",
