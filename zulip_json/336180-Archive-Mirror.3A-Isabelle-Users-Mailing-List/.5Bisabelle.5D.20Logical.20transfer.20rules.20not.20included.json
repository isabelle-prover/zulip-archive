After a closer analysis of all the similar<br>\nmissing rules I've added &gt;20. However, after using transfer' with the<br>\nextended set of rules I've realised that there might be a good reason why<br>\nthey were left out. With complex goal statements, the number of possible<br>\ntransformations using transfer' method becomes very large. After adding<br>\nthese rules, the tactics I've been working on (which have to deal with a<br>\nlot of transformations and choose a specific one according to heuristics)<br>\nhave become understandably slow to go through.</p>\n<p>So my main questions are:<br>\n1) is it known that these transfer rules were left out?<br>\n2) if so, where they deliberately left out?</p>\n<p>I would appreciate any other comments related to this.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nDaniel</p>",
