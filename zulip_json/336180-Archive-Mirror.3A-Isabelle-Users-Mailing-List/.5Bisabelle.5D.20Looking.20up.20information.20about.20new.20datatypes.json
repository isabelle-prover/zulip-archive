In particular, from the name of<br>\na datatype, I would like to find out the names (and types) of the selector functions corresponding to the<br>\narguments of a constructor. I am aware of the get_info function from BNF_LFP_Compat, but this does not give<br>\nme any information about selector functions, since they were not supported by the old datatype package.<br>\nIf I have understood the code correctly, get_info is based on the fp_sugar_of function from BNF_FP_Def_Sugar,<br>\nbut this function mainly seems to return low-level internal information about the datatype. Is there a<br>\nfunction returning more high-level information, including the selector functions?</p>\n<p>Greetings,<br>\nStefan</p>",

Lars gave a reference how to query that interface. But this info (and a bit more) is also contained in the returned fp_sugar record. See e.g.</p>\n<p>ML ‹BNF_FP_Def_Sugar.fp_sugar_of @{context} @{type_name list} |&gt; the |&gt; #fp_ctr_sugar›<br>\nML ‹BNF_FP_Def_Sugar.fp_sugar_of @{context} @{type_name list} |&gt; the |&gt; #fp_ctr_sugar |&gt; #ctr_sugar›</p>\n<p>Please also note that for datatype declarations the selectors are turned off by default. To get the command to generate them one has either to give a name to at least one selector or pass the discs_sels option (c.f. isabelle doc datatypes for details).</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nDmitriy</p>",
