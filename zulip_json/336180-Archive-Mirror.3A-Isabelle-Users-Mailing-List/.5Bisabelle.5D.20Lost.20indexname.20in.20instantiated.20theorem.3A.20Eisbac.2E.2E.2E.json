This results in some inconsistency when forming a static closure.<br>\nThis should be easy to fix. The easiest workaround in the interim is to avoid using bare \"TYPE('a)\".</p>\n<p>i.e.</p>\n<p>thm foo[of \"id TYPE(nat)\",simplified id_def]</p>\n<p>Which I realise is a bit of a pain (sorry about that). Using \"Pure.of\" is also fine as long as you aren't defining an Eisbach method.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
