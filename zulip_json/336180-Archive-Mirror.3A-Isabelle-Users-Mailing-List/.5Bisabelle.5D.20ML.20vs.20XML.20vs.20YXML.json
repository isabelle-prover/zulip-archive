See <br>\n<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/makarius/yxml\">https://bitbucket.org/makarius/yxml</a> (changeset 146b7018ad02 right now). <br>\nThe README also contains an example with some Isabelle/HOL term in yxml <br>\nformat that can be loaded into OCaml.</p>\n<p>The general principle might turn out useful to transfer types, terms, <br>\nproofs etc. between Isabelle and Coq, HOL-Light, HOL0 etc.  Maybe the <br>\nHOL-Light-Import renovation project can use it already.</p>\n<p>Basically, this stuff should scale to some extent, but I have no <br>\nexperience with constraints imposed by the OCaml runtime system (which <br>\ngenerally feels a bit old-fashioned).</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
