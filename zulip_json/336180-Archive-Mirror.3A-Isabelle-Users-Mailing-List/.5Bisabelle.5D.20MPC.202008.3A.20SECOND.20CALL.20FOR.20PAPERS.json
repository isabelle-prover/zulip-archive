Topics<br>\nof interest range from algorithmics to support for program<br>\nconstruction in programming languages and systems.</p>\n<p>The previous conferences were held in Twente, The Netherlands (1989),<br>\nOxford, UK (1992), Kloster Irsee, Germany (1995), Marstrand, Sweden<br>\n(1998), Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000), Dagstuhl, Germany (2002),<br>\nStirling, UK (2004, colocated with AMAST '04) and Kuressaare, Estonia <br>\n(2006, colocated with AMAST '06).</p>\n<p>The 2008 conference will be held in Marseille, France at the <br>\nInternational Center for Mathematical Meetings <br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.cirm.univ-mrs.fr/web.ang\">http://www.cirm.univ-mrs.fr/web.ang</a>).</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<p>To be announced.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>* Submission of abstracts: 14 January 2008<br>\n    * Submission of full papers: 21 January 2008<br>\n    * Notification of authors: 10 March 2008<br>\n    * Camera-ready version: 10 April 2008</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>Papers are solicited on mathematical methods and tools put to use in<br>\nprogram construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to<br>\nsupport for program construction in programming languages and<br>\nsystems. Some typical areas are type systems, program analysis and<br>\ntransformation, programming-language semantics, program<br>\nlogics. Theoretical contributions are welcome provided their relevance<br>\nfor program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome<br>\nprovided their mathematical basis is evident.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<p>Submission is in two stages. Abstracts (plain text, 10 to 20 lines)<br>\nmust be submitted by 14 January 2008. Full papers (pdf) adhering to<br>\nthe llncs style must be submitted by 21 January 2008. There is no<br>\nofficial page limit, but authors should strive for brevity. The<br>\nweb-based submission system is now open <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mpc08\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mpc08</a>.</p>\n<p>Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted<br>\nconcurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. Accepted<br>\npapers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.</p>\n<p>The proceedings of MPC'08 will be published in the Lecture Notes in<br>\nComputer Science series of Springer-Verlag.</p>\n<p>After the conference, the authors of the best papers will be invited<br>\nto submit revised versions to a special issue of the Science of<br>\nComputer Programming journal of Elsevier. </p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>Christine Paulin-Mohring INRIA-Universit Paris-Sud, France (chair)</p>\n<p>Philippe Audebaud   Ecole Normale Suprieure Lyon, France (co-chair)<br>\nRalph-Johan Back    Abo Akademi University, Finland <br>\nEerke Boiten        University of Kent, UK<br>\nVenanzio Capretta   University of Nijmegen, Netherlands<br>\nSharon Curtis       Oxford Brookes University, UK<br>\nJules Desharnais    Universit Laval, Qubec, Canada<br>\nPeter Dybjer        Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden<br>\nJeremy Gibbons      University of Oxford, UK<br>\nLindsay Groves      Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand<br>\nIan Hayes       University of Queensland, Australia<br>\nEric Hehner     University of Toronto, Canada<br>\nJohan Jeuring       Utrecht University, Netherlands<br>\nDexter Kozen        Cornell University, USA <br>\nChristian Lengauer  Universitt Passau, Germany<br>\nLambert Meertens    University of Utrecht, Netherlands<br>\nBernhard Mller  Universitt Augsburg, Germany<br>\nCarroll Morgan      University of New South Wales, Australia<br>\nShin-Cheng Mu       Academia Sinica, Taiwan<br>\nJose Nuno Oliveira  Universidade do Minho, Portugal<br>\nTim Sheard      Portland State University, USA <br>\nTarmo Uustalu       Institute of Cybernetics Tallin, Estonia</p>\n<p>VENUE</p>\n<p>The conference will be held in Marseille, the second largest city in<br>\nFrance next to Paris. Its port is the most important in France, <br>\nand opens the city to the world through the Mediterranean Sea. <br>\nMPC'08  will be hosted  by the  International Center for Mathematical<br>\nMeetings. The center is located inside the Campus of Luminy Faculty. <br>\nIt is close to the \"Calanques\", an astounding wild coastline composed <br>\nof creeks stretching from Marseille to Cassis.</p>\n<p>LOCAL ORGANIZERS</p>\n<p>MPC 2008 is organized with the support of INRIA.</p>\n<p>The local organizers are Philippe Audebaud and Christine<br>\nPaulin-Mohring with the help of Marie-Rene Fleury.</p>\n<p>Enquiries regarding the programme (submission etc.) should be addressed <br>\nto mpc08(at)lri.fr</p>",
