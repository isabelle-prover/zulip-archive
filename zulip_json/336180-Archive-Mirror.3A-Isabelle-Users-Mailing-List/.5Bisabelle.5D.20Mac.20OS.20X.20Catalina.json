Isabelle is unaffected except for one of its add-ons, namely csdp. It is used by the sos proof method, which uses a sum of squares technique to decide certain problems involving real-valued polynomials. If you want to upgrade to Catalina and use this admittedly obscure sos method, you will need to rebuild csdp from sources.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Download the sources from <a href=\"https://github.com/coin-or/Csdp\">https://github.com/coin-or/Csdp</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s necessary to install gfortran, which can be done in a single line using homebrew (<a href=\"https://brew.sh\">https://brew.sh</a>):</p>\n<p>brew cask install gfortran</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This also installs a copy of the real gcc compiler. Put a link in a more sensible place:</p>\n<p>ln -s /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gcc /usr/local/bin/</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type, at the top level of the Csdp-6.1.1 source directory,</p>\n<p>make CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, install the binary somewhere and put a line such as the following in your settings file:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ISABELLE_CSDP=/usr/local/bin/csdp</p>\n<p>In theory, there could be other 32-bit code somewhere within Isabelle, but I did a scan and couldn’t find any.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
