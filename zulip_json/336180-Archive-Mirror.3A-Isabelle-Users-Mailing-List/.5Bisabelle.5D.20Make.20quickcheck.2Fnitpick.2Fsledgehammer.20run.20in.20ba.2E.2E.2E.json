Or is it fundamentally different?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\n<p>Thomas</p>",

It is in fact one of the oldest running gags in that project since <br>\n2009 -- too many other things have sucked up too many resources (including <br>\nmyself maintaining Proof General in parallel until October 2011).</p>\n<p>Hopefully the list of running gags on this mailing list gets some <br>\nrefreshment eventually.  Just yesterday I have given a talk where the long <br>\nanticipated \"asynchronous agents\" approach was covered briefly.  Now it <br>\nonly has to be implemented.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
