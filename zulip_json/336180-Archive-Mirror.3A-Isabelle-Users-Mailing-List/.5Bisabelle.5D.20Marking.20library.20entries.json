In practice, this<br>\nmeans a minimum of documentation, having a consistent set of helper<br>\nexpected lemmas (say, for a data structure) and not just those that<br>\nhappened to be required for what I needed.</p>\n<p>If it is a library with applications, then the modules that are meant<br>\nto be reused ought to be clearly marked.</p>\n<p>Greetings,<br>\nJoachim<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/t87lVXQVPucSQrvwU4IRU7sk/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
