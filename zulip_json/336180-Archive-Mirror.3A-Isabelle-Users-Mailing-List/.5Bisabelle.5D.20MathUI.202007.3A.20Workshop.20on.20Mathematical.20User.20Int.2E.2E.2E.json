Videos, prototypes, mock ups and<br>\n  any other sort of demonstration are welcome!<br>\n  Proceedings will be online.</p>\n<p>Submission format: article of 3-8 (printed) pages, in HTML or PDF<br>\n  format, which may include other electronic presentations such as videos<br>\n  or animations complemented by an abstract of less than 150 words.</p>\n<p>* Either submit a paper by email until May 10th 2007, or<br>\n      submit an abstract on May 1st and a paper presentation on the 15th.</p>\n<p>* Expect an answer on May 31st 2007.<br>\n    * Workshop to happen betwen June 27th and June 30th</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE<br>\nDavid Aspinall<br>\n  School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Scotland<br>\nPaul Cairns<br>\n  UCL Interaction Center, University College London, Great Britain<br>\nOlga Caprotti<br>\n  Research Institute for Symbolic Computation, Linz, Austria<br>\nAnthony Jameson<br>\n  DFKI GmbH and International University, Germany<br>\nNorbert Kajler<br>\n  Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines de Paris, France<br>\nPaul Libbrecht (organizer)<br>\n  Competence Center for E-Learning, DFKI GmbH, Saarbruecken, Germany<br>\nRobert Miner<br>\n  Design Science, Long Beach, California, USA<br>\nElena Smirnova<br>\n  Ontario Research Center for Computer Algebra, London, Canada</p>\n<p>MORE INFORMATION<br>\nMore about MKM 2007 can be found at:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mmk/events/MKM07/\">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mmk/events/MKM07/</a></p>\n<p>Up-to-date information can be read from the workshop's web-page<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.activemath.org/~paul/MathUI07/\">http://www.activemath.org/~paul/MathUI07/</a></p>",
