This workshop aims to bring<br>\ntogether researchers from different areas, interested in effective<br>\nmethods in analysis and geometry, and by the design and implementation<br>\nof efficient and certified algorithms. Its objective is to stimulate<br>\ndiscussions between communities that do not so often meet in<br>\ntraditional venues and to foster interactions between their different<br>\nbut complementary perspectives, in the tradition of the meetings of<br>\nthe MAP community. It will address perspectives from proof theory,<br>\ntype theory, constructive analysis, machine-checked mathematics,<br>\nimplementation of real/float/interval arithmetic, computer algebra<br>\nsystems, including those based on new paradigms like quantum<br>\ncomputation.</p>\n<p>Pre-registerations are opened until <em>before October 31st</em> on the<br>\nwebsite of the event. At this stage, this just requires entering your<br>\nemail address.</p>\n<p>The website of the event is: <a href=\"http://scientific-events.weebly.com/1508.html\">http://scientific-events.weebly.com/1508.html</a></p>\n<p>The meeting will consist of invited lectures (see the list of speakers on the<br>\nwebsite) and of contributed talks. We will come back to the pre-registered<br>\nparticipants in a few weeks to collect the propositions of contributed talks.</p>\n<p>The CIRM provides a generous but limited support for local expenses (food +<br>\naccommodation). If you would like to apply for it, please do pre-register as<br>\nearly as possible.</p>\n<p>Find local information about the CIRM here:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cirm-math.com/visitors.html\">http://www.cirm-math.com/visitors.html</a></p>\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n<p>Assia Mahboubi<br>\nBas Spitters<br>\nPeter Schuster<br>\n<a href=\"http://map.disi.unige.it/\">http://map.disi.unige.it/</a></p>",
