G j ≤ G l\" where G has derivative g ≥ 0. The standard way to <br>\nprove this is using the mean value theorem which already exists in the <br>\nMVA/Derivative theory.<br>\nUnfortunately the mvt is formulated for has_derivative and I have to use <br>\nG has_vector_derivative g rather than has_derivative as G is defined to <br>\nbe (%y.  LBINT x=a..y. g x) and using has_derivative leads to a type <br>\nerror ereal/real_normed_vector.<br>\nShould I just go back and prove the MVT for has_vector_derivative or is <br>\nthere an easier way around this?</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nAlex Hicks</p>",

Is there the case that a = -infty or b = +infty in your example?<br>\nIf not just fix a b to be real. Then Isabelle will add the necessary<br>\ncoercions to LBINT and you should be able to use has_vector_derivative:</p>\n<p>G == (%y::real.  LBINT x=a..y. g x) </p>\n<p>Does this help?</p>\n<p>- Johannes</p>",
