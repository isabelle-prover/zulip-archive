These systems face increasing <br>\ndesign complexity including tighter constraints on timing, power, costs, <br>\nand reliability. MEMOCODE seeks submissions that present novel formal <br>\nmethods and design techniques addressing these issues to create, refine, <br>\nand verify hardware/software systems. We also invite <br>\napplication-oriented papers, and especially encourage submissions that <br>\nhighlight the design perspective of formal methods and models, including <br>\nsuccess stories and demonstrations of hardware/software codesign. <br>\nFurthermore, we invite poster presentations describing ongoing work with <br>\npromising preliminary results.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest for regular submissions include but are not limited to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>system- and transaction-level modeling and verification, abstraction <br>\nand refinement between different modeling levels, formal, semi-formal, <br>\nand specification-driven verification,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>design and verification methods for composition of concurrent systems: <br>\nmulti-core platform architectures, systems-on-chip, networks-on-chip,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>non-traditional and domain-specific design languages for hardware and <br>\nsoftware, novel models of computation, and new design paradigms that <br>\nunify hardware and software design,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>system-level estimation of performance and power in heterogeneous <br>\nhardware/software architectures,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>applications and demonstrators of formal design methodologies and case <br>\nstudies of innovative system-level design flows, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>modeling and reuse of intellectual property at system-level.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS:</p>\n<p>Conference proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION:</p>\n<p>Submissions of research and experience papers will only be accepted <br>\nthrough the conference web site. Papers must not exceed 10 pages and <br>\nmust be formatted following IEEE Computer Society guidelines. <br>\nSubmissions must be written in English, describe original work, and not <br>\nsubstantially overlap papers that have been published or are being <br>\nsubmitted to a journal or another conference with published proceedings. <br>\nPoster submissions should consist of an abstract of at most 250 words. <br>\nThe abstract will be distributed to the conference attendants but will <br>\nnot be published. Note that the poster deadline is different from the <br>\npaper deadline.</p>\n<p>DESIGN CONTEST:</p>\n<p>MEMOCODE will again have a design contest. The contest will start March <br>\n1, 2010. The deadline for submission is 31 March 2010 and the <br>\nnotification of the results is on May 14, 2010. The conference will <br>\nsponsor at least two prize categories, each with a significant cash <br>\naward. We awarded a $1000 prize in each of the two categories in 2009. <br>\nEach team that submits a complete and working entry will be invited to <br>\nsubmit for review a 2-page abstract for the formal conference <br>\nproceedings; winning teams will be invited to contribute a 4-page short <br>\npaper. Each team submitting a completed and working entry will also <br>\nreceive a commemorative plaque with their name and results. Please refer <br>\nto the conference website for more information and updates.</p>\n<p>TUTORIALS:</p>\n<p>MEMOCODE will feature tutorials related to hardware/software codesign. <br>\nPlease send your tutorial proposals to <a href=\"mailto:alain.girault@inria.fr\">alain.girault@inria.fr</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>General Chair:  Klaus Schneider (Kaiserslauten)<br>\nFinance Chair:  James Hoe (CMU)<br>\nProgram Chairs: Barbara Jobstmann (CNRS) and Luca Carloni (Columbia)<br>\nDesign Contest: Joel Emer (Intel) and  Forrest Brewer (UCSB)<br>\nLocal Chairs:   Saddek Bensalem (UJF/CEA) and Christian Fabre (CEA)<br>\nTutorial Chair: Alain Girault (INRIA)</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>David Atienza (EPFL)<br>\nTwan Basten (Eindhoven)<br>\nTevfik Bultan (UCSB)<br>\nRobert de Simone (INRIA)<br>\nRainer Doemer (UCI)<br>\nRolf Drechsler (Bremen)<br>\nStephen Edwards (Columbia)<br>\nFranco Fummi (Verona)<br>\nThierry Gautier (INRIA)<br>\nGanesh Gopalakrishnan (Utah)<br>\nJosef Haid (Infineon)<br>\nFranjo Ivancic (NEC)<br>\nChristoph Kirsch (Salzburg)<br>\nDaniel Kroening (Oxford)<br>\nYassine Lakhnech (UJF)<br>\nLuciano Lavagno (Torino)<br>\nElizabeth Leonard (NRL)<br>\nRishiyur Nikhil (Bluespec, Inc.)<br>\nJohn O'Leary (Intel)<br>\nRoberto Passerone (Trento)<br>\nDiego Puschini (CEA)<br>\nJan Reineke (UC Berkeley)<br>\nPatrick Schaumont (VirginiaTech)<br>\nKlaus Schneider (Kaiserslautern)<br>\nSanjit Seshia (UC Berkeley)<br>\nNatasha Sharygina (Lugano)<br>\nSatnam Singh (Microsoft)<br>\nMichael Theobald (DE Shaw)<br>\nLothar Thiele (ETHZ)<br>\nFei Xie (Portland State)</p>\n<p>Steering Committee</p>\n<p>Arvind (MIT)<br>\nMasahiro Fujita (University Tokyo)<br>\nRajesh Gupta (UC San Diego)<br>\nConnie Heitmeyer (NRL)<br>\nJames Hoe (CMU)<br>\nSandeep Shukla (Virginia Tech)<br>\nJean-Pierre Talpin (INRIA)</p>",
