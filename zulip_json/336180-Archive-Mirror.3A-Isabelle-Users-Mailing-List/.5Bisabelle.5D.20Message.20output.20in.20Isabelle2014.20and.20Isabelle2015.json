What <br>\nwas the \"issue\" and what was the \"fix\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you pointed out, it was already discussed in<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2014-August/msg00115.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2014-August/msg00115.html</a></p>\n<p>in the release, the error messages then appeared before the subgoals,<br>\nor, more precisely, the subgoals did not appear explicitly at all, but<br>\nthe error message contained a list of subgoals.</p>\n<p>In Isabelle2015, the last goal state before the failing command seems to<br>\nget printed, too --- before the error message. This behaviour has a<br>\npositive and a negative effect on (my personal) workflow, which somewhat<br>\ncoincides with your analysis:</p>\n<p>Positive: When typing commands, in particular those involving inner<br>\nsyntax like &lt;have \"very-long-term\"&gt;, I can see the current goal-state<br>\nall the time. In Isabelle2014 you saw \"syntax error\" or \"type error\"<br>\nmost of the time, and had to go back with the cursor to see the<br>\ngoal-state. I appreciate this behaviour, because, during typing such a<br>\ncommand, you are mostly interested in the previous goal state ... not in<br>\nthe bogus information that you have a syntax error b/c typing is not<br>\ncompleted yet.</p>\n<p>Negative: As already reported before, if you have finished typing the<br>\ncommand, you are expecting that it works. If it does not, you are mostly<br>\ninterested in the error message, and the proof state of the previous<br>\ncommand is of less importance.</p>\n<p>As you point out, this behaviour was introduced in 2015. Note that the<br>\noverall problem was introduced with the processing model of PIDE, and<br>\ndid not exist in Proof-General: There, by issuing a \"goto this position\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>command, you told the IDE that you have finished typing, and now want<br>\nto focus on handling the errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The deeper problem is cluttering of Output with too many different things, <br>\nand the lack of a dedicated panel just for proof state output. <br>\nFor those people with large screens, this may be a good solution.
