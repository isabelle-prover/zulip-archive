A person named Markus<br>\n(Makarius) Wenzel (<a href=\"mailto:makarius@sketis.net\">makarius@sketis.net</a>) has developed a habit of repeatedly<br>\nfollowing-up my posts on this mailing list with unpleasant comments with<br>\nregard to my character. In particular, he is continuously referring to me<br>\nas a 'dummy'. Please find examples in the list below:<br>\n<a href=\"https://mailman46.in.tum.de/pipermail/isabelle-dev/2019-May/016924.html\">https://mailman46.in.tum.de/pipermail/isabelle-dev/2019-May/016924.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-June/msg00093.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-June/msg00093.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-November/msg00099.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2019-November/msg00099.html</a></p>\n<p>According to the Oxford dictionary online, the word dummy has several<br>\nmeanings. I have extracted the meanings that I consider to be more relevant:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a model or replica of a human being/doll</li>\n<li>a stupid person</li>\n<li>a rubber or plastic teat for a baby to suck on</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most certainly, I am a living organism: not a doll or a plastic teat. Also,<br>\nI believe that referring to someone as 'stupid' in public for no apparent<br>\nreason is both insulting and degrading.</p>\n<p>Several months ago, I asked him not to refer to me as a 'dummy' in private<br>\ncommunication. I tried to do so in the most polite manner and, with his<br>\npermission, I can display the body of all messages (with the exception of<br>\nmy signature) that were sent to him. However, my plea was ignored and I was<br>\nreferred to as a 'dummy' in public almost immediately after sending the<br>\naforementioned email in private (the timing could not have been better).</p>\n<p>I believe that he is exhibiting a very inappropriate behavior, especially<br>\ngiven the nature of this mailing list. I would be less concerned about such<br>\ncomments and behavior on a forum for sports fans or on a forum for a<br>\ndiscussion of alcoholic beverages, for example. However, I believe that<br>\nacademic forums should demand a certain standard of politeness, tact and<br>\nmanner of all users. Furthermore, I believe that his comments might be in<br>\nviolation of the laws of the German Republic, where, to the best of my<br>\nknowledge, he resides. In particular, Paragraph 185, Section 14 of the<br>\ncriminal code of the German Republic (<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.pdf\">http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.pdf</a>) states:<br>\n\"An insult shall be punished with imprisonment not exceeding one year or a<br>\nfine and, if the insult is committed by means of an assault, with<br>\nimprisonment not exceeding two years or a fine.\" While I have no intention<br>\nto pursue a case against him, I believe that it is only in the best<br>\ninterest of the forum administrators that all users of the forum do not<br>\nviolate the laws of the country where they reside. Therefore, I would<br>\nkindly ask the community and/or the administrators of the mailing list to<br>\ntake appropriate measures against the unlawful behavior that he continues<br>\nto exhibit. Furthermore, ideally, I would like all posts where I am<br>\nreferred to as a 'dummy' to be removed from the archives of this mailing<br>\nlist. I believe that the removal of these threads would also be beneficial<br>\nfor Markus Wenzel, as it would reduce the odds of someone else making a<br>\ndecision to pursue a criminal case against him.</p>\n<p>Overall, Markus Wenzel gives this forum a feeling of a high school<br>\nbackyard, where he is the toughest bully. I would like to think that I have<br>\nhad to endure enough bullying in my youth, not to have to do deal with it<br>\never again (of course, it is very naive of me to think this way...). The<br>\nreasons, of course, were different: it was my frail body, my inability to<br>\ncommunicate information verbally as well as most other persons of the<br>\nequivalent age and, of course, my interest in sciences. However, a person<br>\nin power (whatever is the meaning of the word in a given context) can<br>\nalways find reasons to bully someone of 'lesser standing'. It could be<br>\none's race, it could be one's religion, it could be one's nationality, it<br>\ncould be one's disability, it could be the lack of wealth of one's family,<br>\nit could be one's profession or social status, or it could simply be a<br>\npersonal dislike (I have seen and endured more of this than I could wish<br>\nupon anyone). Nevertheless, quite frankly, I hold no personal grudge or<br>\nresentment towards Markus Wenzel and most other characters who acted<br>\ninappropriately towards me in the past. If I was religious, I would have<br>\nsaid \"May God have mercy upon their souls\", but I am not religious and,<br>\ntherefore, I will not do it :). Perhaps, given his status in the community,<br>\nI would have even acted in a similar manner towards the 'lesser humans<br>\nbeings'. Nevertheless, I do not like it and the human laws are on my side.<br>\nTherefore, I will use all legal means at my disposal to ensure that I am<br>\nnot harassed ever again.</p>\n<p>While the primary reason why I decided to start this thread is, indeed, the<br>\n'dummy' references, I believe that Markus Wenzel has repeatedly acted<br>\ninappropriately on this mailing list in many other ways. For example, he<br>\nhas made a number of remarks that were blatantly off-topic in some of the<br>\nthreads that I started (both for the thread in the narrow sense and for the<br>\nIsabelle mailing list in the most general sense). These remarks were<br>\nrelated to Wikipedia articles, anonymity online and general public<br>\npolicies, but not related to Isabelle or formal methods in any way:<br>\npersonally, I would consider such posts to be off-topic even if they were<br>\nstarted as an explicit meta-thread on this list. Most professional public<br>\nforums (e.g. Stack Overflow) tightly regulate and moderate lengthy<br>\noff-topic discussions (including the associated meta forums). I am rather<br>\nconfident that any user of Stack Overflow/Meta Stack Overflow would be<br>\nbanned if (s)he repeatedly made posts about (general) Wikipedia articles,<br>\nanonymity online or public policies, even though the scope of the website<br>\nStack Overflow is much wider than the scope of this mailing list. Most<br>\ncertainly, I am not asking for Markus Wenzel to be denied the privilege of<br>\nposting on this forum. However, I would like to see the content of the<br>\nforum to be regulated more tightly for the benefit of the users.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",

Once again, I would like to repeat that I asked Markus<br>\nWenzel not to use the word \"dummy\" when referring to me personally and I am<br>\nvery confident that my message was received by him. As a side remark, this<br>\nis the first (non-technical) meta-post that I made on this forum, having<br>\nused it for over a year (in fact, it may be the first non-technical<br>\nmeta-thread that I started on any forum of any kind in my entire life).<br>\nHowever, the number of non-technical and off-topic posts that I received<br>\nfrom Markus Wenzel as replies to the technical threads that I started is<br>\nfar greater than one. Furthermore, I believe that name-calling without a<br>\ncause is \"an actual problem that needs to be discussed properly and<br>\ncarefully\", if only as a meta-thread.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n<p>On Fri, Nov 29, 2019 at 7:53 PM mailing-list anonymous &lt;<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com\">mailing.list.anonymous@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear All,</p>\n<p>I would like to start a slightly unusual meta-thread.

This is why my signature clearly indicates that<br>\nI can provide my identity upon request to any user of the mailing list. If<br>\nthis is not sufficient, I would be happy to pass further ID checks (e.g.<br>\nprovide a copy of my passport to the administrators of the list).</p>\n<p>I would also like to mention that some of the formal proof communities are<br>\nless open to the outsiders. For example, there exists \"Association of Mizar<br>\nUsers\". To the best of my knowledge, to become a member one needs to submit<br>\nan application form and to remain a member one needs to pay a monthly<br>\nmembership fee (<a href=\"http://www.mizar.org/sum/\">http://www.mizar.org/sum/</a>). Many other websites (e.g.<br>\ngambling websites) require one to pass an ID check before the registration<br>\nis possible: this did not stop millions of people to register on such<br>\nwebsites.</p>\n<p>If the lack of knowledge of the identity of the posters is such grave<br>\nconcern, then I would kindly suggest implementing an ID check for all<br>\npeople who wish to post on the list. However, without a requisite ID check<br>\nfor every member of the mailing list, your policy seems to give more<br>\ncredibility and respect to liars than to honest people who state clearly<br>\nthat they do not wish to reveal their identity in public.</p>\n<p>At the time when I decided to register this email address, I considered<br>\nadopting a human pseudonym. However, I decided against it because I thought<br>\nthat lying about my identity is not appropriate. Instead, I chose to state<br>\nclearly that I simply do not wish to reveal it to the general public. At<br>\nthe moment, I have a feeling that I am being denied the services that are<br>\nprovided to anyone who would be shameless enough to lie about his/her<br>\nidentity.</p>\n<p>As a side note, there exist professional researchers who strongly support<br>\nthe idea of anonymous academic publications (<br>\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05382.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05382.pdf</a>), not merely anonymous forum posts.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",

Realizing this is hardly a matter of cultural background, native language, etc. -- rather, pure logic shows that Makarius did not use the term \"dummy\" in reference to Anonymous's intellectual abilities. That would have made absolutely no sense in the context. I wish Anonymous acknowledged this (after re-thinking it over).</p>\n<p>3) There is no doubt to me that <em>this</em> Anonymous is a serious contributor, and he gave valid reasons for not revealing his name on the mailing list (though he is happy to reveal it in private, to Makarius or anyone else). Would it be better if he registered as John Doe? So I wish Makarius considered ending his \"embargo\".

The fact that <br>\nMakarius (and only Makarius so far, as far as I can tell) has exhibited <br>\ndispleasure at anonymous participation does not, in my opinion, make it <br>\na rule.</p>\n<p>Second, the suggestion to circumvent rules creatively surprises me. Do I <br>\nunderstand right that being openly and honestly anonymous is a problem, <br>\nwhile using a fake name and pretending that that is one's real identity <br>\nwould be OK?</p>\n<p>Third, I do not see how participating under a fake name would resolve <br>\nany of the problems that Makarius mentioned such as being able to wreak <br>\nhavoc and then reregister with a new identity. (For the record, I myself <br>\ndo not think this is a problem here.)</p>\n<p>(That being said, for practical purposes, it might be useful if the <br>\nanonymous poster would adopt a pseudonym (while still clearly stating in <br>\nthe email that this is a pseudonym). The advantage is simply that it <br>\nwill be easier to refer to their contributions. E.g., \"Fritz the Cat's <br>\nset-to-types implementation\" instead of \"the anonymous person's <br>\nset-to-types implementation\".)</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",

When my university decided to issue photo ID cards many years ago, we all had to make appointments to be photographed, but we did not have to present any ID, and therefore could claim to be anybody. More recently, somebody who I knew only by email informed me that our project was security-critical and therefore we need to set up PGP keys; when I asked him how we would authenticate these keys to each other, he didn’t even understand the question. But anybody can get a public-private key pair in the name of Albert Einstein or Isaac Newton.</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
