Usually, when replying, I copy the subject of<br>\nthe thread from the archives of the mailing list (<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/</a>) and state it as the<br>\nsubject in my reply, with 'Re: ' appended at the beginning of the subject<br>\nline. Furthermore, I quote some elements of the original message. However,<br>\nfrom time to time, my replies appear as explicit new threads in \"The<br>\nCl-isabelle-users Archives\". If possible, I would like to understand how<br>\ncan I ensure that my replies are posted in the intended thread in the<br>\narchives?</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
