It is designed to prove theorems involving functions such as log, exp, sin, cos and sqrt. MetiTarski is available to download; see</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Arith/metit-1.8.tgz\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Arith/metit-1.8.tgz</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Arith/\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Arith/</a></p>\n<p>This version introduces significant new heuristics, in particular case-splitting.</p>\n<p>Please note that MetiTarski is experimental research software and will require a certain amount of effort to build on your machine. Feedback is welcome!!</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
