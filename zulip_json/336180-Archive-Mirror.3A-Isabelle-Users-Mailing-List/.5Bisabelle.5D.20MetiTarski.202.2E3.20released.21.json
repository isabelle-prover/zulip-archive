It is designed to prove theorems involving real-valued special functions such as ln, exp, sin, cos, arctan and sqrt. All variables are assumed to range over the real numbers.</p>\n<p>MetiTarski can be downloaded from </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Arith/download.html\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Arith/download.html</a></p>\n<p>You will be asked to leave your name and e-mail address so that we can have an idea how many users there are. You will not receive regular e-mails from us.</p>\n<p>Version 2.3 supports user-defined functions (abbreviations introduced using axioms). Also, autoconf is now used to automatically configure builds on a variety of UNIX environments.</p>\n<p>We continue to provide a binary distribution (64-bit Linux and OSX).</p>\n<p>Please note that MetiTarski is experimental research software. Feedback is welcome!!</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
