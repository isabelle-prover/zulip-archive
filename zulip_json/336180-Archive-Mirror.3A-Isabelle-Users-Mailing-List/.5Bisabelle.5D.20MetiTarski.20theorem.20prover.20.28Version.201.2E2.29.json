It is designed to prove theorems involving functions such as  <br>\nlog, exp, sin, cos and sqrt. MetiTarski is available to download; see</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Arith/metit-1.2.tgz\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Arith/metit-1.2.tgz</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Arith/index.html\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Arith/index.html</a></p>\n<p>This version includes support for the TPTP \"include\" directive and  <br>\nmany new problems on analogue circuit verification, etc., from  <br>\nConcordia University.</p>\n<p>Please note that it is experimental research software and will require  <br>\na certain amount of effort to build on your machine. Feedback would be  <br>\nwelcome.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
