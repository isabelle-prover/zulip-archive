A problem that I am frequently <br>\nfacing is that I want to hide the constant name completely from the <br>\npaper and just fancy notation. However, I often do not want to supply <br>\nall parameters to some function and still get the notation.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose there are two definitions, one of which is with <br>\nmixfix syntax, and some text...</p>\n<p>definition foo :: \"'a =&gt; 'b =&gt; 'c =&gt; bool\"<br>\n            (\"_ |- _ : _ *\" [50, 0, 20] 70)<br>\nwhere \"a |- b : c * == True\"</p>\n<p>definition bar :: \"'a =&gt; ('a =&gt; 'b =&gt; 'c =&gt; bool) =&gt; bool\"<br>\nwhere \"bar a f == !b c. f a b c\"</p>\n<p>text {*<br>\n   @{term \"foo a b\"} is a predicate on @{typ 'c} saying that ...</p>\n<p>@{term \"bar a foo\"} denotes that @{term \"foo a\"} holds everywhere.<br>\n*}</p>\n<p>What I would like the text to be typeset (with appropriate LaTeX symbols <br>\ninstead of the ASCII art) is:</p>\n<p>\"a |- b : _ *  is a predicate on 'c saying that ...</p>\n<p>bar a (_ |- _ : _ *)  denotes that  a |- _ : _ *  holds everywhere.\"</p>\n<p>I.e. I would like to have the mixfix syntax printed even though foo is <br>\nnot given all parameters. Those parameters which are missing should be <br>\nreplaced by some placeholder (like _, but . or \\cdot would equally do.<br>\nThe simple way would clearly be to write @{text \"a |- b : _ *\"}, but in <br>\nthm-antiquotations, this trick does not work, e.g.</p>\n<p>lemma foo: \"foo a b = (%x. True)\"<br>\nby(auto intro: ext simp add: foo_def)<br>\ntext {* @{thm foo} *}</p>\n<p>should produce \"?a |- ?b : _ * = (%x. True)\".</p>\n<p>How can I have \"foo\" (automatically) translated to \"_ |- _ : _ *\", \"foo <br>\na\" to \"a |- _ : _ *\", \"foo a b\" to \"a |- b : _ *\" and so on?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
