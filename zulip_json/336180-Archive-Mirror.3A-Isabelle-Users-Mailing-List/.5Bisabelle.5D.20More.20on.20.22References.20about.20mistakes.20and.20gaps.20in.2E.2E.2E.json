This time, I and my coauthor are the<br>\nprotagonists of some \"mistakes and gaps\"...</p>\n<p>In impressive recent work,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10212\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10212</a></p>\n<p>Johannes Åman Pohjola and Arve Gengelbach have formalized in HOL4 our<br>\nmodel-theoretic proof of consistency for (an abstract representation<br>\nof) Isabelle/HOL's logic (<a href=\"http://andreipopescu.uk/pdf/ITP2015.pdf\">http://andreipopescu.uk/pdf/ITP2015.pdf</a>).</p>\n<p>They have found three errors in our informal proof. Two involved<br>\nsubtleties about variable names and substitution and were fairly easy<br>\nto fix. The third one was more serious, and they have fixed it by<br>\nadding a new clause to the definitional dependency relation. Please<br>\nsee their paper for details.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nAndrei</p>\n<p>PS. Incidentally, in the meantime I had also discovered the more<br>\nserious problem (which affects three of our papers), and I had<br>\nformalized in Isabelle a different fix -- the fix only, not the whole<br>\nproof (<a href=\"http://andreipopescu.uk/Theories/Fix_Comp_IHOL_Cons.zip\">http://andreipopescu.uk/Theories/Fix_Comp_IHOL_Cons.zip</a>). I<br>\nwill soon produce an errata, reflecting Johannes and Arve's findings<br>\nas well.</p>",
