The final nail in the coffin is that the company behind<br>\n<a href=\"http://SF.net\">SF.net</a> started replacing genuine downloads with their own versions with<br>\nadded adware. The latest evidence is from the GIMP project:</p>\n<p>&lt;<a href=\"https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gimp-developer-list/2015-May/msg00097.html\">https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gimp-developer-list/2015-May/msg00097.html</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>In that particular case, it affected an inactive project. The AFP is<br>\nvery much not inactive, but nonetheless, nobody guarantees that <a href=\"http://SF.net\">SF.net</a><br>\nwon't further extend this practice. They will probably not touch the<br>\nMercurial source repositories, but the official AFP download uses<br>\nSF.net's download facility:</p>\n<p>&lt;<a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/afp/files/latest/download\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/afp/files/latest/download</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Better alternatives exist, for example Bitbucket. They also offer<br>\nrepository hosting, web hosting, and file download.</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nLars</p>",
