However, it <br>\nseems as if the second (structure) declaration cannot be used, because there are all the <br>\n\\&lt;^bsub&gt;...\\&lt;^esub&gt; annotations for the second structure.  This is in line with the <br>\nimplementation manual (Sect. 7.4.3), which states that \"\\&lt;index&gt;\" always refers to the <br>\nfirst declared structure. This makes sense as it would not be clear in general which <br>\nvariable to pick for the reference (although type checking might disambiguate things in <br>\nmany practical cases).</p>\n<p>IMO it would make sense to support constants that depend on several instances (for example <br>\nan operation on homomorphisms) and that thus should reference multiple structure <br>\narguments. Unfortunately, I cannot even declare the mixfix syntax like in</p>\n<p>\"FOO\\&lt;index&gt;\\&lt;index&gt;\"</p>\n<p>because the parser complains about \"Duplicate index arguments (\\Ä±)\". Is there a way to use <br>\nreference several implicit structures for a constant? If not, how hard would it be to <br>\nextend the index referencing to multiple references?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
