The goal of<br>\nthis project is to develop a comprehensive, formally verified security<br>\narchitecture for communication in the physical and digital world. In<br>\nparticular, the project will develop protocols to transfer physical trust<br>\nrelationships into the digital world and store, manage, and use them. The<br>\ndesign will take into account human (mis-)behavior from the outset. A<br>\nparticular emphasis is on the formal verification of the architecture both<br>\nat the design and implementation level to rule out any undesired behavior.</p>\n<p>We are looking for enthusiastic and outstanding Computer Science or<br>\nMathematics students and postdoctoral researchers with a strong background<br>\nin some of the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formal modeling and verification,</li>\n<li>program verification,</li>\n<li>theorem proving, model checking,</li>\n<li>cryptographic protocols,</li>\n<li>public-key infrastructure, identity management, authentication,</li>\n<li>networking and distributed systems, and</li>\n<li>design and implementation of security architectures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ETH Zurich regulations require PhD students to hold a Masters or equivalent<br>\ndegree (e.g., Diplom). All candidates matching the profile above are<br>\nencouraged to apply as soon as possible. We will process applications until<br>\nall positions are filled.
