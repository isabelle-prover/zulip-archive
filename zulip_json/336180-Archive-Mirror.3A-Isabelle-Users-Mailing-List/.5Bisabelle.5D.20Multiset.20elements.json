The design for \"List\", other parts of the library, and the BNF (co)datatypes, is in favor of \"_ : set_of _\" rather than \"predicators\" (?). It seems to have worked well and should probably be imitated. Apart from the fact that multisets are not a free datatype, they are otherwise very much like lists and should feel that way too (while keeping the set-like syntactic sugar).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With the proposal</p>\n<p>x :# M == not (count M x = 0)</p>\n<p>you would end up with the problem of double negation (try »not (x :# m)«<br>\nmentally).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My original proposal didn't have the double negation issue, but it had another blemish, as noted by Tobias. ;)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hope this makes things more explicit,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes. In the coming weeks or months, Dmitriy and I should be making some contributions to the \"Multiset\" theory. This would be a good opportunity to clean it up, to the extend to which it can be done without breaking existing applications beyond repair.</p>\n<p>Two more things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You circulated privately some renaming proposals, with \"_mset\" as a fairly systematic suffix (no more \"m\" or \"M\" prefixes). This is also something we would look into.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are currently two (provably identical) map functions -- the traditional \"image_mset\" and the Popescuesque \"mmap\". This needs to be consolidated.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",

We're using multisets in a formalization that we would like to submit to the AFP, so we'd like it to work with both Isabelle2014 and the repository version (as much as possible). Once it's published, we'll start playing with the \"Multiset\" theory.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, our formalization happens to be not too remote from IsaFoR thematically -- our multisets are clauses or collections of clauses in a formalized theorem prover.
