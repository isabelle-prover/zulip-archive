All the automated theorem<br>\nproving techniques described are accompanied by actual OCaml code that<br>\nthe reader can use, modify and otherwise experiment with. I'm pleased<br>\nto announce that the book has now been published.</p>\n<p>Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning</p>\n<p>John Harrison</p>\n<p>Cambridge University Press 2009</p>\n<p>ISBN: 9780521899574</p>\n<p>Publisher's Web page: <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/9780521899574\">http://www.cambridge.org/9780521899574</a><br>\n     Code and resources:   <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/atp/\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/atp/</a></p>\n<p>Copies are already becoming available: you can order it directly from<br>\nthe publisher or from various other sources. Currently the price and<br>\navailability looks a bit better in Europe (it was on offer for 56<br>\npounds last week on <a href=\"http://amazon.co.uk\">amazon.co.uk</a>).
