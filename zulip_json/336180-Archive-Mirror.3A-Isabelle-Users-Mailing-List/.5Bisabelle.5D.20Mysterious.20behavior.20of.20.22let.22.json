If this index is 0, the <br>\noutput omits the index, i.e., ?x.0 is printed as ?x (unless the variable name ends with a <br>\nnumber). Moreover, the dot is omitted in pretty-printing and parsing unless the variable <br>\nname ends with a number. I.e., ?x.1 is printed (and parsed) as ?x1 whereas ?x1.0 is <br>\nprinted as ?x1.0 (and you also have to use [where ?x1.0=foo] to instantiate such variables <br>\nwith numbers in the end in theorems).</p>\n<p>Back to your example: let bindings are handled internally like schematic variables. Hence, <br>\n?x0 gets parsed as ?x.0 and ?x1 as ?x.1 and ?x becomes ?x.0 again. That's why your last <br>\nlet-binding overrides the first.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
