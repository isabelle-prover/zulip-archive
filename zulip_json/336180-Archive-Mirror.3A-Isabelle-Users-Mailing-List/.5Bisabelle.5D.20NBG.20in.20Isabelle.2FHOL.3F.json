This post is an attempt to \"snoop\" for information on whether, since<br>\nthen, anyone has attempted a similar feat. Generally, I am looking for a<br>\nworking axiomatization of NBG in HOL for Isabelle2020 in the style of \"ZFC<br>\nin HOL\" or its predecessor HOL/ZF.</p>\n<p>In this context, I would also be keen to know about other work on the<br>\nformalization/semantics of alternative set theories stronger than ZFC (e.g.<br>\nMK) in Isabelle/HOL. Is anyone aware of any ongoing projects in this<br>\ndirection?</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nMikhail Chekhov</p>",

It’s main advantage is its finite axiom system within first-order logic, but that’s irrelevant in our higher-order setting. It’s main drawback is that you simply write a formula when specifying a subset (via the separation axiom), forcing you to find an encoding using a combinator language. Prior attempts to use it with automatic theorem provers only confirm the difficulties:</p>\n<p>Belinfante, J.G.F.
