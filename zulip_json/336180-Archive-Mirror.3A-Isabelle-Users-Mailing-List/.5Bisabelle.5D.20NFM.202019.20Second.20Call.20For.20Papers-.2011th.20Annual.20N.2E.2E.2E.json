The NASA<br>\nFormal Methods Symposium (NFM) is a forum to foster collaboration<br>\nbetween theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, academia, and<br>\nindustry. NFM's goals are to identify challenges and to provide<br>\nsolutions for achieving assurance for such critical systems.</p>\n<p>New developments and emerging applications like autonomous software for<br>\nuncrewed deep space human habitats, caretaker robotics, Unmanned Aerial<br>\nSystems (UAS), UAS Traffic Management (UTM), and the need for<br>\nsystem-wide fault detection, diagnosis, and prognostics provide new<br>\nchallenges for system specification, development, and verification<br>\napproaches. The focus of these symposiums are on formal techniques and<br>\nother approaches for software assurance, including their theory, current<br>\ncapabilities and limitations, as well as their potential application to<br>\naerospace, robotics, and other NASA-relevant safety-critical systems<br>\nduring all stages of the software life-cycle.</p>\n<p>The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is an annual event organized by the<br>\nNASA Formal Methods (NFM) Steering Committee, comprised of researchers<br>\nspanning several NASA centers. NFM 2019<br>\n(<a href=\"https://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/R2/pages/nfm2019.html\">https://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/R2/pages/nfm2019.html</a>) is being<br>\nco-organized by Rice University and NASA- Johnson Space Center in<br>\nHouston, TX.</p>\n<p>Topics of Interest:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches that bring together<br>\nformal methods and techniques from other domains such as probabilistic<br>\nreasoning, machine learning, control theory, robotics, and quantum<br>\ncomputing among others.</p>\n<p>* Formal verification, including theorem proving, model checking,<br>\nand static analysis</p>\n<p>* Advances in automated theorem proving including SAT and SMT solving<br>\n     * Use of formal methods in software and system testing<br>\n     * Run-time verification<br>\n     * Techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods, such as<br>\nabstraction and symbolic methods, compositional techniques, as well as<br>\nparallel and/or distributed techniques</p>\n<p>* Code generation from formally verified models<br>\n     * Safety cases and system safety<br>\n     * Formal approaches to fault tolerance<br>\n     * Theoretical advances and empirical evaluations of formal methods<br>\ntechniques for safety-critical systems, including hybrid and embedded<br>\nsystems</p>\n<p>* Formal methods in systems engineering and model-based development<br>\n     * Correct-by-design controller synthesis<br>\n     * Formal assurance methods to handle adaptive systems</p>\n<p>Important Dates:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Abstract Submission:  7 Dec 2018<br>\nPaper Submission:    14 Dec 2018<br>\nPaper Notifications: 22 Feb 2019<br>\nCamera-ready Papers: 22 Mar 2019<br>\nSymposium:          7-9 May 2019</p>\n<p>Location &amp; Cost:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The symposium will take place in the McMurtry Auditorium, Rice<br>\nUniversity, Houston, Texas, USA, May 7--9, 2019.</p>\n<p>There will be no registration fee for participants. All interested<br>\nindividuals, including non-US citizens, are welcome to attend, to listen<br>\nto the talks, and to participate in discussions; however, all attendees<br>\nmust register.</p>\n<p>Submission Details:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There are two categories of submissions:</p>\n<p>1. Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete<br>\nresults (15 pages + references)</p>\n<p>2. Two categories of short papers: (6 pages + references)<br>\n    (a) Tool Papers describing novel, publicly-available tools<br>\n    (b) Case Studies detailing complete applications of formal methods<br>\nto real systems with publicly-available artifacts</p>\n<p>All papers should be in English and describe original work that has not<br>\nbeen published or submitted elsewhere. All submissions will be fully<br>\nreviewed by members of the Programme Committee. Papers will appear in a<br>\nvolume of Springer's Lecture Notes on Computer Science (LNCS), and must<br>\nuse LNCS style formatting.
