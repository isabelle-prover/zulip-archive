This happens for both induction and recursion: Whenever a datatype T is defined by nesting a (polymorphic) type L, the induction/recursion principle for T appeals to the set/map operator for L, without delving into the constructors of L. Incidentally, without this modularity principle we would not have been able to nest inductive types into coinductive types or vice versa.</p>\n<p>Andrei<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/0kYufHCW56UpA3mNAPVnzDXe/New_to_Old.thy\">New_to_Old.thy</a></p>",

With the old <br>\ndatatype package, nested datatype recursion was mapped to mutual recursion (as shown by <br>\nJeremy below) where you could specify <em>two</em> inductive predicates (one for trees and one <br>\nfor lists of trees) for the induction. If this is what you want, you can have the datatype <br>\npackage generate the appropriate rule:</p>\n<p>datatype_compat tree</p>\n<p>thm compat_tree_tree_list.induct</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
