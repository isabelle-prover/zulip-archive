Both are defined, verified, and<br>\nproved equivalent in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. It is shown that<br>\nif a guest follows a certain safety policy regarding her key cards,<br>\nshe can be sure that nobody but her can enter her room.</p>\n<p>This theory comes with a paper that will appear in the proceedings of <br>\nICTAC 2006 <a href=\"http://www.iist.unu.edu/ICTAC2006/\">http://www.iist.unu.edu/ICTAC2006/</a></p>\n<p>Note:<br>\nThis article is only available in the development version of the AFP.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nTobias Nipkow</p>",
