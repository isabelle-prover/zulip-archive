We use Isabelle/HOL for a detailed<br>\nsystematic study of regular algebras given by Boffa, Conway, Kozen and Salomaa.<br>\nWe investigate the relationships between these classes, formalise a soundness<br>\nproof for the smallest class (Salomaa's) and obtain completeness of the largest<br>\none (Boffa's) relative to a deep result by Krob. In addition we provide a large<br>\ncollection of regular identities in the general setting of Boffa's axiom. Our<br>\nregular algebra hierarchy is orthogonal to the Kleene algebra hierarchy in the<br>\nArchive of Formal Proofs; we have not aimed at an integration for pragmatic reasons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Regular_Algebras.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Regular_Algebras.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
