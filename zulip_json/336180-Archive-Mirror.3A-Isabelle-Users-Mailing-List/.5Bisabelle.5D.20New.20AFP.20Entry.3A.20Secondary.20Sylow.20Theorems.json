C. Paulson) by what are often called the second, third and fourth Sylow theorems. These theorems state propositions about the number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group and the fact that they are conjugate to each other. The proofs make use of an implementation of group actions and their properties.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
