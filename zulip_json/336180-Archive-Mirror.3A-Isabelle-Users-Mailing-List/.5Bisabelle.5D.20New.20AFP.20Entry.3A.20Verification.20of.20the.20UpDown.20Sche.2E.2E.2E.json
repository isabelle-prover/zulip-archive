Usually, when discretizing a Euclidean space of <br>\ndimension d we need O(n^d) points, for n points along each dimension. Sparse <br>\ngrids are a hierarchical representation where the number of points is reduced to <br>\nO(n * log(n)^d). One disadvantage of such sparse grids is that the algorithm now <br>\noperate recursively in the dimensions and levels of the sparse grid.</p>\n<p>The UpDown scheme allows us to compute the stiffness matrix on such a sparse <br>\ngrid. The stiffness matrix represents the influence of each representation <br>\nfunction on the L^2 scalar product. For a detailed description see Dirk <br>\nPfl√ºger's PhD thesis.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/UpDown_Scheme.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/UpDown_Scheme.shtml</a></p>\n<p>We thank Johannes for this first entry in 2015!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/nLOMlrYKeXzWa3B7-se4mHco/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
