(CSF 2016) presents a <br>\ndependent security type system for compositionally verifying a value-dependent <br>\nnoninterference property, defined in (Murray, PLAS 2015), for concurrent <br>\nprograms. This development formalises that security definition, the type system <br>\nand its soundness proof, and demonstrates its application on some small <br>\nexamples. It was derived from the SIFUM_Type_Systems AFP entry, by Sylvia Grewe, <br>\nHeiko Mantel and Daniel Schoepe, and whose structure it inherits.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Dependent_SIFUM_Type_Systems.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Dependent_SIFUM_Type_Systems.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/4yjAF90TyawNa0Mqqhx41g6T/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
