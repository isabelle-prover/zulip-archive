However, most modern multiprocessors depend on store <br>\nbuffering for efficiency, and provide native sequential consistency only at a <br>\nsubstantial performance penalty. To regain sequential consistency, a programmer <br>\nhas to follow an appropriate programming discipline. However, na\\\"ive <br>\ndisciplines, such as protecting all shared accesses with locks, are not flexible <br>\nenough for building high-performance multiprocessor software. We present a new <br>\ndiscipline for concurrent programming under TSO (total store order, with store <br>\nbuffer forwarding). It does not depend on concurrency primitives, such as locks. <br>\nInstead, threads use ghost operations to acquire and release ownership of memory <br>\naddresses. A thread can write to an address only if no other thread owns it, and <br>\ncan read from an address only if it owns it or it is shared and the thread has <br>\nflushed its store buffer since it last wrote to an address it did not own. This <br>\ndiscipline covers both coarse-grained concurrency (where data is protected by <br>\nlocks) as well as fine-grained concurrency (where atomic operations race to <br>\nmemory). We formalize this discipline in Isabelle/HOL, and prove that if every <br>\nexecution of a program in a system without store buffers follows the discipline, <br>\nthen every execution of the program with store buffers is sequentially <br>\nconsistent. Thus, we can show sequential consistency under TSO by ordinary <br>\nassertional reasoning about the program, without having to consider store <br>\nbuffers at all.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Store_Buffer_Reduction.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Store_Buffer_Reduction.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy ths first entry in 2019 (which goes back to 2010)<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/jlNvOcz4eFuyT5t4tR9y0KAN/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
