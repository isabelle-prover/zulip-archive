Thereby, it can also be seen as an approximation to solve <br>\nthe shortest vector problem (SVP), which is an NP-hard problem, where the <br>\napproximation quality solely depends on the dimension of the lattice, but not <br>\nthe lattice itself. The algorithm also possesses many applications in diverse <br>\nfields of computer science, from cryptanalysis to number theory, but it is <br>\nspecially well-known since it was used to implement the first polynomial-time <br>\nalgorithm to factor polynomials. In this work we present the first mechanized <br>\nsoundness proof of the LLL algorithm to compute short vectors in lattices. The <br>\nformalization follows a textbook by von zur Gathen and Gerhard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/LLL_Basis_Reduction.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/LLL_Basis_Reduction.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ddPemQj2QdJ3Hk9_OZKbJ2fs/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
