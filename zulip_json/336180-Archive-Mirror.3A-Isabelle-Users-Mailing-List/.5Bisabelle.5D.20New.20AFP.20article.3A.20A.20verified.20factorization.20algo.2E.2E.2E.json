Each <br>\nfactor of an integer polynomial belongs to a certain lattice. When factoring <br>\npolynomials, the condition that we are looking for an irreducible polynomial <br>\nmeans that we must look for a small element in a lattice, which can be done by a <br>\nbasis reduction algorithm. In this development we formalize this connection and <br>\nthereby one main application of the LLL basis reduction algorithm: an algorithm <br>\nto factor square-free integer polynomials which runs in polynomial time. The <br>\nwork is based on our previous Berlekamp–Zassenhaus development, where the <br>\nexponential reconstruction phase has been replaced by the polynomial-time basis <br>\nreduction algorithm. Thanks to this formalization we found a serious flaw in a <br>\ntextbook.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/LLL_Factorization.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/LLL_Factorization.html</a></p>\n<p>Textbook authors beware!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/mbXgN_NNEE1LJ2O5aFLhoYo_/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
