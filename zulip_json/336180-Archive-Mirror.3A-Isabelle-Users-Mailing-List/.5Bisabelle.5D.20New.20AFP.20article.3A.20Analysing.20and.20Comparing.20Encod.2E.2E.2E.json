To analyse the quality of encodings and to rule out trivial or <br>\nmeaningless encodings, they are augmented with quality criteria. There exists a <br>\nbunch of different criteria and different variants of criteria in order to <br>\nreason in different settings. This leads to incomparable results. Moreover it is <br>\nnot always clear whether the criteria used to obtain a result in a particular <br>\nsetting do indeed fit to this setting. We show how to formally reason about and <br>\ncompare encodability criteria by mapping them on requirements on a relation <br>\nbetween source and target terms that is induced by the encoding function. In <br>\nparticular we analyse the common criteria full abstraction, operational <br>\ncorrespondence, divergence reflection, success sensitiveness, and respect of <br>\nbarbs; e.g. we analyse the exact nature of the simulation relation (coupled <br>\nsimulation versus bisimulation) that is induced by different variants of <br>\noperational correspondence. This way we reduce the problem of analysing or <br>\ncomparing encodability criteria to the better understood problem of comparing <br>\nrelations on processes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Encodability_Process_Calculi.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Encodability_Process_Calculi.shtml</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/CG9Dlj7SPPYnx7kLlDm05b2o/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
