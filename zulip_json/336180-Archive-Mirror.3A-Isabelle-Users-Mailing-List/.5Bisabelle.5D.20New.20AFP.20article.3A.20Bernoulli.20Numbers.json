This entry <br>\nprovides three different definitions for them: a recursive one, an explicit one, <br>\nand one through their exponential generating function.</p>\n<p>In addition, we prove some basic facts, e.g. their relation to sums of powers of <br>\nintegers and that all odd Bernoulli numbers except the first are zero. We also <br>\nprove the correctness of the Akiyama–Tanigawa algorithm for computing Bernoulli <br>\nnumbers with reasonable efficiency, and we define the periodic Bernoulli <br>\npolynomials (which appear e.g. in the Euler–MacLaurin summation formula and the <br>\nexpansion of the log-Gamma function) and prove their basic properties.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bernoulli.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bernoulli.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/zgXD1BBPFDbqhkRTlhGzKtDa/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
