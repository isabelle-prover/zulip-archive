Stark</p>\n<p>Taking as a starting point the author's previous work on developing aspects of <br>\ncategory theory in Isabelle/HOL, this article gives a compatible formalization <br>\nof the notion of \"bicategory\" and develops a framework within which formal <br>\nproofs of facts about bicategories can be given. The framework includes a number <br>\nof basic results, including the Coherence Theorem, the Strictness Theorem, <br>\npseudofunctors and biequivalence, and facts about internal equivalences and <br>\nadjunctions in a bicategory. As a driving application and demonstration of the <br>\nutility of the framework, it is used to give a formal proof of a theorem, due to <br>\nCarboni, Kasangian, and Street, that characterizes up to biequivalence the <br>\nbicategories of spans in a category with pullbacks. The formalization effort <br>\nnecessitated the filling-in of many details that were not evident from the brief <br>\npresentation in the original paper, as well as identifying a few minor <br>\ncorrections along the way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bicategory.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bicategory.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy this first contribution in 2020, and the second-largest entry in the AFP!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ckDEG7Ar1YYuvroSDV2jj0hV/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
