The proof calculus in this formalization is based on the uniform <br>\nsubstitution principle. We show it is sound with respect to our denotational <br>\nsemantics, which provides increased confidence in the correctness of the <br>\nKeYmaera X theorem prover based on this calculus. As an application, we include <br>\na proof term checker embedded in Isabelle/HOL with several example proofs. <br>\nPublished in: Brandon Bohrer, Vincent Rahli, Ivana Vukotic, Marcus Völp, André <br>\nPlatzer: Formally verified differential dynamic logic.
