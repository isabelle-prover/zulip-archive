We also show how the internal path length relates to <br>\nthe average-case cost of a lookup in a BST.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Random_BSTs.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Random_BSTs.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/Z1jBGTgCNfsWcylqkOGinjk4/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
