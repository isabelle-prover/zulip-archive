ML code reflection is used such that the entire prover <br>\ncan be executed within Isabelle as a very simple interactive proof assistant. As <br>\nexamples we consider Pelletier's problems 1-46.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/FOL_Harrison.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/FOL_Harrison.shtml</a></p>\n<p>First submission in 2017 - Happy New Year!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/wn9Z1-cmlR7rCunoxaphMYJc/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
