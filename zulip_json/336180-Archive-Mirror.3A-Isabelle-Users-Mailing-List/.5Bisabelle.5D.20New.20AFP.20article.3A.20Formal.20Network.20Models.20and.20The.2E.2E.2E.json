Brucker, Lukas Br√ºgger and Burkhart Wolff</p>\n<p>We present a formal model of network protocols and their application to modeling <br>\nfirewall policies. The formalization is based on the Unified Policy Framework <br>\n(UPF). The formalization was originally developed with for generating test cases <br>\nfor testing the security configuration actual firewall and router (middle-boxes) <br>\nusing HOL-TestGen. Our work focuses on modeling application level protocols on <br>\ntop of tcp/ip.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/UPF_Firewall.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/UPF_Firewall.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/eVDautxowh61-h8b-FSWiFyC/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
