This article<br>\ncontains an implementation of a proof method \\texttt{casify}, which can<br>\nbe used to easily extend proof tools with support for named cases. Such<br>\na proof tool must produce labeled subgoals, which are then interpreted<br>\nby \\texttt{casify}.</p>\n<p>As examples, this work contains verification condition generators<br>\nproducing named cases for three languages: The Hoare language from<br>\n\\texttt{HOL/Library}, a monadic language for computations with failure<br>\n(inspired by the AutoCorres tool), and a language of conditional<br>\nexpressions. These VCGs are demonstrated by a number of example programs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Case_Labeling.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Case_Labeling.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Thank you, Lars!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/PkyCiI1Tr4vzDuwG9jbgxn6q/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
