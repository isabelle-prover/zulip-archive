This report presents a formal proof of the<br>\ncorrectness of Huffman's algorithm written using Isabelle/HOL. Our proof<br>\nclosely follows the sketches found in standard algorithms textbooks,<br>\nuncovering a few snags in the process. Another distinguishing feature of<br>\nour formalization is the use of custom induction rules to help<br>\nIsabelle's automatic tactics, leading to very short proofs for most of<br>\nthe lemmas.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Huffman.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Huffman.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy<br>\nTobias</p>",
