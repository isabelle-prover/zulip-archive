Our target use case is interpreters for <br>\nlanguages that must have a well-understood low-level behavior. We include a <br>\nformalization of bounded-length strings which are used for the identifiers of <br>\nour language. Bounded-length identifiers are useful in some applications, for <br>\nexample the Differential_Dynamic_Logic article, where a Euclidean space indexed <br>\nby identifiers demands that identifiers are finitely many.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Interval_Arithmetic_Word32.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Interval_Arithmetic_Word32.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/8EnxK1X4cBpnN2Kr4E-sC_Go/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
