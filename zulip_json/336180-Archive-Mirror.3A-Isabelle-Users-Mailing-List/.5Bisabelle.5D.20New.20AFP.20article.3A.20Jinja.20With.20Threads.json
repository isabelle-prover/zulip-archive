Concurrency is captured in a generic <br>\nframework semantics for adding concurrency to a sequential semantics, <br>\nwhich features dynamic thread creation, inter-thread communication via <br>\nshared memory and lock synchronisation. Also, threads can suspend <br>\nthemselves and be notified by others. We instantiate the framework with <br>\nthe adapted Jinja source code semantics and show type safety for the <br>\nmultithreaded case. For explanations see the FOOL 2008 paper by A. <br>\nLochbihler.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/JinjaThreads.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/JinjaThreads.shtml</a></p>",
