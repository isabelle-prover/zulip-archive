Prathamesh</p>\n<p>This work contains a formalization of some topics in knot theory. The concepts <br>\nthat were formalized include definitions of tangles, links, framed links and <br>\nlink/tangle equivalence. The formalization is based on a formulation of links in <br>\nterms of tangles. We further construct and prove the invariance of the Bracket <br>\npolynomial. Bracket polynomial is an invariant of framed links closely linked to <br>\nthe Jones polynomial. This is perhaps the first attempt to formalize any aspect <br>\nof knot theory in an interactive proof assistant.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Knot_Theory.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Knot_Theory.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/1PE9dbhE1uO8NA5lIsIU1rcD/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
