This well-known result shows that if two non-adjacent <br>\ndistinct vertices u, v in a directed graph have no separator smaller than n, <br>\nthen there exist n internally vertex-disjoint paths from u to v. The version for <br>\nundirected graphs follows immediately because undirected graphs are a special <br>\ncase of directed graphs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Menger.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Menger.shtml</a></p>\n<p>A theorem with a name - enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/3YMI2Fql8N7oo2ac4e10F8yN/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
