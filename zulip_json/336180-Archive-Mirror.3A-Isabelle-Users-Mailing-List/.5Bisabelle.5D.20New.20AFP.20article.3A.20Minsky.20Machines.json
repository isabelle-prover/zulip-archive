We then show that there is a deterministic <br>\nMinsky machine with one argument and two final states such that the set of <br>\ninputs that are accepted in one state is recursively inseparable from the set of <br>\ninputs that are accepted in the other state.</p>\n<p>As a corollary, the set of Minsky configurations that reach the first state but <br>\nnot the second recursively inseparable from the set of Minsky configurations <br>\nthat reach the second state but not the first. In particular both these sets are <br>\nundecidable.</p>\n<p>We do not prove that recursive functions can simulate Minsky machines.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Minsky_Machines.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Minsky_Machines.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/YmetUCUybak7WeXMKlrqQ4U9/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
