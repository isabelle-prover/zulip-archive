A <br>\nHennessy-Milner logic for these systems is defined, and proved adequate for <br>\nbisimulation equivalence. A main novelty is the construction of an infinitary <br>\nnominal data type to model formulas with (finitely supported) infinite <br>\nconjunctions and actions that may contain binding names. The logic is <br>\ngeneralized to treat different bisimulation variants such as early, late and <br>\nopen in a systematic way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Modal_Logics_for_NTS.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Modal_Logics_for_NTS.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/jMsQcyrAqaUN0e1KIgh78XGN/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
