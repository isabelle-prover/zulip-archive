Gomes, Ian J. Hayes and Georg Struth</p>\n<p>Partial Semigroups are relevant to the foundations of quantum mechanics and <br>\ncombinatorics as well as to interval and separation logics. Convolution algebras <br>\ncan be understood either as algebras of generalised binary modalities over <br>\nternary Kripke frames, in particular over partial semigroups, or as algebras of <br>\nquantale-valued functions which are equipped with a convolution-style operation <br>\nof multiplication that is parametrised by a ternary relation. Convolution <br>\nalgebras provide algebraic semantics for various substructural logics, including <br>\ncategorial, relevance and linear logics, for separation logic and for interval <br>\nlogics; they cover quantitative and qualitative applications. These mathematical <br>\ncomponents for partial semigroups and convolution algebras provide uniform <br>\nfoundations from which models of computation based on relations, program traces <br>\nor pomsets, and verification components for separation or interval temporal <br>\nlogics can be built with little effort.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/PSemigroupsConvolution.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/PSemigroupsConvolution.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/T7UHaD00GDasgdyUBSoPzJGw/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
