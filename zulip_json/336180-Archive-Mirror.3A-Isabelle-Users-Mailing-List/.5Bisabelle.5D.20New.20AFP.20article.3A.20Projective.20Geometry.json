We also <br>\nprovide a proof of the so-called Desargues's theorem based on an axiomatization <br>\nof (higher) projective space geometry using the notion of rank of a matroid. <br>\nThis last approach allows to handle incidence relations in an homogeneous way <br>\ndealing only with points and without the need of talking explicitly about lines, <br>\nplanes or any higher entity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Projective_Geometry.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Projective_Geometry.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/wfkY8X65LMoBcwsOy3OT3AhD/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
