In each <br>\ncase both a DNF-based non-elementary algorithm and one or more (doubly) <br>\nexponential NNF-based algorithms are formalized, including the <br>\nwell-known algorithms by Ferrante and Rackoff and by Cooper. The <br>\nNNF-based algorithms for dense linear orders are new but based on <br>\nFerrante and Rackoff and on an algorithm by Loos and Weisspfenning which <br>\nsimulates infenitesimals. All algorithms are directly executable. In <br>\nparticular, they yield reflective quantifier elimination procedures for <br>\nHOL itself. The formalization makes heavy use of locales and is <br>\ntherefore highly modular.</p>\n<p>Enjoy<br>\nTobias</p>",
