The <br>\nremaining three concern geometry and graph theory, which, in the author's <br>\nopinion, are more difficult to formalise resp. require a more complex library.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IMO2019.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IMO2019.html</a></p>\n<p>The International Mathematical Olympiad 2020 will require all participants to <br>\nsubmit their solutions as Isabelle theories.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ZXVd7fEN1mp1PdGOYWmeeMw4/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
