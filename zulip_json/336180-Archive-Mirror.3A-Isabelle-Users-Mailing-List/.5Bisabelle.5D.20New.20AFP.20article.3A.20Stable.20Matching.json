Our focus is on game theoretic issues. <br>\nAlong the way we develop executable algorithms for computing optimal stable matches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Stable_Matching.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Stable_Matching.shtml</a></p>\n<p>I recommen thir article for its exemplary textual documentation of the theories.<br>\nThank you, Peter!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/VHzH3ZrC-3h1bIuWVrvRGRr9/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
