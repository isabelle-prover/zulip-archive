The WithOut Operational Transforms (WOOT) <br>\nframework is a CRDT for collaborative text editing introduced by Oster et al. <br>\n(CSCW 2006) for which the eventual consistency property was verified only for a <br>\nbounded model to date. We contribute a formal proof for WOOTs strong eventual <br>\nconsistency.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/WOOT_Strong_Eventual_Consistency.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/WOOT_Strong_Eventual_Consistency.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/9WoYJyoyGPIoPuG4GXporKq_/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
