It would have been<br>\nenough to show something like lcm{1..n} ∈ O(3.2^n), whereas the PNT<br>\ngives you lcm{1..n} ∈(c^n) for any c &gt; e. Proving such a suitable result<br>\nin an elementary way would probably not be /that/ much work (maybe an<br>\nadditional 1000 lines).</p>\n<p>Not that I would advocate for doing that. We have these advanced<br>\nresults, so we ought to make use of them. It was certainly refreshing to<br>\nformalise a result without having to search through troves of related<br>\npapers for more elementary routes to the same result first and coming up<br>\nwith hacks and tricks to get around using results and concepts that are<br>\nnot available in our system yet.</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
