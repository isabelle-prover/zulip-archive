Colloquially, it restricts the possible <br>\nbehaviors of planar dynamical systems: such systems cannot be chaotic. In <br>\npractice, it is a useful tool for proving the existence of (limiting) periodic <br>\nbehavior in planar systems. The theorem is an interesting and challenging <br>\nbenchmark for formalized mathematics because proofs in the literature rely on <br>\ngeometric sketches and only hint at symmetric cases. It also requires a <br>\nsubstantial background of mathematical theories, e.g., the Jordan curve theorem, <br>\nreal analysis, ordinary differential equations, and limiting (long-term) <br>\nbehavior of dynamical systems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Poincare_Bendixson.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Poincare_Bendixson.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/K0DkmJpsyaciz3y0wZYkJal3/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
