The soundness proof uses the substitution <br>\nlemma, which shows a correspondence between substitutions and updates to an <br>\nenvironment. The completeness proof uses semantic trees, i.e. trees whose paths <br>\nare partial Herbrand interpretations. It employs Herbrand's theorem in a <br>\nformulation which states that an unsatisfiable set of clauses has a finite <br>\nclosed semantic tree. It also uses the lifting lemma which lifts resolution <br>\nderivation steps from the ground world up to the first-order world. The theory <br>\nis presented in a paper at the International Conference on Interactive Theorem <br>\nProving [Sch16] and an earlier version in an MSc thesis [Sch15]. It mostly <br>\nfollows textbooks by Ben-Ari [BA12], Chang and Lee [CL73], and Leitsch [Lei97]. <br>\nThe theory is part of the IsaFoL project [Bla+].</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Resolution_FOL.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Resolution_FOL.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/qdZiGPnbBmbGIhBiJkOUCA9C/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
