The definition is based on a<br>\ngeneral, abstract control flow graph representation using Isabelle locales.</p>\n<p>We prove that the algorithm's output is semantically equivalent to the<br>\ninput according to a small-step semantics, and that it is in minimal SSA<br>\nform for the common special case of reducible inputs. We then show the<br>\nsatisfiability of the locale assumptions by giving instantiations for a<br>\nsimple While language.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we use a generic instantiation based on typedefs in order<br>\nto extract OCaml code and replace the unverified SSA construction<br>\nalgorithm of the CompCertSSA project with it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Formal_SSA.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Formal_SSA.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/S0600lTiIApJLPI-Xu1GlJ37/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
