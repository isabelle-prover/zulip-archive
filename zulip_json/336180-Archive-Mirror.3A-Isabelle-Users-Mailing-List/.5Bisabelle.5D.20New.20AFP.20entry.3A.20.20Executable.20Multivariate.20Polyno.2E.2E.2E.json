We also define (weak) monotonicity of polynomials and<br>\ncomparison of polynomials where we provide standard estimations like<br>\nabsolute positiveness or the more recent approach of Neurauter, Zankl,<br>\nand Middeldorp. Moreover, it is proven that strongly normalizing<br>\n(monotone) orders can be lifted to strongly normalizing (monotone)<br>\norders over polynomials. Our formalization was performed as part of the<br>\nIsaFoR/CeTA-system which contains several termination techniques. The<br>\nprovided theories have been essential to formalize polynomial<br>\ninterpretations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Polynomials.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Polynomials.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Thanks to the authors for sharing!</p>",
