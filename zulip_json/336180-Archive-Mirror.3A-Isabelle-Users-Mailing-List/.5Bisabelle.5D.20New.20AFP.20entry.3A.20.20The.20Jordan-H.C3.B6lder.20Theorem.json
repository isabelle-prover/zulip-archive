The<br>\ntheories formalize the notions of isomorphism classes of groups, simple groups,<br>\nnormal series, composition series, maximal normal subgroups. Furthermore, they<br>\nprovide proofs of the second isomorphism theorem for groups, the<br>\ncharacterization theorem for maximal normal subgroups as well as many useful<br>\nlemmas about normal subgroups and factor groups. The proof is inspired by course<br>\nnotes of Stuart Rankin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Jordan_Hoelder.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Jordan_Hoelder.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
