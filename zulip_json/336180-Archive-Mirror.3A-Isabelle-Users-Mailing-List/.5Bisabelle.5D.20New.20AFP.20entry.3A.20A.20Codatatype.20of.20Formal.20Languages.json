This is the first one:</p>\n<p>Dmitriy Traytel: A Codatatype of Formal Languages</p>\n<p>We define formal languages as a codataype of infinite trees branching over the<br>\nalphabet. Each node in such a tree indicates whether the path to this<br>\nnode constitutes a word inside or outside of the language. This codatatype<br>\nis isormorphic to the set of lists representation of languages,<br>\nbut caters for definitions by corecursion and proofs by coinduction.</p>\n<p>Regular operations on languages are then defined by primitive corecursion.<br>\nA difficulty arises here, since the standard definitions of concatenation and<br>\niteration from the coalgebraic literature are not primitively corecursive-they<br>\nrequire guardedness up-to union/concatenation. Without support for up-to<br>\ncorecursion, these operation must be defined as a composition of primitive ones<br>\n(and proved being equal to the standard definitions). As an exercise in<br>\ncoinduction we also prove the axioms of Kleene algebra for the defined regular<br>\noperations.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a language for context-free grammars given by productions in<br>\nGreibach normal form and an initial nonterminal is constructed by primitive<br>\ncorecursion, yielding an executable decision procedure for the word problem<br>\nwithout further ado.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Coinductive_Languages.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Coinductive_Languages.shtml</a></p>",
