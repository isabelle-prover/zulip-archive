This approach decomposes LTL <br>\nformulas into ``simple'' languages and allows a clear separation of concerns: <br>\nfirst, we formalise the purely logical result yielding this decomposition; <br>\nsecond, we instantiate this generic theory to obtain a construction for <br>\ndeterministic (state-based) Rabin automata (DRA). We extract from this <br>\nparticular instantiation an executable tool translating LTL to DRAs. To the best <br>\nof our knowledge this is the first verified translation from LTL to DRAs that is <br>\nproven to be double exponential in the worst case which asymptotically matches <br>\nthe known lower bound.</p>\n<p>[1] Javier Esparza, Jan Kretínský, Salomon Sickert.
