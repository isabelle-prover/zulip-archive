Aiming at a<br>\nframework for mechanising the verification<br>\nof TLA (or TLA*) specifications, this contribution reuses some elements<br>\nfrom a<br>\nprevious axiomatic encoding of TLA in Isabelle/HOL by the second author,<br>\nwhich has been part of the<br>\nIsabelle distribution. In contrast to that previous work, we give here a<br>\nshallow, definitional<br>\nembedding, with the following highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a theory of infinite sequences, including a formalisation of the<br>\nconcepts of stuttering invariance central to TLA and TLA*;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a definition of the semantics of TLA*, which extends TLA by a<br>\nmutually-recursive definition of formulas and pre-formulas, generalising<br>\nTLA action formulas;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a substantial set of derived proof rules, including the TLA* axioms<br>\nand Lamport's proof rules for system verification;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a set of examples illustrating the usage of Isabelle/TLA* for<br>\nreasoning about systems.<br>\nNote that this work is unrelated to the ongoing development of a proof<br>\nsystem for the specification language TLA+,<br>\nwhich includes an encoding of TLA+ as a new Isabelle object logic.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
