The proofs of one subgoal of that subclass statement and four lemmas further down have been generated automatically. I used Prover9 and wrote a simple translator to Isar.</p>\n<p>More details: the classes implement algebras. The assumptions are axioms, which are manually encoded as input for Prover9 together with the statement you want to prove. Prover9 generates quite detailed output including a deduction if it finds a proof. It is mostly straight-forward to translate to Isar (outside of Isabelle) and usually metis can prove the individual steps. Sometimes a bit of manual post-processing was needed, such as using smt or Sledgehammer if metis failed to prove a step. Also the translator currently does not handle constants which appear in some Prover9 proofs. The method worked quite well for this kind of reasoning in algebras. I only used it when I could not make any progress using Sledgehammer.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nWalter</p>",
