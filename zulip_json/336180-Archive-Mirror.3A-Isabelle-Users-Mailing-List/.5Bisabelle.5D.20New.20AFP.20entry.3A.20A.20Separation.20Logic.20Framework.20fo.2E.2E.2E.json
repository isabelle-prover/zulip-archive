Our framework comes with a set of proof methods to<br>\nautomate canonical tasks such as verification condition generation and frame<br>\ninference. Moreover, we provide a set of examples that show the applicability of<br>\nour framework. The examples include algorithms on lists, hash-tables, and<br>\nunion-find trees. We also provide abstract interfaces for lists, maps, and sets,<br>\nthat allow to develop generic imperative algorithms and use data-refinement<br>\ntechniques.</p>\n<p>As we target Imperative HOL, our programs can be translated to efficiently<br>\nexecutable code in various target languages, including ML, OCaml, Haskell, and<br>\nScala.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
