The completeness is shown via a translation from a <br>\ncomplete semantic tableau calculus, the proof of which is based on the <br>\nFirst-Order Logic According to Fitting theory. The calculi and proof techniques <br>\nare taken from Ben-Ari's Mathematical Logic for Computer Science.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/FOL_Seq_Calc1.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/FOL_Seq_Calc1.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ueh9C2BSVkxViwm3jTFbkI1H/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
