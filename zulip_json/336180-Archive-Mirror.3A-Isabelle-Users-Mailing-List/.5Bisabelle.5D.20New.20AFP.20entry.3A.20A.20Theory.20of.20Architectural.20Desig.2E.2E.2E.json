Each pattern specification is formalized in terms of a locale where <br>\nthe locale assumptions correspond to the assumptions which a pattern poses on an <br>\narchitecture. Thus, pattern specifications may build on top of each other by <br>\ninterpreting the corresponding locale. A pattern is verified using the framework <br>\nprovided by the AFP entry Dynamic Architectures. Currently, the document <br>\nconsists of formalizations of 4 different patterns: the singleton, the publisher <br>\nsubscriber, the blackboard pattern, and the blockchain pattern. Thereby, the <br>\npublisher component of the publisher subscriber pattern is modeled as an <br>\ninstance of the singleton pattern and the blackboard pattern is modeled as an <br>\ninstance of the publisher subscriber pattern. In general, this entry provides <br>\nthe first steps towards an overall theory of architectural design patterns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Architectural_Design_Patterns.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Architectural_Design_Patterns.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/g_dfNxp3xp_UyOP9tvzxtsNK/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
