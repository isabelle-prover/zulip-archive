We formalize the resulting hierarchy of probabilistic system<br>\ntypes by modeling the semantics of the different systems as codatatypes.<br>\nThis approach yields simple and concise proofs, as bisimilarity coincides<br>\nwith equality for codatatypes.</p>\n<p>This work is described in detail in the ITP 2015 publication by the authors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Probabilistic_System_Zoo.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Probabilistic_System_Zoo.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/-XKhD1tm8uUxCWNc1wYsglbr/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
