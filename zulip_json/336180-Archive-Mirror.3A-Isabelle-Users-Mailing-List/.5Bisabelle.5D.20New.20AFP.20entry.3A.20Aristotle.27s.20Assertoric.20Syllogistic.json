In <br>\nparticular, we formalise the deductions in the Figures and after that we present <br>\nAristotle's metatheoretical observation that all deductions in the Figures can <br>\nin fact be reduced to either Barbara or Celarent. As the formal proofs prove to <br>\nbe straightforward, the interest of this entry lies in illustrating the <br>\nfunctionality of Isabelle and high efficiency of Sledgehammer for simple <br>\nexercises in philosophy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Aristotles_Assertoric_Syllogistic.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Aristotles_Assertoric_Syllogistic.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/bsQ04_hjd_3oH2fQ-z0_Scxp/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
