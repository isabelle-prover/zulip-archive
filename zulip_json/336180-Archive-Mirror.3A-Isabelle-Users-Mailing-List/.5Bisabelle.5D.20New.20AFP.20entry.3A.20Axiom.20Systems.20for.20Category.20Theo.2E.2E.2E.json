Extending the <br>\nprevious studies (<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01493\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01493</a>) we include one further <br>\naxiomatic theory in our experiments. This additional theory has been suggested <br>\nby Mac Lane in 1948. We show that the axioms proposed by Mac Lane are equivalent <br>\nto the ones we studied before, which includes an axioms set suggested by Scott <br>\nin the 1970s and another axioms set proposed by Freyd and Scedrov in 1990, which <br>\nwe slightly modified to remedy a minor technical issue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/AxiomaticCategoryTheory.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/AxiomaticCategoryTheory.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/fy-RMu0rd2FLFBq8zwFWuYpa/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
