The <br>\ncorrectness of the following heap operations is proved: insert, get-min, <br>\ndelete-min and make-heap. These are then used to verify an in-place heapsort. <br>\nThe formalization is based on IMP2, an imperative program verification framework <br>\nimplemented in Isabelle/HOL. The verified heap functions are iterative versions <br>\nof the partly recursive functions found in \"Algorithms and Data Structures â€“ The <br>\nBasic Toolbox\" by K. Mehlhorn and P. Sanders and \"Introduction to Algorithms\" by <br>\nT. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest and C. Stein.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IMP2_Binary_Heap.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IMP2_Binary_Heap.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/EqTdXRSwM4IRYxf3f0PpEPpW/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
