It generalizes Sutherland's classic notion of<br>\nnondeducibility by factoring in declassification bounds and trigger, whereas<br>\nnondeducibility states that, in a system, information cannot flow between<br>\nspecified sources and sinks, BD security indicates upper bounds for the flow and<br>\ntriggers under which these upper bounds are no longer guaranteed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
