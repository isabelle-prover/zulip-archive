This entry formally defines the problem in the <br>\ncase where the needle's position is chosen uniformly at random in a single strip <br>\naround the origin (which is equivalent to larger arrangements due to symmetry). <br>\nIt then provides proofs of the simple solution in the case where the needle's <br>\nlength is no greater than the width of the strips and the more complicated <br>\nsolution in the opposite case.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Buffons_Needle.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Buffons_Needle.shtml</a></p>\n<p>This is another one off the list of 100 Theorems.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/AoDPx3shRl7lDGZSlYnEkRMw/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
