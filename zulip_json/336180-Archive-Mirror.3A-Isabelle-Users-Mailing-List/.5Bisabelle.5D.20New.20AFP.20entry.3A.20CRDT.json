F. Gomes, Martin Kleppmann, Dominic P. Mulligan and Alastair R. Beresford</p>\n<p>In this work, we focus on the correctness of Conflict-free Replicated Data Types <br>\n(CRDTs), a class of algorithm that provides strong eventual consistency <br>\nguarantees for replicated data. We develop a modular and reusable framework for <br>\nverifying the correctness of CRDT algorithms. We avoid correctness issues that <br>\nhave dogged previous mechanised proofs in this area by including a network model <br>\nin our formalisation, and proving that our theorems hold in all possible network <br>\nbehaviours. Our axiomatic network model is a standard abstraction that <br>\naccurately reflects the behaviour of real-world computer networks. Moreover, we <br>\nidentify an abstract convergence theorem, a property of order relations, which <br>\nprovides a formal definition of strong eventual consistency. We then obtain the <br>\nfirst machine-checked correctness theorems for three concrete CRDTs: the <br>\nReplicated Growable Array, the Observed-Remove Set, and an Increment-Decrement <br>\nCounter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CRDT.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CRDT.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy (your w/e) ;-)<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/NB6wgznT3kUV0JIkARKSkFlB/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
