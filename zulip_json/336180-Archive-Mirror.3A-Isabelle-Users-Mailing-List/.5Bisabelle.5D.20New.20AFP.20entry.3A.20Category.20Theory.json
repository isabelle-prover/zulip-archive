Functors and Natural<br>\nTransformations are also defined. The main result that has been<br>\nformalized is that the Yoneda functor is a full and faithful embedding.<br>\nWe also formalize the completeness of many sorted monadic equational<br>\nlogic. Extensive use is made of the HOLZF theory in both cases.<br>\n<a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Category2.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Category2.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
