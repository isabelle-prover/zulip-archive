We keep our formalization as <br>\ngeneral as possible: we reprove several well-known results about complete <br>\norders, often without any properties of ordering, thus complete non-orders. In <br>\nparticular, we generalize the Knaster–Tarski theorem so that we ensure the <br>\nexistence of a quasi-fixed point of monotone maps over complete non-orders, and <br>\nshow that the set of quasi-fixed points is complete under a mild <br>\ncondition—attractivity—which is implied by either antisymmetry or transitivity. <br>\nThis result generalizes and strengthens a result by Stauti and Maaden. Finally, <br>\nwe recover Kleene’s fixed-point theorem for omega-complete non-orders, again <br>\nusing attractivity to prove that Kleene’s fixed points are least quasi-fixed points.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Complete_Non_Orders.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Complete_Non_Orders.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/KOWuzYKd1TovMiDf0XJ7_Xxg/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
