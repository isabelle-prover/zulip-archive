Despite their brevity, their ability to operate in concurrent, <br>\nasynchronous and failure-prone environments comes at the cost of complex and <br>\nsubtle behaviors. Accordingly, understanding how they work and proving their <br>\ncorrectness is a non-trivial endeavor where abstraction is immensely helpful. <br>\nMoreover, research on consensus has yielded a large number of algorithms, many <br>\nof which appear to share common algorithmic ideas. A natural question is whether <br>\nand how these similarities can be distilled and described in a precise, unified <br>\nway. In this work, we combine stepwise refinement and lockstep models to provide <br>\nan abstract and unified view of a sizeable family of consensus algorithms. Our <br>\nmodels provide insights into the design choices underlying the different <br>\nalgorithms, and classify them based on those choices.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/t7IRu4U4JaUA6IrRgrZ5977e/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
