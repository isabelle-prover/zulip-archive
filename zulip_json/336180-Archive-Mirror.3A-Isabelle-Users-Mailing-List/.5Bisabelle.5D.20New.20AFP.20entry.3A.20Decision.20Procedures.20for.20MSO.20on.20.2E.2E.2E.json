Since MSO formulas<br>\ncorrespond to regular languages, equivalence of MSO formulas can be reduced to<br>\nthe equivalence of some regular structures (e.g. automata). We verify an<br>\nexecutable decision procedure for MSO formulas that is not based on automata but<br>\non regular expressions.</p>\n<p>Decision procedures for regular expression equivalence have been formalized<br>\nbefore, usually based on Brzozowski derivatives. Yet, for a straightforward<br>\nembedding of MSO formulas into regular expressions an extension of regular<br>\nexpressions with a projection operation is required. We prove total correctness<br>\nand completeness of an equivalence checker for regular expressions extended in<br>\nthat way. We also define a language-preserving translation of formulas into<br>\nregular expressions with respect to two different semantics of MSO.</p>\n<p>The formalization is described in this ICFP 2013 functional pearl:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/icfp13.html\">http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/icfp13.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/MSO_Regex_Equivalence.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/MSO_Regex_Equivalence.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
