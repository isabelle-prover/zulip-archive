Formulas of these logics denote regular languages. Unlike <br>\ntraditional decision procedures, we do <em>not</em> translate formulas into automata <br>\n(nor into regular expressions), at least not explicitly. Instead we devise <br>\nnotions of derivatives (inspired by Brzozowski derivatives for regular <br>\nexpressions) that operate on formulas directly and compute a syntactic <br>\nbisimulation using these derivatives. The treatment of Boolean connectives and <br>\nquantifiers is uniform for all mentioned logics and is abstracted into a locale. <br>\nThis locale is then instantiated by different atomic formulas and their <br>\nderivatives (which may differ even for the same logic under different encodings <br>\nof interpretations as formal words).</p>\n<p>The WS1S instance is described in the draft paper \"A Coalgebraic Decision <br>\nProcedure for WS1S\" <br>\n(<a href=\"http://www21.in.tum.de/~traytel/papers/ws1s_derivatives/index.html\">http://www21.in.tum.de/~traytel/papers/ws1s_derivatives/index.html</a>) by the author.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Formula_Derivatives.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Formula_Derivatives.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/pJClxD7423zEqSz5S_9yWAzl/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
