Our refinement strategy transforms abstract security goals into <br>\nprotocols that are secure when operating over an insecure channel controlled by <br>\na Dolev-Yao-style intruder. As intermediate levels of abstraction, we employ <br>\nmessageless guard protocols and channel protocols communicating over channels <br>\nwith security properties. These abstractions provide insights on why protocols <br>\nare secure and foster the development of families of protocols sharing common <br>\nstructure and properties. We have implemented our method in Isabelle/HOL and <br>\nused it to develop different entity authentication and key establishment <br>\nprotocols, including realistic features such as key confirmation, replay caches, <br>\nand encrypted tickets. Our development highlights that guard protocols and <br>\nchannel protocols provide fundamental abstractions for bridging the gap between <br>\nsecurity properties and standard protocol descriptions based on cryptographic <br>\nmessages. It also shows that our refinement approach scales to protocols of <br>\nnontrivial size and complexity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Security_Protocol_Refinement.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Security_Protocol_Refinement.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/uilKvC7NEObD0oAzuAaUl2O2/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
