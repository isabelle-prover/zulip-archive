This algorithm is then instantiated for lists over <br>\narbitrary carriers and red black trees (which are faster but require a <br>\nlinear order on the carrier), respectively. Our formalization was <br>\nperformed as part of the IsaFoR/CeTA project where reflexive transitive <br>\nclosures of large tree automata have to be computed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Transitive-Closure.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Transitive-Closure.shtml</a></p>",
