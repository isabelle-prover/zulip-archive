We model reactive systems as <br>\nmonotonic property transformers that transform sets of output infinite sequences <br>\ninto sets of input infinite sequences. Within this semantics we can model <br>\nrefinement of reactive systems, (unbounded) angelic and demonic nondeterminism, <br>\nsequential composition, and other semantic properties. We can model systems that <br>\nmay fail for some inputs, and we can model compatibility of systems. We can <br>\nspecify systems that have liveness properties using linear temporal logic, and <br>\nwe can refine system specifications into systems based on symbolic transitions <br>\nsystems, suitable for implementations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/RefinementReactive.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/RefinementReactive.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/djzaDslu35X1iWTY6WVLoFc9/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
