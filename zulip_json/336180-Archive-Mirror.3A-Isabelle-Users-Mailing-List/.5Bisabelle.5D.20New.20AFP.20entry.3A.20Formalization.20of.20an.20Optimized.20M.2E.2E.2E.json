Additionally, the monitor supports aggregation operations such as <br>\ncount and sum. This formalization, which is described in a forthcoming paper at <br>\nIJCAR 2020, significantly extends previous work on a verified monitor for MFOTL. <br>\nApart from the addition of regular expressions and aggregations, we implemented <br>\nmulti-way joins and a specialized sliding window algorithm to further optimize <br>\nthe monitor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MFODL_Monitor_Optimized.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MFODL_Monitor_Optimized.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/5sOxxa7vboK5bwCPxdTN9R2c/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
