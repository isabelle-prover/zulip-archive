Joosten</p>\n<p>This is an Isabelle/HOL formalisation of graph saturation, closely following a <br>\npaper by the author on graph saturation. Nine out of ten lemmas of the original <br>\npaper are proven in this formalisation. The formalisation additionally includes <br>\ntwo theorems that show the main premise of the paper: that consistency and <br>\nentailment are decided through graph saturation. This formalisation does not <br>\ngive executable code, and it did not implement any of the optimisations <br>\nsuggested in the paper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Graph_Saturation.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Graph_Saturation.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/WJNV3VXWmu2aenDVDmEsGVYP/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
