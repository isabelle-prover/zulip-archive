A polymorphic edge type allows edges<br>\nto be treated as pairs of vertices, if multi-edges are not required. Formalized<br>\nproperties are i.a. walks (and related concepts), connectedness and subgraphs<br>\nand basic properties of isomorphisms.</p>\n<p>This formalization is used to prove characterizations of Euler Trails, Shortest<br>\nPaths and Kuratowski subgraphs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Graph_Theory.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Graph_Theory.shtml</a></p>",
