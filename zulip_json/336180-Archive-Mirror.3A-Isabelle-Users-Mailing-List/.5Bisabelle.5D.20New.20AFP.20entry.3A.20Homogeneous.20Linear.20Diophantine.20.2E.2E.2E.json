Both, the characterization and <br>\nthe algorithm are based on previous work by Huet. Our starting point is a simple <br>\nbut inefficient variant of Huet's lexicographic algorithm incorporating improved <br>\nbounds due to Clausen and Fortenbacher. We proceed by proving its soundness and <br>\ncompleteness. Finally, we employ code equations to obtain a reasonably efficient <br>\nimplementation. Thus, we provide a formally verified solver for homogeneous <br>\nlinear diophantine equations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Diophantine_Eqns_Lin_Hom.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Diophantine_Eqns_Lin_Hom.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/aV8np-Vfy1rGBIw5wv00-y1H/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
