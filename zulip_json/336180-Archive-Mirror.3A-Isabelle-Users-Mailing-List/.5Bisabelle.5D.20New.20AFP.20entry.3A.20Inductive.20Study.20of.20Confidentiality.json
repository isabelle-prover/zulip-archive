They<br>\naim at an illustrative and didactic presentation of the Inductive Method of<br>\nprotocol analysis, focusing on the treatment of one of the main goals of<br>\nsecurity protocols: confidentiality against a threat model. The treatment of<br>\nconfidentiality, which in fact forms a key aspect of all protocol analysis<br>\ntools, has been found cryptic by many learners of the Inductive Method, hence<br>\nthe motivation for this work. The theory files in this document guide the reader<br>\nstep by step towards design and proof of significant confidentiality theorems.<br>\nThese are developed against two threat models, the standard Dolev-Yao and a more<br>\naudacious one, the General Attacker, which turns out to be particularly useful<br>\nalso for teaching purposes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Inductive_Confidentiality.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Inductive_Confidentiality.shtml</a></p>",
