We present sufficient conditions for when a<br>\nrule is invertible with respect to a calculus. We illustrate the<br>\nconditions with examples. It must be noted we give purely syntactic<br>\ncriteria; no guarantees are given as to the suitability of the rules.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/SequentInvertibility.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/SequentInvertibility.shtml</a></p>\n<p>For users of Nominal Isabelle I recommend the subtheory NominalSequents.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nTobias</p>",
