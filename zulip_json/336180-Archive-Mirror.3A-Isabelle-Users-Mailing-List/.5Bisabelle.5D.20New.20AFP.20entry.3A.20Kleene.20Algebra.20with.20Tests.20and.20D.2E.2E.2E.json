F. Gomes, Georg Struth</p>\n<p>We formalise Kleene algebra with tests (KAT) and demonic refinement<br>\nalgebra (DRA) in Isabelle/HOL. KAT is relevant for program verification<br>\nand correctness proofs in the partial correctness setting. While DRA<br>\ntargets similar applications in the context of total correctness. Our<br>\nformalisation contains the two most important models of these algebras:<br>\nbinary relations in the case of KAT and predicate transformers in the<br>\ncase of DRA. In addition, we derive the inference rules for Hoare logic<br>\nin KAT and its relational model and present a simple formally verified<br>\nprogram verification tool prototype based on the algebraic approach.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/KAT_and_DRA.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/KAT_and_DRA.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
