We<br>\nshow that powersets over a given monoid, (regular) languages, sets of<br>\npaths in a graph, sets of computation traces, and binary relations form<br>\nKleene algebras, and consider further models based on lattices,<br>\nmax-plus semirings and min-plus semirings. We also demonstrate that<br>\ndioids are closed under the formation of matrices and formal power<br>\nseries (proofs for Kleene algebras remain to be completed).</p>\n<p>On the one hand we have aimed at a reference formalisation of variants<br>\nof Kleene algebras that covers a wide range of variants and the core<br>\ntheorems in a structured and modular way and provides readable proofs<br>\nat text book level. On the other hand, we intend to use this algebraic<br>\nhierarchy and its models as a generic algebraic middle-layer from which<br>\nprogramming applications can quickly be explored, implemented and<br>\nverified.</p>\n<p>In the AFP at last!</p>",
