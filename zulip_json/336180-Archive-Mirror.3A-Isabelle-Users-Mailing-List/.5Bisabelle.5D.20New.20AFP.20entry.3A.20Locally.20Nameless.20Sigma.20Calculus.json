We prove confluence of the operational<br>\nsemantics following the outline of Nipkow's proof of confluence for the<br>\nlambda-calculus reusing his general Commutation.thy [4] a generic<br>\ndiamond lemma reduction. We furthermore formalize a simple type system<br>\nfor our sigma-calculus including a proof of type safety. The entire<br>\ndevelopment uses the concept of Locally Nameless representation for<br>\nbinders [2]. The first part, i.e. sigma-calculus confluence, has been<br>\npublished on an earlier version based on lists and de Bruijn indices [3].</p>\n<p>[1] M. Abadi and L. Cardelli. A Theory of Objects.
