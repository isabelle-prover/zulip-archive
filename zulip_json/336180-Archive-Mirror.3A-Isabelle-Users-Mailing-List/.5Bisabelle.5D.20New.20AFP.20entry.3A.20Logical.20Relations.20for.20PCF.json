We show that the Y combinator coincides<br>\nwith the domain-theoretic fixpoint operator, that parallel-or and the Plotkin<br>\nexistential are not definable in PCF, that the continuation semantics for PCF<br>\ncoincides with the direct semantics, and that our domain-theoretic semantics for<br>\nPCF is adequate for reasoning about contextual equivalence in an operational<br>\nsemantics. Our version of PCF is untyped and has both strict and non-strict<br>\nfunction abstractions. The development is carried out in HOLCF.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/PCF.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/PCF.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
