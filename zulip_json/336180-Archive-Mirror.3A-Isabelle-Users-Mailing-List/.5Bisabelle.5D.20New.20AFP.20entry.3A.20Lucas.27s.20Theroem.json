We first outline extensions to the existing Formal<br>\nPower Series (FPS) library, including an equivalence relation for<br>\ncoefficients modulo n, an alternate binomial theorem statement, and a<br>\nformalised proof of the Freshman's dream (mod p) lemma. The second part<br>\nof the work presents the formal proof of Lucas's Theorem. Working<br>\nbackwards, the formalisation first proves a well known corollary of the<br>\ntheorem which is easier to formalise, and then applies induction to<br>\nprove the original theorem statement. The proof of the corollary aims to<br>\nprovide a good example of a formalised generating function equivalence<br>\nproof using the FPS library. The final theorem statement is intended to<br>\nbe integrated into the formalised proof of Hilbert's 10th Problem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Lucas_Theorem.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Lucas_Theorem.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
