These <br>\nstructures play an important role in combinatorial optimisation, e. g. greedy <br>\nalgorithms such as Kruskal's algorithm. The development is based on Oxley's <br>\n`What is a Matroid?'.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/qTkftLyNO7REnl-6nh_uYtfU/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
