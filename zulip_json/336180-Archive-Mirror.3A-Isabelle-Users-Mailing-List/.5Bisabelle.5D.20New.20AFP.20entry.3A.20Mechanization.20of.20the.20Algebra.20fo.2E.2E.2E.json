AWN models comprise five distinct layers: sequential processes, local parallel compositions, nodes, partial networks, and complete networks.</p>\n<p>This development mechanises the original operational semantics of AWN and introduces a variant 'open' operational semantics that enables the compositional statement and proof of invariants across distinct network nodes. It supports labels (for weakening invariants) and (abstract) data state manipulations. A framework for compositional invariant proofs is developed, including a tactic (inv_cterms) for inductive invariant proofs of sequential processes, lifting rules for the open versions of the higher layers, and a rule for transferring lifted properties back to the standard semantics. A notion of 'control terms' reduces proof obligations to the subset of subterms that act directly (in contrast to operators for combining terms and joining processes).</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
