In their work, the authors have shown that Braun et al.'s <br>\nstatic single assignment (SSA) construction algorithm produces minimal SSA form <br>\nfor input programs with a reducible control flow graph (CFG). However Braun et <br>\nal. also proposed an extension to their algorithm that they claim produces <br>\nminimal SSA form even for irreducible CFGs.<br>\nIn this formalization we support that claim by giving a mechanized proof.</p>\n<p>As the extension of Braun et al.'s algorithm aims for removing so-called <br>\nredundant strongly connected components of phi functions, we show that this <br>\nsuffices to guarantee minimality according to Cytron et al..</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Minimal_SSA.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Minimal_SSA.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/YxPWvWlXgllVHV5IZjbPt6jq/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
