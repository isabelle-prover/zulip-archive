Stark</p>\n<p>Building on the formalization of basic category theory set out in the author's <br>\nprevious AFP article, the present article formalizes some basic aspects of the <br>\ntheory of monoidal categories. Among the notions defined here are monoidal <br>\ncategory, monoidal functor, and equivalence of monoidal categories. The main <br>\ntheorems formalized are MacLane's coherence theorem and the constructions of the <br>\nfree monoidal category and free strict monoidal category generated by a given <br>\ncategory. The coherence theorem is proved syntactically, using a structurally <br>\nrecursive approach to reduction of terms that might have some novel aspects. We <br>\nalso give proofs of some results given by Etingof et al, which may prove useful <br>\nin a formal setting. In particular, we show that the left and right unitors need <br>\nnot be taken as given data in the definition of monoidal category, nor does the <br>\ndefinition of monoidal functor need to take as given a specific isomorphism <br>\nexpressing the preservation of the unit object. Our definitions of monoidal <br>\ncategory and monoidal functor are stated so as to take advantage of the economy <br>\nafforded by these facts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MonoidalCategory.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MonoidalCategory.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/a_6Z61omLGRGixHS-PWXm43k/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
