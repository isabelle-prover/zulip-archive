It includes a balanced build algorithm as well as the nearest <br>\nneighbor algorithm and the range search algorithm. It is based on the papers <br>\nMultidimensional binary search trees used for associative searching and An <br>\nAlgorithm for Finding Best Matches in Logarithmic Expected Time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/KD_Tree.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/KD_Tree.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/yitMiRWfsTF8aXVImLEwj6fQ/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
