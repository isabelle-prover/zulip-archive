A security<br>\npolicy is represented as directed graph. To check high-level security goals,<br>\nsecurity invariants over the policy are expressed. We cover monotonic security<br>\ninvariants, i.e. prohibiting more does not harm security. We provide the<br>\nfollowing contributions for the security invariant theory.<br>\n(i)   Secure auto-completion of scenario-specific knowledge, which eases usability.<br>\n(ii)  Security violations can be repaired by tightening the policy iff the<br>\nsecurity invariants hold for the deny-all policy.<br>\n(iii) An algorithm to compute a security policy.<br>\n(iv)  A formalization of stateful connection semantics in network security<br>\nmechanisms.<br>\n(v)   An algorithm to compute a secure stateful implementation of a policy.<br>\n(vi)  An executable implementation of all the theory.<br>\n(vii) Examples, ranging from an aircraft cabin data network to the analysis of a<br>\nlarge real-world firewall.</p>\n<p>For a detailed description, see<br>\nC.
