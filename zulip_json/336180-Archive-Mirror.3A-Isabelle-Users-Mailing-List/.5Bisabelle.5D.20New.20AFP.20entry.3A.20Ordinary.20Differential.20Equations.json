We introduce general one-step<br>\nmethods for numerical approximation of the solution and provide an analysis<br>\nregarding the local and global error of one-step methods. We give an executable<br>\nspecification of the Euler method to approximate the solution of IVPs and prove<br>\nan explicit bound for the global error. We use arbitrary-precision<br>\nfloating-point numbers and also handle rounding errors when we truncate the<br>\nnumbers for efficiency reasons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/devel-entries/Ordinary_Differential_Equations.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/devel-entries/Ordinary_Differential_Equations.shtml</a><br>\n(Currently only in the development version)</p>",
