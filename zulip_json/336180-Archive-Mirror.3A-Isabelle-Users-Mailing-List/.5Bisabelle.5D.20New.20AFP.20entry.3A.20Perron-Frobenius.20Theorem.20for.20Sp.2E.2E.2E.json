In case A contains only non-negative real values, a simplification <br>\nis possible with the help of the Perron-Frobenius theorem, which tells us that <br>\nit suffices to consider only the real eigenvalues of A, i.e., applying Sturm's <br>\nmethod can decide the polynomial growth of A^n.</p>\n<p>We formalize the Perron-Frobenius theorem based on a proof via Brouwer's <br>\nfixpoint theorem, which is available in the HOL multivariate analysis (HMA) <br>\nlibrary. Since the results on the spectral radius is based on matrices in the <br>\nJordan normal form (JNF) library, we further develop a connection which allows <br>\nus to easily transfer theorems between HMA and JNF. With this connection we <br>\nderive the combined result: if A is a non-negative real matrix, and no real <br>\neigenvalue of A is strictly larger than one, then A^n is polynomially bounded in n.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Much as I welcome new formalizations, especially such substantial and <br>\nfundamental ones, maybe we can call it a day for today ;-)<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/E0v62MgZetY81VONhNCSR0-M/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
