We define notions probabilistic noninterference in two variants: resumption-based and trace-based. For the resumption-based notions, we prove compositionality w.r.t. the language constructs and establish sound type-system-like syntactic criteria.</p>\n<p>This is a formalization of the mathematical development presented at CPP 2013 and CALCO 2013. It is the probabilistic variant of the Possibilistic Noninterference AFP entry.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
