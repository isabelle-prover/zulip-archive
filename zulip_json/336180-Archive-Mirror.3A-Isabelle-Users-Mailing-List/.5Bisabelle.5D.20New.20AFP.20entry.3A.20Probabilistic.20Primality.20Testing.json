Examples of <br>\nthis are the Miller–Rabin test, the Solovay–Strassen test, and (in most cases) <br>\nFermat's test.</p>\n<p>This entry defines these three tests and proves their correctness. It also <br>\ndevelops some of the number-theoretic foundations, such as Carmichael numbers <br>\nand the Jacobi symbol with an efficient executable algorithm to compute it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Probabilistic_Prime_Tests.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Probabilistic_Prime_Tests.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/OVFjDzlaRvw-N1uh8XZlebJp/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
