However, for each conjecture, knowing which automation to use, and <br>\nhow to tweak its parameters, is currently labour intensive. We have developed a <br>\nlanguage, PSL, designed to capture high level proof strategies. PSL offloads the <br>\nconstruction of human-readable fast-to-replay proof scripts to automatic search, <br>\nmaking use of search-time information about each conjecture. Our preliminary <br>\nevaluations show that PSL reduces the labour cost of interactive theorem <br>\nproving. This submission contains the implementation of PSL and an example <br>\ntheory file, Example.thy, showing how to write poof strategies in PSL.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Proof_Strategy_Language.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Proof_Strategy_Language.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/wMJo7aJ9WrYd974Wf2jsy7tm/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
