We are interested in the probability that a<br>\nrandom graph contains a certain pattern, for example a cycle or a clique. A very<br>\nhigh edge probability gives rise to perhaps too many edges (which degrades<br>\nperformance for many algorithms), whereas a low edge probability might result in<br>\na disconnected graph. We prove a theorem about a threshold probability such that<br>\na higher edge probability will asymptotically almost surely produce a random<br>\ngraph with the desired subgraph.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Random_Graph_Subgraph_Threshold.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Random_Graph_Subgraph_Threshold.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
