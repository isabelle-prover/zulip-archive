All three problems were proved to be impossible in the 19th century. The<br>\nfollowing document presents the proof of the impossibility of solving the latter<br>\ntwo problems using Isabelle/HOL, following a proof by Carrega. The proof uses<br>\nelementary methods: no Galois theory or field<br>\nextensions. The set of points constructible using a compass and straightedge is<br>\ndefined inductively. Radical expressions, which involve only square roots and<br>\narithmetic of rational numbers, are defined, and we find that all constructive<br>\npoints have radical coordinates. Finally, doubling the cube and trisecting<br>\ncertain angles requires solving certain cubic equations that can be proved to<br>\nhave no rational roots. The Isabelle proofs require a great many detailed<br>\ncalculations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Impossible_Geometry.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Impossible_Geometry.shtml</a></p>\n<p>If you would like to hear Larry talk about it, do come to the Isabelle workshop<br>\ncoming weekend: <a href=\"http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/Isabelle2012/\">http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/Isabelle2012/</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nTobias</p>",
