Paulson</p>\n<p>This development proves upper and lower bounds for several familiar real-valued<br>\nfunctions. For sin, cos, exp and sqrt, it defines and verifies infinite families<br>\nof upper and lower bounds, mostly based on Taylor series expansions. For arctan,<br>\nln and exp, it verifies a finite collection of upper and lower bounds,<br>\noriginally obtained from the functions' continued fraction expansions using the<br>\ncomputer algebra system Maple. A common theme in these proofs is to take the<br>\ndifference between a function and its approximation, which should be zero at one<br>\npoint, and then consider the sign of the derivative. The immediate purpose of<br>\nthis development is to verify axioms used by MetiTarski, an automatic theorem<br>\nprover for real-valued special functions. Crucial to MetiTarski's operation is<br>\nthe provision of upper and lower bounds for each function of interest.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Special_Function_Bounds.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Special_Function_Bounds.shtml</a></p>",
