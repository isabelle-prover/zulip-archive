Regular expressions and their meaning are defined. An<br>\nexecutable equivalence checker for regular expressions is verified; it<br>\ndoes not need automata but works directly on regular expressions.</p>\n<p>By mapping regular expressions to binary relations, an automatic and<br>\ncomplete proof method for (in)equalities of binary relations over union,<br>\nconcatenation and (reflexive) transitive closure is obtained.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/devel-entries/Regular-Sets.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/devel-entries/Regular-Sets.shtml</a></p>",
