Relation algebras provide equational axioms for a large fragment <br>\nof the calculus of binary relations. Although relations are standard tools in <br>\nmany areas of mathematics and computing, researchers usually fall back to <br>\npoint-wise reasoning when it comes to arguments about paths in a graph. We <br>\npresent a purely algebraic way to specify different kinds of paths in Kleene <br>\nrelation algebras, which are relation algebras equipped with an operation for <br>\nreflexive transitive closure. We study the relationship between paths with a <br>\ndesignated root vertex and paths without such a vertex. Since we stay in <br>\nfirst-order logic this development helps with mechanising proofs. To demonstrate <br>\nthe applicability of the algebraic framework we verify the correctness of three <br>\nbasic graph algorithms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Relational_Paths.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Relational_Paths.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/XTrtpgDEncv7p6ienmhVMsCD/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
