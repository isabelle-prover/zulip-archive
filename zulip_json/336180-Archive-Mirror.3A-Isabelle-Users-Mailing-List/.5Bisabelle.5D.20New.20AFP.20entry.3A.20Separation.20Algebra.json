These theories are also the basis of the ITP 2012 rough diamond<br>\n\"Mechanised Separation Algebra\" by the authors.</p>\n<p>The aim of this work is to support and significantly reduce the effort for<br>\nfuture separation logic developments in Isabelle/HOL by factoring out the part<br>\nof separation logic that can be treated abstractly once and for all. This<br>\nincludes developing typical default rule sets for reasoning as well as automated<br>\ntactic support for separation logic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Separation_Algebra.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Separation_Algebra.shtml</a></p>",
