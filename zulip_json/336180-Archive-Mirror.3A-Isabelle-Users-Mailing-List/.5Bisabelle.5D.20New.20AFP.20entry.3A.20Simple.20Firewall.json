The firewall can accept or drop a <br>\npacket and can match on interfaces, IP addresses, protocol, and ports. It was <br>\ndesigned to feature nice mathematical properties: The type of match expressions <br>\nwas carefully crafted such that the conjunction of two match expressions is only <br>\none match expression. This model is too simplistic to mirror all aspects of the <br>\nreal world. In the upcoming entry \"Iptables Semantics\", we will translate the <br>\nLinux firewall iptables to this model. For a fixed service (e.g. ssh, http), we <br>\nprovide an algorithm to compute an overview of the firewall's filtering <br>\nbehavior. The algorithm computes minimal service matrices, i.e. graphs which <br>\npartition the complete IPv4 and IPv6 address space and visualize the allowed <br>\naccesses between partitions. For a detailed description, see Verified iptables <br>\nFirewall Analysis, IFIP Networking 2016.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Simple_Firewall.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Simple_Firewall.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/rFGrp84BjfYXqVO9JtbvrEDx/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
