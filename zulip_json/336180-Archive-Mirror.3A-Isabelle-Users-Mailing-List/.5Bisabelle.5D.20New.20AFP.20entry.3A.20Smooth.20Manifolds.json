Concepts covered include partition of unity, tangent and<br>\ncotangent spaces, and the fundamental theorem of path integrals. We also<br>\nexamine some concrete manifolds such as spheres and projective spaces.<br>\nThe formalization makes extensive use of the analysis and linear algebra<br>\nlibraries in Isabelle/HOL, in particular its “types-to-sets” mechanism.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Smooth_Manifolds.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Smooth_Manifolds.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
