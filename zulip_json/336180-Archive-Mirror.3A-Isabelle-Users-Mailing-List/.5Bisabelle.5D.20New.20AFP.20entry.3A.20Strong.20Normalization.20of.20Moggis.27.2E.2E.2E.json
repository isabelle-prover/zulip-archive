In this context, Moggi's computational metalanguage serves as an<br>\ninteresting case study. It features monadic types and a commuting<br>\nconversion rule that rearranges the binding structure. Lindley and Stark<br>\nhave given an elegant proof of strong normalization for this calculus.<br>\nThe key construction in their proof is a notion of relational<br>\nTT-lifting, using stacks of elimination contexts to obtain a Girard-Tait<br>\nstyle logical relation. I give a formalization of their proof in<br>\nIsabelle/HOL-Nominal with a particular emphasis on the treatment of<br>\nbound variables.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Lam-ml-Normalization.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Lam-ml-Normalization.shtml</a></p>",
