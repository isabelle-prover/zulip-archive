This work contains a proof of Sturm's Theorem and code for<br>\nconstructing Sturm sequences efficiently. It also provides the “sturm” proof<br>\nmethod, which can decide certain statements about the roots of real polynomials,<br>\nsuch as “the polynomial P has exactly n roots in the interval I” or “P(x) &gt; Q(x)<br>\nfor all x in R”.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Sturm_Sequences.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Sturm_Sequences.shtml</a></p>",
