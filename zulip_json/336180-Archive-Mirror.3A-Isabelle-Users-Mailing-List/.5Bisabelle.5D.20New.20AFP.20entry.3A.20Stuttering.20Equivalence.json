Stuttering equivalence is a fundamental concept in the<br>\ntheory of concurrent and distributed systems. Notably, Lamport argues that<br>\nrefinement notions for such systems should be insensitive to finite stuttering.<br>\nPeled and Wilke show that all LTL (linear-time temporal logic) properties that<br>\nare insensitive to stuttering equivalence can be expressed without the next-time<br>\noperator. Stuttering equivalence is also important for certain verification<br>\ntechniques such as partial-order reduction for model checking.</p>\n<p>We formalize stuttering equivalence in Isabelle/HOL. Our development relies on<br>\nthe notion of a stuttering sampling function that identifies blocks of identical<br>\nsequence elements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Stuttering_Equivalence.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Stuttering_Equivalence.shtml</a></p>\n<p>[An eminently reusable contribution, thanks Stephan.]</p>",
