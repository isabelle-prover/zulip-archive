Taylor models were introduced as a tool to <br>\nmitigate the dependency problem of interval arithmetic. Our implementation <br>\nautomatically computes Taylor models for the class of elementary functions, <br>\nexpressed by composition of arithmetic operations and basic functions like exp, <br>\nsin, or square root.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Taylor_Models.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Taylor_Models.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/_VDI61drE6x9lJU1az0v_eZv/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
