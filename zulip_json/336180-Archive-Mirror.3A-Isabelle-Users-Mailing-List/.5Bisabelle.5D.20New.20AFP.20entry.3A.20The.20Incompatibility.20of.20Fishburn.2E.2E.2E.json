It was derived from a proof of <br>\nBrandt et al., which relies on an unverified translation of a fixed finite <br>\ninstance of the original problem to SAT. This Isabelle proof contains a <br>\nmachine-checked version of both the statement for exactly three agents and <br>\nalternatives and the lifting to the general case.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Fishburn_Impossibility.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Fishburn_Impossibility.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/OkiOGuUJO-yJErmz8p7PkVj0/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
