J. M. Makarios</p>\n<p>Tarski's axioms of plane geomtry are formalized and, using the standard real<br>\nCartesian model, shown to be consistent. A substantial theory of the projective<br>\nplane is developed. Building on this theory, the Klein-Beltrami model of the<br>\nhyperbolic plane is defined and shown to satisfy all of Tarski's axioms except<br>\nhis Euclidean axiom; thus Tarski's Euclidean axiom is shown to be independent of<br>\nhis other axioms of plane geometry.</p>\n<p>An earlier version of this work was the subject of the author's MSc thesis,<br>\nwhich contains natural-language explanations of some of the more interesting proofs.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
