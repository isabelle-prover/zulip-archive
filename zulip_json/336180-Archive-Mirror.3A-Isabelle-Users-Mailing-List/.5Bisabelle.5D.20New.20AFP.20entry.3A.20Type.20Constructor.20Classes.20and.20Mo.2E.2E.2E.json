This work is described<br>\nin detail in the ICFP 2012 paper “Formal Verification of Monad<br>\nTransformers” by the author. The formalization is a revised and<br>\nupdated version of earlier joint work with Matthews and White.</p>\n<p>Based on the hierarchy of type classes in Haskell, we define classes<br>\nfor functors, monads, monad-plus, etc. Each one includes all the<br>\nstandard laws as axioms. We also provide a new user command,<br>\ntycondef, for defining new type constructors in HOLCF. Using tycondef,<br>\nwe instantiate the type class hierarchy with various monads and monad<br>\ntransformers.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>",
