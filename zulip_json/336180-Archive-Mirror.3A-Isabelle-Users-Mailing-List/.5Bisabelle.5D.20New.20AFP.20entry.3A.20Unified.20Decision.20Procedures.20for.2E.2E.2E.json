Five recently published formalizations of such<br>\ndecision procedures (three based on derivatives, two on marked regular<br>\nexpressions) can be obtained as instances of the framework. We discover that<br>\nthe two approaches based on marked regular expressions, which were previously<br>\nthought to be the same, are different, and one seems to produce uniformly<br>\nsmaller automata.  The common framework makes it possible to compare the<br>\nperformance of the different decision procedures in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Regex_Equivalence.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Regex_Equivalence.shtml</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/regex_equiv.pdf\">http://www.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/regex_equiv.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nTobias and Dmitriy</p>",
