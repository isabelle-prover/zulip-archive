Caminati, Manfred Kerber, Christoph Lange, Colin Rowat</p>\n<p>A VCG auction (named after their inventors Vickrey, Clarke, and<br>\nGroves) is a generalization of the single-good, second price Vickrey<br>\nauction to the case of a combinatorial auction (multiple goods, from<br>\nwhich any participant can bid on each possible combination). We<br>\nformalize in this entry VCG auctions, including tie-breaking and prove<br>\nthat the functions for the allocation and the price determination are<br>\nwell-defined. Furthermore we show that the allocation function<br>\nallocates goods only to participants, only goods in the auction are<br>\nallocated, and no good is allocated twice. We also show that the price<br>\nfunction is non-negative. These properties also hold for the<br>\nautomatically extracted Scala code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Vickrey_Clarke_Groves.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Vickrey_Clarke_Groves.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Thanks to the authors, and stay tuned, because there is more where this first <br>\nnugget of auction theory came from!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/urXPkUiy6yzAK7NHzKq8hALI/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
