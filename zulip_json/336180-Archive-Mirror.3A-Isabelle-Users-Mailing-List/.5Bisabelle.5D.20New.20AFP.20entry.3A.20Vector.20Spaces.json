It includes basic definitions: linear combinations,<br>\nspan, linear independence; linear transformations; interpretation of function<br>\nspaces as vector spaces; the direct sum of vector spaces, sum of subspaces; the<br>\nreplacement theorem; existence of bases in finite-dimensional; vector spaces,<br>\ndefinition of dimension; the rank-nullity theorem. Some concepts are actually<br>\ndefined and proved for modules as they also apply there. Infinite-dimensional<br>\nvector spaces are supported, but dimension is only supported for<br>\nfinite-dimensional vector spaces. The proofs are standard; the proofs of the<br>\nreplacement theorem and rank-nullity theorem roughly follow the presentation in<br>\nLinear Algebra by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence. The rank-nullity theorem<br>\ngeneralises the existing development in the Archive of Formal Proof (originally<br>\nusing type classes, now using a mix of type classes and locales).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/VectorSpace.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/VectorSpace.shtml</a></p>",
