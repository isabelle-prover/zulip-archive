Realizing this promise, however, involves<br>\nquite subtle algorithmic mechanisms, and requires precise statements<br>\nabout the kinds and numbers of faults that an algorithm tolerates (such<br>\nas process crashes, communication faults or corrupted values).  The<br>\nlandmark theorem due to Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson shows that it is<br>\nimpossible to achieve Consensus among N asynchronously communicating<br>\nnodes in the presence of even a single permanent failure. Existing<br>\nsolutions must rely on assumptions of \"partial synchrony\".</p>\n<p>Indeed, there have been numerous misunderstandings on what exactly a given<br>\nalgorithm is supposed to realize in what kinds of environments. Moreover, the<br>\nabundance of subtly different computational models complicates comparisons<br>\nbetween different algorithms. Charron-Bost and Schiper introduced the Heard-Of<br>\nmodel for representing algorithms and failure assumptions in a uniform<br>\nframework, simplifying comparisons between algorithms.</p>\n<p>In this contribution, we represent the Heard-Of model in Isabelle/HOL. We define<br>\ntwo semantics of runs of algorithms with different unit of atomicity and relate<br>\nthese through a reduction theorem that allows us to verify algorithms in the<br>\ncoarse-grained semantics (where proofs are easier) and infer their correctness<br>\nfor the fine-grained one (which corresponds to actual executions). We<br>\ninstantiate the framework by verifying six Consensus algorithms that differ in<br>\nthe underlying algorithmic mechanisms and the kinds of faults they tolerate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Heard_Of.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Heard_Of.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Thanks to the authors, and enjoy!</p>",
