To this<br>\nend, we formalized the standard two-phase slicer from Horwitz, Reps and<br>\nBinkley (see their TOPLAS 12(1) 1990 paper) together with summary edges<br>\nas presented by Reps et al. (see FSE 1994). The framework is again<br>\nmodular in the programming language by using an abstract CFG, defined<br>\nvia structural and well-formedness properties. Using a weak simulation<br>\nbetween the original and sliced graph, we were able to prove the<br>\ncorrectness of static interprocedural slicing. We also instantiate our<br>\nframework with a simple While language with procedures. This shows that<br>\nthe chosen abstractions are indeed valid.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nTobias</p>",
