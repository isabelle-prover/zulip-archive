Our two main results are instantiations for<br>\nthe product type and the list type, which (almost) directly follow from our<br>\nproofs of (1) Dickson's Lemma and (2) Higman's Lemma. More concretely:</p>\n<p>If the sets A and B are wqo then their Cartesian product is wqo.<br>\n    If the set A is wqo then the set of its finite subsets is wqo.</p>\n<p>The research was funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): J3202.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/devel-entries/Well_Quasi_Orders.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/devel-entries/Well_Quasi_Orders.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Note that this entry is only available in the development version (until the<br>\nrelease).</p>",
