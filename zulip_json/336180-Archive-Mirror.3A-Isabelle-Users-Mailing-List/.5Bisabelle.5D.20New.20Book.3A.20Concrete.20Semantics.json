Concrete Semantics introduces semantics of<br>\nprogramming languages through the medium of a proof assistant.<br>\nIt consists of two parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Part I is a self-contained introduction to the proof assistant Isabelle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Part II is an introduction to semantics and its applications and<br>\n  is based on a simple imperative programming language. It covers<br>\n  the following topics: operational semantics, compiler correctness,<br>\n  (security) type systems, program analyses, denotational semantics,<br>\n  Hoare logic and abstract interpretation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the material in Part II is formalized in Isabelle,<br>\nyet most of it can also be read independently of Part I.</p>\n<p>The book has been classroom-tested extensively and contains<br>\n115 exercises that provide hands-on experience with Isabelle.<br>\nSlides and exercise templates are available online.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nTobias &amp; Gerwin</p>",
