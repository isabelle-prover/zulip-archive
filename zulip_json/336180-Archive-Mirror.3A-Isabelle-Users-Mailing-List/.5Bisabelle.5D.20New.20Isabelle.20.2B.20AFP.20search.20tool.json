Those are very good questions.</p>\n<p>I'll answer them in detail:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is there an Isar command associated with the tool (i.e. something <br>\nsimilar to find_theorems)?<br>\nNo, currently not.<br>\nDoes there exist a public Isabelle/ML interface associated with the <br>\ntool, i.e. something that would enable the users of the Isabelle/ML <br>\ninfrastructure to (easily) define queries programmatically when <br>\nworking on the development of other tools?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There exists a scala interface for user-defined queries (see the <br>\nrepository for details: <a href=\"https://github.com/qaware/isabelle-afp-search\">https://github.com/qaware/isabelle-afp-search</a>), <br>\nthough you'd have to build the search index first (or download a <br>\npre-build one).</p>\n<p>Also, there is a REST interface deployed to which you can simply send <br>\nqueries programatically (see API doc under <br>\n<a href=\"http://search.isabelle.in.tum.de/docs\">search.isabelle.in.tum.de/docs</a>), without building an index yourself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the answers to 1 and/or 2 are negative, are there any plans to <br>\nprovide an Isabelle/ML interface and/or an Isar command for this tool?<br>\nThe tool has been developed with integration into Isabelle in mind, but <br>\nright now integrating it into isabelle is not in my scope.<br>\nIs the code for the tool going to be added to the AFP at some point in <br>\nthe future?<br>\nNot quite sure if I understand what you mean with 'Added to the AFP' - A <br>\nlink will probabily added <a href=\"http://isa-afp.org\">isa-afp.org</a> site, if that's what you mean.<br>\nAlso, I have some critical feedback about the survey (not the tool). <br>\nThe questions \"How intuitive was the user interface?\" and \"What is the <br>\nlikelihood you will use the tool in the future?\" have the comments <br>\n\"very intuitive\" and \"very likely\" near score \"1\". However, \"How <br>\nuseful was the tool for you?\" does not have any comments around the <br>\nscores. Should the users of the survey assume that \"1\" is \"very <br>\nuseful\" and \"5\" is \"not useful at all\"? Personally, I find this <br>\nslightly counter-intuitive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you for the heads-up, that is of course a bug. I re-added the <br>\nscale there.</p>\n<p>If you have further questions, please let me know!</p>",
