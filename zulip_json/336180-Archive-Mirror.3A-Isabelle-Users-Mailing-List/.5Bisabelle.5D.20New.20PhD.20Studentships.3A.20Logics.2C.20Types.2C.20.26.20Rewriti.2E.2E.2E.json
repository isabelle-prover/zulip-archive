(2) Additional possible research<br>\n    topics have been included.</p>\n<p>Several new Ph.D. student positions are available in areas involving<br>\n    research into the theories of logics, types, and rewriting and their<br>\n    applications in reasoning about computer systems and mathematics.  The<br>\n    positions are at Heriot-Watt University[1] in the ULTRA (Useful<br>\n    Logics, Types, Rewriting, and their Automation) group[2] in the<br>\n    Computer Science Department[3] in the School of Mathematical and<br>\n    Computer Sciences[4] at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh[5], the<br>\n    capital of Scotland[6].  The Ph.D. supervisors will be either Fairouz<br>\n    Kamareddine[7] and/or Joe Wells[8].</p>\n<p>Available research topics include work on any of the following:</p>\n<p>* The Poly*[9] polymorphic retargetable type system for process and<br>\n        mobility calculi, aimed at the goal of supporting modular reasoning<br>\n        and compositional analysis for systems involving mobility and<br>\n        concurrency (such systems can include combinations of hardware,<br>\n        software, people, etc.).</p>\n<p>* The MathLang[10] framework for computerizing mathematical text.<br>\n        MathLang tries to keep the computerization as close as possible to<br>\n        the mathematician's text while at the same time providing a formal<br>\n        structure supporting mathematical software systems (e.g., computer<br>\n        algebra systems, theorem provers, etc.).  Possible MathLang work<br>\n        includes:</p>\n<p>+ Building libraries of computerized books of mathematics.<br>\n           + Developing bridges between MathLang and proof checkers (e.g.,<br>\n             Coq, Mizar, Isabelle, OMEGA, etc.).</p>\n<p>* The idea of Expansion[11] as a fundamental organizing principle for<br>\n        obtaining flexible and compositional polymorphic type inference for<br>\n        computer software.</p>\n<p>* The use of Type Error Slicing[12] as a superior user interface for<br>\n        explaining type errors to users of new programming languages with<br>\n        advanced (and complicated!) type systems.</p>\n<p>* Any other reasonable idea which builds on work we have already<br>\n        started, including both theory and implementation.  In general, we<br>\n        are interested in the design and implementation of useful and<br>\n        elegant type systems and logics which can reason about or extend<br>\n        existing programming languages and theorem provers.</p>\n<p>It will be helpful to have interests (or possibly even competence) in 1<br>\n    or more of the following background knowledge areas:</p>\n<p>* Formal calculi for reasoning about the meaning of systems<br>\n        (including computer programs) such as the lambda calculus, the pi<br>\n        calculus, and the numerous other calculi they have inspired that<br>\n        deal with aspects of concurrency, mobility, modules, components,<br>\n        linking &amp; loading, resource usage, staged compilation, classes &amp;<br>\n        objects, etc.</p>\n<p>* Methods for analyzing specific systems (e.g., specific computer<br>\n        programs) represented by individual terms of such formal calculi.</p>\n<p>* Formal calculi for representing mathematical texts, including those<br>\n        aspects related to how actual practicing mathematicians (i.e., not<br>\n        mathematical logicians) construct and present mathematics.</p>\n<p>* Type systems for the kinds of formal calculi mentioned above,<br>\n        especially those with features similar to intersection, union,<br>\n        dependent, and singleton types.</p>\n<p>* Rewriting theories, especially those with higher-order features,<br>\n        such as the lambda calculus, higher-order rewriting (HOR), systems<br>\n        with explicit substitutions, higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS),<br>\n        combinators, etc.</p>\n<p>* Constraint solving and unification.<br>\n      * Theorem provers and mathematical reasoning tools.<br>\n      * Programming languages especially suitable for use for any of the<br>\n        above.</p>\n<p>The usual duration of Ph.D. studentships in the UK is 3 years.  The<br>\n    positions are available immediately.</p>\n<p>The Ph.D. students will probably collaborate on 1 or more of the<br>\n    following activities.  The specific activities will be matched to their<br>\n    strengths.</p>\n<p>* Designing languages/calculi for representing various aspects of<br>\n        such things as computer programs, concurrent systems, mathematical<br>\n        texts, etc.</p>\n<p>* Developing theories for reasoning about such a calculus as a whole<br>\n        as well as individual terms written in the calculus.</p>\n<p>* Developing new type systems for such calculi with useful<br>\n        properties.</p>\n<p>* Developing analysis algorithms for the new type systems.<br>\n      * Proving various properties of the above items.<br>\n      * Making software systems incorporating the new calculi, theories,<br>\n        type systems, and algorithms.</p>\n<p>* Publishing scientific reports on the work done.</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>1.  <a href=\"http://www.hw.ac.uk/\">http://www.hw.ac.uk/</a><br>\n    2.  <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/ultra/\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/ultra/</a><br>\n    3.  <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/cs/\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/cs/</a><br>\n    4.  <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/</a><br>\n    5.  <a href=\"http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/tour/edintour.html\">http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/tour/edintour.html</a><br>\n    6.  <a href=\"http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/scotland.html\">http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/scotland.html</a><br>\n    7.  <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fairouz/\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fairouz/</a><br>\n    8.  <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/</a><br>\n    9.  <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/DART/software/PolyStar/\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/DART/software/PolyStar/</a><br>\n   10.  <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fairouz/talks/talks2005/mathlang-general-talk.pdf\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fairouz/talks/talks2005/mathlang-general-talk.pdf</a><br>\n   11.  <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/papers/#Car+Wel:ITRS-2004\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/papers/#Car+Wel:ITRS-2004</a><br>\n   12.  <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/ultra/compositional-analysis/type-error-slicing/\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/ultra/compositional-analysis/type-error-slicing/</a></p>\n<p>Contact Information</p>\n<p>Inquiries can be directed to Fairouz Kamareddine at:</p>\n<p>web:    <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fairouz/\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fairouz/</a><br>\n    e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:fairouz@macs.hw.ac.uk\">fairouz@macs.hw.ac.uk</a><br>\n    fax:    +44 131 451 8179</p>\n<p>Inquiries can be directed to Joe Wells at:</p>\n<p>web:    <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/</a><br>\n    e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:jbw@macs.hw.ac.uk\">jbw@macs.hw.ac.uk</a><br>\n    fax:    +44 131 451 8179</p>\n<p>Applying for the Positions</p>\n<p>Please contact Fairouz Kamareddine and Joe Wells for full details on<br>\n    how to apply.  We will want to see your curriculum vitae, as well as 2<br>\n    (or even 3 if possible) recommendation letters (preferably written by<br>\n    people familiar with your academic and research abilities, but a letter<br>\n    from an industry source is better than no letter at all).  We will<br>\n    expect recommendation letters to be sent directly by their authors and<br>\n    will need contact details for the letter authors.  You should probably<br>\n    already have a master's degree or equivalent experience.  It can be<br>\n    helpful to write a brief statement about why your research interests<br>\n    are a good match for the ULTRA group.  If you already have research<br>\n    publications (this is not required), it can be helpful to send 1 (or<br>\n    even 2) of them.  There will also be official Heriot-Watt application<br>\n    forms to fill out.  Please convert Microsoft Word documents to a public,<br>\n    standard, and non-proprietary format.  PDF is good, plain text is good,<br>\n    LaTeX is okay (if using only standard packages), HTML is okay (if not<br>\n    generated by Microsoft Word), PostScript is sometimes okay, Open<br>\n    Document format is undesirable, Microsoft Word format will not be<br>\n    accepted.</p>\n<p>For your information, it is helpful if writers of recommendation<br>\n    letters provide details of:</p>\n<p>* the capacity in which they know the candidate,<br>\n      * the candidate's skills, abilities and performance in relation to<br>\n        the post applied for,</p>\n<p>* the candidate's record including details of the candidate's role(s)<br>\n        and service dates,</p>\n<p>* their view of the candidate's suitability for the post as a whole,<br>\n        in light of the attached details and their knowledge of the<br>\n        candidate's experience and abilities,</p>\n<p>* any further relevant information which would assist us in choosing<br>\n        the right candidate.</p>",
