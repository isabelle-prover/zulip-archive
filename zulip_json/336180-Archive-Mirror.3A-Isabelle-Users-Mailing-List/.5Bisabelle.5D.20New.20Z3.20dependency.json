This looks indeed like a new requirement, at least on Linux. Now that Z3 4.3.2 has officially been released, I will need to produce new packages anyway, and I'll look more closely into the issue (and/or simply update the NEWS and the requirements listed on the web site).</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",

I think this library was not needed in previous Isabelle releases.</p>\n<p>Maintainers might want to state this new requirement in NEWS file.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nMarco</p>",
