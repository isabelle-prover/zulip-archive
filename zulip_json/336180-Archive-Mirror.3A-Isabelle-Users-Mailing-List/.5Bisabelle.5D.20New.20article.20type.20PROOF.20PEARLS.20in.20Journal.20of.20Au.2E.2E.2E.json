Application areas include <br>\nthe full range from pure mathematics and logic to software and hardware <br>\nverification. Proof pearls should be short communications that focus on <br>\na few central ideas rather than extended research reports. Contributions <br>\nmay include:</p>\n<p>o a short, elegant proof of a self-standing result</p>\n<p>o a novel way of defining a fundamental concept</p>\n<p>o a notable approach to proving a key lemma in a larger development</p>\n<p>o a snippet of verified code, carefully engineered to balance efficiency <br>\nwith ease of verification</p>\n<p>o a clever or impressive application of automated tools in a particular <br>\ndomain</p>\n<p><em>Proof Pearls</em> adapt Jon Bentley's notion of a \"programming pearl\" to <br>\nthe verification paradigm. Proof pearls should thus encapsulate <br>\nfundamental insights that are adaptable and reusable, while being <br>\nelegant and satisfying in their own right. Typical examples could be a <br>\nverification of Huffman's algorithm, a perspicuous proof of the <br>\nfundamental theorem of algebra, or a novel axiomatization of a <br>\nparticular algebraic system that was discovered using automated methods.</p>\n<p>Submissions will undergo the usual refereeing process, and will be <br>\nevaluated according to expository and theoretical merit. Systems and <br>\nformalizations should be made available online.</p>",
