It is <br>\ngreedy and minimizes the number of operator applications. We formalize the <br>\nalgorithm and verify its functional correctness. We extend the algorithm with <br>\nadditional operations and provide an alternative interface to the slide <br>\noperation that does not require the entire input sequence.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Sliding_Window_Algorithm.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Sliding_Window_Algorithm.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/e4p8mSY5bb8-R08V9EFE0OAl/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
