The first new entry in 2019 is:</p>\n<p>Formalization of Concurrent Revisions<br>\n  by Roy Overbeek</p>\n<p>Concurrent revisions is a concurrency control model developed by<br>\nMicrosoft Research. It has many interesting properties that<br>\ndistinguish it from other well-known models such as transactional<br>\nmemory. One of these properties is determinacy:<br>\nprograms written within the model always produce the same outcome,<br>\nindependent of scheduling activity. The concurrent revisions model has<br>\nan operational semantics, with an informal proof of determinacy. This<br>\ndocument contains an Isabelle/HOL formalization of this semantics and<br>\nthe proof of determinacy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Concurrent_Revisions.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Concurrent_Revisions.html</a></p>\n<p>Happy New Year,<br>\nRené</p>",
