This could make autonomous vehicle liable for safe-distance-related<br>\naccidents because there is no clear definition of how large a safe distance is.<br>\nWe provide a formally proven prescriptive definition of a safe distance, and<br>\ncheckers which can decide whether an autonomous vehicle is obeying the safe<br>\ndistance rule. Not only does our work apply to the domain of law, but it also<br>\nserves as a specification for autonomous vehicle manufacturers and for online<br>\nverification of path planners.</p>\n<p>For further information have a look at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Safe_Distance.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Safe_Distance.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
