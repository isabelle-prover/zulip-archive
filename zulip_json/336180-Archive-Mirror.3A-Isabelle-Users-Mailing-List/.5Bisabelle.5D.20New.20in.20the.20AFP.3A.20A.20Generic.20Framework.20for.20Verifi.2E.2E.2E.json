It leverages Isabelle/HOL’s locales to abstract over concrete languages and transformations. It states common definitions for language semantics, program behaviours, forward and backward simulations, and compilers. We provide generic operations, such as simulation and compiler composition, and prove general (partial) correctness theorems, resulting in reusable proof components.</p>\n<p>Available at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/VeriComp.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/VeriComp.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
