I develop a verified compilation toolchain from executable specifications in Isabelle/HOL to CakeML abstract syntax trees. This improves over the state-of-the-art in Isabelle by providing a trustworthy procedure for code generation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This looks to be a major importance and I hope we will get some instructions on how to use it!</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
