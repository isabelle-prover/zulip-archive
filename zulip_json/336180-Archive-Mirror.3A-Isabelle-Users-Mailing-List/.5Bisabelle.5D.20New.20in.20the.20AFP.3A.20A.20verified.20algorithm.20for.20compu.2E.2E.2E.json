We also provide a formal proof on some results about the generality of<br>\nthis algorithm as well as the uniqueness of the Smith normal form. Since<br>\nIsabelle/HOL does not feature dependent types, the development is carried out<br>\nswitching conveniently between two different existing libraries: the Hermite<br>\nnormal form (based on HOL Analysis) and the Jordan normal form AFP entries. This<br>\npermits to reuse results from both developments and it is done by means of the<br>\nlifting and transfer package together with the use of local type definitions.</p>\n<p>More details are available at: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Smith_Normal_Form.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Smith_Normal_Form.html</a></p>",
