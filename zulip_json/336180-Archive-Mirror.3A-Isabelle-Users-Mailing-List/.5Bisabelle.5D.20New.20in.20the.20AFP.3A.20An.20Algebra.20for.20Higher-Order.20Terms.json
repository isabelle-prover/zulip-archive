The need arose from the work on a verified compiler from Isabelle to CakeML. Terms can be thought of as consisting of a generic (free variables, constants, ap- plication) and a specific part. As example applications, this entry provides instantiations for de-Bruijn terms, terms with named variables, and Blanchette’s λ-free higher-order terms. Furthermore, I implement translation functions between de-Bruijn terms and named terms and prove their correctness.\"</p>\n<p>Looks like this one will go far.
