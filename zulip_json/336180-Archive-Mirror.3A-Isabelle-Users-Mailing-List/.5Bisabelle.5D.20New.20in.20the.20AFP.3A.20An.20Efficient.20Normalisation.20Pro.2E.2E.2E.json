Some years<br>\nlater, Chang, Manna, and Pnueli built on this result to derive a similar<br>\nnormal form for LTL. Both normalisation procedures have a non-elementary<br>\nworst-case blow-up, and follow an involved path from formulas to<br>\ncounter-free automata to star-free regular expressions and back to<br>\nformulas. We improve on both points. We present an executable<br>\nformalisation of a direct and purely syntactic normalisation procedure<br>\nfor LTL yielding a normal form, comparable to the one by Chang, Manna,<br>\nand Pnueli, that has only a single exponential blow-up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/LTL_Normal_Form.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/LTL_Normal_Form.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
