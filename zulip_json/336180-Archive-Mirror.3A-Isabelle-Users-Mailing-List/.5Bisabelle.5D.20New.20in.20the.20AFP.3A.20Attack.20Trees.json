Using the expressiveness of Higher Order Logic in Isabelle, we develop a generic theory of Attack Trees with a state-based semantics based on Kripke structures and CTL. The resulting framework allows mechanically supported logic analysis of the meta-theory of the proof calculus of Attack Trees and at the same time the developed proof theory enables application to case studies. A central correctness and completeness result proved in Isabelle establishes a connection between the notion of Attack Tree validity and CTL. The application is illustrated on the example of a healthcare IoT system and GDPR compliance verification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You’ll find it at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Attack_Trees.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Attack_Trees.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
