The proof is ported from John Harrison's formalisation in HOL Light. It proceeds by first showing that the property is true for all n greater than or equal to 600 and then showing that it also holds for all n below 600 by case distinction.”</p>\n<p>It’s an important result and the proof involves reflection along with a specific list of prime numbers.
