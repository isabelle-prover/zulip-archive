Fundamental<br>\nobjects that are investigated are the complex plane extended by a single<br>\ninfinite point, its objects (points, lines and circles), and groups of<br>\ntransformations that act on them (e.g., inversions and Möbius<br>\ntransformations). Most objects are defined algebraically, but<br>\ncorrespondence with classical geometric definitions is shown.</p>\n<p>Poincaré Disc Model<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Poincare_Disc.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Poincare_Disc.html</a></p>\n<p>by Danijela Simić, Filip Marić, and Pierre Boutry</p>\n<p>We describe formalization of the Poincaré disc model of hyperbolic<br>\ngeometry within the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant. The model is defined<br>\nwithin the extended complex plane (one dimensional complex projectives<br>\nspace ℂP1), formalized in the AFP entry “Complex geometry”. Points,<br>\nlines, congruence of pairs of points, betweenness of triples of points,<br>\ncircles, and isometries are defined within the model. It is shown that<br>\nthe model satisfies all Tarski's axioms except the Euclid's axiom. It is<br>\nshown that it satisfies its negation and the limiting parallels axiom<br>\n(which proves it to be a model of hyperbolic geometry).</p>\n<p>Enjoy,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
