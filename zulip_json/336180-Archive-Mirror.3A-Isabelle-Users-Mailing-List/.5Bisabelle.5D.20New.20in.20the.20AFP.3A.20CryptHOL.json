It shallowly embeds a probabilistic functional<br>\nprogramming language in higher order logic. The language features <br>\nmonadic sequencing, recursion, random sampling, failures and failure<br>\nhandling, and black-box access to oracles. Oracles are probabilistic<br>\nfunctions which maintain hidden state between different invocations. <br>\nAll operators are defined in the new semantic domain of<br>\ngenerative probabilistic values, a codatatype. We derive proof rules for<br>\nthe operators and establish a connection with the theory of relational<br>\nparametricity. Thus, the resuting proofs are trustworthy and<br>\ncomprehensible, and the framework is extensible and widely applicable.  </p>\n<p>The framework is used in the accompanying AFP entry \"Game-based<br>\nCryptography in HOL\". There, we show-case our framework by formalizing<br>\ndifferent game-based proofs from the literature. This formalisation<br>\ncontinues the work described in the author's ESOP 2016 paper.</p>\n<p>Enjoy 4/5</p>",
