In addition to the syntax and<br>\nsemantics, it formalizes a uniform substitution calculus for dGL.<br>\nChurch's uniform substitutions substitute a term or formula for a<br>\nfunction or predicate symbol everywhere. The uniform substitutions for<br>\ndGL also substitute hybrid games for a game symbol everywhere. We prove<br>\nsoundness of one-pass uniform substitutions and the axioms of<br>\ndifferential game logic with respect to their denotational semantics.<br>\nOne-pass uniform substitutions are faster by postponing<br>\nsoundness-critical admissibility checks with a linear pass homomorphic<br>\napplication and regain soundness by a variable condition at the<br>\nreplacements. The formalization is based on prior non-mechanized<br>\nsoundness proofs for dGL.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Differential_Game_Logic.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Differential_Game_Logic.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
