The main topics that are addressed are <br>\nproperties of the distribution of prime numbers that can be shown in an elementary <br>\nway (i.e. without the Prime Number Theorem), the various equivalent forms of the PNT <br>\n(which imply each other in elementary ways), and consequences that follow from the PNT<br>\nin elementary ways. The latter include bounds for the number of distinct prime factors<br>\nof n, the divisor function d(n), Euler's totient function phi(n), and lcm(1,...,n).</p>\n<p>For more details, see <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Prime_Distribution_Elementary.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Prime_Distribution_Elementary.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
