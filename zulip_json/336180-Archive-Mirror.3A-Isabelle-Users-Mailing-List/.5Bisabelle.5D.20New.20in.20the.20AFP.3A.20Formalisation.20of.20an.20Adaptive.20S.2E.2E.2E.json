The algorithm is formalised using<br>\nmutually recursive functions, for which it is proven that the generated test<br>\nsuite is sufficient to test for reduction against finite state machines of a<br>\ncertain fault domain. Additionally, the algorithm is specified in a simple<br>\nWHILE-language and its correctness is shown using Hoare-logic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Adaptive_State_Counting.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Adaptive_State_Counting.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
