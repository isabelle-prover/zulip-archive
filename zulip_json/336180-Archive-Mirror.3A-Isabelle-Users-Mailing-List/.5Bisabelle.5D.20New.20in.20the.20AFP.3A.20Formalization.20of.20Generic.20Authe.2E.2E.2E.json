The server is required to produce an<br>\nefficiently checkable and cryptographically secure proof that it carried out<br>\nprecisely the requested computation. Miller et al. introduced λ• (pronounced<br>\nlambda auth)—a functional programming language with a built-in primitive<br>\nauthentication construct, which supports a wide range of user-specified<br>\nauthenticated data structures while guaranteeing certain correctness and<br>\nsecurity properties for all well-typed programs. We formalize λ• and prove its<br>\ncorrectness and security properties. With Isabelle's help, we uncover and repair<br>\nseveral mistakes in the informal proofs and lemma statements. Our findings are<br>\nsummarized in a paper draft.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/LambdaAuth.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/LambdaAuth.html</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
