The verified monitor implements a simplified variant of the<br>\nalgorithm used in the efficient MonPoly monitoring tool. The formalization is<br>\npresented in a forthcoming RV 2019 paper, which also compares the output of the<br>\nverified monitor to that of other monitoring tools on randomly generated inputs.<br>\nThis case study revealed several errors in the optimized but unverified tools.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MFOTL_Monitor.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MFOTL_Monitor.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
