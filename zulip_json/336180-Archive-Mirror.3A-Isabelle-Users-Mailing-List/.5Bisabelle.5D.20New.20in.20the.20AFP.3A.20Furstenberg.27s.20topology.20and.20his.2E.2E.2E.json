He defines a topology on the integers based on arithmetic progressions (or, equivalently, residue classes). Using some fairly obvious properties of this topology, the infinitude of primes is then easily obtained.<br>\nApart from this, this topology is also fairly `nice' in general: it is second countable, metrizable, and perfect. All of these (well-known) facts are formally proven, including an explicit metric for the topology given by Zulfeqarr.</p>\n<p>More details at: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Furstenberg_Topology.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Furstenberg_Topology.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy and stay healthy,<br>\nRené</p>",
