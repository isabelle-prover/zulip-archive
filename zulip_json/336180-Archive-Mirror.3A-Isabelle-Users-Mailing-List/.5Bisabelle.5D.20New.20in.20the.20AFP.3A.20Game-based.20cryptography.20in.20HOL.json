Reza Sefidgar, and Bhargav Bhatt</p>\n<p>In this AFP entry, we show how to specify game-based cryptographic<br>\nsecurity notions and formally prove secure several cryptographic<br>\nconstructions from the literature using the CryptHOL framework. Among<br>\nothers, we formalise the notions of a random oracle, a pseudo-random<br>\nfunction, an unpredictable function, and of encryption schemes that are<br>\nindistinguishable under chosen plaintext and/or ciphertext attacks. We<br>\nprove the random-permutation/random-function switching lemma, security<br>\nof the Elgamal and hashed Elgamal public-key encryption scheme and<br>\ncorrectness and security of several constructions with pseudo-random<br>\nfunctions.  </p>\n<p>Our proofs follow the game-hopping style advocated by<br>\nShoup and Bellare and Rogaway, from which most of the examples have<br>\nbeen taken. We generalise some of their results such that they can be<br>\nreused in other proofs. Thanks to CryptHOL's integration with<br>\nIsabelle's parametricity infrastructure, many simple hops are easily<br>\njustified using the theory of representation independence.</p>\n<p>Enjoy 5/5,<br>\nRen√©</p>",
