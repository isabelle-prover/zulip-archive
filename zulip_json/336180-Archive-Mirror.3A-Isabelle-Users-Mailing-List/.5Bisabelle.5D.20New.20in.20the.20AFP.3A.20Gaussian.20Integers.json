This article provides a definition of this ring as <br>\nwell as proofs of various basic properties, such as that they form a Euclidean ring and a full <br>\nclassification of their primes. An executable (albeit not very efficient) factorisation algorithm is <br>\nalso provided.</p>\n<p>Lastly, this Gaussian integer formalisation is used in two short applications:</p>\n<p>• The characterisation of all positive integers that can be written as sums of two squares<br>\n    • Euclid's formula for primitive Pythagorean triples</p>\n<p>While elementary proofs for both of these are already available in the AFP, the theory of Gaussian<br>\nintegers provides more concise proofs and a more high-level view.</p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
