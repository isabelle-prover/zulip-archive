In particular,<br>\nit contains a method for computing Gröbner bases, which proceeds by first<br>\nconstructing some Macaulay matrix of the initial set of polynomials, then<br>\nrow-reducing this matrix, and finally converting the result back into a set of<br>\npolynomials. The output is shown to be a Gröbner basis if the Macaulay matrix<br>\nconstructed in the first step is sufficiently large. In order to obtain concrete<br>\nupper bounds on the size of the matrix (and hence turn the method into an<br>\neffectively executable algorithm), Dubé's degree bounds on Gröbner bases are<br>\nutilized; consequently, they are also part of the formalization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Groebner_Macaulay.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Groebner_Macaulay.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/h9T8cixWf4X0cQzx-uIcnK6q/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
