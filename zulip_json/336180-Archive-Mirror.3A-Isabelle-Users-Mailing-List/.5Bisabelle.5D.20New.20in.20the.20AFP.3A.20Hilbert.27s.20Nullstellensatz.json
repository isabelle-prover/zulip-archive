The formalization proves several equivalent versions of this celebrated theorem: the weak Nullstellensatz, the strong Nullstellensatz (connecting algebraic varieties and radical ideals), and the field-theoretic Nullstellensatz. The formalization follows Chapter 4.1. of Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms by Cox, Little and O’Shea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many thanks to Alexander Maletzky for this additional entry!
