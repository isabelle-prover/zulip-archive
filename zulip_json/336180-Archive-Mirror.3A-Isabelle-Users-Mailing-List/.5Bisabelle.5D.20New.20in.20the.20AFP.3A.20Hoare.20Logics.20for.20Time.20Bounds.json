L. Haslbeck and Tobias Nipkow</p>\n<p>We study three different Hoare logics for reasoning about time bounds of<br>\nimperative programs and formalize them in Isabelle/HOL: a classical Hoare like<br>\nlogic due to Nielson, a logic with potentials due to Carbonneaux et al. and a<br>\nseparation logic following work by Atkey, Chaguérand and Pottier. These logics<br>\nare formally shown to be sound and complete. Verification condition generators<br>\nare developed and are shown sound and complete too. We also consider variants<br>\nof the systems where we abstract from multiplicative constants in the running<br>\ntime bounds, thus supporting a big-O style of reasoning. Finally we compare<br>\nthe expressive power of the three systems.</p>",
