Hancl asserting the<br>\nirrationality of the sum of a series consisting of rational numbers, built up<br>\nby sequences that fulfill certain properties. Even though the criterion is a<br>\nnumber theoretic result, the proof makes use only of analytical arguments. We<br>\nalso formalize a corollary of the theorem for a specific series fulfilling the<br>\nassumptions of the theorem.</p>",
