It proves Lerch's lemma and uniqueness of the Laplace transform for continuous functions. In order to formalize the foundational assumptions, this entry contains a formalization of piecewise continuous functions and functions of exponential order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is now online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Laplace_Transform.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Laplace_Transform.html</a>.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
