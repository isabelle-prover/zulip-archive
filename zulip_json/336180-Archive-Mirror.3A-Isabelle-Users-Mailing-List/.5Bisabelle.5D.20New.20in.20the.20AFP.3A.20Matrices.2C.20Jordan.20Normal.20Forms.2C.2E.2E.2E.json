In order to use these interpretations also for complexity analysis, the growth rate of matrix powers has to examined. Here, we formalized a central result of spectral radius theory, namely that the growth rate is polynomially bounded if and only if the spectral radius of a matrix is at most one.</p>\n<p>To formally prove this result we first studied the growth rates of matrices in Jordan normal form, and partially prove the result that every complex matrix has a Jordan normal form: we are restricted to upper-triangular matrices since we did not yet formalize the Schur decomposition.</p>\n<p>The whole development is based on a new abstract type for matrices, which is also executable by a suitable setup of the code generator. It completely subsumes our former AFP-entry on executable matrices, and its main advantage is its close connection to the HMA-representation which allowed us to easily adapt existing proofs on determinants.</p>\n<p>All the results have been applied to improve CeTA, our certifier to validate termination and complexity proof certificates.</p>",
