However, if you're hoping for one on Septions or<br>\nSedecions next week, you will unfortunately be disappointed – it turns<br>\nout 4 and 8 are the only dimensions for which it works out. Sorry.</p>\n<p>The new entry is available at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Octonions.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Octonions.html</a></p>\n<p>Quaternions<br>\n  by Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki</p>\n<p>We develop the basic theory of Octonions, including various identities<br>\nand properties of the octonions and of the octonionic product, a<br>\ndescription of 7D isometries and representations of orthogonal<br>\ntransformations. To this end we first develop the theory of the vector<br>\ncross product in 7 dimensions. The development of the theory of<br>\nOctonions is inspired by that of the theory of Quaternions by Lawrence<br>\nPaulson. However, we do not work within the type class real_algebra_1<br>\nbecause the octonionic product is not associative.</p>\n<p>Enjoy,</p>\n<p>Manuel<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/fx80iF6gVxZIv5vN9x1qLr9X/pEpkey.asc\">pEpkey.asc</a></p>",
