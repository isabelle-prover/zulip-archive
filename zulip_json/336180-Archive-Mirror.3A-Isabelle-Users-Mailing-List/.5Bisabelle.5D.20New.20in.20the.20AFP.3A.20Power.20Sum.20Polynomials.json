These are of the form p_n(X_1,...,X_k) = X_1^n + … + X_k^n. <br>\nA formal proof of the Girard–Newton Theorem is also given. This theorem relates the power sum polynomials to the elementary symmetric polynomials s_k in the form of a recurrence <br>\nrelation (-1)^k * k * s_k = Sum_{i in [0,k)} (-1)^i * s_i * p_{k-i}.</p>\n<p>As an application, this is then used to solve a generalised form of a puzzle given as <br>\nan exercise in Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra: For k complex unknowns x_1, ..., x_k, <br>\ndefine p_j := x_1^j + … + x_k^j. Then for each vector a in ℂ^k, show that there is exactly one<br>\nsolution to the system p_1 = a_1, …, p_k = a_k up to permutation of the x_i and determine the<br>\nvalue of p_i for i&gt;k.</p>\n<p>Enjoy even further,<br>\nRené</p>\n<p>PS: Here are the links to both of Manuel’s entries:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Power_Sum_Polynomials.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Power_Sum_Polynomials.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Gaussian_Integers.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Gaussian_Integers.html</a></p>",
