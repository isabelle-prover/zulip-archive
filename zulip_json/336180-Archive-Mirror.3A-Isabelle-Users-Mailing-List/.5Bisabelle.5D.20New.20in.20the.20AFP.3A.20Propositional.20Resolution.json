See the (shortened) abstract below. </p>\n<p>It’s truly gratifying to see this collection of formal material grow and grow. We now have 268 entries and more than a million lines of formal proofs. And, with the help of the contributors and our own tools, we are able to keep all these entries working despite Isabelle’s rapid development.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>\n<p>Full name: Propositional Resolution and Prime Implicates Generation<br>\nAuthors: Nicolas Peltier &lt;<a href=\"http://membres-lig.imag.fr/peltier/\">http://membres-lig.imag.fr/peltier/</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>We provide formal proofs in Isabelle-HOL (using mostly structured Isar<br>\nproofs) of the soundness and completeness of the Resolution rule in<br>\npropositional logic.  The completeness proofs take into account the<br>\nusual redundancy elimination rules (tautology elimination and<br>\nsubsumption), and several refinements of the Resolution rule are<br>\nconsidered: ordered resolution (with selection functions), positive<br>\nand negative resolution, semantic resolution and unit resolution (the<br>\nlatter refinement is complete only for clause sets that are Horn-<br>\nrenamable). We also define a concrete procedure for computing<br>\nsaturated sets and establish its soundness and completeness.</p>",
