Paulson</p>\n<p>This theory is inspired by the HOL Light development of quaternions, but follows<br>\nits own route. Quaternions are developed coinductively, as in the existing<br>\nformalisation of the complex numbers. Quaternions are quickly shown to belong to<br>\nthe type classes of real normed division algebras and real inner product spaces.<br>\nAnd therefore they inherit a great body of facts involving algebraic laws,<br>\nlimits, continuity, etc., which must be proved explicitly in the HOL Light<br>\nversion. The development concludes with the geometric interpretation of the<br>\nproduct of imaginary quaternions.</p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
