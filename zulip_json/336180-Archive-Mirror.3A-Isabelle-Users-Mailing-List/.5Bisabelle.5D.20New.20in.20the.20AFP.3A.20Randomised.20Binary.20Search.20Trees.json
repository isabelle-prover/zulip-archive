However, unlike treaps, they only use discrete probability distributions, but their use of randomness is more complicated.\"</p>\n<p>It's a wonderful demonstration of what can be done with the libraries now our disposal, including probability theory and a number of theories related to the analysis of algorithms.</p>\n<p>It is now online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Randomised_BSTs.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Randomised_BSTs.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
