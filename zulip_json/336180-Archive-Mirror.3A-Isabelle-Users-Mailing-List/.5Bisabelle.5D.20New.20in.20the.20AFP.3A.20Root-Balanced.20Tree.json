Using a lightweight model of<br>\nexecution time, amortized logarithmic complexity is verified in the theorem<br>\nprover Isabelle.</p>\n<p>This is the Isabelle formalization of the material decribed in the APLAS 2017<br>\narticle Verified Root-Balanced Trees by the same author, which also presents<br>\nexperimental results that show competitiveness of root-balanced with AVL and<br>\nred-black trees.</p>\n<p>More details at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Root_Balanced_Tree.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Root_Balanced_Tree.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRen√©</p>",
