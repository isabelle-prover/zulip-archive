Both are widely used fundamental two party cryptographic primitives. Security for commitment schemes is considered using game-based definitions whereas the security of Sigma-protocols is considered using both the game-based and simulation-based security paradigms. In this work, we first define security for both primitives and then prove secure multiple case studies: the Schnorr, Chaum-Pedersen and Okamoto Sigma-protocols as well as a construction that allows for compound (AND and OR statements) Sigma-protocols and the Pedersen and Rivest commitment schemes. We also prove that commitment schemes can be constructed from Sigma-protocols. We formalise this proof at an abstract level, only assuming the existence of a Sigma-protocol; consequently, the instantiations of this result for the concrete Sigma-protocols we consider come for free.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You’ll find it online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Sigma_Commit_Crypto.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Sigma_Commit_Crypto.html</a>.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, you might want to take look at the session graph:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Sigma_Commit_Crypto/session_graph.pdf\">https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Sigma_Commit_Crypto/session_graph.pdf</a></p>\n<p>This entry depends on numerous other AFP entries, showing the extent to which material here can be reused.</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",

Nevertheless, the theory graph<br>\ncontains everything used by any theory in EdmondsKarp_Maxflow, so is<br>\nnot particularly precise here.</p>\n<p>Does this indicate a problem with the theory graph generation, or a<br>\nproblem with the session setup in the Edmonds-Karp AFP entry?</p>",
