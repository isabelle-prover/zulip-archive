The<br>\npresent development is both generic, in the sense that most known variants of<br>\nsignature-based algorithms are covered by it, and effectively executable on<br>\nconcrete input thanks to Isabelle's code generator. Sample computations of<br>\nbenchmark problems show that the verified implementation of signature-based<br>\nalgorithms indeed outperforms the existing implementation of Buchberger's<br>\nalgorithm in Isabelle/HOL.</p>\n<p>Besides total correctness of the algorithms, the article also proves that under<br>\ncertain conditions they a-priori detect and avoid all useless zero-reductions,<br>\nand always return 'minimal' (in some sense) Gröbner bases if an input parameter<br>\nis chosen in the right way.</p>\n<p>The formalization follows the recent survey article by Eder and Faugère.</p>\n<p>More details at: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Signature_Groebner.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Signature_Groebner.html</a></p>\n<p>Many thanks to Alexander,<br>\nRené</p>",
