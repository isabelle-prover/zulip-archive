Stewart's Theorem relates the length of<br>\na triangle's cevian to the lengths of the triangle's two<br>\nsides. Apollonius' Theorem is a specialisation of Stewart's<br>\ntheorem, restricting the cevian to be the median. The proof applies<br>\nthe law of cosines, some basic geometric facts about triangles and<br>\nthen simply transforms the terms algebraically to yield the<br>\nconjectured relation. The formalization in Isabelle can closely follow<br>\nthe informal proofs described in the Wikipedia articles of those two<br>\ntheorems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Stewart_Apollonius.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Stewart_Apollonius.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
