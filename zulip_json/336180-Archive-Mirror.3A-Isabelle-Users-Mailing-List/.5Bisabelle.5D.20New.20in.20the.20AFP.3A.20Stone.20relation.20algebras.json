We<br>\nshow that finite matrices over extended real numbers form an instance. As a<br>\nconsequence, relation-algebraic concepts and methods can be used for reasoning<br>\nabout weighted graphs. We also develop a fixpoint calculus and apply it to<br>\ncompare different definitions of reflexive-transitive closures in semirings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Stone_Relation_Algebras.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Stone_Relation_Algebras.shtml</a></p>",
