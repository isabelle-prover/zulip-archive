We have first formalised the Budan-Fourier<br>\ntheorem: given a polynomial with real coefficients, we can calculate sign<br>\nvariations on Fourier sequences to over-approximate the number of real roots<br>\n(counting multiplicity) within an interval. When all roots are known to be real,<br>\nthe over-approximation becomes tight: we can utilise this theorem to count real<br>\nroots exactly. It is also worth noting that Descartes' rule of sign is a direct<br>\nconsequence of the Budan-Fourier theorem, and has been included in this entry.<br>\nIn addition, we have extended previous formalised Sturm's theorem to count real<br>\nroots with multiplicity, while the original Sturm's theorem only counts distinct<br>\nreal roots. Compared to the Budan-Fourier theorem, our extended Sturm's theorem<br>\nalways counts roots exactly but may suffer from greater computational cost.</p>\n<p>Happy counting,<br>\nRené</p>",
