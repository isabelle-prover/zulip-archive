In particular, Fitting's (and Anderson's) variant of the ontological argument is verified and confirmed. This variant avoids the modal collapse, which has been criticised as an undesirable side-effect of Kurt Gödel's (and Dana Scott's) versions of the ontological argument. Fitting's work is employing an intensional higher-order modal logic, which we shallowly embed here in classical higher-order logic. We then utilize the embedded logic for the formalisation of Fitting's argument. (See also the earlier AFP entry ``Gödel's God in Isabelle/HOL'’.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With thanks to David Fuenmayor and Christoph Benzmüller.
