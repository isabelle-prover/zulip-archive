Specific variants of this theorem<br>\nare additionally proven for deterministic processes and trace set processes.”</p>\n<p>The entry is online at <a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Noninterference_Inductive_Unwinding.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Noninterference_Inductive_Unwinding.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Many thanks to Pasquale Noce for this contribution!</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
