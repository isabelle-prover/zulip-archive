It builds on a tower of Manuel’s other contributions.</p>\n<p>The Lambert W function is a multi-valued function defined as the inverse function of x ↦ x ex. Besides numerous applications in combinatorics, physics, and engineering, it also frequently occurs when solving equations containing both ex and x, or both x and log x.</p>\n<p>This article provides a definition of the two real-valued branches W0(x) and W-1(x) and proves various properties such as basic identities and inequalities, monotonicity, differentiability, asymptotic expansions, and the MacLaurin series of W0(x) at x = 0.</p>\n<p>You’ll find it online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Lambert_W.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Lambert_W.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
