One valid<br>\ncompleteness threshold is the diameter of the underlying transition system. The<br>\ndiameter is the maximum element in the set of lengths of all shortest paths<br>\nbetween pairs of states. The diameter is not calculated exactly in our setting,<br>\nwhere the transition system is succinctly described using a (propositionally)<br>\nfactored representation. Rather, an upper bound on the diameter is calculated<br>\ncompositionally, by bounding the diameters of small abstract subsystems, and<br>\nthen composing those. We port a HOL4 formalisation of a compositional algorithm<br>\nfor computing a relatively tight upper bound on the system diameter. This<br>\ncompositional algorithm exploits acyclicity in the state space to achieve<br>\ncompositionality, and it was introduced by Abdulaziz et. al. The formalisation<br>\nthat we port is described as a part of another paper by Abdulaziz et. al. As a<br>\npart of this porting we developed a libray about transition systems, which shall<br>\nbe of use in future related mechanisation efforts.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/CldScZQK8WdShLnRjsYBEp55/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
