They support reasoning about<br>\ncontinuous evolutions of hybrid programs in the style of differential<br>\ndynamics logic. Vector fields or flows model these evolutions, and<br>\ntheir verification is done with invariants for the former or orbits<br>\nfor the latter. Laws of modal Kleene algebra or categorical predicate<br>\ntransformers implement the verification condition generation. Examples<br>\nshow the approach at work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hybrid_Systems_VCs.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hybrid_Systems_VCs.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nRené</p>",
