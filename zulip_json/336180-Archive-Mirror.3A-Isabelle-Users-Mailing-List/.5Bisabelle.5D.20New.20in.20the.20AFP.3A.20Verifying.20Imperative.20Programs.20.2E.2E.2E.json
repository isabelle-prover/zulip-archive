Algorithms and data structures that are verified<br>\ninclude linked lists, binary search trees, red-black trees, interval<br>\ntrees, priority queue, quicksort, union-find, Dijkstra's algorithm, and<br>\na sweep-line algorithm for detecting rectangle intersection. The<br>\nimperative verification is based on Imperative HOL and its separation<br>\nlogic framework. A major goal of this work is to set up automation in<br>\norder to reduce the length of proof that the user needs to provide, both<br>\nfor verifying functional programs and for working with separation logic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Auto2_Imperative_HOL.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Auto2_Imperative_HOL.html</a></p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
