This<br>\nincludes relation-algebraic concepts such as subidentities, vectors and<br>\na domain operation as well as various notions associated to functions.<br>\nRelation algebras are also expanded by a reflexive transitive closure<br>\noperation, and they are linked with Kleene algebras and models of binary<br>\nrelations and Boolean matrices.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
