It supports efficient normalization of open <br>\nlambda-terms w.r.t. beta-reduction and rewrite rules. We have <br>\nimplemented NBE and show both a detailed formal model of our <br>\nimplementation and its verification in Isabelle. Finally we discuss how <br>\nNBE is turned into a proof rule in Isabelle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/nbe.html\">http://www.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/nbe.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments are welcome.</p>\n<p>Tobias</p>",
