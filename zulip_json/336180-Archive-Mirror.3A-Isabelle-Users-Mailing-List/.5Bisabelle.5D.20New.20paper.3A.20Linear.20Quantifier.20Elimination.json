The DLO <br>\nprocedures are new. All procedures are defined and verified in the <br>\ntheorem prover Isabelle/HOL, are executable and can be applied to HOL <br>\nformulae themselves (by reflection).<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/lqe.html\">http://www.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/lqe.html</a></p>\n<p>This paper documents the NNF-based methods in the AFP-article<br>\nQuantifier Elimination for Linear Arithmetic<br>\nthat I announced recently.</p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nTobias</p>",
