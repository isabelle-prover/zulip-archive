For Nitpick, I now have a few soundness bugs that I haven't investigated yet. It may be that it's the same issue.</p>\n<p>Although Nitpick isn't in the \"critical path\", soundness bugs for Nitpick are really annoying, because it often takes 5-10 minutes to make sense of a counterexample, and if it's not correct, then that's really annoying.</p>\n<p>I want to get rid of Nitpick anyway once Nunchaku is finished (or good enough). I haven't found a student to take over Nunchaku yet but I am hiring some new PhD students and one of them might take over the tool.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
