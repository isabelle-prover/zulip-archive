The latest version, with support for coinduction,<br>\ncan be downloaded from</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www4.in.tum.de/~blanchet/nitpick.html\">http://www4.in.tum.de/~blanchet/nitpick.html</a></p>\n<p>Nitpick has few users, but they seem happy. Here are some quotes:</p>\n<p>\"Nitpick [hat] mir letzte Woche einige Stunden einspart, falsche<br>\n    Hilfslemmata zu zeigen.\"</p>\n<p>\"I used the model generator Nitpick [...] to find a closure set<br>\n    of two SCGs, where none of them is sub-idempotent. [...] Nitpick<br>\n    rocks! Otherwise I would have actually written code just to<br>\n    enumerate stupid finite relations... Now I basically just had to<br>\n    write down the properties...\"</p>\n<p>\"What a fast tool. I've already installed it and am looking<br>\n    forward to the time savings it will surely provide.\"</p>\n<p>\"We [...] are currently trying out the new Nitpick tool and it<br>\n    works very nicely with some of our theories.\"</p>\n<p>The package contains everything you need. To install it, you just<br>\nneed to type \"./build\".</p>\n<p>We expect to bundle Nitpick with Isabelle starting with the next<br>\nofficial release, so this is your last chance to install Nitpick<br>\nmanually and try it out.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
