The short sequence of 'apply's that I have<br>\nused in previous proofs, and have seen in uses of Nominal2 in the AFP, is<br>\nnot working.</p>\n<p>I notice the appearance of 'default' and  'invariant' on some nominal<br>\nfunctions in the AFP. I can see what the type signatures of these are and<br>\ncan guess how to construct them.</p>\n<p>My questions is: What are these used for and can they help?</p>\n<p>Cheers</p>\n<p>Mark</p>",
