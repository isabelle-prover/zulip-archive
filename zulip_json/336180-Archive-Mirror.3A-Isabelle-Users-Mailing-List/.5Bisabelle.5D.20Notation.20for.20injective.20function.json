(cf. the lemmas f_inv_into_f and inv_into_f_f in the theory<br>\nHilbert_Choice in Isabelle)</p>\n<p>The definition of inv_into is straightforward: ‘inv_into A f x = SOME y.<br>\ny ∈ A ∧ f y = x’.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",

There <br>\nisn't a unique function g of type B -&gt; A such that g(f b) = b.  Since <br>\nyour are starting with a surjective function, you could define g using <br>\nthe Hilbert Choice operator SOME by  g y = SOME x. (f x = y).  From <br>\nsurjectivity you have for all y there exists x such the f x = y, so you <br>\ncan show f (g y) = y.  Otherwise, the preimage of an element of B would <br>\nbe a set and you don't need surjectivity to define this since you just <br>\nget empty set for the preimage of any element not in the range.</p>\n<p>---Elsa</p>",
