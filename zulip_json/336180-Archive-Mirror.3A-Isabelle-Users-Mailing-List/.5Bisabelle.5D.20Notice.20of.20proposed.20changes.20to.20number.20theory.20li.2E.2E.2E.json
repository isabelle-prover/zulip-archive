Meanwhile, some of the experimental material in HOL/Number_Theory will be going away. The availability of implicit conversions from natural numbers to integers reduces the need to overload certain primitives, and we will go back to using Suc instead of n+1 for induction and recursion there.</p>\n<p>Interested users will be able to follow these changes using development snapshots. The theory Library/Binomial.thy is likely to be deleted very soon, having already been combined with the theory of the same name in directory Number_Theory.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
