The »subclass« command does the same:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Establish a proof obligation for an interpretation and give it to the<br>\nuser.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From this, establish the subclass relation on the axclass level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Then establish the subclass dependency on the locale level.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And my real question is, if the interpret is necessary, how to perform the above proof on the Isabelle/ML-level, <br>\ni.e., especially the \"interpret\" command.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is maybe best for setup a Isar proof goal from ML and then use<br>\nExpression.interpret.</p>\n<p>You can also do this on a more fundamental level using something like<br>\n(Context.proof_map ooo Locale.add_registration) in a proof context, but<br>\nthen you have to manually deal with all the subtle constracts of the<br>\nlocale machinery.  I would not recommend this in a first step.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/7Yg8CGQKDHkcrObMUQSNWm5O/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
