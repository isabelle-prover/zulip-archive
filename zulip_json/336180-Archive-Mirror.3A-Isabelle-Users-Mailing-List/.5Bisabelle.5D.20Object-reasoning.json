You're right that I'm not clear on the terms meta-level<br>\nand object-level.</p>\n<p>So if I have, e.g.,</p>\n<p>const P :: \"nat =&gt; bool\"<br>\nlemma \"P x = True\"</p>\n<p>Would you say that I'm actually encoding an object-level sentence in<br>\nthe meta-level? That is, I'm essentially translating the object-level<br>\nsentence \"\\forall x. P(x) = True\" into Isabelle's notations, and thus<br>\n\"using the meta-level language only to talk about the object level\".</p>\n<p>Regarding the way the object-level is represented in the meta-level<br>\nand how unification in the meta-level are reflected in the<br>\nobject-level, that's all down to using Pure, right? A short<br>\nclarification will be much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for your time.</p>\n<p>John</p>",
