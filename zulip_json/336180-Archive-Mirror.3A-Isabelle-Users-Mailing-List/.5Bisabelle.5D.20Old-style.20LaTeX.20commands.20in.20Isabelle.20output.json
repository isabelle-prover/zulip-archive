This means that Isabelle-produced LaTeX documents<br>\nfail to compile with that document class (they used to compile at some<br>\npoint in the past).</p>\n<p>The reason appears to be that \"isabelle.sty\" still uses these ancient<br>\ncommands, e.g. here:</p>\n<p>\\newcommand{\\isakeyword}[1]<br>\n{\\emph{\\bf\\def\\isachardot{.}\\def\\isacharunderscore{\\isacharunderscorekeyword}<br>\n\\def\\isacharbraceleft{\\{}\\def\\isacharbraceright{\\}}#1}}</p>\n<p>... in what appears to be a mixture between old- and new-style.</p>\n<p>I would like to advocate for replacing all ancient commands by their<br>\nnewer counterparts.</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nLars</p>",
