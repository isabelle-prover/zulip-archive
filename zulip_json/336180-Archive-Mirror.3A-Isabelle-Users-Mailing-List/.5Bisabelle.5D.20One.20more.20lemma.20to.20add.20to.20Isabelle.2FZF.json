Very few Isabelle users are interested in Isabelle/ZF. <br>\nIf you decide to contribute to IsarMathLib, please read the style guide at <a href=\"http://www.nongnu.org/isarmathlib/IsarMathLib/CONTRIBUTING.html\">http://www.nongnu.org/isarmathlib/IsarMathLib/CONTRIBUTING.html</a> first. <br>\nNote that Isabelle and IsarMathLib are separate projects and you shouldn't expect that your contributions to IsarMathLib will be automatically included in Isabelle distribution.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nSlawomir</p>",

Please stop doing<br>\nthis, as it is just a waste of everybody's time!</p>\n<p>Instead, my suggestion is this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Learn the basics of Isabelle using the available documentation. Since<br>\nZF has less documentation than HOL, it may be helpful to work through<br>\nthe Isabelle/HOL tutorial first. Many things described there also apply<br>\nto ZF. Typically, getting sufficiently comfortable with the system to do<br>\nactual work takes a few months.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you have mastered the basics, start working on some<br>\nformalization that you are interested in.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you have proved something non-trivial, you can consider<br>\nsubmitting your formalization to the AFP (<a href=\"http://afp.sf.net\">http://afp.sf.net</a>).<br>\nSubmissions will be reviewed by the editors and added to the AFP if<br>\nconsidered relevant. If in this process, it is discovered that some<br>\nlemmas should rather go directly into ZF, rather than the AFP, this will<br>\nbe taken care of by the Isabelle developers.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alex</p>",
