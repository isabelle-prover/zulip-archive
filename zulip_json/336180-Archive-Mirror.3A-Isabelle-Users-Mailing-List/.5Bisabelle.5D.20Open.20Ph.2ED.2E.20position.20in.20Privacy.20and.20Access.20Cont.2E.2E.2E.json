We seek to hire one or more doctoral<br>\nstudents who will carry out research on the development of novel control and<br>\nauditing mechanisms that enhance data protection, e.g., by ensuring that<br>\ndata is only used for the purposes it is collected.  This will involve<br>\ndeveloping and prototyping new access control mechanisms as well as<br>\nusing code analysis and machine learning methods to extract and<br>\ndetermine \"purpose\" from code and other system artifacts. In addition and <br>\nindependent of foundational research on these topics, there will be<br>\nthe opportunity to work with our industrial partners to evaluate the<br>\ndeveloped techniques on realistic large-scale systems.</p>\n<p>The ideal candidate for this position is an enthusiastic, outstanding<br>\nstudent with a strong background and interest in one or more of<br>\nthe following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formal methods </li>\n<li>information security or cryptography,</li>\n<li>programing language theory and methods and tools for program analysis</li>\n<li>machine learning</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Candidates with a strong theoretical background in related areas are<br>\nalso encouraged to apply. ETH Zurich regulations require PhD candidates<br>\nto hold a Master's or equivalent degree (e.g. Diplom). The Ph.D. student <br>\nwill be a paid employee of ETH Zurich. Salary and employment conditions <br>\nare very attractive. </p>\n<p>Applications should include a curriculum vitae, a brief description of<br>\nresearch interests, transcripts of grades, 2-3 letters of recommendation <br>\nfrom teachers or employers, and, if possible, the Master's or<br>\nBachelor's thesis and publications. Applications and informal inquiries <br>\nshould be sent to Esfandiar Mohammadi at the following email address:</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:infsec.positions@inf.ethz.ch\">infsec.positions@inf.ethz.ch</a></p>\n<p>ETH Zurich specifically encourages women to apply with a view towards<br>\nincreasing the proportion of female researchers.</p>\n<p>Our group:<br>\nThe Information Security Group carries out research on methods and tools<br>\nfor the analysis and construction of safe and secure systems. This<br>\nincludes methods for specifying systems, developing systems in<br>\ncorrectness-preserving ways, and verifying or testing existing systems<br>\nand infrastructures. Our goal is not only to build and analyze novel<br>\nsystems and security solutions, but also to develop better methods and<br>\ntools for system engineering and quality assurance activities.</p>\n<p>The city of Zurich:<br>\nZurich is a diverse and multicultural city, which is consistently rated<br>\namong the best cities in the world in which to live. We favor the same<br>\nsort of diversity that defines Zurich's cultural makeup and encourage<br>\nanyone matching the profile above to apply, regardless of where you are from.</p>",
