A program producer can hence verify the security of his <br>\nprogram with a<br>\nlarge amount of computation resource before distributing it with a <br>\ncertificate that<br>\nhelps the consumer to replay the verification program but with very far <br>\nfewer resources.</p>\n<p>Candidates should have a background in program verification. Additional<br>\nknowledge in one or more of the following topics will be appreciated:</p>\n<p>- static analysis,<br>\n  - theory of abstract interpretation,<br>\n  - language-based security,<br>\n  - deductive verification,<br>\n  - decision procedures,<br>\n  - probabilistic verification<br>\n  Knowledge of the French language is not required.</p>\n<p>Start of contract: ideally, the candidate will start working in <br>\nseptember or october, but<br>\nwe can accomodate a later date.<br>\nSalaries: usual INRIA postdoc salary (2,357.30 euros gross/month, i.e. <br>\n1923,26 euros net/month).<br>\nSocial security benefits:</p>\n<p>- Entitled to unemployment benefit at the end of the contract;<br>\n   - Affiliated to the French social security system.</p>\n<p>Candidates should submit to david.pichardie[at]irisa.fr, <br>\nthomas.genet[at]irisa.fr and thomas.jensen[at]irisa.fr</p>\n<p>- A CV including a list of publications<br>\n   - A one-page research statement<br>\n   - Referee reports for the PhD thesis if any<br>\n   - Contact information for two references (including the PhD supervisor)</p>",
