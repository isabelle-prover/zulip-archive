They should support pattern matching and <br>\nhigher-order functions. I'd like to use them to assign run-time bounds to programs written <br>\nin these languages and to connect these programs semantically to functions written in HOL.</p>\n<p>I know of the formalisation by Simon Wimmer, the ongoing work of Lars Hupel and Joachim <br>\nBreitner's formalisation of Sestoft's semantics for call-by-name. What others are out <br>\nthere that might be useful?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any pointers,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
