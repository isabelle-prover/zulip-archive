We should probably <br>\ndo something about this.</p>\n<p>I see the following three options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Rename one of the operators. Since Formal_Power_Series is used less <br>\nthan vectors, this is probably the one to change in this case. I am not <br>\nsure, however, what it could be renamed to. The standard mathematical <br>\nnotation is something like \"[X^n] f\", so I suppose we could go for <br>\n\"⟨X^n⟩ f\", but I'm not sure if that's a good idea.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Disable the \"$\" notation completely outside the FPS theory, or put it <br>\nin a locale that has to be interpreted every time one wants to use the <br>\nnotation. On the down side, one still runs into problems when one wants <br>\nto use the $ notation for FPSs but has Multivariate_Analysis loaded as <br>\nwell. I guess one could put both of them in locales, but I don't know if <br>\nwe want that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use ad-hoc Overloading, similar to what is done for monads. One could <br>\nthen also use $ e.g. for the n-th coefficient of a polynomial, or <br>\nperhaps even unify the notation with the n-th element of lists and <br>\narrays etc. at some point. The down side of this is that when there are <br>\nambiguities/type errors, the error messages get a bit confusing.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that \"normal\" overloading does not work, since the constant would <br>\nhave to have the type \"'a =&gt; nat =&gt; 'b\", and that means one has to write <br>\ntype annotations everywhere.</p>\n<p>Any opinions? Whatever the outcome is, I will take care of implementing it.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",

I'd recommend that the operations by default use <br>\nsubscripts for disambiguation, e.g. (we can discuss about the concrete subscripts),</p>\n<p>op $\\&lt;^sub&gt;v for vectors<br>\n   op $\\&lt;^sup&gt;p for formal power series<br>\n   op $\\&lt;^sup&gt;f for FinFun</p>\n<p>In HOLCF/Cfun, Rep_cfun uses \\&lt;cdot&gt; in jEdit, so one could in theory drop the ASCII <br>\nnotation there.</p>\n<p>Then, if a user wants to use several of the theories at the same time, she can always use <br>\nunambiguous syntax. However, typing subscripts can be annoying, so there should be support <br>\nfor users that use only one of the theories. Makarius recently [1] renovated bundles to <br>\nsupport that. Then, users can install their op $ syntax for what they want in one line.</p>\n<p>I am against adhoc_overloading, because the type error messages just get incomprehensible <br>\nand adhoc_overloading is not complete (in some cases, it fails to find a resolution of <br>\noverloading, but when I add type annotations, then it succeeds).</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://mailmanbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/pipermail/isabelle-dev/2016-June/006891.html\">https://mailmanbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/pipermail/isabelle-dev/2016-June/006891.html</a></p>\n<p>Andreas</p>",
