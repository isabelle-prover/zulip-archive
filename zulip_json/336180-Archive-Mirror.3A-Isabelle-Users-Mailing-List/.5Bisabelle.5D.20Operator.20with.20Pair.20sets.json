The first parenthesation corresponds to what you have written, but the <br>\nsecond version looks more like what I would expect from a \"pair set\". In case of the <br>\nlatter, the theory Relation defines a number of useful operators, e.g., composition, <br>\nimage, domain and range.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
