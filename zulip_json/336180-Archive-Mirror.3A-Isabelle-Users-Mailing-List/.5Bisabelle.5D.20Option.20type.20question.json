Then we have proved a number of properties<br>\nof this function. Now we want to also use an extended version of the<br>\nfunction which is defined in two further points (in 0 and 1) and want<br>\nto reuse the original proofs as much as possible.</p>\n<p>What is the best way to extend a partial function defined via an<br>\noption type so that as much of the structure of the definitions,<br>\ntheorems, and proofs can be reused?</p>\n<p>Many thanks<br>\nManfred</p>",

Assume your current definition of the<br>\nfunction is:</p>\n<p>f :: real =&gt; real<br>\n  f = some_definition</p>\n<p>1) You write your extended function like</p>\n<p>g = f (0 ↦ 5, 1 ↦ 7)</p>\n<p>and then try to prove properties of g by reusing the existing theorems for f.</p>\n<p>2) You change the definition of f itself to</p>\n<p>f = some_definition (0 ↦ 5, 1 ↦ 7)</p>\n<p>and then add a case-anaylsis on x = 0, x = 1, x != 0,1 to your existing proofs.</p>\n<p>I hope some of these approaches is applicable in your case.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nRené</p>",
