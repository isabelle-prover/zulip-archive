An Isar <br>\ngoal always consists of a list of facts plus a pending problem.  It is up <br>\nto the proof method to make as much sense out of it as possible.  The <br>\n\"auto\" method is an automated tool of the \"simple method\" category, which <br>\nmeans it first pushes the facts into the goal, in the given order, and <br>\nthen does some kind of magic.  What happens in the latter step is not so <br>\nobvious, and there can be almost arbitrary prover plugins in the context, <br>\ntoo.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
