My question is<br>\nwhere I can find the essential definition of ordered pair product as a<br>\nfunction. I've seen the product definition in Product_Type theory but I<br>\nstill can't find the definition of  ordered pair as in set theory (as a<br>\nfunction).<br>\nSo, is there and function or definition says that the ('a x'b)set is a<br>\nfunction or relation of AXB where for pair (a,b):C  a:A and b:B and C is<br>\n('a x'b)set.</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nJasim</p>",
