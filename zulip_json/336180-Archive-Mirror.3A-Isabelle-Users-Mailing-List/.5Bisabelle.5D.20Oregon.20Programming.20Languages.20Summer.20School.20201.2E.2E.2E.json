The main aim is to enable  <br>\nparticipants to conduct research in the area, thereby contributing to  <br>\nimprove software quality.</p>\n<p>The Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS) has been held  <br>\nat the University of Oregon each summer since 2002. This year, in the  <br>\noccasion of the tenth anniversary of the summer school, two plenary  <br>\nlectures will complement the technical program.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Technical Program</p>\n<p>Logical Relations<br>\nAmal Ahmed - Indiana University</p>\n<p>Software Verification<br>\nAndrew Appel - Princeton University</p>\n<p>Monadic Effects<br>\nNick Benton - Microsoft Research</p>\n<p>Metamathematics of Polymorphic Logics - applications<br>\nRobert Constable - Cornell University</p>\n<p>Polarization and Focalization<br>\nPierre-Louis Curien  - pi.r2 team, PPS, CNRS-Paris Diderot University- <br>\nINRIA</p>\n<p>Type Theory Foundation<br>\nRobert Harper - Carnegie Mellon University</p>\n<p>The Calculus of Inductive Constructions<br>\nHugo Herbelin  - pi.r2 team, PPS, CNRS-Paris Diderot University-INRIA</p>\n<p>Compiler Certification<br>\nXavier Leroy - INRIA</p>\n<p>Programming languages in string diagrams<br>\nPaul-Andre' Mellies  - PPS, CNRS-Paris Diderot University</p>\n<p>Imperative Programming in Coq<br>\nGreg Morrisett - Harvard University</p>\n<p>Proof Theory Foundation<br>\nFrank Pfenning  - Carnegie Mellon University</p>\n<p>Proof Theory in Coq<br>\nBenjamin Pierce - University of Pennsylvania</p>\n<p>Semilattices, Domains, and Computability<br>\nDana Scott - Carnegie Mellon University - Berkeley University</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Plenary Lectures:</p>\n<p>Speaker: Dana Scott (Carnegie Mellon University and Berkeley University)<br>\nTitle: What is a Proof? -- Some Challenges for Automated Theorem Proving</p>\n<p>Speaker: Robert Constable (Cornell University)<br>\nTitle: Metamathematics of Polymorphic Logics - foundations</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Registration</p>\n<p>Full information on registration are available at:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Activities/summerschool/\">http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Activities/summerschool/</a></p>\n<p>Registration Deadline: March 4, 2011</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Some further activities will complement the main program.</p>\n<p>Coq-labs:<br>\nSome of the lectures will assume interactive sessions using the  <br>\ninteractive proof assistant Coq. Students are encouraged to bring a  <br>\nlaptop on which Coq has been installed, and to form small working  <br>\ngroup during the interactive sessions. Moreover, some Coq-labs will be  <br>\noffered in order to give the participants the opportunity of make more  <br>\npractice in using Coq.</p>\n<p>Student Sessions:<br>\nInterested students will have the opportunity to present their work  <br>\nduring special sessions. Each presentation will consist of a brief  <br>\ntalk about the student research interests and results. These sessions  <br>\nwill be an occasion for students to obtain useful feedback on their  <br>\nwork by other students and researchers, and also to interact with  <br>\nparticipants having similar research interests.</p>\n<p>We hope to see you in Eugene.</p>\n<p>Zena Ariola<br>\nPierre-Louis Curien<br>\nMarco Gaboardi<br>\nRobert Harper<br>\nHugo Herbelin</p>",
