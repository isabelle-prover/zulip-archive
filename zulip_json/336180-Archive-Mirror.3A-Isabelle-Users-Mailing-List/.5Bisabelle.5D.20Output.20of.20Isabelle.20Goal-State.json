My intention is to do as much of<br>\nthe rewriting as possible in Isabelle and and then prove the non-linear<br>\nstuff in HOL-Light. My problem is that I have to do the translation of a<br>\nintermediate Isabelle proof state to a HOL-Light input by hand.</p>\n<p>Is the a neat and simple way to output the current subgoals of a proof<br>\nto a file and maybe translate it to another syntax?</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\n Dominik</p>",
