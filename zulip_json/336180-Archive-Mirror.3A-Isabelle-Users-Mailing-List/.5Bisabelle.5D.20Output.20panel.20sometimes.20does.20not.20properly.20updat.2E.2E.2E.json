For example, intermittently, on invoking \"try\", the<br>\nOutput panel prints the usual</p>\n<p>\"Trying \"solve_direct\", \"quickcheck\", \"try0\", \"sledgehammer\", and<br>\n\"nitpick\"...\"</p>\n<p>message, but if any proof method invoked by try successfully finds a<br>\nproof this is not relayed to the user by another message appearing in<br>\nthe panel, as one would expect, and as what usually happens.  Instead,<br>\nthe user must notice that the try or sledgehammer command is now<br>\nunderlined in grey in the Isabelle/jEdit editor pane, and the found<br>\nproof must be retrieved from the popup window that appears whilst<br>\nmouse hovering over the command.</p>\n<p>(I'm not sure if this is the correct place to report apparent bugs or<br>\nunexpected behaviours --- is there an Isabelle bug tracker?)</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nDominic</p>",
