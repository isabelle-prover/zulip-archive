I introduce a function, such as \"be bounded by\", <br>\nin a LaTeX theorem environment, named using spaces. It's understood that <br>\n\"be bounded by\" will be named in Isar with different characters to <br>\nseparate the words. And, after all, the Isar code will be shown to them. <br>\nIt's not too much to expect that people will make the connection between <br>\n\"be bounded by\" in some formal-non-formal natural language proof, and <br>\nthe \"be_bounded_by\" in the Isar proof (or be_bounded_by with something <br>\nelse in place of \"_\").</p>\n<p>And typing \\&lt;^isub&gt;' isn't that bad with the \"-_\" shortcut.</p>\n<p>It's also not a trivial thing to have subscripts available for use in <br>\nidentifiers, in general.</p>\n<p>I attached a screen shot of the Verbatim environment with \\&lt;^isub&gt;' <br>\nbeing used for spacing. It looks good in jEdit too. These kind of <br>\noptions are always good to have, even if you decide not to use them.</p>\n<p>--GB</p>\n<p>theorem emS\\&lt;^isub&gt;'is\\&lt;^isub&gt;'unique: \"u = emS \\&lt;longleftrightarrow&gt; <br>\n(\\&lt;forall&gt;x::sT. \\&lt;not&gt;(inS x u))\"<br>\n   apply(auto)<br>\n   oops</p>\n<p>Let A be'bounded'by b.</p>\n<p>Let A be\\&lt;^isub&gt;'bounded\\&lt;^isub&gt;'by b.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/2mngGDxB3ywrJREWaEgGaYyj/isubforSpace.jpg\">isub'forSpace.jpg</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/2mngGDxB3ywrJREWaEgGaYyj/isubforSpace.jpg\" title=\"isub'forSpace.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/2mngGDxB3ywrJREWaEgGaYyj/isubforSpace.jpg\"></a></div>",
