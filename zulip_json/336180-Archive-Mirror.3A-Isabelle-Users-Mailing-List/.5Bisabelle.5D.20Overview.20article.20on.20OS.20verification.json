We survey the<br>\nstate of the art, the advantages and limitations of machine-checked<br>\ncode proofs, and describe two specific ongoing larger-scale<br>\nverification projects in more detail.</p>\n<p>The article is written for a general engineering audience, but it will also be <br>\ninteresting to people closer to formal verification.</p>\n<p>Available from:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ias.ac.in/sadhana\">http://www.ias.ac.in/sadhana</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ias.ac.in/sadhana/CurrentIssueFeb2009.htm\">http://www.ias.ac.in/sadhana/CurrentIssueFeb2009.htm</a></p>\n<p>Needless to say, Isabelle plays a prominent role in OS verification these days.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",
