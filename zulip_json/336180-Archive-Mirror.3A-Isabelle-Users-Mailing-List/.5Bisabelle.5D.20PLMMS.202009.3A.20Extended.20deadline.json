The latter<br>\ncategory subsumes present-day computer algebra systems (CAS),<br>\ninteractive proof assistants (PA), and automated theorem provers<br>\n(ATP), all heading towards fully integrated mechanized mathematical<br>\nassistants. Areas of interest include all aspects of PL and MMS that<br>\nmeet in the following topics, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Dedicated input languages for MMS: covers all aspects of languages<br>\n   intended for the user to deploy or extend the system, both<br>\n   algorithmic and declarative ones. Typical examples are tactic<br>\n   definition languages such as Ltac in Coq, mathematical proof<br>\n   languages as in Mizar or Isar, or specialized programming<br>\n   languages built into CA systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mathematical modeling languages used for programming: covers the<br>\n   relation of logical descriptions vs. algorithmic content. For<br>\n   instance the logic of ACL2 extends a version of Lisp, that of Coq<br>\n   is close to Haskell, and some portions of HOL are similar to ML<br>\n   and Haskell, while Maple tries to do both simultaneously. Such<br>\n   mathematical languages offer rich specification capabilities,<br>\n   which are rarely available in regular programming languages. How<br>\n   can programming benefit from mathematical concepts, without<br>\n   limiting mathematics to the computational world view?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Programming languages with mathematical specifications: covers<br>\n   advanced mathematical concepts in programming languages that<br>\n   improve the expressive power of functional specifications, type<br>\n   systems, module systems etc. Programming languages with dependent<br>\n   types are of particular interest here, as is intentionality vs<br>\n   extensionality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Language elements for program verification: covers specific means<br>\n   built into a language to facilitate correctness proofs using<br>\n   MMS. For example, logical annotations within programs may be<br>\n   turned into verification conditions to be solved in a proof<br>\n   assistant eventually. How need MMS and PL to be improved to make<br>\n   this work conveniently and in a mathematically appealing way?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These issues have a very colorful history. Many PL innovations first<br>\nappeared in either CA or proof systems first, before migrating into<br>\nmore mainstream programming languages.  This workshop is an<br>\nopportunity  to present the latest innovations in MMS design that may be <br>\nrelevant to future programming languages, or conversely novel PL <br>\nprinciples that improve upon implementation and deployment of MMS.  Why <br>\nare all the languages of mainstream CA systems untyped?  Why are the <br>\n(strongly typed) proof assistants so much harder to use than a typical <br>\nCAS?  What forms of polymorphism exist in mathematics?  What forms of <br>\ndependent types may be used in mathematical modeling?  How can MMS <br>\nregain the upper hand on issues of \"genericity\" and<br>\n\"modularity\"?  What are the biggest barriers to using a more<br>\nmainstream language as a host language for a CAS or PA/ATP?<br>\nPLMMS 2007 was held as a satellite event of, and PLMMS 2008 was<br>\na CICM 2008 workshop.</p>\n<p>Submission Details</p>\n<p>Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF),<br>\n  formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines<br>\n  (<a href=\"http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm\">http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm</a>).
