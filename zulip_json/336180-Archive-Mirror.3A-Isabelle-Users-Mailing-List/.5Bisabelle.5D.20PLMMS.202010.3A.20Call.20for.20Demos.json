In particular:</p>\n<p>- Mathematical algorithms<br>\n  - Tactics and proof search<br>\n  - Proofs<br>\n  - Mathematical notation</p>\n<p>Of particular interest are the dimensions of:</p>\n<p>- Expressiveness<br>\n  - Efficiency<br>\n  - Correctness<br>\n  - Understandability and Usability<br>\n  - Modularity and Extensibility<br>\n  - Design and implementation</p>\n<p>Mechanised mathematics systems, whether stand-alone or embedded in<br>\nlarger systems, include but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>- Dependent typed programming languages<br>\n  - Proof assistants<br>\n  - Computer algebra systems<br>\n  - Proof planning systems<br>\n  - Theorem proving systems<br>\n  - Theory formation systems</p>\n<p>These issues have a very colourful history. Why are all the languages<br>\nof mainstream computer algebra systems untyped? (Not for lack of<br>\ntrying: Axiom and Magma both enjoy type systems, although they have<br>\nnot (yet) become mainstream.) Why are the (strongly typed) proof<br>\nassistants so much harder to use than a typical computer algebra<br>\nsystems?  What forms of polymorphism exist in mathematics?  What forms<br>\nof dependent types may be used in mathematical modelling?  How can MMS<br>\nregain the upper hand on issues of \"genericity\" and \"modularity\"?<br>\nWhat are the biggest barriers when using more mainstream languages for<br>\ncomputer algebra systems, proof assistants or theorems provers?</p>\n<p>Many programming language innovations appeared in either computer<br>\nalgebra or proof systems first, before migrating into more mainstream<br>\nprogramming languages.  This workshop is an opportunity to present the<br>\nlatest innovations in the design of MMS that may be relevant to future<br>\nprogramming languages, or conversely novel programming language<br>\nprinciples that improve upon the implementation and deployment of MMS.</p>\n<p>Submission Details</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We welcome submission of proposals to present a demo, as well as<br>\nsubmissions of papers presenting original unpublished work which is<br>\nnot been submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library. System demos<br>\nwill be presented at the workshop, and the material from the demo will<br>\nbe made available online.</p>\n<p>Papers and demos should be submitted via the PLMMS 2010 easychair website:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=plmms2010\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=plmms2010</a></p>\n<p>At least one author of each accepted paper/demo is expected to attend<br>\nPLMMS 2010 and present her or his paper/demo.</p>\n<p>Papers should be no more than 8 pages in length and are to be<br>\nsubmitted in PDF format. They must conform to the ACM SIGPLAN style<br>\nguidelines using 9-point font size (see<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm\">http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm</a> - this also<br>\nprovides latex templates). Each submission must also adhere to<br>\nSIGPLAN's republication policy<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm\">http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm</a>). Papers will be<br>\nreviewed by at least three reviewers and the authors will have an<br>\nopportunity for rebuttal by the response deadline.</p>\n<p>Demo proposals may be formatted as the author finds most suitable, but <br>\nshould include a brief description of the system and proposed contents <br>\nof the demo.</p>\n<p>Links</p>\n<hr>\n<p>* <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=plmms2010\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=plmms2010</a><br>\n     abstract and paper submission webpage</p>\n<p>* ttp://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm<br>\n     submission style guide</p>\n<p>* <a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm\">http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm</a><br>\n     republication policy</p>\n<p>* <a href=\"http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/events/plmms-2010/\">http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/events/plmms-2010/</a><br>\n     the PLMMS 2010 web site</p>\n<p>* <a href=\"http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/\">http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/</a><br>\n     the CICM 2010 conference web site</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>* Thorsten Altenkirch (University of Nottingham, UK)<br>\n  * Serge Autexier (DFKI, Germany)<br>\n  * David Delahaye (CNAM, Paris, France)<br>\n  * James Davenport [PC co-chair] (University of Bath, UK)<br>\n  * Lucas Dixon [PC co-chair] (University of Edinburgh, UK)<br>\n  * Gudmund Grov (University of Edinburgh, UK)<br>\n  * Ewen Maclean (University of Herriot Watt, UK)<br>\n  * Dale Miller (INRIA, France)<br>\n  * Gabriel Dos Reis (Texas A&amp;M University, USA)<br>\n  * Carsten Schuermann (IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark)<br>\n  * Tim Sheard (Portland State University, USA)<br>\n  * Sergei Soloviev (IRIT, Toulouse, France)<br>\n  * Stephen Watt (The University of Western Ontario, Canada)<br>\n  * Makarius Wenzel (ITU Munich, Germany)<br>\n  * Freek Wiedijk (Radboud University Nijmegen, Netherlands)</p>",
