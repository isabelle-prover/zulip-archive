The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical<br>\nformalisms and methods for specifying, performing, and analyzing<br>\ncomputations, including mechanisms for mobility, modularity,<br>\nconcurrency, object-orientation, security, verification and static<br>\nanalysis. Papers related to the use of declarative paradigms and tools<br>\nin industry and education are especially solicited. Topics of interest<br>\ninclude, but are not limited to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Functional programming</li>\n<li>Logic programming</li>\n<li>Answer-set programming</li>\n<li>Functional-logic programming</li>\n<li>Declarative visual languages</li>\n<li>Constraint Handling Rules</li>\n<li>Parallel implementation and concurrency</li>\n<li>Monads, type classes and dependent type systems</li>\n<li>Declarative domain-specific languages</li>\n<li>\n<p>Termination, resource analysis and the verification of declarative <br>\nprograms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transformation and partial evaluation of declarative languages</p>\n</li>\n<li>Language extensions for security and tabulation</li>\n<li>Probabilistic modeling in a declarative language and modeling reactivity</li>\n<li>Memory management and the implementation of declarative systems</li>\n<li>Practical experiences and industrial application</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This year the conference will be co-located with the 24th<br>\nInternational Symposium on Logic-Based Program Synthesis and<br>\nTransformation (LOPSTR 2014).</p>\n<p>The conference will be held in Canterbury, UK. Previous symposia were<br>\nheld at Madrid (Spain), Leuven (Belgium), Odense (Denmark), Hagenberg<br>\n(Austria), Coimbra (Portugal), Valencia (Spain), Wroclaw (Poland),<br>\nVenice (Italy), Lisboa (Portugal), Verona (Italy), Uppsala (Sweden),<br>\nPittsburgh (USA), Florence (Italy), Montreal (Canada), and Paris<br>\n(France). You might have a look at the contents of past PPDP symposia.</p>\n<p>Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in<br>\nEnglish, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been<br>\npublished or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal,<br>\nconference, or workshop with refereed proceedings. Work that already<br>\nappeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings<br>\nmay be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of<br>\nquestions). The proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital<br>\nLibrary.</p>\n<p>After the symposium, a selection of the best papers will be invited to<br>\nextend their submissions in the light of the feedback solicited at the<br>\nsymposium. The papers are expected to include at least 30% extra<br>\nmaterial over and above the PPDP version. Then, after another round of<br>\nreviewing, these revised papers will be published in a journal.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>Abstract Submission:           12 May, 2014<br>\n    Paper submission:               15 May, 2014<br>\n    Notification:               30 June, 2014<br>\n    Camera-ready:               To be announced</p>\n<p>Symposium:                  8-10 September, 2014</p>\n<p>Invites for journal publication:   To be announced<br>\n    Submission of journal version:     To be announced<br>\n    Notification:               To be announced<br>\n    Camera-ready version:          To be announced</p>\n<p>Authors should submit an electronic copy of the full paper in<br>\nPDF. Papers should be submitted to the submission website for PPDP<br>\n2014. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title;<br>\nauthors and their affiliations; abstract; and three to four<br>\nkeywords. The keywords will be used to assist the program committee in<br>\nselecting appropriate reviewers for the paper. Papers should consist<br>\nof the equivalent of 12 pages under the ACM formatting<br>\nguidelines. These guidelines are available online, along with<br>\nformatting templates or style files. Submitted papers will be judged<br>\non the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and<br>\nclarity. They should include a clear identification of what has been<br>\naccomplished and why it is significant. Authors who wish to provide<br>\nadditional material to the reviewers beyond the 12-page limit can do<br>\nso in clearly marked appendices: reviewers are not required to read<br>\nsuch appendices.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Michael Adams        University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA<br>\nElvira Albert        Complutense University of Madrid, Spain<br>\nDariusz Biernacki    University of Wroclaw, Poland<br>\nBernd Brassel        Recordbay, Germany<br>\nMike Codish        Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel<br>\nOlivier Danvy (chair)    Aarhus University, Denmark<br>\nMarc Denecker         KU Leuven, Belgium<br>\nJoshua Dunfield        Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Germany<br>\nZoe Drey        ENSTA Bretagne/Lab-STICC, France<br>\nThibaut Feydy        NICTA, Australia<br>\nDanko Ilik        Inria, France<br>\nYukiyoshi Kameyama    University of Tsukuba, Japan<br>\nChantal Keller        Microsoft Research -- Inria Joint Centre<br>\nTemur Kutsia        RISC, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria<br>\nDan Licata        Wesleyan University, USA<br>\nAkimasa Morihata    University of Tokyo, Japan<br>\nMatthias Puech        McGill University, Canada<br>\nTiark Rompf        Oracle Labs and EPFL, Switzerland<br>\nKristoffer H.
