Either you misspelled it<br>\n(babel)                or the language definition file brazil.ldf was not<br>\nfound</p>\n<p>Thus I have to comment the line that calls this package. It<br>\nworks well with the \"english\" option, though. Besides, I did not had<br>\nthis problem when preparing documents with Isabelle 2013.</p>\n<p>(Makarius), is it possible to  fix this for the next release? if not,<br>\nwhat is the best way to upgrade the latex instalation in<br>\ncygwin? I run cigwin-setup and texlive-collection-basic seems<br>\nto be installed. So I don´t know what is going on here exactly.</p>\n<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Best!</p>",

The<br>\nproblem is  that TexLive in cygwin seems to adopt non<br>\nstandard names for LaTeX packages.
