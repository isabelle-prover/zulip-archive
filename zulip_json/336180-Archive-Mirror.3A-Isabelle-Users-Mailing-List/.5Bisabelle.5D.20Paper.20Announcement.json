Please contact us if you <br>\nhave any comment or suggestion.</p>\n<p>Abstract:  This article presents detailed implementations of quantifier <br>\nelimination for both integer and real linear arithmetic for theorem <br>\nprovers. The underlying algorithms are those by Cooper (for Z) and by <br>\nFerrante and Rackoff (for R). Both algorithms are realized in two <br>\nentirely different ways: once in tactic style, i.e. by a proof-producing <br>\nfunctional program, and once by reflection, i.e. by computations inside <br>\nthe logic rather than in the meta-language. Both formalizations are <br>\ngeneric because they make only minimal assumptions w.r.t. the underlying <br>\nlogical system and theorem prover. An implementation in Isabelle/HOL <br>\nshows that the reflective approach is between one and two orders of <br>\nmagnitude faster.</p>\n<p>Keywords:  Proof synthesis - Reflection - Linear arithmetic</p>",
