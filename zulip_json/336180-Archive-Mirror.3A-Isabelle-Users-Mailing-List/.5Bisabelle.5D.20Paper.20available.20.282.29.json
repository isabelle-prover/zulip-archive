Brucker and Lukas Br√ºgger and Burkhart Wolff.<br>\nModel-based Firewall Conformance Testing. In Testcom/FATES 2008.<br>\nLNCS 5047 Springer-Verlag, 2008.</p>\n<p>Abstract:<br>\nFirewalls are a cornerstone of todays security infrastructure for  <br>\nnetworks. Their configuration, implementing a firewall policy, is  <br>\ninherently complex, hard to understand, and difficult to validate. We  <br>\npresent a substantial case study performed with the model-based  <br>\ntesting tool HOL-TestGen. Based on a formal model of firewalls and  <br>\ntheir policies in HOL, we first present a derived theory for  <br>\nsimplifying policies. We discuss different test plans for test  <br>\nspecifications. Finally, we show how to integrate these issues to a  <br>\ndomain-specific firewall testing tool HOL-TestGen/FW.</p>\n<p>PDF: <a href=\"http://www-wjp.cs.uni-sb.de/publikationen/brucker_TestCom_2008.pdf\">http://www-wjp.cs.uni-sb.de/publikationen/brucker_TestCom_2008.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Comments and Discussions are welcome!</p>\n<p>Burkhart (&amp; Achim &amp; Lukas)</p>",
