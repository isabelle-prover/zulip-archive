We have used HOL-Z to<br>\n   formalize and combine both data-oriented and process-oriented <br>\n   architectural views. Afterwards, we formalized temporal requirements<br>\n   in Z and carried out verification in higher-order logic. The same<br>\n   architecture has been previously verified using the SPIN model<br>\n   checker. Based on this, we provide a detailed comparison of these two<br>\n   different approaches to formalization (infinite state with rich data<br>\n   types versus finite state) and verification (theorem proving versus#<br>\n   model checking). Contrary to common belief, our case study suggests<br>\n   that Z is well suited for temporal reasoning about process models<br>\n   with rich data. Moreover, our comparison highlights the advantages of<br>\n   this approach and provides evidence that, in the hands of experienced<br>\n   users, theorem proving is neither substantially more time-consuming<br>\n   nor more complex than model checking.</p>\n<p>URL:<a href=\"http://kisogawa.inf.ethz.ch/WebBIB/publications/papers/2005/3_fm.pdf\">http://kisogawa.inf.ethz.ch/WebBIB/publications/papers/2005/3_fm.pdf</a></p>\n<p>bu</p>",
