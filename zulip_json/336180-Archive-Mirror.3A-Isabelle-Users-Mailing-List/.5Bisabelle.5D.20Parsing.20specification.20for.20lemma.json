I am trying to find special purpose<br>\nparsers that help with parsing specification for the above lemma.</p>\n<p>I will be thankful  for your advices and suggestions.</p>\n<p>Best regards<br>\nCharmi Panchal</p>",

You just work directly in the <br>\ngiven A.thy file.</p>\n<p>The other notable thing is this: first you use several isolated Parse.term<br>\ninvocations for \"outer syntax\" parsing of string tokens that will be <br>\ninterpreted as terms later.  Then you do the actual \"innter syntax\" <br>\nparsing via Syntax.parse_terms, with simultaneous type-checking of the <br>\ngiven list of items.</p>\n<p>In your sketch above you could probably need Syntx.parse_props, or <br>\nfull-scala Specification.read_specification (which requires a different <br>\nouter syntax parser).</p>\n<p>Makarius<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/DWOn9Rhn1attRPX0QzGzk9Dk/A.thy\">A.thy</a></p>",
