It is not what the tutorial led me to expect.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nRandy</p>",

According to Section 3, function does not <br>\nattempt to prove termination of the defintion like fun does. Hence, you only get <br>\nthe psimps equations. After showing pattern completeness and consistency as <br>\ndescribed in Section 6.1, i.e. \"by pat_completeness auto\", you want to show <br>\ntermination before working with your function. For the example in the tutorial, <br>\nyou need</p>\n<p>termination by lexicographic_order</p>\n<p>Then, you get the simp rules you would expect under the name And2.simps.<br>\nSection 4 of the tutorial explains termination proofs in more detail.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nAndreas</p>\n<p>Randy Pollack schrieb:</p>",
