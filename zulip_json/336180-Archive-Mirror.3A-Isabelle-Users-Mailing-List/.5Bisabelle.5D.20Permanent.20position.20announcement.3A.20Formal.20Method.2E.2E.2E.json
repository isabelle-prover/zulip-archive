We are <br>\nlooking for a young researcher knowing well one or more formal methods <br>\n(and associated tools) to work on applying formal methods to industrial <br>\nsystems and software of Mitsubishi Electric group <br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.mitsubishielectric.com/products/\">http://www.mitsubishielectric.com/products/</a>).</p>\n<p>We are using various formalisms (Deductive Verification, Model Checking, <br>\nRefinement, Abstract Interpretation, ...) applied to very diverse <br>\ndomains (Rail, Factory Automation, Automotive, ...). Mitsubishi Electric <br>\ngroup has a lot of interesting cases to work on and where formal methods <br>\ncould make a real difference!</p>\n<p>Our research is applied to concrete industrial case studies which have <br>\ninteresting research challenges. As we are part of corporate R&amp;D, we <br>\nhave less constraints than business units and make publications and <br>\nprototypes or participate to collaborative research projects like any <br>\nacademic research laboratory. In my view, this is the best of both <br>\nworlds. :-)</p>\n<p>Our laboratory is located in Rennes <br>\n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennes\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennes</a>), France, a not-so-big city very <br>\nnice to live in.</p>\n<p>So if you are a researcher fond of formal methods (and you are because <br>\nyou are reading this message ;-) ) and think they can make a real and <br>\npositive impact on society, join us and help us!</p>\n<p>If you know somebody that could be interested by this position, let <br>\nher/him know, thank you!</p>\n<p>Feel free to publicly or privately ask questions if needed.</p>\n<p>Sincerely yours,<br>\nD.
