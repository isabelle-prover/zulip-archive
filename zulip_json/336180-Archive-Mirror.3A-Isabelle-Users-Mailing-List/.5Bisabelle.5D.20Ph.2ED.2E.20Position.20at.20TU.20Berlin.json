Besides the complexity of <br>\nsuch systems, a particular challenge is to cope with concurrency aspects <br>\nand real-time requirements. A distinguishing feature of the VATES <br>\nproject is that we consider the whole development chain from abstract <br>\nspecifications through source code down to compiler-generated executable <br>\nmachine code. To ensure the correctness of our proofs and to gain a high <br>\ndegree of automatization, the verification is carried out with machine <br>\nassistance, especially model checkers, SAT/SMT-solvers, and mechanical <br>\nprovers (like the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL).</p>\n<p>In the first phase of the VATES project, we developed a novel approach <br>\nthat allows us to formally relate an abstract process-algebraic <br>\nspecification formulated in the timed process calculus Timed CSP with <br>\nits implementation given in the LLVM compiler intermediate <br>\nrepresentation. Using this relation, we are able to verify safety, <br>\nliveness, and timing properties on the level of Timed CSP and transfer <br>\nthem to the level of executable code.</p>\n<p>In the second phase of VATES, we extend our methodology in two <br>\ndirections. First, we aim at supporting the verification of multicore <br>\nsystems, which are more and more used in the context of embedded <br>\nsystems. To this end, we include directives that guide the <br>\ntransformation for multicore target architectures into our methodology <br>\non the specification level. These can then be exploited in subsequent <br>\nverification steps. Second, our methodology is extended such that <br>\nadaptive systems (which dynamically restructure themselves in changing <br>\nenvironments) can be specified, verified, and transformed into <br>\nexecutable, semantically equivalent code.</p>\n<p>As a case study, we use the embedded real-time operating system BOSS, <br>\nwhich was developed by Fraunhofer FIRST (Berlin). It is employed, for <br>\nexample, in satellites, medical applications and an electronic lottery <br>\nsystem. Furthermore, it is well suited for verification purposes because <br>\nof its comparatively simple structure and its relatively small size. In <br>\nthis phase, BOSS is extended to support multicore architectures and to <br>\ndirectly include mechanisms that support adaptivity.
