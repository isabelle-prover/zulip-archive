Multi-threaded applications are prone to subtle bugs,<br>\nsuch as deadlocks and race conditions. These bugs are notoriously<br>\ndifficult to find. Consequently, there is great interest in formal<br>\nverification techniques for concurrent code. The objective of this<br>\nproject is to build a trustworthy framework that supports the<br>\ninteractive and semi-automated verification of programs that utilize<br>\nlow-level concurrency.</p>\n<p>The work will be carried out in the Modeling of Concurrent Computation<br>\nresearch group (<a href=\"http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/mobility\">http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/mobility</a>), which is<br>\npart of the Uppsala Programming for Multicore Architectures Research<br>\nCentre (<a href=\"http://www.it.uu.se/research/upmarc\">http://www.it.uu.se/research/upmarc</a>).</p>\n<p>Qualifications: The candidate should have a Master of Science in<br>\nComputer Science, Computer Engineering or equivalent, ideally with a<br>\nstrong background in logic, formal semantics and concurrent/parallel<br>\nprogramming. Experience with interactive theorem proving (e.g.,<br>\nIsabelle, Coq) is a plus.</p>\n<p>Please see the official announcement at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/join-us/jobs-detail-page/?positionId=46736\">http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/join-us/jobs-detail-page/?positionId=46736</a><br>\nfor further details. Applications close on December 14, 2014.</p>",
