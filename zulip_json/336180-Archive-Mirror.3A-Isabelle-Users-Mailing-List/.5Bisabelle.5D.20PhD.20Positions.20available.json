The chair Modeling and Analysis<br>\nof Information Systems (brief: MAIS) was founded in 2007 as part of<br>\nTheoretical Computer Science. Prof.~Dr.~Heiko Mantel is the scientific<br>\ncoordinator of the DFG priority programme `Reliably Secure Software<br>\nSystems' (brief: RS3).</p>\n<p>In the context of the RS3-Project `Reliable Security for Concurrent<br>\nPrograms', the MAIS group is currently offering</p>\n<p>2 Positions for PhD-Students (Doktorandenstellen).</p>\n<p>Information flow control is the basis for a property-centric and<br>\nsemantically well-founded approach to IT security.<br>\nWhile Information flow security for sequential programs is a non-trivial<br>\nproblem, the conceptual complexity of concurrent systems poses<br>\nadditional challenges and makes it particularly desirable to obtain<br>\nreliable security guarantees.<br>\nThis project addresses the formal assurance of security guarantees for<br>\nconcurrent programs based on declarative information flow properties<br>\nand reliable program analyses. It aims at a novel framework for<br>\nadequately characterising security aspects by noninterference-like<br>\ninformation flow properties as well as for analysing and certifying<br>\nthe security of concurrent programs based on well-founded semantics.</p>\n<p>The detailed job advertisement can be found at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.mais.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/assets/misc/Ausschreibung-RSCP.pdf\">http://www.mais.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/assets/misc/Ausschreibung-RSCP.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Further information about the project can be found at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.mais.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/RS3-RSCP.html\">http://www.mais.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/RS3-RSCP.html</a></p>\n<p>In case of any further questions please contact Prof. Dr. Heiko Mantel<br>\n(<a href=\"mailto:mantel@cs.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de\">mantel@cs.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de</a>).</p>\n<p>Deadline for applications is the 10th of October 2010.<br>\nHowever, we will consider applications until the position is filled.</p>\n<p>TU Darmstadt is an equal opportunities employer and welcomes<br>\napplications from women.
