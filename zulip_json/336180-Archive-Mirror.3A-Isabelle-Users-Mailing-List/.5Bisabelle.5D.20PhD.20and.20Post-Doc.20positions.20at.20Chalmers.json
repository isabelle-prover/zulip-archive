The group's research focus are the theoretical and<br>\npractical aspects of rigorous software analysis and verification,<br>\nincluding techniques such as automated reasoning, interactive theorem<br>\nproving, runtime verification, automated test generation, and program<br>\nsynthesis. In collaboration with other researchers worldwide,<br>\nChalmersâ€™ Formal Methods group developed and maintains verification<br>\ntools such as the CakeML toolchain (<a href=\"https://cakeml.org/\">https://cakeml.org/</a>) and the HOL4<br>\ntheorem proving system (<a href=\"http://hol-theorem-prover.org/\">http://hol-theorem-prover.org/</a>), KeY<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.key-project.org\">http://www.key-project.org</a>), Vampire (<a href=\"http://vprover.org\">http://vprover.org</a>), ALIGATOR<br>\n(<a href=\"http://mtc.epfl.ch/software-tools/Aligator\">http://mtc.epfl.ch/software-tools/Aligator</a>), the Eiffel Verification<br>\nEnvironment (<a href=\"http://se.inf.ethz.ch/research/eve/\">http://se.inf.ethz.ch/research/eve/</a> and<br>\n<a href=\"http://comcom.csail.mit.edu/autoproof/\">http://comcom.csail.mit.edu/autoproof/</a>), and LARVA.</p>\n<p>We are looking for outstanding candidates with interest in pursuing<br>\nresearch in one or more of the following areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Automated program repair</li>\n<li>Functional-correctness verification of software</li>\n<li>Combining heterogeneous verification techniques</li>\n<li>Synthesis of programs and specifications</li>\n<li>Compiler correctness (for e.g. just-in-time compilation)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These positions will be supervised by Prof. Carlo A. Furia (1 PhD<br>\nstudent, research areas 1-4, see <a href=\"http://bugcounting.net\">http://bugcounting.net</a>) and<br>\nProf. Magnus Myreen (1 PhD student and 1 Post-Doctoral researcher,<br>\nresearch areas 2-5, see <a href=\"http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~myreen/\">http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~myreen/</a>).</p>\n<p>1 PhD student position in language-based security</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The PhD students will join a high-profile group of researchers on<br>\nsoftware security with a rich network of collaborators and visibility<br>\nacross several research communities (security, programming languages,<br>\nand systems research). In collaboration with top universitites,<br>\nresearchers at Chalmers have developed some of the state of the art<br>\ntools for protecting users' private data in Haskell programs (e.g.,<br>\nLIO <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lio\">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lio</a>) as well as web browsers<br>\n(COWL <a href=\"http://cowl.ws/\">http://cowl.ws/</a>).</p>\n<p>The position focuses on developing techniques to protect<br>\nconfidentiality and integrity of users' data when manipulated by<br>\nuntrusted code -- a pressing problem for the web as well as mobile<br>\nplatforms. It is expected that the work carried out by the applicant<br>\nranges from establishing new theoretical foundations to deploying<br>\nprototypes in production systems. We are looking for outstanding<br>\ncandidates with background in either programming languages and/or<br>\nsystems research interest in pursuing one or more of the following<br>\ntopics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Combining static and dynamic techniques to secure Haskell programs</li>\n<li>\n<p>Leveraging hardware-level security components (e.g, Intel SGX and<br>\n   ARM TrustZones) to provide security in depth, where private data<br>\n   can be protected from the application level down to the low-level<br>\n   physical layers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Developing domain specific languages to express different kind of<br>\n   security policies</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This position will be supervised by Prof. Alejandro Russo<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/\">http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/</a>).</p>",
