Nowadays, model checking is used by <br>\nmajor companies, like Microsoft and Intel, to improve the <br>\nquality of their products. <br>\n<br>\nThe aim of this project is to develop algorithms for model <br>\nchecking (including probabilistic model checking) that can <br>\nfully exploit the parallelism of the new generations of <br>\nmulti- and many-core processors. The main bottleneck in <br>\npractical applications of model checking is the state <br>\nspace explosion that has impact on the required memory and <br>\nrun-time. Therefore, we will strive towards designing <br>\nefficient algorithms that are compatible with the major<br>\ntechniques for state space reduction, like partial-order or <br>\nsymmetry reduction. <br>\n<br>\nWe intend to develop prototype implementations of the new <br>\nalgorithms In model checkers, like Spin and its <br>\nextensions, as well as the probabilistic model checker <br>\nMRMC. The prototype implementations will be validated on <br>\ncase studies including models of biological systems. <br>\n<br>\nAs PhD Student, you will: <br>\n<br>\n     * perform scientific research; <br>\n     * work on the implementation of (prototype) tools; <br>\n     * present results at international conferences; <br>\n     * publish results in conference proceedings and <br>\nscientific journals; <br>\n     * write a Ph.D. thesis; <br>\n     * participate in activities of the group and of the <br>\ndepartment. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRequirements <br>\n<br>\nWe are looking for a candidate who meets the following <br>\nrequirements: <br>\n<br>\n     * a MSc degree in Computer Science or equivalent; <br>\n     * a solid theoretical background (preferably in model <br>\nchecking or <br>\n       other formal methods); <br>\n     * interest and experience in programming (especially <br>\nexperience in parallel and/or distributed computing will <br>\nbe considered an advantage); <br>\n     * good communication- and writing skills in English. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWorking Environment, Appointment and Salary <br>\n<br>\nThe project will be implemented as cooperation of several <br>\ndepartments and groups. The Software Engineering and <br>\nTechnology group, headed by prof. dr. Mark van den Brand <br>\nat the M&amp;CS department of TU/e, focuses on maintaining <br>\nconsistency between models and code. Also, part of the <br>\nwork within the project will be done in the group of prof. <br>\ndr. Joost-Pieter Katoen at RWTH Aachen University. Prof. <br>\nKatoen has internationally recognized competence in the <br>\nfield of formal specification and verification of <br>\nprobabilistic systems. Biologically inspired case <br>\nstudies will be provided by the Biomodeling and <br>\nBioinformatics group of prof. dr. Peter Hilbers, who is <br>\nalso an expert on parallel algorithms and has an <br>\noutstanding record in applications of parallel computing <br>\nin biology. Most of the tool implementations will be done <br>\nin close collaboration with the Laboratory for Quality <br>\nSoftware at the M&amp;CS at TU/e. <br>\n<br>\nWe offer: <br>\n<br>\n     * a full-time employment for 4 years with an <br>\nintermediate evaluation <br>\n       after 1 year; <br>\n     * a stimulating scientific environment with <br>\ninternational cooperation <br>\n<br>\n     * access to modern equipment (multi- and many-core <br>\nsystems, computer clusters) <br>\n     * a salary of Euro 2,042 per month (gross) in the <br>\nfirst year, <br>\n       increasing to Euro 2,612 per month (gross) in the <br>\nfourth year. <br>\n       Moreover 8% holiday allowance and 8.3 % End-of-year <br>\nbonus is <br>\n       provided annually; <br>\n     * Support with your personal development and career <br>\nplanning; <br>\n     * Attractive secondary labour conditions (including <br>\nexcellent work facilities, child care, sports facilities). <br>\n<br>\nInformation <br>\n<br>\n     * Information about the position: <br>\n       dr.
