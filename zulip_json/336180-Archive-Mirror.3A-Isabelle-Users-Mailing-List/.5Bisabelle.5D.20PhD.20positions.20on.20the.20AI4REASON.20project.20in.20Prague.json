Our motivation is to (i) facilitate<br>\nautomated computer encoding, understanding and large-scale verification of<br>\nmathematics, science, software and hardware designs, and to (ii) research<br>\nAI methods that combine learning and reasoning over large repositories of<br>\ncomplex mathematical knowledge, getting closer to human-level scientific<br>\nthinking.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>machine learning procedures over large proof libraries</li>\n<li>methods that propose useful intermediate lemmas for long proofs</li>\n<li>methods that efficiently apply learned knowledge in proof search</li>\n<li>feedback loops between learning and automated reasoning</li>\n<li>\n<p>statistical and deductive methods for automated formalization of informal<br>\nmathematics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>learning from aligned informal, semiformal and formal corpora</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The work will include close collaboration with several international<br>\npartners: University of Innsbruck, Google Research, University of Miami,<br>\nRadboud University Nijmegen and others.</p>\n<p>Requirements<br>\n============</p>\n<p>You should meet the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A master's degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Mathematics or a<br>\nrelated field, with a strong interest in Machine Learning, AI and/or<br>\nAutomated Reasoning;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Commitment and a cooperative attitude;</p>\n</li>\n<li>Proficiency in written and spoken English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will enroll in the PhD program in Artificial Intelligence at CTU with<br>\nan individual study plan.</p>\n<p>Research Environment<br>\n====================</p>\n<p>The research will take place at the recently established Czech Institute of<br>\nInformatics, Robotics, and Cybernetics (CIIRC) of the Czech Technical<br>\nUniversity (CTU) in Prague, which is with over 1700 members of academic<br>\nstaff one of the largest research institutions in the Czech Republic. CIIRC<br>\nhas been founded by CTU in July 2013 as a research and teaching institute<br>\nand a center of excellence in the Czech Republic.</p>\n<p>CIIRC is the home of the Prague Automated Reasoning Group (<br>\n<a href=\"http://arg.ciirc.cvut.cz/\">http://arg.ciirc.cvut.cz/</a>) - an international research group working on<br>\nvarious aspects of Automated Reasoning, AI and Machine Learning,<br>\nFormalization of Mathematics, and related fields. The group has a large and<br>\nactive network of collaborations around the world. The AI4REASON project<br>\nled by Josef Urban is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) which<br>\ntargets highest-quality investigator-driven frontier research in Europe (<br>\n<a href=\"https://erc.europa.eu/about-erc/mission\">https://erc.europa.eu/about-erc/mission</a>).</p>\n<p>Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic, considered one the most<br>\nbeautiful cities in the world and attracting millions of tourists every<br>\nyear. It has the highest Quality of Living Worldwide ranking among the<br>\neastern European cities and over 160,000 foreign residents. It boasts a<br>\nrich history and culture, long tradition of university education and<br>\nscientific research, and a dynamic economy.  The cost of living in Prague<br>\nis about one half of the living costs in Amsterdam,Paris or Munich.</p>\n<p>Application<br>\n===========</p>\n<p>Inquiries and applications should be sent via email to <a href=\"mailto:Josef.Urban@gmail.com\">Josef.Urban@gmail.com</a><br>\nwith \"AI4REASON PhD\" in the subject. When sending an application please<br>\ninclude your CV together with a brief description of your research<br>\naccomplishments and interests, including the names of two references.</p>\n<p>Deadlines: March 1, 2017, or until the positions are filled. Earlier<br>\napplications are welcome and and early start date is an advantage.</p>",
