To this end,<br>\nseveral analysis techniques will be formalized in the theorem prover<br>\nIsabelle/HOL, with a focus on term rewriting and Haskell.</p>\n<p>For this project, we are looking for an enthusiastic young researcher with a<br>\nbackground in computational logic. Knowledge of automated termination analysis,<br>\ncomplexity analysis, or theorem proving would be an asset.  Candidates with a<br>\nstrong theoretical background in related areas are also encouraged to apply.<br>\nThe PhD-student candidate must have a Master's or equivalent degree.  Knowledge<br>\nof German is not essential.</p>\n<p>The salary is determined by the FWF-funding scheme (3.546,00 EUR monthly <br>\ngross salary for postdocs, and 2.024,90 EUR for PhD-students, cf.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-funding/personnel-costs/\">http://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-funding/personnel-costs/</a>)</p>\n<p>Applications (including a CV, a publication list (only for postdocs), and a<br>\nletter of recommendation) may be emailed to the project leader René Thiemann<br>\n(rene.thiemann at <a href=\"http://uibk.ac.at\">uibk.ac.at</a>) no later than July 6, 2015.</p>\n<p>We plan to make decisions on these position until July 10.</p>\n<p>The preferred starting date is summer or autumn 2015.</p>\n<p>Informal inquiries are also welcome via email.</p>\n<p>The city of Innsbruck is superbly located in the beautiful surroundings of the<br>\nTyrolean Alps. The combination of the Alpine environment and urban life in this<br>\nhistoric town provides a high quality of living. </p>\n<p>Further information is available from the following links:</p>\n<p>START Project:<br>\n<a href=\"http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/research/projects/certifying-termination-and-complexity-proofs-of-pr/\">http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/research/projects/certifying-termination-and-complexity-proofs-of-pr/</a></p>\n<p>Institute of Computer Science:<br>\n<a href=\"http://informatik.uibk.ac.at/\">http://informatik.uibk.ac.at/</a></p>\n<p>University of Innsbruck:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.uibk.ac.at/\">http://www.uibk.ac.at/</a></p>\n<p>City of Innsbruck:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.innsbruck.at/\">http://www.innsbruck.at/</a></p>",
