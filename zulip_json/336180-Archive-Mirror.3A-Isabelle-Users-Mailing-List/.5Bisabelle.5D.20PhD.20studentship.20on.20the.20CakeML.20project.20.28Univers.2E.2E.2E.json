The position is part of the<br>\n\"Building Verified Applications in CakeML\" project funded by the UK Research<br>\nInstitute in Verified Trustworthy Software Systems:<br>\n<a href=\"https://vetss.org.uk/funded-proposals/\">https://vetss.org.uk/funded-proposals/</a>.</p>\n<p>CakeML (<a href=\"https://cakeml.org\">https://cakeml.org</a>) is a formally verified compiler for an ML-like<br>\nprogramming language. The studentship is focussed on techniques for formally<br>\nverifying applications written in the CakeML language. Within the project,<br>\nthere is a wide range of possible topics, ranging from fully automated<br>\nverification to techniques requiring interactive proof, and also from the logic<br>\nand mathematics that underpin verification to the creation of a practical<br>\nverification tool chain.</p>\n<p>The student will be studying in the University of Kent's programming languages<br>\nresearch group which has 13 faculty members, and has notable strengths in<br>\nverification, concurrency, and functional programming. He or she will also work<br>\nwith the broader international CakeML community at Chalmers (Sweden), CMU<br>\n(USA), and Data61 (Australia).</p>\n<p>The position starts in September 2018. Applicants must have, or be about to<br>\ncomplete a degree in Computer Science or Mathematics at the BSc or MSc level.<br>\nThe position is fully funded for 3.5 years for students from the UK/EU.</p>\n<p>Interested candidates should contact me by 21 May, 2018.</p>\n<p>Scott Owens<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~sao\">http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~sao</a></p>",
