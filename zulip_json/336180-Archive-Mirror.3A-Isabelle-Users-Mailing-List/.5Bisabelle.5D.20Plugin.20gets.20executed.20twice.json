This can<br>\nbe reproduced with:</p>\n<p>theory Scratch<br>\n  imports<br>\n    \"$AFP/Coinductive/Coinductive_Nat\"<br>\n    \"$AFP/Constructor_Funs/Constructor_Funs\"<br>\n  begin</p>\n<p>The warning says \"enat already processed\" and is generated by my code<br>\nwhen it is invoked a second time on the same type. I'm not sure why this<br>\nis happening; certainly it shouldn't happen on theory merge.</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nLars</p>",
