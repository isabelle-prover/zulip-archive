PDF format is strongly encouraged.</p>\n<p>Emails will be automatically processed and should have</p>\n<p>'RIF: ES/postdoc'</p>\n<p>as subject.</p>\n<p>The Embedded System Research Unit<br>\n=================================</p>\n<p>The Embedded Systems Unit consists of about 15 persons, including<br>\nresearchers, post-Doc, Ph.D. students, and programmers. The<br>\nUnit carries out research, tool development and technology transfer in<br>\nthe fields of design and verification of embedded systems.</p>\n<p>Current research directions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory, and its application to the<br>\n     verification of hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid<br>\n     systems (Verilog, SystemC, C/C++, StateFlow/Simulink)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal Requirements Analysis based on techniques for temporal logics<br>\n     (consistency checking, vacuity detection, input determinism,<br>\n     cause-effect analysis, realizability and synthesis)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal Safety Analysis, based on the integration of traditional<br>\n     techniques (e.g. Fault-tree analysis, FMEA) with symbolic<br>\n     verification techniques.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The unit develops and maintains several tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>the NuSMV symbolic model checker (<a href=\"http://nusmv.fbk.eu\">http://nusmv.fbk.eu</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the MathSAT SMT solver (<a href=\"http://mathsat.fbk.eu\">http://mathsat.fbk.eu</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the Formal Safety Analysis Platform FSAP (<a href=\"http://fsap.fbk.eu\">http://fsap.fbk.eu</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the Requirements Analysis Tool RAT (<a href=\"http://rat.fbk.eu\">http://rat.fbk.eu</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The unit is currently involved in several research projects, funded by<br>\nthe European Union (FP VI and FP VII), the European Space Agency, the<br>\nEuropean Railway Agency, as well as in industrial technology transfer<br>\nprojects. The projects aim at applying research results to key<br>\napplication domains such as space, avionics, railways, hardware design<br>\nand mobile embedded applications.</p>\n<p>The Embedded Systems Unit is part of Fondazione Bruno Kessler,<br>\nformerly Istituto Trentino di Cultura, a public research institute of<br>\nthe Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy), founded in 1976. The<br>\ninstitute, through its center for the scientific and technological<br>\nresearch, is active in the areas of Information Technology,<br>\nMicrosystems, and Physical Chemistry of Surfaces and<br>\nInterfaces. Today, FBK is an internationally recognized research<br>\ninstitute, collaborating with industries, universities, and public and<br>\nprivate laboratories in Italy and abroad. The institute's applied and<br>\nbasic research activities aim at resolving real-world problems, driven<br>\nby the need for technological innovation in society and industry.</p>\n<p>Location<br>\n========</p>\n<p>Trento is a lively town of about 100.000 inhabitants, located 130 km<br>\nsouth of the border between Italy and Austria. It is well known for<br>\nthe beauty of its mountains and lakes, and it offers the possibility<br>\nto practice a wide range of sports. Trento enjoys a rich cultural and<br>\nhistorical heritage, and it is the ideal starting point for day trips<br>\nto famous towns such as Venice or Verona, as well as to enjoy great<br>\nnaturalistic journeys.
