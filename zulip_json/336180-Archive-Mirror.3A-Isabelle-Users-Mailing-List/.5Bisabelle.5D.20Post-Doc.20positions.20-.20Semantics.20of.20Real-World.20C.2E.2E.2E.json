Our recent work has focussed on the relaxed-memory<br>\nconcurrency that real systems exhibit, including work on the memory<br>\nmodels of multiprocessors (x86, Power, ARM) and of programming<br>\nlanguages (C11/C++11, Java), verified compilation of concurrent<br>\nprogramming languages to multiprocessors, the semantic theory of<br>\nrelaxed-memory concurrency, and the development of tool support for<br>\nsemantics; some details can be found at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/weakmemory/\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/weakmemory/</a>. We now plan to continue<br>\nsome of the above and also to look more broadly at areas where<br>\nrigorous semantics can be applied to the engineering of systems<br>\nsoftware.</p>\n<p>RA:  Salary  27,578-35,938 pa     Reference NR15622<br>\nSRA: Salary  37,012-46,846 pa     Reference NR15612 </p>\n<p>For the RA position you should have a PhD (which should be submitted<br>\nby the start date) or equivalent experience; for the SRA position you<br>\nshould have an appropriate level of postdoctoral experience.  For<br>\neither, a keen interest in developing and applying rigorous semantic<br>\ntechniques for real-world systems is essential, ideally with a strong<br>\nbackground in one or more of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Programming Language Semantics and Type Systems</li>\n<li>Automated Reasoning Tools</li>\n<li>Concurrency</li>\n<li>Program Verification</li>\n<li>Static and Dynamic Analysis</li>\n<li>Operating Systems</li>\n<li>Compilers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The position is funded by the EPRSC grant EP/H005633<br>\n(<a href=\"http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/H005633/1\">http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/H005633/1</a>), led by<br>\nPeter Sewell (<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/</a>), to whom enquiries should<br>\nbe addressed.</p>\n<p>Applications should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a Curriculum Vitae</li>\n<li>\n<p>a brief statement of the particular contribution you would like to<br>\n    make to the project</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a completed form CHRIS6: <a href=\"http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/hr/forms/chris6/\">http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/hr/forms/chris6/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>the names and contact details (postal and e-mail addresses) of<br>\n    two or three referees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start date: as soon as possible. The currently funded project runs<br>\nuntil end 2014.</p>\n<p>Applications should be sent, preferably by email in pdf format, to<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:personnel-admin@cl.cam.ac.uk\">personnel-admin@cl.cam.ac.uk</a>.
