The<br>\nposition is funded by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) in<br>\nthe frame of a research project that is jointly pursued by the RISC<br>\ninstitute, the RISC Software company, and the SecureGUARD company, a<br>\nleading European manufacturer of high-quality integrated security<br>\nsolutions. The PostDoc contract guarantees full employment with a<br>\nyearly gross salary of approx. €48.762,- (net salary approx. €31,034.-)<br>\nwith social and health insurance included. The working place is the<br>\ncastle of Hagenberg near Linz, the site of RISC.</p>\n<p>The project is a continuation of the \"LogicGuard\" project<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.risc.jku.at/projects/LogicGuard\">http://www.risc.jku.at/projects/LogicGuard</a>) which pursues research on<br>\na security solution whose core is a language based on classical<br>\npredicate logic for specifying a property of a stream of messages<br>\ntransmitted over the network. The goal of the former project was to<br>\nautomatically translate such a specification into a program that<br>\nefficiently monitors the network for a violation of the property. The<br>\ncore task of the PostDoc researcher in the new project is to analyze<br>\nthe resource complexity of runtime monitors that were generated from<br>\nlogic specifications to observe traffic in a network; there may be also<br>\nsome corresponding software development involved.</p>\n<p>Potential applications should have</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a PhD in mathematics, computer science, or related area with a<br>\n   formal focus,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a strong background in formal logic, automated theorem proving,<br>\n   program verification, program synthesis, runtime verification, or<br>\n   similar topics,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>good communication skills and fluency in English (German language<br>\n   skills are optional), the ability to work both independently and<br>\n   in a team.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A letter of application including a detailed curriculum vitae, a list<br>\nof publications, copies of (resp. links to) the dissertation and up to<br>\nthree publications, and preferrably letters of recommendation should be<br>\nsent per email as soon as possible, but not later than October 31, 2014<br>\nto</p>\n<p>Wolfgang Schreiner &lt;<a href=\"mailto:Wolfgang.Schreiner@risc.jku.at\">Wolfgang.Schreiner@risc.jku.at</a>&gt;<br>\n   Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC)<br>\n   Johannes Kepler University<br>\n   Altenberger Straße Linz 69, Austria<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.risc.jku.at\">http://www.risc.jku.at</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>+--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\nA.Univ.-Prof. Dipl.-Ing.
