The position can be held for a maximum of 2 years.</p>\n<p>Project: Our goal is to build a framework to accommodate a spectrum of models for parallel programs, parameterized on data types, logics, type system etc. Within this framework we will establish general proof methods and results related to verification methods. We shall implement the framework in an interactive theorem prover, currently Isabelle.</p>\n<p>Environment: The department is described at <a href=\"http://www.it.uu.se\">http://www.it.uu.se</a>. We run several connected large projects, e g <a href=\"http://www.upmarc.se\">http://www.upmarc.se</a>.</p>\n<p>Qualifications required: PhD in Computer Science and documented experience in development of theories of programming. Documented experience in the use of an interactive theorem prover.</p>\n<p>Other qualifications: Experience of theory development for parallel or distributed programs. Experience of Isabelle.</p>\n<p>For further information about the position, please contact Professor Joachim Parrow, e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:Joachim.Parrow@it.uu.se\">Joachim.Parrow@it.uu.se</a>.</p>\n<p>You are welcome to submit your application, including CV and completed list of publications no later than 3 May 2010.
