It has been used to certify the A380<br>\nbackbone. Its mathematical background is based on the (min,plus) dioid,<br>\nand algorithms have been derived and implemented that allow users to<br>\nascertain bounds on network parameters, given hypotheses on the<br>\narrival of packets from the environment. The objective of the<br>\npost-doctoral research will be to contribute to increasing the<br>\nconfidence in the results obtained by applying Network Calculus.<br>\nThe candidate is expected to encode the mathematical theory<br>\nof Network Calculus in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL and to derive<br>\ntheorems underlying the algorithms for network analysis. The results<br>\nwill be validated by instrumenting a Network Calculus analyzer in order<br>\nto produce a trace whose correctness can be certified using Isabelle.</p>\n<p>Preliminary work has already been carried out in order to demonstrate<br>\nthe feasibility of the approach, and the post-doctoral researcher will<br>\nextend and consolidate the existing Isabelle theory. The work will be<br>\ncarried out at ONERA, in partnership with SME Real-Time at Work, and <br>\nINRIA Nancy (Stephan Merz).</p>\n<p>Please do not hesitate to contact Marc Boyer (<a href=\"mailto:Marc.Boyer@onera.fr\">Marc.Boyer@onera.fr</a>) with<br>\nany questions if you are interested in the position.</p>",
