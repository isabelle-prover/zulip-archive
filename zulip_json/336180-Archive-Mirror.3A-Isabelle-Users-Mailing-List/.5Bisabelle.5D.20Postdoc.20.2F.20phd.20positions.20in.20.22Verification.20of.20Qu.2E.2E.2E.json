Similar to what the<br>\nEasyCrypt tool does in classical cryptography. The scope of the project<br>\ncovers everything from the logical foundations, through the development of<br>\ntools, to the verification of real quantum protocols.</p>\n<p>The <em>ideal candidate would have experience in</em>:</p>\n<p>- Semantics<br>\n   - Theorem proving<br>\n   - Verification of classical cryptography<br>\n   - Quantum cryptography<br>\n   - Quantum computation / communication</p>\n<p>Of course, expertise in all those areas is very rare, so candidates who are<br>\nstrong in some of those areas and are interested in the others are<br>\nencouraged to apply!</p>\n<p>Please refer to</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://crypto.cs.ut.ee/Main/PostdocInVerificationOfQuantumCryptography\">http://crypto.cs.ut.ee/Main/PostdocInVerificationOfQuantumCryptography</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://crypto.cs.ut.ee/Main/PhdInVerificationOfQuantumCryptography\">http://crypto.cs.ut.ee/Main/PhdInVerificationOfQuantumCryptography</a></p>\n<p>for more information.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",
