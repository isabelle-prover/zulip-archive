The new compiler's input<br>\nlanguage is to be compatible with the ETIF from above.</p>\n<p>To apply and read more, see the separate job ads:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>KTH: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/f9HheP\">https://goo.gl/f9HheP</a></li>\n<li>Chalmers: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/SB8V3X\">https://goo.gl/SB8V3X</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Application deadline: 28 February, 2019</p>\n<p>Starting date: preferably in the first half of 2019</p>\n<p>Both postdoc positions are for two years.
