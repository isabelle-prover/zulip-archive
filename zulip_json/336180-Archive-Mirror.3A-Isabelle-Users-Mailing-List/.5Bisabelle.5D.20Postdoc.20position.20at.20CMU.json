In particular, the project will be on automatically<br>\nidentifying exploitable bugs in binary code.  This may be of interest<br>\nto people on this mailing list as our techniques are related to<br>\nverification. At a high level, we're developing techniques and tools<br>\nfor scalable symbolic execution of binary code. This involves research<br>\nin program analysis (e.g., type reconstruction for binary code,<br>\nredundancy elimination), verification condition generation, and fast<br>\ndecision procedures.  This postdoc would be very much a hands-on<br>\nopportunity; we're interested not just in theorems but actually<br>\nproducing results that work on real software.</p>\n<p>More information on what we've done so far is available at<br>\n<a href=\"http://security.ece.cmu.edu/aeg\">http://security.ece.cmu.edu/aeg</a>  Interested postdocs should contact me<br>\ndirectly.</p>\n<p>Take care,<br>\n-David</p>",
