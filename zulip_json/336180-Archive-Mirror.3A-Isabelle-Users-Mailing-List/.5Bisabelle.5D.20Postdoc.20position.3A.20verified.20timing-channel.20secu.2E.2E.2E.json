We are seeking somebody<br>\nwith a research background in formal methods and security.</p>\n<p>You will contribute to the development of methods for reasoning about<br>\ntiming channels in verified operating system kernels, applied to the<br>\nseL4 kernel. Your work will also investigate how to extend seL4’s<br>\nexisting proofs of information flow security, which primarily cover<br>\nstorage channels, to also encompass timing channels.</p>\n<p>Further details about the research project are summarised in the<br>\nfollowing position paper:</p>\n<p>[1] Gernot Heiser, Gerwin Klein and Toby Murray.<br>\n\"Can We Prove Time Protection?\" in Proceedings of the<br>\nWorkshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems (HotOS),<br>\npages 23-29, May 2019.<br>\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08338\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08338</a></p>\n<p>The position is for two years in the first instance, based at the<br>\nUniversity of Melbourne under Dr Toby Murray<br>\n(<a href=\"https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/\">https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/</a>).
