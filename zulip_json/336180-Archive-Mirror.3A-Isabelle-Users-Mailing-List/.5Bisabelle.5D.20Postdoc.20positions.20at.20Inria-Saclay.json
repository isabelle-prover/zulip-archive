We are looking for people with a range of interests<br>\nand expertise, ranging from proof theory, linear logic, and the<br>\nlambda-calculus to automated deduction, model checking, and logic and<br>\nfunctional programming.</p>\n<p>To apply for a postdoctoral position, submit the following:</p>\n<p>- A cover letter with (links to) your CV and publication list.<br>\n    Additional material, such as letters of recommendation, will be<br>\n    requested as necessary.</p>\n<p>- Candidates who do not have a PhD at the time of their application<br>\n    should provide their planned defense date and the composition of<br>\n    the thesis committee.</p>\n<p>All inquiries and application material should be sent to Dale Miller<br>\n(dale.miller at <a href=\"http://inria.fr\">inria.fr</a>).
