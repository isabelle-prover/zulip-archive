The available positions are related to several <br>\nongoing projects within the section, all in the general area of formal <br>\nmethods for critical systems.</p>\n<p>The objective of the section’s research program is to develop formal, <br>\nmathematically based methods, models, algorithms, theories, and tools <br>\nsupporting both the construction and analysis of software at different <br>\nlevels of abstraction, from requirements through code. Such methods and <br>\ntools provide vital support for the development of high assurance <br>\nsoftware for systems, such as autonomous systems, security systems and <br>\ndevices, and control software, that must satisfy critical system <br>\nproperties such as safety, timing, fault tolerance, and security. Many <br>\nof the formal-methods-based techniques and tools produced in the <br>\nSection’s past research have been applied to real Navy systems.</p>\n<p>Current research in the section includes:</p>\n<p>Application-Specific Security of Source Code: This project is developing <br>\ntheory, methods, and tools for analyzing source code for <br>\napplication-specific security properties such as data separation, <br>\nabsence of undesirable information flows, nonbypassability of critical <br>\ncode, and proper memory sanitization. The research combines <br>\ntemplate-based specification of security properties with automatic <br>\ngeneration and checking of assertions to verify that code satisfies the <br>\nspecified properties and to detect violations of those properties.</p>\n<p>High Assurance Cyber-Physical Systems:This project is developing new <br>\ntheory, methods, and tools for model-based development of cyber-physical <br>\nsystems.All methods and tools developed in the project will be <br>\ndemonstrated on real systems, which may include unmanned vehicles and <br>\nrobots.</p>\n<p>Applications of Formal Methods in Developing Real Critical Systems:</p>\n<p>(1) Robotics: Formal-methods-based modeling and analysis techniques and <br>\ntools are being applied to critical software components of a robot <br>\ndesigned to service satellites in space. In addition to applying <br>\nwell-established formal analysis methods and tools, new analysis <br>\ntechniques and tools are being developed to provide assurance that the <br>\nrobot behaves safely and functions correctly.</p>\n<p>(2) Secure Systems: Formal analysis methods and tools are being <br>\ndeveloped and applied to critical aspects of a framework for <br>\nself-securing systems.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Program Information and Application Process</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Interested candidates should send a CV and cover letter to Dr. Elizabeth <br>\nLeonard (<a href=\"mailto:elizabeth.leonard@nrl.navy.mil\">elizabeth.leonard@nrl.navy.mil</a>). Please indicate in your email <br>\nthat you are applying for a postdoc position.</p>\n<p>Positions will initially be awarded for one year, but may be extended <br>\nfor up to an additional two years. The stipend level is currently <br>\n$77,490 annually. Start date is flexible.</p>\n<p>Applicants MUST be US Citizens or US Permanent Residents.</p>\n<p>Dual Citizenship: If offered an award, those who hold another <br>\ncitizenship in addition to that of the United States MUST BE PREPARED to <br>\nprovide the following to NRL Security before beginning tenure:<br>\n• A statement expressing your willingness to renounce your dual citizenship<br>\n• Awardees are not permitted to possess a non-US passport while on <br>\ntenure. Awardees must either provide a receipt proving that the foreign <br>\npassport has been relinquished to the consulate, OR must relinquish the <br>\nforeign passport to an NRL Security official.</p>",
