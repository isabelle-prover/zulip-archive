The project's goals<br>\ninclude verifying components of experimental Linux kernels (e.g., Popcorn<br>\nLinux; <a href=\"http://popcornlinux.org/\">http://popcornlinux.org/</a>), compiler backends and run-times (e.g.,<br>\nHydraVM; <a href=\"http://www.hydravm.org/hydra\">http://www.hydravm.org/hydra</a>), and transactional memory<br>\nconcurrency libraries (e.g., Hyflow; <a href=\"http://www.hyflow.org/\">http://www.hyflow.org/</a>), which are<br>\nbeing developed by the group and transitioned into production contexts of<br>\nsponsors.</p>\n<p>Recent computer science/engineering PhD graduates with formal methods<br>\nbackground (e.g., Isabelle/HOL) are sought. The position is for three years<br>\nminimum, with strong possibilities for additional years. For the right<br>\ncandidate, a research faculty position may also be possible. Contact Prof.<br>\nBinoy Ravindran (<a href=\"mailto:binoy@vt.edu\">binoy@vt.edu</a>) with a CV or for any questions.</p>",
