This month alone [2] there have been three threads dedicated<br>\nto discussing various issues relating to formal proof, the use of proof<br>\nassistants in mainstream mathematics, how hard formal verification is for<br>\nthose not well versed in the use of a proof assistant, the Flyspeck<br>\nproject, and so on, and the topic has regularly come up in the past, albeit<br>\nintermittently (see e.g. [3] from two months ago).</p>\n<p>Perhaps those with deep knowledge of proof assistants and their use, many<br>\nof which can be found on this list, but not yet aware of the FOM list,<br>\nwould like to join in the discussion and answer some of the questions and<br>\nchallenges being posed.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nDominic</p>\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://www.cs.nyu.edu/mailman/listinfo/fom\">http://www.cs.nyu.edu/mailman/listinfo/fom</a><br>\n[2]: <a href=\"http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2014-October/thread.html\">http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2014-October/thread.html</a><br>\n[3]: <a href=\"http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2014-August/018057.html\">http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2014-August/018057.html</a></p>",
