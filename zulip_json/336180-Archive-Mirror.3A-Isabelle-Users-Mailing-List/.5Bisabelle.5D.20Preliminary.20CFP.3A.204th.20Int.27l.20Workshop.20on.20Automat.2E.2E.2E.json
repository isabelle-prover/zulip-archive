Nowadays, many companies have diverted their<br>\nWeb   sites   into   interactive,   completely-automated,  Web-based<br>\napplications (such  as  Amazon, on-line banking, or travel agencies)<br>\nwith  a  high complexity that requires appropriate specification and<br>\nverification  techniques and tools. Systematic, formal approaches to<br>\nthe  analysis  and  verification  can  address  the problems of this<br>\nparticular  domain  with  automated  and  reliable  tools  that also<br>\nincorporate semantic aspects.</p>\n<p>We solicit original papers on formal methods and techniques applied<br>\nto Web sites, Web services or Web-based applications, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>rule-based approaches to Web site analysis, certification,<br>\n     specification, verification, and optimization</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>formal models for describing and reasoning about Web sites</p>\n</li>\n<li>model-checking, synthesis and debugging of Web sites</li>\n<li>\n<p>abstract interpretation and program transformation applied<br>\n     to the semantic Web</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>intelligent tutoring and advisory systems for Web specifications<br>\n     authoring</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Web quality and Web metrics</p>\n</li>\n<li>Web usability and accessibility</li>\n<li>Testing and evaluation of Web systems and applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The WWV series provides a forum for researchers from the communities<br>\nof Rule-based programming, Automated Software Engineering, and<br>\nWeb-oriented research to facilitate the cross-fertilization and the<br>\nadvancement of hybrid methods that combine the three areas.</p>\n<p>The previous WWV editions were: WWV'07 (Venice, Italy), WWV'06 <br>\n(Paphos, Cyprus), and WWV'05 (Valencia, Spain).</p>\n<p>LOCATION</p>\n<p>WWV'08 will be held in July in the convention centre of the<br>\nUniversity of Siena, Italy: <a href=\"http://www.unisi.it/santachiara/\">http://www.unisi.it/santachiara/</a></p>\n<p>The workshop will be co-located with WFLP'08:<br>\n<a href=\"http://wflp08.dimi.uniud.it/\">http://wflp08.dimi.uniud.it/</a></p>\n<p>WORKSHOP VENUE</p>\n<p>Siena is one of the nicest city in Italy. The historical centre is<br>\nsituated  on   top of a   hill and   is made of beautiful medieval <br>\nbuildings   and   churches,   all surrounded by ancient walls. The <br>\ncountryside of Siena is worldwide famous for its beauty. The Palio <br>\nof Siena is probably the most famous historical fair in Italy. The <br>\nmost   important event of it is a horse race  of medieval origins, <br>\nwhich is held  in the afternoon of July 2nd  in 'Piazza del Campo' <br>\nin the centre of Siena.
