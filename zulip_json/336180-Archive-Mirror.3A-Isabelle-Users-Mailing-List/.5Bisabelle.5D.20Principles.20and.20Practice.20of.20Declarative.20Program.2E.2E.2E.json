The goal is to<br>\nstimulate research in the use of logical formalisms and methods for analyzing,<br>\nperforming, specifying, and reasoning about computations, including mechanisms<br>\nfor concurrency, security, static analysis, and verification.</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Amal Ahmed                      Northeastern University, USA<br>\nNaoki Kobayashi                 The University of Tokyo, Japan</p>\n<p>Scope</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions are invited on all topics related to declarative programming, from<br>\nprinciples to practice, from foundations to applications. Topics of interest<br>\ninclude, but are not limited to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Language Design: domain-specific languages; interoperability; concurrency,<br>\n    parallelism, and distribution; modules; probabilistic languages; reactive<br>\n    languages; database languages; knowledge representation languages; languages<br>\n    with objects; language extensions for tabulation; metaprogramming.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implementations: abstract machines; interpreters; compilation; compile-time<br>\n    and run-time optimization; memory management.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Foundations: types; logical frameworks; monads and effects; semantics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analysis and Transformation: partial evaluation; abstract interpretation;<br>\n    control flow; data flow; information flow; termination analysis; resource<br>\n    analysis; type inference and type checking; verification; validation;<br>\n    debugging; testing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tools and Applications: programming and proof environments; verification<br>\n    tools; case studies in proof assistants or interactive theorem provers;<br>\n    certification; novel applications of declarative programming inside and<br>\n    outside of CS; declarative programming pearls; practical experience reports<br>\n    and industrial application; education.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The PC chair (Ekaterina Komendanstkaya &lt;<a href=\"mailto:e.komendantskaya@hw.ac.uk\">e.komendantskaya@hw.ac.uk</a>&gt;) will be<br>\nhappy to advise on the appropriateness of a topic.</p>\n<p>Submission Categories</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions can be made in three categories: regular Research Papers, System<br>\nDescriptions, and Experience Reports.</p>\n<p>Submissions of Research Papers must present original research which is<br>\nunpublished and not submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 12 pages ACM style<br>\n2-column (including figures, but excluding bibliography). Work that already<br>\nappeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be<br>\nsubmitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions). Research papers<br>\nwill be judged on originality, significance, correctness, clarity, and<br>\nreadability.</p>\n<p>Submission of System Descriptions must describe a working system whose<br>\ndescription has not been published or submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed<br>\n10 pages and should contain a link to a working system. System Descriptions must<br>\nbe marked as such at the time of submission and will be judged on originality,<br>\nsignificance, usefulness, clarity, and readability.</p>\n<p>Submissions of Experience Reports are meant to help create a body of published,<br>\nrefereed, citable evidence where declarative programming such as functional,<br>\nlogic, answer-set, constraint programming, etc., is used in practice. They must<br>\nnot exceed 5 pages <strong>including references</strong>.  Experience Reports must be marked<br>\nas such at the time of submission and need not report original research results.<br>\nThey will be judged on significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability.</p>\n<p>Supplementary material may be provided in a clearly marked appendix beyond the<br>\nabove-mentioned page limits. Reviewers are not required to study any material<br>\nbeyond the respective page limit.</p>\n<p>Format of a Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For each paper category, you must use the most recent version of the \"Current<br>\nACM Master Template\" which is available at<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template\">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>&gt;. The most recent version<br>\nat the time of writing is 1.48. You must use the LaTeX sigconf proceedings<br>\ntemplate as the conference organizers are unable to process final submissions in<br>\nother formats. In case of problems with the templates, contact ACM's TeX support<br>\nteam at Aptara &lt;<a href=\"mailto:acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com\">acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com</a>&gt;.</p>\n<p>Authors should note ACM's statement on author's rights (<a href=\"http://authors.acm.org/\">http://authors.acm.org/</a>)<br>\nwhich apply to final papers. Submitted papers should meet the requirements of<br>\nACM's plagiarism policy<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy\">http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy</a>).</p>\n<p>Requirements for Publication</p>\n<hr>\n<p>At least one author of each accepted submission will be expected to<br>\nattend and present the work at the conference. The pc chair may retract<br>\na paper that is not presented. The pc chair may also retract a paper if<br>\ncomplaints about the paper's correctness are raised which cannot be<br>\nresolved by the final paper deadline.</p>\n<p>Program Committee Chair</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ekaterina Komendantskaya        Heriot-Watt University, UK</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Henning Basold                  CNRS, ENS de Lyon, France<br>\nJasmin Christian Blanchette     Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands<br>\nMaria Paola Bonacina            University of Verona, Italy<br>\nDmitry Boulytchev               JetBrains, Russia<br>\nWilliam Byrd                    University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA<br>\nOrnela Dardha                   University of Glasgow, UK<br>\nMarco Gaboardi                  University at Buffalo, SUNY, USA<br>\nArie Gurfinkel                  University of Waterloo, Canada<br>\nZhenjiang Hu                    National Institute of Informatics, Japan<br>\nMoa Johansson                   Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden<br>\nNeelakantan Krishnaswami        University of Cambridge, UK<br>\nRalf Lämmel                     University of Koblenz · Landau, Germany<br>\nAnthony Widjaja Lin             University of Oxford, UK</p>\n<p>Christopher Mieklejohn          Carnegie Mellon University, USA<br>\nAart Middeldorp                 University of Innsbruck, Austria<br>\nGopalan Nadathur                University of Minnesota, USA<br>\nKeisuke Nakano                  Tohoku University, Japan<br>\nDominic Orchard                 University of Kent, UK<br>\nAlberto Pardo                   University of the Republic, Uruguay<br>\nAleksy Schubert                 University of Warsaw, Poland<br>\nPeter J.
