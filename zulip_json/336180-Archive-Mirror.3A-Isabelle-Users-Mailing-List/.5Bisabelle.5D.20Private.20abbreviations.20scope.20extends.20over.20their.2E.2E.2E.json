This restricts name space accesses to the local scope, as<br>\n  determined by the enclosing ⬚‹context begin … end› block.

This will open a context based on an<br>\nanonymous locale* that can't be interpreted once you exit it.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you could use a plain locale.</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nLars</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a locale with a random name</li>\n</ul>",
