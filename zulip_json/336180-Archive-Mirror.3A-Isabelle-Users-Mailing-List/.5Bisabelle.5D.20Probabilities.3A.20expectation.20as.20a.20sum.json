I realized I actually needed the<br>\nexpectation of f(X), but the proof is obvious using yours:</p>\n<p>lemma (in prob_space) simp_exp_composed:<br>\n  assumes X: \"simple_distributed M X Px\"<br>\n  shows \"expectation (λa. f (X a)) = (∑x ∈ X`space M. f x * Px x)\"<br>\nusing distributed_integral[OF simple_distributed[OF X], of f]<br>\n  by (simp add: lebesgue_integral_count_space_finite[OF<br>\nsimple_distributed_finite[OF X]] ac_simps)</p>\n<p>I don't think I need to reason on sets that are not finite, as I only<br>\nuse random variables that output symbols taken from a finite set, so<br>\nsimple_distributed should suffice. I have seen that the pmf type could<br>\nhave helped me to manipulate such expressions, but I'm not sure that I<br>\nwould be wise to try to rewrite all that I have done so far using<br>\nsimple_distributed.</p>\n<p>Do you intend on linking simple_distributed and the pmf type, or are<br>\nthey to remain independent definitions?</p>\n<p>Quentin</p>",
