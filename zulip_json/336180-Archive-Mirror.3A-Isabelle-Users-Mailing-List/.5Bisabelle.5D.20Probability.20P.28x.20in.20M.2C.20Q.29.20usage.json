P)\" =&gt; \"CONST measure M {x ∈ CONST space M. P}\"</p>\n<p>but I could not find any well-known rules related to it (e.g.<br>\ninclusion-exclusion:[image: {\\mathbb {P}}(A_{1}\\cup A_{2})={\\mathbb<br>\n{P}}(A_{1})+{\\mathbb {P}}(A_{2})-{\\mathbb {P}}(A_{1}\\cap A_{2}),]), so I<br>\nwould like to know if anything of that kind has been formalised or we<br>\nalways need to go down to the translation form of  𝒫 ( \"CONST measure M {x<br>\n∈ CONST space M. P}\" ) and deal with it by using 'measure' function, hence<br>\nalways proving in the set level, when it comes to proof.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nKawin</p>",
