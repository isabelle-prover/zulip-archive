However, doing the same kind of reasoning<br>\ndirectly without explicitly considering the auxiliary functions, then calling the<br>\nsimplifier led to the above exception.</p>\n<p>The problem occurs in both Isabelle2013-RC2 and in the development version<br>\n(80660c529d74)</p>\n<p>I just want to report this problem, a small theory file is attached.<br>\nI tried to simplify the example as much as possible, but several further <br>\nsimplification which I tried resulted in normal behavior without the exception.</p>\n<p>Kind regards,<br>\nRené<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/2uU8EOywbwpJLGJrR_w8cEGB/Test.thy\">Test.thy</a></p>",
