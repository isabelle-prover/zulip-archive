XEmacs seems to work fine if  <br>\nyou start it on its own; I've downloaded the version, via macports,  <br>\nwhich is suggested on the Isabelle website.  On my old computer, I  <br>\nhad used the fink installer, which installed xemacs in</p>\n<p>/sw/bin</p>\n<p>whereas macports installs it in</p>\n<p>/opt/local/bin</p>\n<p>So, after it didn't work, I created a symlink in /sw/bin, and then  <br>\nrecompiled proofgeneral (I didn't know if this was necessary, but it  <br>\ndidn't seem to harm anything; afterwards it all worked to the same  <br>\nstandard as before, i.e. without XEmacs).  I then tried editing the  <br>\nmakefile that comes with ProofGeneral, but this was less than  <br>\nsuccessful.  Does anyone know if there is a variable in one of the  <br>\nvarious settings files that I can set so that my installation knows  <br>\nwhere XEmacs is?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Peter</p>",

It can't be wise to use Fink and Macports at the same time.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
