[|assoc b1; assoc b2;<br>\npromotable h b1 b2; cata c f b1|] ==&gt; cata (h o c) (h o f) b2\"</p>\n<p>which I want to apply in a different lemma by:<br>\napply(frule_tac h=\"h\" and f=\"f\" and c=\"catafunc f b1\" and b2=\"b2\" in<br>\npromotion_theorem)</p>\n<p>Isabelle says \"No such variable in theorem: ?b2\".<br>\nTrying with<br>\napply(frule_tac h=\"h\" and f=\"f\" and c=\"catafunc f b1\" in promotion_theorem)<br>\ninstead, I see that b2 shows up as ?b2.2.</p>\n<p>I now tried<br>\napply(frule_tac h=\"h\" and f=\"f\" and c=\"catafunc f b1\" and ?b2.2=\"b2\"<br>\nin promotion_theorem)<br>\nbut still no luck.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2011/doc/isar-ref.pdf\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2011/doc/isar-ref.pdf</a><br>\np. 134 it is correct to precede variables with a question mark, if<br>\nthey contain dots.</p>\n<p>My document can be downloaded here:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.imada.sdu.dk/~sorenh07/misc/isabelle/Draft4.thy\">http://www.imada.sdu.dk/~sorenh07/misc/isabelle/Draft4.thy</a><br>\nand is completely self-contained. The error shows up when applying the<br>\nlast statement.</p>\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nSøren Haagerup</p>",

The parsing<br>\nrules have some weird special cases for variable names that end with<br>\ndigits. (See section 3.1 of isar-ref.)</p>\n<p>x, ?x, x0, ?x0, and ?x.0 parse as (\"x\", 0)<br>\nx2, ?x2 and ?x.2 parse as (\"x\", 2)<br>\n?x2.0 parses as (\"x2\", 0)</p>\n<p>In your case, you want to refer to the variable (\"b2\", 0). But the<br>\nname b2 inconveniently refers to (\"b\", 2), so you will have to use the<br>\nadmittedly awkward name ?b2.0 instead.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I think the above parsing rules are quite confusing, and<br>\nshould be changed. I instantiate variables in theorems quite often,<br>\nand many theorems use variable names that end in digits, but I almost<br>\nnever need to refer to variables with indices other than 0. Maybe at<br>\none time, it was more common to refer to indexnames like (\"b\", 2) than<br>\nones like (\"b2\", 0), but this seems outdated now.</p>\n<p>I would propose to simplify the parsing rules to work like this: Any<br>\nvariable name with index 0 can be referred to without a question mark<br>\nor dot, and a dot is always required for indices other than 0.</p>\n<p>x, ?x and ?x.0 parse as (\"x\", 0)<br>\nx0, ?x0 and ?x0.0 parse as (\"x0\", 0)<br>\nx2, ?x2 and ?x2.0 parse as (\"x2\", 0)<br>\n?x.2 parses as (\"x\", 2)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brian</li>\n</ul>",
