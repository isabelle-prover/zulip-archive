By taking away certain features, the text can become sufficiently <br>\ninformative to approximate human readability to some extend.</p>\n<p>Anyway, your above example is probably just based on a misunderstanding <br>\nwhat \"proof\" and \"?thesis\" really mean in Isar.  When you say \"proof\" <br>\nwithout any arguments, the system applies some default refinement to your <br>\nproblem, and then enters a subproof.  So the initial goal is already <br>\nchanged here.</p>\n<p>The \"?thesis\" abbreviation always refers statically to your last claim, <br>\ncf. \"shows\".  After refining that, the abbreviation usually becomes <br>\nuseless (although there can be monotonic refinements where ?thesis remains <br>\napplicable).</p>\n<p>I reckon, you've meant \"proof -\" above, to open a proof block without any <br>\ninitial refinement.  The you can \"show ?thesis\" and everything fits <br>\ntogether as expected.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
