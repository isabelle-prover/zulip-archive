I am  <br>\ntrying to install the program Isabelle in my  Power PC (Mac OS X,  <br>\n10.4.10) but I have some problems. I have managed to run Isabelle but  <br>\nin the X11 window instead of the XEmacs window. At the bottom of the  <br>\nX11 window appears the following message: \"File `/usr/local/ <br>\nProofGeneral/generic/proof-autoloads.elc' was not compiled in Emacs\".  <br>\nI have already installed the XEmacs with the Fink application but it  <br>\nseems not to run properly.</p>\n<p>Do you know where the problem could be? I suppose you are really busy  <br>\nbut if you could give me a hint or help me in anyway I would be  <br>\nreally thankful.</p>\n<p>If you are not the correct person to whom I should write but you know  <br>\nsomeone that could help me, could you please tell me who?</p>\n<p>Thank you very much in advance</p>\n<p>Lidia SÃ¡nchez Gil</p>",
