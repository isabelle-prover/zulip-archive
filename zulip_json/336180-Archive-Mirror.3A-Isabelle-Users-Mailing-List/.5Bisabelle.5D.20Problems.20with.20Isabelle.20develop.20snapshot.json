I left ProofGeneral and Xemacs <br>\nalone, particularly seeing as they seem to be the most recent releases <br>\nanyway.  When I try tp start up Isabelle inside ProofGeneral inside <br>\nXemacs, either by loading a .thy file in Xemacs, or by running Isabelle, <br>\nI get the following error message:</p>\n<p>File mode specification error: (args-out-of-range \"\" 0 -1)</p>\n<p>and Isabelle fails to load.  Does anybody have any idea what the root of <br>\nmy problem is?<br>\n---Elsa</p>",
