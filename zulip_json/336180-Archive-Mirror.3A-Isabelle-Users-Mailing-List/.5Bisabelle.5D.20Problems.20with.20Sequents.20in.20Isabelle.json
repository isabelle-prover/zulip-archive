I'm using XEmacs from the Fink package downloader and  <br>\nIsabelle2005, on a PowerPC mac.  I've compiled the logic Sequents,  <br>\nand once in Proof General switched to using this from the Isabelle -- </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Logics --&gt; Sequents menu option.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following the manual (.../doc/Logics.pdf) I type in \"context LK.thy\"   <br>\nBut then I get the following error messages</p>\n<p>context LK.thy</p>\n<p>***Outer syntax error : name declaration expected but long  <br>\nidentifier \"LK.thy\" was found</p>\n<p>from typing</p>\n<p>context \"LK.thy\"</p>\n<p>***  Could not find theory file \"LK.thy.thy\" in dir(s) \"/Users/pc/ <br>\nIsabelle/Proof Files\", \".\"<br>\n        ***  Theory loader: the error(s) above occurred while  <br>\nexamining theory \"LK.thy\"<br>\n    *** At command \"context\"</p>\n<p>but from typing</p>\n<p>context \"LK\"</p>\n<p>I get the message</p>\n<p>theory LK = (LK)</p>\n<p>Now, again following the example in the Logics manual, if I type the  <br>\nfollowing</p>\n<p>consts A, B :: o;</p>\n<p>I get an error of</p>\n<p>***  Outer Syntax error: keyword \"::\" expected but keyword \",\" was found</p>\n<p>Changing this to</p>\n<p>consts A :: o<br>\n        B :: o;</p>\n<p>Allows it to work.  However, now if I try to prove the simple sequent  <br>\n\" |- A /\\ B --&gt; A\" via the line</p>\n<p>Goal \"|- A /\\ B --&gt; A\";</p>\n<p>I get the error</p>\n<p>***  Outer syntax error: command expected, but identifier \"Goal\" was  <br>\nfound</p>\n<p>Basically, I'm not sure what has gone wrong; I don't think Isabelle  <br>\nis working properly at all.  I also experienced a problem when trying  <br>\nto prove automatically that the sum of the first n squares is (1/6)n(n <br>\n+1)(2n+1), in that Isabelle cannot do it by \"auto\" or any other  <br>\nmethod (this was back in HOL).  The proof of the sum of the first n  <br>\nintegers being (1/2)n(n+1) works fine by induction, and since by hand  <br>\nthe proofs follow the same pattern and are very similar, I assume  <br>\nthat the first n squares proof would be similarly easy.  When I  <br>\nturned on the simplifier trace for this problem to see what was  <br>\nhappening, it did not stop, and one time actually shut down XEmacs  <br>\nand left me looking at a blank X-Term window.</p>\n<p>Any insights anyone could give me would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Many thanks</p>\n<p>Peter Chapman</p>",
