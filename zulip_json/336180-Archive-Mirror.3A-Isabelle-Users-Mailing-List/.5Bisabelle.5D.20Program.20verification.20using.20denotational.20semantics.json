If you are using the axiomatic method, the point is to use the denotational description of a language in order to prove that the axioms hold in that language under certain conditions. We should all be aware that the axioms don't always hold; even the Assignment Axiom doesn't always hold in the presence of side effects. </p>\n<p>Sent from my iPhone</p>",
