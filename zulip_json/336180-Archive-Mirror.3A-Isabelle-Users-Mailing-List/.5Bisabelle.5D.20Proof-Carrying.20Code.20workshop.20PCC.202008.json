Registration is now<br>\nopen, with reduced rates available until 1 June:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/pcc08/#registration\">http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/pcc08/#registration</a></p>\n<p>The workshop addresses theoretical foundations of proof-carrying<br>\ncode as well as practical examples and work on alternative<br>\napplication domains.  See full programme at the workshop website<br>\n<a href=\"http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/pcc08\">http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/pcc08</a></p>\n<p>Proof-carrying code is the use of formal evidence to support the<br>\nstatic analysis of programs: statements about an intrinsic property<br>\nof code behaviour that can be independently checked by any user,<br>\nintermediary or third party.  These manifest guarantees mean that<br>\nPCC raises trust in the code itself, distinct from and complementary<br>\nto any existing trust in the creator of the code, the process used<br>\nto produce it, or its distributor.</p>\n<p>Ian Stark and David Aspinall<br>\nSchool of Informatics<br>\nThe University of Edinburgh<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:pcc08@easychair.org\">pcc08@easychair.org</a></p>",
