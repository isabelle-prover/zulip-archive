On 31-Oct-2014 the last remains of the old TTY<br>\nloop have been removed. See also<br>\n<a href=\"http://sketis.net/2014/discontinuation-of-isabelle-proof-general\">http://sketis.net/2014/discontinuation-of-isabelle-proof-general</a> --<br>\nespecially the closing remark:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It should be noted that the general PIDE protocol infrastructure is sufficiently flexibile to support old-fashioned stepping through proof scripts as well, maybe even with some Emacs front-end. So Proof General veterans who do care enough about that may assemble at the proofgeneral-devel mailing list to prove that this old warrior is not-quite-dead yet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>People who are still interested in Emacs have now a last chance to join<br>\n<a href=\"http://lists.inf.ed.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/proofgeneral-devel\">http://lists.inf.ed.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/proofgeneral-devel</a> before all<br>\nold provers are removed, and Proof General becomes a Coq-only front-end.</p>\n<p>I actually support that move: there is no point to keep obsolete prover<br>\ninterfaces and prevent renovation of Proof General for the Coq-8.5<br>\nprover interaction protocol.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
