It seems like you see a <br>\nlow-level XEmacs crash maybe caused by using old binaries with the newer <br>\ndistribution.  You could try rebuilding from the source on FC6 --- <br>\nplease let us know how you get on if so.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the beta-stamped version of XEmacs that FC6 has thrust on <br>\nus can be made to work with the current CVS/development version of PG <br>\n(which should still supports Isabelle 2005 in Isar mode), but you may <br>\nhit nasty errors with X-Symbol/character encodings if you start it with <br>\nthe \"Isabelle\" script.  At least, this is what I see using Isabelle CVS, <br>\nI'm not sure about Isabelle2005.  Starting XEmacs first avoids some of <br>\nthis (see ProofGeneral/INSTALL) but may not set the environment <br>\nvariables exactly the way that Isabelle likes them -- and leaves odd <br>\ncharacters in the output.  I hope to fix this last problem soon.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry for these troubles, but maintaining forward and backward <br>\ncompatibility across Emacs and prover versions is near impossible, we do <br>\nthe best we can.</p>\n<p>- David.</p>\n<p>Gergely Buday wrote:</p>",
