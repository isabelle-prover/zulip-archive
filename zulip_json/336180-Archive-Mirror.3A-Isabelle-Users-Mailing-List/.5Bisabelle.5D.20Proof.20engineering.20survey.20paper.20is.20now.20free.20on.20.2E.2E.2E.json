Good news! We've made<br>\nour proof engineering survey paper \"QED at Large: A Survey of Engineering<br>\nof Formally Verified Software\" available for free on arXiv. You can find it<br>\nat this link &lt;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06458\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06458</a>&gt;.</p>\n<p>It's over 120 pages without citations, so it should keep you occupied for a<br>\nbit. If you're not quite sure where to start, check out our Q&amp;A and reading<br>\nguide<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://taliasplse.wordpress.com/2019/09/14/proof-engineering-survey-paper-qed-a/\">https://taliasplse.wordpress.com/2019/09/14/proof-engineering-survey-paper-qed-a/</a>&gt;<br>\n.</p>\n<p>Of course, be sure to check the errata<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://proofengineering.org/qed_errata.html\">https://proofengineering.org/qed_errata.html</a>&gt; for the mistakes and<br>\nomissions we've identified and corrected since the original publication.<br>\nInstructions for suggesting new corrections and omissions are on the errata<br>\nwebsite. The version above has the same content as the journal version. We<br>\ndo plan to integrate corrections from the errata at some point for later<br>\nversions.</p>\n<p>Stay healthy and enjoy the read! Thanks again to everyone who gave us<br>\nfeedback while we were working on the original version, and to everyone who<br>\nhas given us feedback for our errata!</p>\n<p>Talia</p>",
