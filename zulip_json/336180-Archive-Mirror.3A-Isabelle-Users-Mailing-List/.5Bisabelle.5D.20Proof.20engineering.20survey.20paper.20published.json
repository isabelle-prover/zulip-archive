QED at Large: A Survey of Engineering of Formally Verified<br>\nSoftware. &lt;<a href=\"https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/PGL-045\">https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/PGL-045</a>&gt;<br>\nFoundations and Trends in Programming Languages (FTPL), Vol. 5: No. 2-3, pp<br>\n102-281, September 2019.</p>\n<p>The article is available for free download at the URL above until around<br>\nSeptember 10, 2019.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Many of you helped us ensure adequate and accurate coverage of Isabelle for<br>\nthis survey. Most of the authors are coming from the Coq community, so this<br>\nhelp was crucial. We hope that this helps the community in return. We<br>\nappreciate your help, and we welcome further feedback.</p>\n<p>If you find any errors not already documented in our errata<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://proofengineering.org/qed_errata.html\">https://proofengineering.org/qed_errata.html</a>&gt;, please report them as a<br>\nGitHub issue<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/proofengineering/proofengineering.github.io/issues\">https://github.com/proofengineering/proofengineering.github.io/issues</a>&gt;.<br>\nOmissions are also welcome, as are questions about confusing text.</p>\n<p>And of course, thank you to everyone who helped make this possible.</p>\n<p>Talia, Karl, Ilya, Milos, and Zach</p>",
