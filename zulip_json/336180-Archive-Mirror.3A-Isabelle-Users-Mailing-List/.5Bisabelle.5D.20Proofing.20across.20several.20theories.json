For example, given two theories a.thy and b.thy, can a goal like<br>\n\\exists t:T, q:Q.t -&gt; q in a.thy and \\exists t:T, p:P. t -&gt; p, where T and P<br>\nare types, be proven. Here, I want T to be the same in both theories. Can<br>\nthis information be passed from one theory to another? If so, since a.thy<br>\nand b.thy are separate, can they be inconsistent with each other?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>S</p>",
