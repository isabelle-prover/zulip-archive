At first it's okay, if this field isn't the <br>\nsmallest field with that property.<br>\nI'm using the HOL/Algebra library (and version Isabelle2013-1) and have <br>\nalready proved several useful lemmas. I defined term \"field extension\" <br>\nthis way</p>\n<p>locale field_extension =<br>\nfixes L::\"('a, 'n) ring_scheme\" (structure) and K::\"('b, 'm) ring_scheme\"<br>\nand iota::\"'b =&gt; 'a\"<br>\nassumes field_L[intro, simp]: \"field L\"<br>\nand field_K[intro, simp]: \"field K\"<br>\nand hom[intro, simp]: \"iota ? ring_hom K L\"</p>\n<p>furthermore I could prove this theorem</p>\n<p>theorem extension_with_zero:<br>\nfixes K::\"'b ring\" and p<br>\nassumes \"field K\"<br>\nand \"p ? carrier (UP K)\"<br>\nand \"deg K p ~= 0\"<br>\nshows \"?(L?(nat ? 'b) set ring). ?iota. ?x ? carrier L. field_extension <br>\nL K ? ? eval K L iota x p = zero L\"</p>\n<p>That shows that you can find a field in which the polynomial has at <br>\nleast one root. Next you could use long division to reduce the <br>\npolynomial and repeat the process until you have a field which contains <br>\nevery root of the polynomial. That would be a solution...</p>\n<p>Now the problem:<br>\nIsabelle forces me to specify the type of the object which existence I <br>\nwant to show. Unfortunately the field I get from the theorem from above <br>\nhas another \"bigger\" type than the field I'm starting with. If you want <br>\nto repeat the process you had to know the number of repetitions you <br>\nmake, but that varies with the polynomial.</p>\n<p>Has anyone an idea or a solution?</p>\n<p>Best wishes<br>\nMarkus</p>\n<p>and a happy new year :-)</p>",
