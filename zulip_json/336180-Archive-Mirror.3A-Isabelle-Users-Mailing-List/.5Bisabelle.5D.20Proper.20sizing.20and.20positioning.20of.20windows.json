I'm afraid that in the  <br>\ncurrent version of Proof General there isn't an easy way to set  <br>\npositions and sizes of the multiple windows independently.  If you  <br>\nare using XEmacs you could try editing proof-multiframe-parameters in  <br>\ngeneric/pg-response.el to add a default height parameter.  (My  <br>\nversion of GNU Emacs produces windows of a useful height, they only  <br>\nneed a quick rearrangement on the screen which I don't find too  <br>\ntroublesome).</p>\n<p>I had hoped to support an automatic saving of positions and sizes  <br>\nfrom session to session but didn't manage to complete the code: Emacs  <br>\nmanagement of windows is a real pain.  Patches from users to improve  <br>\nthis (or any other) aspect of PG are of course welcome!</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>- David.</p>",
