While I've tried to search a little through the mailing list for related questions, I had trouble because I'm looking for something involving three common keywords in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>Essentially I've got a proposition which I can use the \"value\" command to evaluate as True, in the form of a proposition. However, when I try making this into a lemma of the same form, I seem to be unable to prove it using any of the proof methods I'm aware of. What approaches does value use to evaluate its argument, and can I apply those methods via apply in proof mode too? Otherwise, could you point me toward what assumption I might be making that could be incorrect? I've also tried nitpick, which showed no counterexamples to this proposition.</p>\n<p>value \"(circ1 [False, False] [x, y] 2) ≡ [False, False, False]\"<br>\nlemma \"(circ1 [False, False] [x, y] 2) ≡ [False, False, False]\"</p>\n<p>I'm probably just making a ridiculous rookie error, so any help here would be much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nJonathan</p>",
