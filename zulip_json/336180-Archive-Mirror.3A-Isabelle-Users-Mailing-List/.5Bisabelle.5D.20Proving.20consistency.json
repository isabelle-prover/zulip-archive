For example,<br>\nfor the following simple setup:</p>\n<p>locale A =<br>\nfixes a :: real<br>\nand b :: real<br>\nassumes ax1: \"a &gt; 0 &amp; b &gt; 0\"<br>\nand ax2: \"a + b &gt; 0\"</p>\n<p>What is the theorem for proving that A is consistent? On paper, I'd<br>\nlike to show that I can't prove False from A, but how can that be done<br>\nin practice?</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance,</p>\n<p>John</p>",
