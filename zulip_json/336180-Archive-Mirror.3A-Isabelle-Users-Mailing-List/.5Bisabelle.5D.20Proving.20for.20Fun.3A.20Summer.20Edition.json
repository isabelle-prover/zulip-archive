This<br>\nmeans you can now submit your solutions in both Isabelle and Coq. The<br>\ncontest is open starting now until 9 August 2019.</p>\n<p>This also serves as a warmup for the \"Proof Ground\" workshop [1], which<br>\nwill take place in September alongside the ITP conference in Portland. The<br>\ngoal of the workshop is to bring together researchers from the ITP<br>\ncommunity, to discuss and compete in a \"proving contest\", and it will use<br>\nthe Proving for Fun platform. If you happen to have ideas for interesting<br>\ntasks, please consider submitting them following our \"Call for Problems\".</p>\n<p>We believe our problems should be stimulating as a fun summer activity! We<br>\nalso encourage you to participate and give us feedback on the prototype<br>\nsystem.</p>\n<p>Happy proving,<br>\nArmaël Guéneau<br>\nMax Haslbeck<br>\nSimon Wimmer</p>",
