Machine-checkable proofs have been proposed for<br>\napplications like proof-carrying code and certified compilation, as<br>\nwell as for exchanging knowledge between different automated reasoning<br>\nsystems.  For example, interactive theorem provers can import results<br>\nfrom otherwise untrusted high-performance solvers, by means of proofs<br>\nthe solvers produce.  In such situations, one automated reasoning tool<br>\ncan make use of the results of another, without having to trust that<br>\nthe second tool is sound.  It is only necessary to be able to<br>\nreconstruct a proof that the first tool will accept, in order to<br>\nimport the result without increasing the size of the trusted computing<br>\nbase.</p>\n<p>This simple idea of proof exchange for theorem proving becomes quite<br>\ncomplicated under the real-world constraints of highly complex and<br>\nheterogeneous proof producers and proof consumers.  For example, even<br>\nthe issue of a standard proof format for a single class of solvers,<br>\nlike SMT solvers, is quite difficult to address, as different solvers<br>\nuse different inference systems.  It may be quite challenging, from an<br>\nengineering and possibly also theoretical point of view, to fit these<br>\ninto a single standard format.  Emerging work from several groups<br>\nproposes standard meta-languages or parametrized formats to achieve<br>\nflexibility while retaining a universal proof language.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of proof<br>\nexchange among automated reasoning tools.  More specifically, some<br>\nsuggested topics are:</p>\n<p>-- proposed proof formats for different classes of logic solvers (SAT,<br>\n   SMT, QBF, First-Order ATP, Higher-Order ATP, Rewriting, etc.).</p>\n<p>-- meta-languages and logical frameworks for proofs, particularly <br>\n   proof systems designed for solvers.</p>\n<p>-- proof checking tools and algorithms.</p>\n<p>-- proof translation and methods for importing proofs, including proof<br>\n   replaying or reconstruction.</p>\n<p>-- tools and case studies related to analyzing proofs produced by<br>\n   solvers, and proof metrics.</p>\n<p>-- applications relying on importing proofs from automated theorem<br>\n   provers, such as certified static analysis, proof-carrying code, or<br>\n   certified compilation.</p>\n<p>-- data structures and algorithms for improved proof production in<br>\n   solvers (for example, more time- or memory-efficient ways of<br>\n   representing proofs).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions</p>\n<p>Submitted papers must fall into one of the following two categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Short papers: up to 6 pages, work in progress, experience reports, <br>\n  tool presentations or position statements</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Regular papers: 12-15 pages, research papers</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will<br>\nselect a balanced program of high-quality contributions. <br>\nShort submissions that could stimulate fruitful discussion at the<br>\nworkshop are particularly welcome.</p>\n<p>Submissions should be in standard-conforming Postscript or PDF.  Final<br>\nversions should be prepared in LaTeX using the easychair.cls class<br>\nfile.</p>\n<p>To submit a paper, go to the EasyChair PxTP page<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pxtp2012\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pxtp2012</a> <br>\nand follow the instructions there.</p>\n<p>PxTP will have no formal proceedings, but we intend to provide<br>\nelectronic proceedings on the CEUR-WS website.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Important dates</p>\n<p>Submission of papers: April 2nd, 2012 <br>\nNotification: May 7th, 2012<br>\nCamera-ready versions due: May 21th, 2012 <br>\nWorkshop: June 30th, 2012</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Jasmin Blanchette, Technische Universität München, Germany<br>\nPascal Fontaine, University of Nancy, France<br>\nJohn Harrison, Intel Corporation, USA<br>\nLeonardo de Moura, Microsoft Research, USA<br>\nDavid Pichardie (co-chair), INRIA Rennes, France<br>\nAaron Stump, The University of Iowa, USA<br>\nGeoff Sutcliffe, University of Miami, USA<br>\nLaurent Théry, INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, France<br>\nAllen Van Gelder, University of California at Santa Cruz, USA<br>\nTjark Weber (co-chair), Uppsala University, Sweden</p>\n<hr>",
