In recent years,<br>\n  cooperation of such tools in larger verification environments has<br>\n  demonstrated the potential to reduce the amount of manual intervention.<br>\n  Examples include the Sledgehammer tool providing an interface between<br>\n  Isabelle and (untrusted) automated provers, and also collaboration of<br>\n  the HOL Light and Isabelle systems in the formal proof of the Kepler<br>\n  conjecture.</p>\n<p>Cooperation between reasoning systems relies on availability of<br>\n  theoretical formalisms and practical tools to exchange problems,<br>\n  proofs, and models. The PxTP workshop strives to encourage such<br>\n  cooperation by inviting contributions on suitable integration,<br>\n  translation and communication methods, standards, protocols,<br>\n  and programming interfaces. The workshop welcomes the interested<br>\n  developers of automated and interactive theorem proving tools,<br>\n  developers of combined systems, developers and users of translation<br>\n  tools and interfaces, and producers of standards and protocols.<br>\n  We are interested both in success stories and in descriptions<br>\n  of the current bottlenecks and proposals for improvement.</p>\n<p><em>## Topics</em></p>\n<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of<br>\n  cooperation between reasoning tools, whether automatic or<br>\n  interactive. More specifically, some suggested topics are:</p>\n<p>* applications that integrate reasoning tools (ideally<br>\n    with certification of the result);</p>\n<p>* interoperability of reasoning systems;</p>\n<p>* translations between logics, proof systems, models;</p>\n<p>* distribution of proof obligations among heterogeneous<br>\n    reasoning tools;</p>\n<p>* algorithms and tools for checking and importing (replaying,<br>\n    reconstructing) proofs;</p>\n<p>* proposed formats for expressing problems and solutions for<br>\n    different classes of logic solvers (SAT, SMT, QBF, first-order<br>\n    logic, higher-order logic, typed logic, rewriting, etc.);</p>\n<p>* meta-languages, logical frameworks, communication methods,<br>\n    standards, protocols, and APIs related to problems, proofs,<br>\n    and models;</p>\n<p>* comparison, refactoring, transformation, migration,<br>\n    compression and optimization of proofs;</p>\n<p>* data structures and algorithms for improved proof production in<br>\n    solvers (e.g. efficient proof representations);</p>\n<p>* (universal) libraries, corpora and benchmarks of proofs and theories;</p>\n<p>* alignment of diverse logics, concepts and theories across systems <br>\nand libraries;</p>\n<p>* engineering aspects of proofs<br>\n    (e.g. granularity, flexiformality, persistence over time);</p>\n<p>* proof certificates;</p>\n<p>* proof checking;</p>\n<p>* mining of (mathematical) information from proofs<br>\n    (e.g. quantifier instantiations, unsat cores, interpolants, ...);</p>\n<p>* reverse engineering and understanding of formal proofs;</p>\n<p>* universality of proofs;</p>\n<p>* origins and kinds of proofs<br>\n    (e.g. (in)formal, automatically generated, interactive, ...)</p>\n<p>* Hilbert's 24th Problem (i.e. what makes a proof better than another?);</p>\n<p>* social aspects (e.g. community-wide initiatives related to proofs,<br>\n    cooperation between communities, the future of (formal) proofs);</p>\n<p>* applications relying on importing proofs from automatic theorem<br>\n    provers, such as certified static analysis, proof-carrying code,<br>\n    or certified compilation;</p>\n<p>* application-oriented proof theory;</p>\n<p>* practical experiences, case studies, feasibility studies;</p>\n<p><em>## Submissions</em></p>\n<p>Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either<br>\n  an extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15<br>\n  pages). Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which<br>\n  will select a balanced program of high-quality contributions. Short<br>\n  submissions that could stimulate fruitful discussion at the workshop<br>\n  are particularly welcome. We expect that one author of every accepted<br>\n  paper will present their work at the workshop.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers should describe previously unpublished work, and must<br>\n  be prepared using the LaTeX EPTCS class (<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org/\">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>).<br>\n  Papers will be submitted via EasyChair, at the PxTP'2017 workshop page<br>\n  (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference.cgi?a=12750890;welcome=1;conf=pxtp2017\">https://easychair.org/my/conference.cgi?a=12750890;welcome=1;conf=pxtp2017</a>).<br>\n  Accepted regular papers will appear in an EPTCS volume.</p>\n<p><em>## Important Dates</em></p>\n<p>* Abstract submission: Monday, 12 June 2017<br>\n  * Paper submission: Monday, 19 June 2017<br>\n  * Notification: Friday, 7 July 2017<br>\n  * Camera ready versions due: Friday, 21 July 2017<br>\n  * Workshop: 23-24 September 2017</p>\n<p><em>## Invited Speakers</em></p>\n<p>* Gilles Dowek (INRIA)<br>\n  * Cesare Tinelli (The University of Iowa)</p>\n<p><em>## Program Committee</em></p>\n<p>* Catherine Dubois (ENSIIE-Samovar), co-chair<br>\n  * Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo, co-chair</p>\n<p>* Christoph Benzmüller (Freie Universität Berlin)<br>\n  * Jasmin Christian Blanchette (INRIA Nancy &amp; LORIA)<br>\n  * Hans De Nivelle (Institute of Computer Science, University of Wroclaw)<br>\n  * Pascal Fontaine (Loria, INRIA, University of Lorraine)<br>\n  * Stéphane Graham-Lengrand (CNRS - INRIA - Ecole Polytechnique)<br>\n  * Hugo Herbelin (INRIA)<br>\n  * Olivier Hermant (MINES ParisTech)<br>\n  * Cezary Kaliszyk (University of Innsbruck)<br>\n  * Guy Katz (Stanford University)<br>\n  * Chantal Keller (LRI, Université Paris-Sud)<br>\n  * Tomer Libal (INRIA)<br>\n  * Mariano Moscato (National Institute of Aerospace)<br>\n  * Vivek Nigam (Universidade Federal da Paraíba)<br>\n  * Andrei Paskevich (Université Paris-Sud, LRI)<br>\n  * Florian Rabe (Jacobs University Bremen)<br>\n  * Andrew Reynolds (University of Iowa)<br>\n  * Stephan Schulz (DHBW Stuttgart)<br>\n  * Geoff Sutcliffe (University of Miami)<br>\n  * Josef Urban (Czech Technical University in Prague)<br>\n  * Tjark Weber (Uppsala University)<br>\n  * Akihisa Yamada (University of Innsbruck)</p>\n<p><em>## Previous PxTP Editions</em></p>\n<p>* PxTP 2011 (<a href=\"http://pxtp2011.loria.fr/\">http://pxtp2011.loria.fr/</a>), affiliated to CADE-23<br>\n  * PxTP 2012 (<a href=\"http://pxtp2012.inria.fr/\">http://pxtp2012.inria.fr/</a>), affiliated to IJCAR 2012<br>\n  * PxTP 2013 (<a href=\"http://www.cs.ru.nl/pxtp13/\">http://www.cs.ru.nl/pxtp13/</a>), affiliated to CADE-24<br>\n  * PxTP 2015 (<a href=\"http://pxtp15.lri.fr/\">http://pxtp15.lri.fr/</a>), affiliated to CADE-25</p>",
