In recent years, cooperation of<br>\n  such tools in larger verification environments has demonstrated the potential<br>\n  to reduce the amount of manual intervention.  Examples include the<br>\n  Sledgehammer tool providing an interface between Isabelle and (untrusted)<br>\n  automated provers, and collaboration of the HOL Light and Isabelle systems in<br>\n  the formal proof of the Kepler conjecture.</p>\n<p>Cooperation between reasoning systems relies on availability of theoretical<br>\n  formalisms and practical tools for exchanging problems, proofs, and<br>\n  models. The PxTP workshop strives to encourage such cooperation by inviting<br>\n  contributions on suitable integration, translation, and communication methods,<br>\n  standards, protocols, and programming interfaces. The workshop welcomes<br>\n  developers of automated and interactive theorem proving tools, developers of<br>\n  combined systems, developers and users of translation tools and interfaces,<br>\n  and producers of standards and protocols.  We are interested both in success<br>\n  stories and descriptions of current bottlenecks and proposals for improvement.</p>\n<h2>Topics</h2>\n<p>Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of cooperation<br>\n  between reasoning tools, whether automatic or interactive. More specifically,<br>\n  some suggested topics are:</p>\n<p>* applications that integrate reasoning tools (ideally with certification of<br>\n    the result);</p>\n<p>* interoperability of reasoning systems;<br>\n  * translations between logics, proof systems, models;<br>\n  * distribution of proof obligations among heterogeneous reasoning tools;<br>\n  * algorithms and tools for checking and importing (replaying, reconstructing)<br>\n    proofs;</p>\n<p>* proposed formats for expressing problems and solutions for different classes<br>\n    of logic solvers (SAT, SMT, QBF, first-order logic, higher-order logic,<br>\n    typed logic, rewriting, etc.);</p>\n<p>* meta-languages, logical frameworks, communication methods, standards,<br>\n    protocols, and APIs related to problems, proofs, and models;</p>\n<p>* comparison, refactoring, transformation, migration, compression and<br>\n    optimization of proofs;</p>\n<p>* data structures and algorithms for improved proof production in<br>\n    solvers (e.g., efficient proof representations);</p>\n<p>* (universal) libraries, corpora and benchmarks of proofs and theories;<br>\n  * alignment of diverse logics, concepts and theories across systems and<br>\n    libraries;</p>\n<p>* engineering aspects of proofs<br>\n    (e.g., granularity, flexiformality, persistence over time);</p>\n<p>* proof certificates;<br>\n  * proof checking;<br>\n  * mining of (mathematical) information from proofs<br>\n    (e.g., quantifier instantiations, unsat cores, interpolants, ...);</p>\n<p>* reverse engineering and understanding of formal proofs;<br>\n  * universality of proofs<br>\n    (i.e. interoperability of proofs between different proof calculi);</p>\n<p>* origins and kinds of proofs<br>\n    (e.g., (in)formal, automatically generated, interactive, ...)</p>\n<p>* Hilbert's 24th Problem (i.e. what makes a proof better than another?);<br>\n  * social aspects (e.g., community-wide initiatives related to proofs,<br>\n    cooperation between communities, the future of (formal) proofs);</p>\n<p>* applications relying on importing proofs from automatic theorem provers,<br>\n    such as certified static analysis, proof-carrying code, or certified<br>\n    compilation;</p>\n<p>* application-oriented proof theory;<br>\n  * practical experiences, case studies, feasibility studies.</p>\n<h2>Submissions</h2>\n<p>Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either an<br>\n  extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15 pages).<br>\n  Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will select a<br>\n  balanced program of high-quality contributions. Short submissions that could<br>\n  stimulate fruitful discussion at the workshop are particularly welcome. We<br>\n  expect that one author of every accepted paper will present their work at the<br>\n  workshop.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers should describe previously unpublished work, and must<br>\n  be prepared using the LaTeX EPTCS class (<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org/\">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>).<br>\n  Papers will be submitted via EasyChair, at the PxTP'2019 workshop page<br>\n  (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pxtp2019\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pxtp2019</a>).<br>\n  Accepted regular papers will appear in an EPTCS volume.</p>\n<h2>Important Dates</h2>\n<p>* Abstract submission: May 12, 2019<br>\n  * Paper submission: May 19, 2019<br>\n  * Notification: June 21, 2019<br>\n  * Camera ready versions due: July 14, 2019<br>\n  * Workshop: 25-26 August 2019</p>\n<h2>Invited Speakers</h2>\n<p>TBA</p>\n<h2>Program Committee</h2>\n<p>* Haniel Barbosa (University of Iowa), co-chair<br>\n  * Giselle Reis (Carnegie Mellon University), co-chair</p>\n<p>* Roberto Blanco, Inria, France<br>\n  * Frédéric Blanqui, Inria, France<br>\n  * Simon Cruanes, Aesthetic Integration, USA<br>\n  * Catherine Dubois, ENSIIE, France<br>\n  * Amy Felty, University of Ottawa, Canada<br>\n  * Mathias Fleury, Max-Planck-Institut für Informatik, Germany<br>\n  * Stéphane Graham-Lengrand, SRI, USA<br>\n  * Cezary Kaliszyk, University of Innsbruck, Austria<br>\n  * Chantal Keller, LRI, Université Paris-Sud, France<br>\n  * Laura Kovács, TU Wien, Austria<br>\n  * Olivier Laurent, CNRS, ENS Lyon, France<br>\n  * Stefan Mitsch, Carnegie Mellon University, USA<br>\n  * Carlos Olarte, UFRN, Brazil<br>\n  * Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo, IOHK, Australia<br>\n  * Florian Rabe, LRI, Université Paris-Sud, France<br>\n  * Martin Riener, University of Manchester, UK<br>\n  * Geoff Sutcliffe, University of Miami, USA<br>\n  * Josef Urban, Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics<br>\n    (CIIRC), Czech Republic</p>\n<p>* Yoni Zohar, Stanford University, USA</p>\n<h2>Previous PxTP Editions</h2>\n<p>* PxTP 2017 (<a href=\"https://pxtp.github.io/2017/\">https://pxtp.github.io/2017/</a>), affiliated to Tableaux 2017,<br>\n    FroCoS 2017 and ITP 2017</p>\n<p>* PxTP 2015 (<a href=\"http://pxtp15.lri.fr/\">http://pxtp15.lri.fr/</a>), affiliated to CADE-25<br>\n  * PxTP 2013 (<a href=\"http://www.cs.ru.nl/pxtp13/\">http://www.cs.ru.nl/pxtp13/</a>), affiliated to CADE-24<br>\n  * PxTP 2012 (<a href=\"http://pxtp2012.inria.fr/\">http://pxtp2012.inria.fr/</a>), affiliated to IJCAR 2012<br>\n  * PxTP 2011 (<a href=\"http://pxtp2011.loria.fr/\">http://pxtp2011.loria.fr/</a>), affiliated to CADE-23</p>",
