The QED system will conform to the highest<br>\nstandards of mathematical rigor, including the use of strict formality<br>\nin the internal representation of knowledge and the use of mechanical<br>\nmethods to check proofs of the correctness of all entries in the<br>\nsystem...\"</p>\n<p>SCOPE AND TOPICS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The purpose of this special issue is to demonstrate the state of the<br>\nart in formalization of mathematics 20 years after the QED Manifesto<br>\nand the related 1994 and 1995 QED Workshops, and to show how we are<br>\n(not yet) achieving the QED goals.</p>\n<p>The topics of interest include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>significant formalization projects, particularly in mathematics and<br>\n   related areas</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>formalization and theorem proving technology for QED-scale efforts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>projects generally aimed at large-scale computer understanding and<br>\n   semantic processing of mathematical knowledge and reasoning</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>important issues in computer understanding and formalization of<br>\n   mathematics and their proposed/prototyped/working solutions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>important applications and uptake of computer-understandable<br>\n   mathematics</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Participants of the QED+20 workshop, as well as other authors are invited to<br>\nsubmit contributions.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This special issue welcomes original high-quality contributions that<br>\nhave been neither published in nor simultaneously submitted to other<br>\nvenues. Submissions will be peer-reviewed using the standard<br>\nrefereeing procedure of the Journal of Formalized Reasoning.</p>\n<p>Submission instructions, author guidelines and the JFR latex style are<br>\navailable at <a href=\"http://jfr.unibo.it/about/submissions#onlineSubmissions\">http://jfr.unibo.it/about/submissions#onlineSubmissions</a>.</p>\n<p>In the first step of the online submission process, authors should<br>\nselect the section: \"QED 20th anniversary\".</p>\n<p>GUEST EDITORS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>John Harrison (Intel Corporation)<br>\nJosef Urban (Radboud University Nijmegen)<br>\nFreek Wiedijk (Radboud University Nijmegen)</p>",
