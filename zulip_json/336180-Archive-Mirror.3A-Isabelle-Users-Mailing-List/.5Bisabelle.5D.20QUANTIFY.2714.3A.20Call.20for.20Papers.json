The use of quantifiers often allows for a more succinct<br>\nencoding than would be possible without quantifiers. However, the<br>\nintroduction of quantifiers affects the complexity of the extended<br>\nformalism in general. Moreover, theoretical results established for<br>\nthe quantifier-free formalism typically cannot be directly transferred<br>\nto the quantified case. Further, techniques successfully implemented<br>\nin reasoning tools for quantifier-free formulas cannot directly be<br>\nlifted to a quantified version.</p>\n<p>The goal of the 1st International Workshop on Quantification<br>\n(QUANTIFY 2014) is to bring together researchers who investigate the<br>\nimpact of quantification from a theoretical as well as from a practical<br>\npoint of view. Quantification is a topic in different research areas<br>\nsuch as in SAT in terms of QBF, in CSP in terms of QCSP, in SMT, etc.<br>\nThis workshop has the aim to provide an interdisciplinary forum where<br>\nresearchers of various fields may exchange their experiences.</p>\n<p>===============<br>\nIMPORTANT DATES<br>\n===============</p>\n<p>Please follow the workshop website at <a href=\"http://vsl2014.at/quantify\">http://vsl2014.at/quantify</a><br>\nfor any updates.</p>\n<p>April 15 2014: paper submission<br>\nMay    7 2014: notification of acceptance<br>\nJuly  18 2014: workshop</p>\n<p>==================<br>\nTOPICS OF INTEREST<br>\n==================</p>\n<p>The workshop is concerned with all theoretical and practical aspects<br>\nof quantification in logics such as QBF, QCSP, SMT, and theorem<br>\nproving.  The topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Complexity results</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encodings with and without quantification and comparisons thereof</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of quantification</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implementations of reasoning tools</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies and experimental results</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intersections between the different research communities working<br>\n   working on quantification</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Surveys of state-of-the-art approaches to handling quantification</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>=================<br>\nPAPER SUBMISSIONS<br>\n=================</p>\n<p>Submissions will be managed via Easychair:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=quantify2014\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=quantify2014</a></p>\n<p>Submitted papers should be formatted in either LNCS format or a<br>\nstandard LaTeX article format (paper size A4, font size 11pt).</p>\n<p>We solicit two types of submissions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Talk abstracts (maximum two pages, excluding references)<br>\ndescribing already published results.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Full papers (maximum 14 pages, excluding references) on novel,<br>\nunpublished work.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The talk abstracts of category 1 should include a relevant<br>\nbibliography of related work and an outline of the planned talk.<br>\nFor this category, we explicitly advocate talks which survey results<br>\nalready published, maybe in multiple articles or presentations<br>\ncapturing the commonalities and differences<br>\nof various quantification approaches (perhaps even interdisciplinary).</p>\n<p>Each submission will be assessed by the program committee and the<br>\nworkshop organizers with respect to novelty, originality, and scope.</p>\n<p>Submissions related to completed work as well as work in progress are<br>\nwelcome. Authors are encouraged to provide additional material such as<br>\nsource code of tools, experimental data, benchmarks and related<br>\npublications in an appendix or a related webpage. The additional<br>\nmaterial will be considered at the discretion of the reviewers.</p>\n<p>Previously published work or extensions thereof may be submitted to the<br>\nworkshop but that case has to be explicitly stated in the submitted<br>\npaper. This regulation also applies to work which is currently under<br>\nreview elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Since the workshop does not have official proceedings, work related to<br>\naccepted submissions can be resubmitted to other venues without<br>\nrestrictions.</p>\n<p>Authors of accepted abstracts and papers are expected to give a talk at<br>\nthe workshop.</p>\n<p>===============<br>\nWORKSHOP REPORT<br>\n===============</p>\n<p>Accepted papers and abstracts are collected in an informal report which<br>\nwill be publicly available at the workshop's website.</p>\n<p>===================<br>\nWORKSHOP ORGANIZERS<br>\n===================</p>\n<p>Hubie Chen<br>\nUniversidad del País Vasco and Ikerbasque, Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain</p>\n<p>Florian Lonsing<br>\nVienna University of Technology, Austria</p>\n<p>Martina Seidl<br>\nJohannes Kepler University Linz, Austria</p>\n<p>=================<br>\nPROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>\n=================</p>\n<p>Albert Atserias (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya)<br>\nNikolaj Bjorner (Microsoft Research)<br>\nMikolas Janota (INESC-ID Lisboa)<br>\nHans Kleine Büning (University of Paderborn)<br>\nKonstantin Korovin (Manchester University)<br>\nLaura Kovacs (Chalmers University of Technology)<br>\nFrancesco Scarcello (DIMES, University of Calabria)<br>\nChristoph M.
