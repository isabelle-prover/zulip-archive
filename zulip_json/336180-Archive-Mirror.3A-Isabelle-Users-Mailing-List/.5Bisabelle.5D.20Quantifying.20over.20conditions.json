But<br>\nlike you said, it trivially holds. So is there a way to formulate it<br>\nsuch that it isn't trivial? I want to check that if there is such a<br>\nprecondition such that \"p = 0\". If there isn't, then the statement<br>\nshould be evaluated to False.</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nJohn</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kind regards,<br>\nTjark</p>\n</blockquote>",
