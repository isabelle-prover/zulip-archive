I think the work around is to prefix execution with rlwrap. I was never clear why the Scala devs did not fix this upstream, but maybe they have and my recollections are out of date.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nMatt</p>",

It does not open a different console window,  and is working in the same terminal window, but the shell is changed from Windows's PS shell to a bash of Cygwin.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that \"isabelle scala\" merely invokes the regular \"scala\" tool with some<br>\nadditions to the environment.
