In the theory, there are just a few inference rules (meta-level<br>\naxioms):</p>\n<p>Leibniz [intro] : “P = Q ==&gt; E P = E Q”</p>\n<p>Transitivity [trans] : “[P = Q; Q = R] ==&gt; P = R”</p>\n<p>Equanimity [trans] : “[P = Q; Q] ==&gt; P”</p>\n<p>There are also a few derived inference rules (meta-level theorems) that are<br>\nsimple variations of the rules above. By annotating the rules with the<br>\nattributes [intro] and [trans], I don’t have to mention them explicitly in<br>\nthe Isar proofs. Writing “by rule” will make the system pick a rule<br>\nannotated with [intro] and the rules annotated with [trans] will be used<br>\nimplicitly when chaining calculations with “also” and “finally”.</p>\n<p>All of this works fine but it does feel a bit strange to label rule Leibniz<br>\nas an introduction rule (or as an elimination rule, or as a symmetry rule).<br>\nNote that I don’t really use classical reasoning in my theory. Is it ok to<br>\nsomewhat “abuse” these attributes in order to obtain the effect of the rules<br>\nbeing automatically selected by the system? I would expect that there is<br>\nsome annotation like [standard] that simply declares a rule to be a<br>\n“standard” rule without forcing the user to classify it as an introduction<br>\nor elimination rule. Is there any source that explains clearly which<br>\nattributes should be used for which kind of rules and what the consequences<br>\nare exactly?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help or comments.</p>\n<p>Hannes Verlinde</p>\n<p>Ghent University</p>",

Alternatively, you may use Pure.intro<br>\nor intro? instead, which do not affect the classical proof tools.
