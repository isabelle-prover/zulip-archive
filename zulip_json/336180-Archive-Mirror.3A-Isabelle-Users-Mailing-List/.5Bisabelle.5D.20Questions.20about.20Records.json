I have some questions regarding records. I am giving an<br>\nexample which is similar to what I want to do. My questions are based<br>\non this example. </p>\n<p>datatype op = a | b | c</p>\n<p>record class = <br>\nclass_name ::string<br>\nclass_type :: op</p>\n<p>record classext = class +<br>\nextension :: “class list”</p>\n<p>datatype sub = “(class, classext)<br>\nlist”</p>\n<p>record  program =<br>\nprogram_name :: string<br>\nprogram_content :: sub</p>\n<p>Assume that record class is concretely defined with these 2 definitions:</p>\n<p>definition</p>\n<p>class1 :: class</p>\n<p>where</p>\n<p>class1_def: \"class1 = (|<br>\nclass_name = ''man'', class_type = a |)\"</p>\n<p>definition</p>\n<p>class2 :: class</p>\n<p>where</p>\n<p>class2 _def: \"class2 = (|<br>\nclass_name = ''woman'', class_type = b |)\"</p>\n<p>Can I extend the record (classext)  from another record (class) and use one of the element of the new   record as the old record ? Similar to the above 'class' definitions, how can I define concretely the 'classext'record which uses the class1 and class2 definitions? When such adefinition has other record definitions embedded in it, can thedefinitions be automatically unfolded and how? Also, how can concretely define the 'program' record?</p>\n<p>If I want to define another element inthe 'program' record which can be either of type class or of typeclassext, how can I do it? Should I use datatypes and caseexpressions ? And, how can I concretely define this element? </p>\n<p>Thanks in Advance, </p>\n<p>Rajesh</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________________________________<br>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?  <br>\nFind them fast with Yahoo!
