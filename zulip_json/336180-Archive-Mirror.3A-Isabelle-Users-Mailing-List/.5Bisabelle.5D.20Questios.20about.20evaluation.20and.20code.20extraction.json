I<br>\nknow that one can exract executable specifications to ML (\"Isabelle's<br>\nLogics: HOL\", Section 2.9). I also know that in the proof mode I can<br>\nsay apply(simp) to simplify, say, the goal \"(12 :: int) div 5 = 2\" to<br>\nTrue. But can I make Isabelle compute the result of \"(12 :: int) div<br>\n5\"?</p>\n<p>(2) Is it possible to extract code from fragments that use rational<br>\nnumbers? When I tried the following code:</p>\n<p>constdefs f :: \"rat =&gt; rat\"<br>\n  \"f x == 1 / x + x\"</p>\n<p>code_module Inc file \"<a href=\"http://rat.ml\">rat.ml</a>\"<br>\ncontains f</p>\n<p>I got this error:</p>\n<p>*** Unable to generate code for type:<br>\n*** 'a set<br>\n*** required by:<br>\n*** Quotient.quot (type), Rational.rat (type), &lt;Top&gt;<br>\n*** At command \"code_module\".</p>\n<p>Thank you,<br>\nYevgeniy</p>",
