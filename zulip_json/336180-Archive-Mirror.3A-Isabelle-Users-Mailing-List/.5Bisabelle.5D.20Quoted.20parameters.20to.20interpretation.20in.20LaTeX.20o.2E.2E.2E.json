Stark\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:isabelle-users@starkeffect.com\">isabelle-users@starkeffect.com</a>&gt;<br>\nWhen an interpretation with quoted parameters appears in the Isar source, e.g.:</p>\n<p>interpretation foo \"x y\" z</p>\n<p>in the LaTeX output there are no delimiters to separate the quoted parameter<br>\nfrom the others, so the output appears like:</p>\n<p>interpretation foo x y z</p>\n<p>which is ambiguous to the human reader.  It is not clear that there is a way<br>\nto rectify this at the source level and I am in any case hesitant to try to<br>\nhack my source to work around something that seems to be an issue with<br>\ndocument processing.  I would think that the system should determine that the<br>\npiece of inner syntax \"x y\" ought to be parenthesized in the document output,<br>\nin order to remove ambiguity.</p>",

I’d suggest you try adding that in a ROOT file — see the ones in the Isabelle distribution and/or the AFP for examples of the syntax. Note the caveat that this option may yet get trumped by LaTeX styling.</p>\n<p>Seeing as the absence of quotes seems to work OK elsewhere, you might instead adopt something like:</p>\n<p>interpretation foo<br>\n  “x y\"<br>\n  z</p>\n<p>cheers,<br>\npeter</p>",
