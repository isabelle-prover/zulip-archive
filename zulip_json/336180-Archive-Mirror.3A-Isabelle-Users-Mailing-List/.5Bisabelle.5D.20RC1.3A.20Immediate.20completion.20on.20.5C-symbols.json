In Isabelle 2015,<br>\nwhenever I wanted an alpha, my process was:</p>\n<p>Type &lt;\\&gt; &lt;a&gt; &lt;l&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;h&gt; &lt;a&gt;, wait for tooltip, realize I already have<br>\n\"\\&lt;alpha&gt;ha\" standing there, delete the \"ah\".</p>\n<p>In Isabelle 2016, there is still a problem which has been there since<br>\nIsabelle 2015:</p>\n<p>When I want to type the comment (<em>old</em>), I type &lt;(&gt; &lt;*&gt; &lt;o&gt; and it<br>\nimmediately completes to \"(\\&lt;otimes&gt;\".
