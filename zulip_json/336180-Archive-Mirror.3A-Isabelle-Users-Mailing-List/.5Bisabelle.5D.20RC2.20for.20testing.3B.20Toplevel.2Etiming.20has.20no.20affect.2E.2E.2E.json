When you toggle full-screen mode, the panel is <br>\nremoved and added again, so the Sledgehammer run is reset. In <br>\nIsabelle2013-1-RC2 the GUI display is a bit crude and merely changes into <br>\nthe state \"Waiting for evaluation of context ...\".  In the coming RC3 this <br>\nweek it will be more clear that the state is reset.</p>\n<p>These slight inconveniences of dockable window state are due to certain <br>\nfeatures of Java/Swing and jEdit Dockable Window Management. For Output <br>\nand Info, I had already made some workarounds a few years ago, to pretend <br>\nmore persistence than is there in reality. Instead of adding more <br>\nworkarounds it would be better to brush up the Dockable Window Manager at <br>\nsome point, but it requires some enthisiastic and competent people helping <br>\nout at the jEdit project on Sourceforge.</p>\n<p>Another known problem of dockable windows (especially in full-screen mode) <br>\nis that windows often get lost behind the main window.
