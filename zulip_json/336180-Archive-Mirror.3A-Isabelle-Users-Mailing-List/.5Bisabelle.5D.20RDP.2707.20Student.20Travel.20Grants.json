Applicants should note that<br>\na grant is limited, and that costs in excess of the grant will not be<br>\nreimbursed.</p>\n<p>Grants will be awarded based on the evaluating committee's assessment<br>\nof the applicant's genuine financial need, the potential benefit to<br>\nthe applicant's education, research, and career, and the potential<br>\nbenefit to the conference or workshop. Among those applicants who<br>\ngenuinely could not attend the conference without a grant, the<br>\nevaluating committee gives priority to (co-)authors of accepted<br>\npapers.</p>\n<p>Applications should explain</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the current status of the applicant</li>\n<li>the kind of participation of the applicant in RDP</li>\n<li>a breakdown of the estimated amount needed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Applications should be send by May 20, midnight UT time zone, by email<br>\nto <a href=\"mailto:registration@rdp07.org\">registration@rdp07.org</a>.
