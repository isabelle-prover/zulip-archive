This<br>\nemail is about TPHOLs in 2010. It is necessary to hold this vote now<br>\n(before<br>\nthe host for 2009 has been determined) because one option is to join FLoC<br>\n(Federated Logic Conference) 2010, which requires longer-term planning. At<br>\nTPHOLs 2007 in Kaiserslautern, a Steering Committee (SC) was formed (see<br>\nbelow) and it is this SC who is holding this vote. The SC proposes 3<br>\nalternatives for organizing TPHOLs 2010:</p>\n<p>A) TPHOLs merges with the normally standalone conferences<br>\n  CADE, FroCoS, FTP and TABLEAUX to create IJCAR,<br>\n  a sub-conferences of FLoC 2010. The arrangement would be similar to<br>\n  IJCAR 2006: <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/FLoC-06/IJCAR.html\">http://www.easychair.org/FLoC-06/IJCAR.html</a>.<br>\n  Characteristics: 1 joint PC, 1 joint proceedings.<br>\n  The details would be negotiated by the TPHOLs SC.</p>\n<p>B) TPHOLs merges one time with the ACL2 Workshop to become<br>\n  a sub-conference of FLoC 2010. For past ACL2 workshops see<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshops.html\">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshops.html</a>.<br>\n  Characteristics: 1 joint PC, 1 joint proceedings.<br>\n  The details would be negotiated by the TPHOLs SC.</p>\n<p>C) TPHOLs remains separate, does not participate in FLoC, and is<br>\norganized in<br>\nthe traditional manner by a call for hosts and a vote in 2008/09.</p>\n<p>FLoC will take place in Edinburgh. The other FLoC sub-conferences will be<br>\nCAV, IJCAR, LICS, RTA, SAT, ICLP.</p>\n<p>Anyone who is seriously considering attending TPHOLs 2010 is entitled to<br>\nvote. The voting procedure employed will be Single Transferable Vote<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote</a>.<br>\nTo vote please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:tphols2010@lists-sop.inria.fr\">tphols2010@lists-sop.inria.fr</a> in the<br>\nfollowing format:</p>\n<p>First choice for TPHOLs 2010<br>\nSecond choice for TPHOLs 2010<br>\nThird choice for TPHOLs 2010</p>\n<p>Your Name</p>\n<p>Each choice should be one of A, B, C.  It is possible to omit the second<br>\nand<br>\nthird choices to indicate no preference. Including your name is for the<br>\nsole<br>\npurpose of preventing ballot stuffing: all votes will remain secret. The<br>\ndeadline for voting is 11/11/07.</p>\n<p>The TPHOLs SC</p>\n<p>Mike Gordon<br>\nJohn Harrison<br>\nMatt Kaufmann<br>\nJohn Matthews<br>\nTobias Nipkow<br>\nMichael Norrish<br>\nLawrence Paulson<br>\nKlaus Schneider<br>\nSofiène Tahar<br>\nLaurent Théry</p>",
