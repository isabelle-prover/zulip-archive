LIPIcs is open access, meaning that<br>\npublications will be available online and free of charge, and authors<br>\nkeep the copyright for their papers.  LIPIcs publications are indexed<br>\nin DBLP.  STACS and FSTTCS proceedings also appear in LIPIcs.

Submissions must fall into one of the following categories<br>\n(to be indicated at submission):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Regular research Papers: describing new results; they will be judged<br>\n   on correctness and significance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Papers describing the experience of applying rewriting techniques in<br>\n   other areas; they will be judged on relevance and comparison with<br>\n   other approaches.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Problem sets that provide realistic and interesting challenges in<br>\n   the field of rewriting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>System descriptions; they should contain a link to a working system<br>\n   and will be judged on usefulness and design.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All submissions will be judged on originality and quality of<br>\npresentation. Submissions in the first three categories can be up to<br>\n15 proceedings pages long, system descriptions up to 10 proceedings<br>\npages. Additional material, for instance proof details, may be given<br>\nin an appendix which is not subject to the page limit.<br>\nHowever, submissions must be self-contained within the<br>\nrespective page limit; reading the appendix should not be necessary to<br>\nassess the merits of a submission.</p>\n<p>Submissions are accepted in either Postscript or PDF format.</p>\n<p>Abstracts and papers must be submitted electronically through the<br>\nEasyChair system at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rta2010\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rta2010</a></p>\n<p>Questions concerning submissions may be addressed to the PC chair,<br>\n Christopher Lynch &lt;clynch \"AT\" <a href=\"http://clarkson.edu\">clarkson.edu</a>&gt;.</p>",
