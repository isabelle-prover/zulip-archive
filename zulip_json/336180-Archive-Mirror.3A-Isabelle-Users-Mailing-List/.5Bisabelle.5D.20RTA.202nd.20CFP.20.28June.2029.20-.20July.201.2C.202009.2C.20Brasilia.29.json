The conference<br>\nwill be preceded by the 4th International School on Rewriting (ISR).</p>\n<p>Brasilia, the federal capital of Brazil, is listed as a World Heritage<br>\nSite by UNESCO.  RDP 2009 will be held at Universidade de Brasilia,<br>\none of the largest and one of the most prestigious universities in<br>\nBrazil, on a campus built by highly acclaimed architect Oscar Niemeyer. <br>\nBrasilia is easily reached by plane; air fares are moderate at that time <br>\nof the year.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES:<br>\nAbstract Submission:  January 19, 2009<br>\nPaper Submission:     January 26, 2009<br>\nNotification:         March 20, 2009<br>\nFinal version:        April 10, 2009</p>\n<p>RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects of<br>\nrewriting. Typical areas of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Applications: case studies; analysis of cryptographic protocols;<br>\n   rule-based (functional and logic) programming; symbolic and algebraic<br>\n   computation; theorem proving; system synthesis and verification; proof<br>\n   checking; reasoning about programming languages and logics; program<br>\n   transformation;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Foundations: matching and unification; narrowing; completion techniques;<br>\n   strategies; rewriting calculi, constraint solving; tree automata;<br>\n   termination; combination;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Frameworks: string, term, and graph rewriting; lambda-calculus and<br>\n   higher-order rewriting; constrained rewriting/deduction; categorical and<br>\n   infinitary rewriting; integration of decision procedures;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implementation: implementation techniques; parallel execution; rewrite<br>\n   tools; termination checking;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Semantics: equational logic; rewriting logic; rewriting models of<br>\n   programs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>\nInvited talks will be given by Vincent Danos (Edinburgh, UK) and<br>\nJohannes Waldmann (Leipzig, Germany). The joint invited speaker<br>\nof RTA and TLCA will be announced later.</p>\n<p>BEST PAPER AWARD:<br>\nA prize of 500 Euro will be given to the best paper as judged by the<br>\nprogram committee.

Submissions must fall into one of the following categories<br>\n(to be indicated at submission):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Regular Research Papers: describing new results; they will be judged<br>\n   on correctness and significance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Papers describing the experience of applying rewriting techniques in<br>\n   other areas; they will be judged on relevance and comparison with<br>\n   other approaches.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Problem sets that provide realistic and interesting challenges in<br>\n   the field of rewriting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>System descriptions; they should contain a link to a working system<br>\n   and will be judged on usefulness and design.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All submissions will be judged on originality and quality of<br>\npresentation. Submissions in the first three categories can be up to<br>\n15 proceedings pages long, system descriptions up to 10 proceedings<br>\npages. Additional material, for instance proof details, may be given<br>\nin an appendix which is not subject to the limitation of<br>\npages. However, submissions must be self-contained within the<br>\nrespective page limit; reading the appendix should not be necessary to<br>\naccess the merits of a submission.</p>\n<p>Submissions are accepted in either Postscript or PDF format.
