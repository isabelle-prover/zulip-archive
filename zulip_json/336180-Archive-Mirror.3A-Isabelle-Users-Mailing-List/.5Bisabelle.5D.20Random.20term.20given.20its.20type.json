Unfortunately, I could not<br>\nfound a public available link to this bachelor thesis. The source code<br>\nis however available in the directory src/Tools/Spec_Check.</p>\n<p>Especially, the function to create a random term was implemented in<br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/628b271c5b8b/src/Tools/Spec_Check/generator.ML#l222\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/628b271c5b8b/src/Tools/Spec_Check/generator.ML#l222</a>.</p>\n<p>Personally, I would also suggest to experiment with an alternative<br>\ngenerator that exhaustively enumerates small terms.<br>\nThe randomly generated terms at larger size might have a very low<br>\nprobability to fulfil the conditions you are interested in. Hence,<br>\nchecking all small terms might be more successful; an observation that<br>\nhas led us to choose exhaustive testing for the auto quickcheck tool<br>\nin Isabelle.</p>\n<p>Lukas</p>",
