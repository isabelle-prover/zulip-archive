(it is planned to merge Lib/Misc_Polynomial<br>\ninto the Isabelle library).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Johannes</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p>From: Brian Huffman &lt;<a href=\"mailto:huffman.brian.c@gmail.com\">huffman.brian.c@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>\nAlso in HOL/Library you will find Fraction_Field.thy, which defines a<br>\ntype constructor 'a fract that gives the field of fractions over any<br>\nintegral domain 'a. You can combine this with the polynomial type from<br>\nPolynomial.thy to get a type of rational functions: e.g. \"real poly<br>\nfract\" would be the type of rational functions with real coefficients.</p>\n<p>Fraction_Field.thy seems to be a bit spartan at the moment, not<br>\nproviding a lot of operations or theorems beyond basic arithmetic<br>\nstuff. Please let us know about any suggestions for<br>\nadditions/improvements you'd like to see, so we can make the libraries<br>\nbetter!</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brian</li>\n</ul>",
