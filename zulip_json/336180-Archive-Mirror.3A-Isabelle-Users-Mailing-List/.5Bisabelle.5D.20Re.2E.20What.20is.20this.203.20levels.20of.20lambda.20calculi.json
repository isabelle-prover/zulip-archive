The <br>\nproblems around this way of structuring are manifold. If you regard a <br>\nproof/some software as a tree of sub-proofs you need to verify the <br>\nconnections, i.e. the types at the vertices. As long as there is no <br>\ncommonly agreed (and published) type model you can only rely upon <br>\nnon-typed text substitution. Go ahead; try to define it for 2 or more <br>\nlevels...</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nJens</p>",
