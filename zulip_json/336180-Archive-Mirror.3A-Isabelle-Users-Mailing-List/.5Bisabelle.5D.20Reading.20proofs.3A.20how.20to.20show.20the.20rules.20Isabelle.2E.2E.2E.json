If I want to see what Isabelle rules have been applied for a <br>\n<em>single</em> proof step how do I do it? </p>\n<p>Example below: assume I simply want to see the rule(s) that have/has been <br>\napplied in step 2 without mixing them up with anything any rule <br>\nthat has been applied in step 1.</p>\n<p>theory test<br>\n  imports Main<br>\n  begin<br>\n    lemma combined: <br>\n      assumes a1: \"ALL n::nat. A n  --&gt; B\"<br>\n      and     a2: \"B --&gt; C\"<br>\n        shows \"A 0 --&gt; C\"<br>\n    proof-<br>\n      (* step 1 *) from a1 and a2 have \"ALL n. A n --&gt; C\" by blast<br>\n      (* step 2 *) from this show \"A 0 --&gt; C\" by auto<br>\n    qed<br>\n  end</p>\n<p>Thanks and best,</p>",
