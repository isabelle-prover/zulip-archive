Most automatic theorem provers for first-order logic are complete, which means that if your conjecture is a theorem, you simply have to wait for the proof. However, you may have to wait until the sun grows into a red giant, engulfing the Earth. Or you could guide the proof interactively.</p>\n<p>Very few higher-order interactive theorem provers use higher-order unification anyway. It is much more commonly found in automatic provers. So your informant is 100% wrong.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
