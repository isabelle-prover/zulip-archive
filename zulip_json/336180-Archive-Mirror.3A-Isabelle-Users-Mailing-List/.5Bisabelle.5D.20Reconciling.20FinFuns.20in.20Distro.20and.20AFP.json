(I remember me also being<br>\ninvolved into that decision).</p>\n<p>Despite the initial enthusiasm, uses of that theory remained rare.<br>\nTaking that into account and further the increase of reuse in the AFP,<br>\nit seems time to reconcile the distro version back into the AFP.</p>\n<p>Are there any comments on this?</p>\n<p>This measure is part of a bigger plan to<br>\na) introduce a type of finite mappings;<br>\nb) let Mapping.thy base on that (as far as appropriate);<br>\nc) maybe also go for a general cleanup of Map.thy in the long run.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/obyLZaRzbzv0o33bRFoVZcGI/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
