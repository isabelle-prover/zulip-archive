In<br>\nthe context of a record R<br>\n  record R = f :: nat<br>\nI can write<br>\n  term \"x(| f := 1 |)\"<br>\nThis gets displayed as<br>\n  \"x(| f := 1 |)\"<br>\n    :: \"'a R_scheme\"<br>\nwhich is what I'd expect. However, updating an application<br>\n  term \"(g x)(| f := 1 |)\"<br>\ngets displayed as<br>\n  \"f_update (%_. 1) (g x)\"<br>\n    :: \"'a R_scheme\"</p>\n<p>I understand that both \"g x\"-terms are internally equal and that it's<br>\njust a matter of pretty printing. However, I don't understand why the<br>\nsyntax translation machinery fails to pretty print the application.<br>\nCan somebody explain it to me?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\n  Dennis</p>",
