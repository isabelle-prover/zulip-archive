Is there a way to<br>\ndefine them mutually as we did in, for example, mutually recursive<br>\ndatatypes?</p>\n<p>record A =<br>\n  a : int<br>\n  b : B</p>\n<p>record B =<br>\n  x : int<br>\n  y : A</p>\n<p>Secondly, how do I define a record which contains a field of type itself:</p>\n<p>record Block =<br>\n  a : int<br>\n  b : Block</p>\n<p>(p.s. I know both these example contain syntax errors. They're just to<br>\nexplain what I'm trying to do.)</p>",
