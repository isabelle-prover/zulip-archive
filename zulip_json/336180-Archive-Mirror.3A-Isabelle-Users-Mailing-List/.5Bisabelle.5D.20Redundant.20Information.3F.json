My questions are the following ones:</p>\n<p>a) Is there any advantage in including the equivalence A  ⟷   B as a lemma,<br>\nwhen we already have both A ⟹ B and B ⟹ A as lemmas?</p>\n<p>b) Is there any advantage in including both A ⟹ B and B ⟹ A as lemmas, when<br>\nwe already have the equivalence A  ⟷   B as a lemma?</p>\n<p>c) Is there any case when it is useful to have two definitions A and B,<br>\neven if we have the fact A  ⟷   B? The typical example is:</p>\n<p>theorem LIMSEQ_NSLIMSEQ_iff: \"f ⇢ L ⟷ f ⇢⇩N⇩S L\"</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nJosé M.</p>",

In particular we have many introduction rules, with names ending with I and which work with the intro method or “blast intro: …”. Analogously we have elimination rules with names ending with D or E, for “blast dest: …” or “blast elim: …”. The variant forms are also convenient with attributes such as OF and THEN, while the equality forms are convenient with the simplifier.</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
