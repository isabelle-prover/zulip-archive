Read:  <br>\nat least with jEdit.</p>\n<p>If ever I create a redundant lemma, Isabelle warns me all the time, even  <br>\nwhen I feel it helps readability. But it seems it don't applies the same  <br>\nto it‑self: whenever I do “using [[simp_trace=true]]” and enable trace in  <br>\nthe output pan, I often get redundant entries starting with</p>\n<p>“[1]Adding rewrite rule \"??.unknown\":”</p>\n<p>For a concrete case I just had, there were multiple</p>\n<p>[1]Adding rewrite rule \"??.unknown\":<br>\n   r x y ≡ True</p>\n<p>When repeated multiple times for multiple rewrite rules, this make the  <br>\ntrace encumbered and less readable.</p>\n<p>Is there a known way to filter it out automatically? If possible, I would  <br>\nlike to have only one trace message for each added rewrite rule.
