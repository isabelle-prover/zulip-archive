Is<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.lri.fr/~wenzel/Isabelle2011-Paris/pure.pdf\">http://www.lri.fr/~wenzel/Isabelle2011-Paris/pure.pdf</a> a reasonably<br>\nsufficient reference for summarising the primitives of Pure? If so,<br>\nsuppose my function requires something richer than those presented on<br>\npage 2, e.g., theory manipulations, does that mean I'm actually<br>\nworking in a separate meta-logic (one that sits between Pure and the<br>\nobject-logic)? That is, I'm actually using Pure to encode theory<br>\nmanipulations, so it's an object-logic when viewed from Pure's<br>\nperspective.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for your time in advance.</p>\n<p>John</p>",

        "content": "<p>From: John Munroe &lt;<a href=\"mailto:munddr@gmail.com\">munddr@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br>\nSorry, I'll try to clarify clarify my question. For example, if the<br>\ntransformation is to negate each axiom in a theory or the<br>\ntransformation is to make some syntactic changes, e.g., rename certain<br>\nterm to something else, then is it still expressible in Pure? I've<br>\njust found <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-130.pdf\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-130.pdf</a> and<br>\nit seems that there isn't appropriate syntax at least for the latter.<br>\nIf that's the case, does that mean these transformations would sit in<br>\na separate meta-level in the logic hierarchy -- between Pure and the<br>\nobject-logic?</p>\n<p>Please let me know if more clarification is needed.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>John</p>",
