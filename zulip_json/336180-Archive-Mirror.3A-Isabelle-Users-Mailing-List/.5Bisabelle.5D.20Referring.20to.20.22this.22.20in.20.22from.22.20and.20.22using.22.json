The Isar <br>\nproof language is based on an alternation of facts and goals, i.e. you <br>\n\"state\" things in forward mode and then \"prove\" things in backward mode.</p>\n<p>When you claim a new goal, you are already one step after the last fact, <br>\nso the \"this\" binding is removed, and thus unavailable in a 'using' <br>\ncommand.</p>\n<p>In principle one could do otherwhise.  There are many degrees of freedom <br>\nin the design space.  By re-adjusting them you would get a slightly <br>\ndifferent language, with slightly different style of expression.  Its a <br>\nbit like English vs. French vs. German vs. Italien -- basically the same <br>\nthing, but slightly different here and there ...</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
