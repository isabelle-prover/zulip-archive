(length [y] = length [y])\" for y :: int<br>\n   apply (reify Irifm.simps Irnat_simps Irlist.simps Irint_simps)</p>\n<p>Note that when the allquantifier is remove, <em>or</em> when one of the y's is <br>\nreplaced by 0, reification works. So the problem seems to be some subtle <br>\ninteraction between the allquantifier and the fact that y occurs twice.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",
