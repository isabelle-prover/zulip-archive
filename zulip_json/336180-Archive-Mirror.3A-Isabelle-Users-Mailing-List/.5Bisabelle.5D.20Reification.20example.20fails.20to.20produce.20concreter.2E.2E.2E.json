I have also tried Isabelle2017, Isabelle2018, Isabelle2019, but no such luck.</p>\n<p>I have been informed that it might be because the occurrence of a binder and free variables. If we replace the term <code>x*z + 8 - y</code> with <code>x*x + x - x</code>, the reification produces something. But this seems unlikely since the reification works for a smaller size example e.g. ‹∀x :: int. m &lt; 5<em>n - length (xs @ [2,3,4,x</em>z + 8 - y])›.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAlbert</p>\n<hr>\n<p>CONFIDENTIALITY: This email is intended solely for the person(s) named and may be confidential and/or privileged.
