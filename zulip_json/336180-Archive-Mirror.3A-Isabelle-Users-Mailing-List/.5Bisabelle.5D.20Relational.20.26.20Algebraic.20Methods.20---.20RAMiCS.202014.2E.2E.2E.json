Special focus will lie on formal methods for software<br>\nengineering, logics of programs and links with neighbouring disciplines.</p>\n<p>Particular topics of interest for the conference cover,<br>\nbut are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Algebraic approaches to<br>\n  • specification, development, verification, and analysis of programs<br>\n    and algorithms<br>\n  • computational logic, in particular logics of programs, modal and<br>\n    dynamic logics, interval and temporal logics<br>\n  • semantics of programming languages</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications in fields such as<br>\n  • relational formal methods such as B or Z, tabular methods<br>\n  • information systems<br>\n  • graph theory and combinatorial optimisation<br>\n  • games, automata and language theory<br>\n  • spatio-temporal reasoning, knowledge acquisition<br>\n  • preference and scaling methods, computational social choice,<br>\n    social software</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical foundations and supporting tools, including<br>\n  • mechanised and automated reasoning, decision procedures<br>\n  • process algebras, fixed point calculi, idempotent semirings,<br>\n    quantales, allegories<br>\n  • dynamic algebras, cylindric algebras and their applications in computing</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>History</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Since 1994, the RelMiCS meetings on Relational Methods in Computer Science<br>\nhave been a main forum for researchers who use the calculus of relations<br>\nand similar algebraic formalisms as methodological and conceptual tools.<br>\nThe AKA workshop series on Applications of Kleene algebra started with a<br>\nDagstuhl seminar in 2001 and was co-organised with the RelMiCS conference<br>\nuntil 2009. Since 2011, joint RAMiCS conferences continue to encompass<br>\nthe scope of both RelMiCS and AKA.</p>\n<p>The predecessors of this conference were held in Dagstuhl (January 1994),<br>\nParati (September 1995), Hammamet (January 1997), Warsaw (September 1998),<br>\nQuébec (January 2000), Dagstuhl (February 2001), Oisterwijk (October 2001),<br>\nMalente (April 2003), St. Catherines (January 2005), Manchester<br>\n(September 2006), Frauenwörth (April 2008), Doha (November 2009),<br>\nRotterdam (June 2011), and Cambridge UK (September 2012).</p>\n<p>Student Program</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The conference will be accompanied by a PhD training program. Details will<br>\nbe published in due time in a special call and on the conference website.</p>\n<p>Proceedings and Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All papers will be formally reviewed. The proceedings will be published<br>\nin the Springer series Lecture Notes in Computer Science, ready at<br>\nthe conference. Submissions must be in English, in Postscript or PDF<br>\nformat, and provide sufficient information to judge their merits.<br>\nThey must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. <br>\nThey should not exceed 16 pages in Springer LNCS style (accepted<br>\npapers must be produced with LaTeX). Additional material may be<br>\nprovided by a clearly marked appendix or a reference to a manuscript<br>\non a website. This may be considered at the discretion of the PC.<br>\nDeviation from these requirements may cause immediate rejection.<br>\nOne author of each accepted paper is expected to present the paper<br>\nat the conference.</p>\n<p>Submission is via EasyChair at the following address:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ramics2014\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ramics2014</a><br>\nFormatting instructions and the LNCS styled files can be obtained via:<br>\n<a href=\"http://springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a></p>\n<p>As for the earlier conferences of this series, it is also intended to<br>\npublish a selection of the best papers in revised and extended form in<br>\na special issue of the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming (JLAP).</p>\n<p>Programme Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Rudolf Berghammer        (Kiel, Germany)<br>\n    Jules Desharnais         (Laval U., Canada)<br>\n    Harrie de Swart          (Rotterdam, Netherlands)<br>\n    Marc Frappier            (Sherbrooke, Canada)<br>\n    Hitoshi Furusawa         (Kagoshima, Japan)<br>\n    Timothy G.
