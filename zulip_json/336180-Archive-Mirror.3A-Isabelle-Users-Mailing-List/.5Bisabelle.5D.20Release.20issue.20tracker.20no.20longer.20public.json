De-facto it turned out to be just an <br>\nextension of my personal mail folder, although with some tendency of<br>\nreduced attention of what was going on there -- sometimes I also forgot to <br>\nsubscribe to items where that was not automatic.</p>\n<p>Consequently, some important issues like Fedora 18 playing against Java 7 <br>\ndid not get the full public attention that they deserved.  The issue came <br>\nup again on the mailing list here, but too late for the Isabelle2013 <br>\nrelease.</p>\n<p>It is still to be seen if the tracker will come back for the next <br>\npre-release stage.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
