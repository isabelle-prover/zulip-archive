The alternative PDF reader that is <br>\nbundled with Isabelle2013 on Windows is also very small and fast, and Mac <br>\nOS X had smooth support for PDF from the start.</p>\n<p>So it looks like the time to dismantle alternative DVI (and PS) output <br>\ncould be now, unless someone points out convincing applications of it.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
