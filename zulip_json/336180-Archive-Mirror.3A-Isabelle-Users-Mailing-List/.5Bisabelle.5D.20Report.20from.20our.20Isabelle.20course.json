Maybe some advanced TeX math typesetting in rare<br>\nsituations, where formal text typesetting of Isabelle is not sufficient.<br>\nAt some point there might be a @{math} antiquotation for $...$, which<br>\ncould be translated to HTML by MathJax.</p>\n<p>Actually doing that reform of HTML document preparation will take an<br>\nunspecified time as usual: it might happen tomorrow in or 10 more years.</p>\n<p>In the mean time, authors of Isabelle documentation can update their<br>\nsources to Isabelle markdown + antiquotations as much as possible.
