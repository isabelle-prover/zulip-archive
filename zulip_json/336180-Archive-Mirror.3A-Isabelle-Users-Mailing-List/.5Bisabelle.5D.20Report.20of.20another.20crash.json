It depends a bit what else you are running on that machine.</p>\n<p>The ML_OPTIONS are passed to the poly executable.  Its options are <br>\nexplained further by the executable itself, e.g. like this within the <br>\nrunning Isabelle environment:</p>\n<p>ML ‹Isabelle_System.bash \"\\\"$ML_HOME/poly\\\" --help\"›</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"http://stop-ttip.org\">http://stop-ttip.org</a>  1,232,687 Participants</p>\n<hr>",
