Verified information<br>\nflow security has seen something of a renaissance over the past 5<br>\nyears, with success stories such as seL4 or the more recent mCertiKOS;<br>\nbut concurrency remains an open challenge and one that this project<br>\naims to address for the first time.</p>\n<p>This research will:</p>\n<p>1. design and mechanise logics for verifying the information flow<br>\n      security of concurrent programs, and</p>\n<p>2. apply those logics to verify software running on seL4-based,<br>\n      user-facing critical embedded devices, previously deployed on<br>\n      Defence networks to process and protect classified information.</p>\n<p>Ideal applicants will have prior experience with an interactive<br>\ntheorem prover like Isabelle or Coq, and either knowledge of<br>\nverification techniques for shared memory concurrent programs<br>\n(e.g. rely guarantee, concurrent separation logic, etc.) or<br>\ninformation flow security (noninterference, declassification, etc.).</p>\n<p>The successful applicant will be based at the University of Melbourne<br>\nand work in collaboration with project partners at Data61's<br>\nTrustworthy Systems group in Sydney (<a href=\"http://ts.data61.csiro.au/\">http://ts.data61.csiro.au/</a>) and<br>\nthe Defence Science and Technology Group in Adelaide.</p>\n<p>The position is currently funded for one year, beginning around<br>\nJuly--September 2017, with possible extension beyond 12 months<br>\ncontingent on additional funding.</p>\n<p>Applications close on the 28th of May, Australian Eastern Standard<br>\nTime (AEST, GMT +10 hours), and should be made on-line:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/890645/research-assistant-research-fellow-in-program-verification-security\">http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/890645/research-assistant-research-fellow-in-program-verification-security</a></p>\n<p>Applicants are encouraged to contact me in the first instance.</p>\n<p>Enquiries about the position should be directed to:<br>\n   Toby Murray<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:toby.murray@unimelb.edu.au\">toby.murray@unimelb.edu.au</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/\">http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/</a></p>\n<p>Thanks heaps</p>\n<p>Toby</p>",
