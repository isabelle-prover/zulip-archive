A particular focus of the positions is automated reasoning of<br>\nunintended, emergent program behaviors (e.g., weird machines) and verifying<br>\ntheir non-exploitability. Additional thrusts include verified decompilation<br>\nand verified recompilation.</p>\n<p>PhD graduates in Computer Science/Engineering (or related fields) with a<br>\nbackground and publication record in verification, security, or program<br>\nanalysis are sought. Background in theorem proving, program analysis<br>\ntechniques, low-level system software including assembly code, ISA<br>\nsemantics, and functional programming are highly desirable. The positions<br>\nhave no teaching obligations.</p>\n<p>Interested candidates are requested to contact Prof. Binoy Ravindran (<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:binoy@vt.edu\">binoy@vt.edu</a>) with a CV or for any questions.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nJosh Bockenek</p>",
