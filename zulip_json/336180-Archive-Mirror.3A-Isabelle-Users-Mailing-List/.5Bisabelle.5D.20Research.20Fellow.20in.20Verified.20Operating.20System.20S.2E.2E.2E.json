We are seeking somebody<br>\nwith a research background in formal methods and security.</p>\n<p>You will contribute to the development of methods for reasoning about<br>\ntiming channels in verified operating system kernels, applied to the<br>\nseL4 kernel. Your work will also investigate how to extend seL4’s<br>\nexisting proofs of information flow security, which primarily cover<br>\nstorage channels, to also encompass timing channels.</p>\n<p>Further details about the research project are summarised in the<br>\nfollowing position paper:</p>\n<p>Gernot Heiser, Gerwin Klein and Toby Murray.<br>\n\"Can We Prove Time Protection?\" in Proceedings of the<br>\nWorkshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems (HotOS),<br>\npages 23-29, May 2019.<br>\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08338\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08338</a></p>\n<p>The position is for two years in the first instance, based at the<br>\nUniversity of Melbourne under Dr Toby Murray<br>\n(<a href=\"https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/\">https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/</a>).  You will work with a<br>\nclose-knit team here at University of Melbourne, and collaborate<br>\nheavily with UNSW and Data61’s Trustworthy Systems group, in Sydney.</p>\n<p>Candidates should have experience in at least one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>program verification (e.g. Hoare logic)</li>\n<li>information flow security (e.g. non-interference)</li>\n<li>interactive theorem provers (e.g. Isabelle, Coq, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Applications close on August 30, 11:55pm Australian Eastern Standard<br>\nTime (GMT +10)<br>\n<a href=\"http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/900474/research-fellow-in-verified-operating-system-security\">http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/900474/research-fellow-in-verified-operating-system-security</a></p>\n<p>Informal enquiries should be directed to<br>\n  Toby Murray<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:toby.murray@unimelb.edu.au\">toby.murray@unimelb.edu.au</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/\">https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Toby Murray, DPhil (University of Oxford)<br>\nSenior Lecturer, School of Computing and Information Systems<br>\nUniversity of Melbourne</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/\">https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/</a><br>\n<a href=\"mailto:toby.murray@unimelb.edu.au\">toby.murray@unimelb.edu.au</a></p>",
