The methods will be applied to verify the security<br>\nof seL4-based critical embedded devices.</p>\n<p>The position is for two years in the first instance, based at the<br>\nUniversity of Melbourne under Dr Toby Murray<br>\n(<a href=\"https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/\">https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/</a>). This project will provide<br>\nthe opportunity to collaborate with researchers at Australian National<br>\nUniversity (ANU), Canberra; Data61's Trustworthy Systems Group (the<br>\n\"seL4 team\"), Sydney; and Australia's Defence Science and Technology<br>\n(DST) Group, Brisbane.</p>\n<p>Candidates should have experience in at least one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>program verification (e.g. Hoare logic),</li>\n<li>information flow security,</li>\n<li>interactive proof assistants (e.g. Isabelle, Coq, etc.),</li>\n<li>\n<p>concurrent program verification methods (e.g. Owicki-Gries,<br>\n   Rely-Guarantee, Concurrent Separation Logic, etc.),</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>weak memory consistency models (e.g. x86 TSO, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following are indicative, entry-level salary figures:<br>\n  Research Assistant (Bachelor's graduate): $65K (AUD)<br>\n  Research Assistant (Master's graduate): $71K (AUD)<br>\n  Postdoctoral Research Fellow: $90K (AUD)<br>\nBesides salary, total remuneration also includes 9.5% employer<br>\nsuperannuation contribution.</p>\n<p>Applications close on April 30, 11:55pm Australian Eastern Standard<br>\nTime (GMT +10)</p>\n<p>Further details, including how to apply, are available here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/researcher19-weak-memory.html\">https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/researcher19-weak-memory.html</a></p>\n<p>Informal enquiries should be directed to<br>\n  Toby Murray<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:toby.murray@unimelb.edu.au\">toby.murray@unimelb.edu.au</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/\">https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Toby Murray, DPhil (University of Oxford)<br>\nSenior Lecturer, School of Computing and Information Systems<br>\nUniversity of Melbourne</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/\">https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/</a><br>\n<a href=\"mailto:toby.murray@unimelb.edu.au\">toby.murray@unimelb.edu.au</a></p>",
