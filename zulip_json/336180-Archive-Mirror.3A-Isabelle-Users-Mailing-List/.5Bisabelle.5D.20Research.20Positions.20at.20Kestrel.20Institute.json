Domains that are currently of interest include<br>\nplanning and scheduling, network operations, smart cards, Java analysis, <br>\nmemory<br>\nmanagement, synthetic diversity, computer and network security, security and<br>\ncommunication protocols, embedded controllers, and malware detection.</p>\n<p>Kestrel Institute is a non-profit research center. Our website, <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.kestrel.edu\">www.kestrel.edu</a>,<br>\ndescribes our research. We offer competitive salaries and excellent<br>\nbenefits. All of our researchers are offered opportunities to take on <br>\nproject<br>\nleadership roles, if so inclined.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizenship is a plus.</p>\n<p>Resumes may be submitted by email, fax, or mail to:<br>\nCareers<br>\nReference: Computer Scientist Position<br>\nKestrel Institute<br>\n3260 Hillview Ave.<br>\nPalo Alto, CA 94304<br>\nFax: 650-424-1807<br>\nEmail:<a href=\"mailto:careers@kestrel.edu\">careers@kestrel.edu</a></p>\n<p>Principals only, and no phone calls please.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/xVO9qb8zo4NyRbp7rd3aTdZO/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
