This is a final call for applications in<br>\nthe following project:]</p>\n<p>AI Secure and Explainable by Construction:</p>\n<p>Multiple Research Positions (3 Doctoral, 5 Post-doctoral)</p>\n<p>available at Heriot-Watt, Edinburgh and Strathclyde Universities, Scotland,<br>\nUK.</p>\n<p>Start date: 1 September 2020 or soon after; End date: 2023</p>\n<p>Postdoctoral Salary Scale: £31,866 to £40,322 per annum</p>\n<p>PhD funding: covering PhD fees and stipend for 3.5 years</p>\n<p>We encourage interested applicants to contact us informally ASAP.</p>\n<p>The project has sufficient flexibility to mitigate the effects of COVID-19,<br>\ni.e. by accommodating later start date or remote working.</p>\n<p>The project aims to design novel methods and tools for verification of<br>\ncomplex AI systems. It spans several subjects: type theory, automated and<br>\ninteractive theorem proving, security, AI and machine learning, autonomous<br>\nsystems, natural language processing and generation, legal aspects of AI.<br>\nIt will cover two main application areas: autonomous cars and chatbots,<br>\ndrawing from expertise and infrastructure provided by industrial partners<br>\nworking in these two areas. The project has a significant international<br>\nspan, with 12 partners from Academia and Industry in Europe (France,<br>\nGermany, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway) and the US. Researchers joining<br>\nthis project will have excellent opportunities to travel to international<br>\nconferences, organise scientific events, spend time with industrial<br>\npartners, collaborate with academic leaders in the field, develop their own<br>\nresearch profiles as well as gain experience in other AI and CS disciplines.</p>\n<p>For further information,applications deadlines, and instructions how to<br>\napply, please visit: <a href=\"http://laiv.uk/index.php/vacancies/\">http://laiv.uk/index.php/vacancies/</a></p>\n<p>Ekaterina Komendantskaya: <a href=\"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ek19/\">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ek19/</a></p>\n<p>Robert Atkey: <a href=\"https://bentnib.org/\">https://bentnib.org/</a></p>\n<p>David Aspinall: <a href=\"https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/da/\">https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/da/</a></p>\n<p>Burkard Schafer: <a href=\"https://www.law.ed.ac.uk/people/professor-burkhard-schafer\">https://www.law.ed.ac.uk/people/professor-burkhard-schafer</a><br>\nVerena Rieser: <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/verenateresarieser/\">https://sites.google.com/site/verenateresarieser/</a></p>",
