The position<br>\nis for a project on massively scaling automated verification techniques for<br>\nsecurity protocol verification. Of particular interests are techniques to<br>\nscale up verification for equivalence properties of security protocols<br>\n(covering eg, anonymity, unlinkability, etc). This project will investigate<br>\nthe use of high performance computing (HPC) platform to massively<br>\nparallelise the verification algorithms.</p>\n<p>The deadline for application is 31 January 2020 (11:55pm, Australian<br>\nEastern Time).<br>\nSalary range is A$99,809 - A$113,165 (roughly, US$ 68K - US$ 77K, or 61K<br>\nEuros - 70K Euros).</p>\n<p>Applicants with strong backgrounds in formal methods (SAT/SMT, first-order<br>\ntheorem proving, interactive theorem provers) and programming languages are<br>\npreferred. Experience with implementation of theorem provers is desirable.</p>\n<p>Details of the application procedure can be found at:<br>\n<a href=\"https://jobs.anu.edu.au/en/job/534934/research-fellow\">https://jobs.anu.edu.au/en/job/534934/research-fellow</a></p>\n<p>For further information please contact Alwen Tiu (alwen.tiu at <a href=\"http://anu.edu.au\">anu.edu.au</a>).</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nAlwen Tiu</p>",
