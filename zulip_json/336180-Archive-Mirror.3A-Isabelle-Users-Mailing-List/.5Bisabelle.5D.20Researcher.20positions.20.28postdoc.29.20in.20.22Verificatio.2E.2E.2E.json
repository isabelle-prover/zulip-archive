Similar to what the<br>\nEasyCrypt tool does in classical cryptography. The scope of the project<br>\ncovers everything from the logical foundations, through the development of<br>\ntools, to the verification of real quantum protocols.</p>\n<p>The <em>ideal candidate would have experience in</em>:</p>\n<p>- Semantics<br>\n   - Theorem proving<br>\n   - Verification of classical cryptography<br>\n   - Quantum cryptography<br>\n   - Quantum computation / communication</p>\n<p>Of course, expertise in all those areas is very rare, so candidates who are<br>\nstrong in some of those areas and are interested in the others are<br>\nencouraged to apply!</p>\n<p>Please contact <em>Dominique Unruh &lt;<a href=\"mailto:unruh@ut.ee\">unruh@ut.ee</a> &lt;<a href=\"mailto:unruh@ut.ee\">unruh@ut.ee</a>&gt;&gt;</em> if you have<br>\nmore questions about the project, the required background, Estonia, the<br>\nposition itself, or the application process.</p>\n<p>The <em>salary range is 30000-36000 Euro</em> per year (depending on experience),<br>\nwhich is highly competitive in Estonia due to low costs of living and low<br>\nincome tax rate (20%), pension contributions and health insurance are<br>\ncovered by the employer.</p>\n<p>The position is for three years, <em>September 1, 2017 till August 31, 2020</em>.<br>\nThe starting date and duration can be negotiated (in both directions).</p>\n<p>To apply, please send the following documents to <a href=\"mailto:unruh@ut.ee\">unruh@ut.ee</a>:</p>\n<p>- Curriculum vitae (please explain your scientific background)<br>\n   - List of publications<br>\n   - Research plan (i.e., how do you think you could contribute to the<br>\n   topic)</p>\n<p>- At least two letters of reference (please ask for the letters to be<br>\n   sent directly to us)</p>\n<p>- Phd degree</p>\n<p>The <em>deadline</em> for applications is <em>June 1, 2017</em>, but later applications<br>\ncan be considered.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://crypto.cs.ut.ee/Main/PostdocInVerificationOfQuantumCryptography\">http://crypto.cs.ut.ee/Main/PostdocInVerificationOfQuantumCryptography</a></p>",
