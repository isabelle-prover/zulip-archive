Similar to what the EasyCrypt tool does in classical <br>\ncryptography. The scope of the project covers everything from the <br>\nlogical foundations, through the development of tools, to the <br>\nverification of real quantum protocols.</p>\n<p>The <em>ideal candidate</em> would have experience in:</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Semantics</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Theorem proving</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Verification of classical cryptography</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Quantum cryptography</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Quantum computation / communication</p>\n<p>Of course, expertise in all those areas is very rare, so candidates who <br>\nare strong in some of those areas and are interested in the others are <br>\nencouraged to apply!</p>\n<p>Please contact <em>Dominique Unruh &lt;unruh@ut.ee&gt;</em> if you have more <br>\nquestions about the project, the required background, Estonia, the <br>\nposition itself, or the application process. I can also provide a <br>\ndetailed description of the overall research project.</p>\n<p>The <em>salary range is 30000-36000 Euro</em> per year (depending on <br>\nexperience), which is highly competitive in Estonia due to low costs of <br>\nliving and low income tax rate (20%), pension contributions and health <br>\ninsurance are covered by the employer.</p>\n<p>Applications are accepted at any time (until all positions are filled), <br>\nand positions can start as soon as possible. Positions are for 2-3 years <br>\n(up to negotiation).</p>\n<p><em>To apply</em>, please send the following documents to <a href=\"mailto:unruh@ut.ee\">unruh@ut.ee</a>:</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Curriculum vitae (please explain your scientific background)</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>List of publications</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Research plan (i.e., how do you think you could contribute to the topic)</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>At least two letters of reference (please ask for the letters to be<br>\n    sent directly to us)</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Phd degree</p>\n<p>Please apply as soon as possible.</p>",
