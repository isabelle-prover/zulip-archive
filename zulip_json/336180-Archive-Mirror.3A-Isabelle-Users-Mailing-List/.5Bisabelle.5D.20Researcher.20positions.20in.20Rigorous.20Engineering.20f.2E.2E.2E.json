REMS (Rigorous Engineering for Mainstream Systems)<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/</a>) is a 6-year EPSRC-funded<br>\nProgramme Grant to do just that, bringing together an exciting<br>\ncombination of researchers in systems (architecture, operating<br>\nsystems, and networks) and in semantics (programming languages,<br>\nautomated reasoning, and verification) at three UK universities:<br>\nCambridge, Imperial, and Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>We want to understand how to build accurate full-scale mathematical<br>\nmodels of some of the key computational abstractions (processor<br>\narchitectures, programming languages, and concurrent OS interfaces),<br>\nand how these can be used for new verification research, to build<br>\ntools that are applicable to real systems, and to enable new systems<br>\nand programming language research. Supporting all this, we are also<br>\nworking on new specification tools and their foundations.</p>\n<p>If you have a keen interest in developing and applying rigorous<br>\nmethods for real-world systems, we'd like to hear from you. At the<br>\nCambridge site, we're looking to appoint several researcher and<br>\nresearch-engineer staff: up to four postdocs and two research<br>\nengineers (we will also be looking to appoint researchers at the<br>\nImperial site, advertised separately). We're looking for people who<br>\nhave a strong background in systems, in semantics, or in both, and who<br>\nwant to develop research that integrates theory and practice,<br>\ncontributing to ongoing research and initiating new subprojects. You<br>\nshould have expertise in one or more of the following, on the<br>\nsemantics side:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Programming Language and Processor Semantics and Type Systems</li>\n<li>Automated Reasoning Tools, including Interactive Proof Assistants</li>\n<li>Concurrency</li>\n<li>Program Verification</li>\n<li>Static and Dynamic Analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and/or the following, on the systems side:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Computer Architecture</li>\n<li>Operating Systems</li>\n<li>Security</li>\n<li>Compilers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have four postdoctoral researcher positions available. For these<br>\npositions you should have a PhD (which should be submitted by the<br>\nstart date) or equivalent experience. For candidates with exceptional<br>\nexperience it may be possible to appoint on the Senior Research<br>\nAssociate scale (£37,382-£47,314); for this you should also have the<br>\nability to assist with project coordination.</p>\n<p>We also have two research engineer positions available, which will be<br>\non the Research Assistant scale. Candidates for these should have an<br>\nexcellent first degree. One of the positions has a tenure of three<br>\nyears; in some cases it may be possible to combine this with PhD<br>\nstudy. The limit of tenure for the other position is one year; this<br>\nmay suit someone who is thinking of going on to a PhD later.</p>\n<p>The positions are funded by the EPSRC grant EP/K008528<br>\n(<a href=\"http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K008528/1\">http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K008528/1</a>), led<br>\nby Peter Sewell (<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/</a>). Further details of<br>\nthe project are at <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/</a>. Enquiries can<br>\nbe addressed to any of the investigators, listed there.</p>\n<p>Those involved in the project include researchers in semantics and<br>\nsystems at Cambridge: Mike Gordon, Magnus Myreen, Andrew Pitts, and<br>\nPeter Sewell (PI) for the former, and Jon Crowcroft, Steve Hand, Anil<br>\nMadhavapeddy, Simon Moore, and Robert Watson for the latter, together<br>\nwith Philippa Gardner at Imperial College London and Ian Stark at the<br>\nUniversity of Edinburgh. Also involved are Mike Dodds (York), Susmit<br>\nSarkar (St. Andrews) and Scott Owens (Kent). Project partners include<br>\nARM, IBM, Microsoft Research, the FreeBSD foundation, INRIA,<br>\nU. Pennsylvania, Purdue University, and U. Texas Austin.</p>\n<p>Applications should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a Curriculum Vitae</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a brief statement of the particular contributions you would like to<br>\n  make to the project</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a completed form CHRIS6: <a href=\"http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/hr/forms/chris6/\">http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/hr/forms/chris6/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the names and contact details (postal and e-mail addresses) of two<br>\n  or three referees who, if asked, will be able to provide references<br>\n  promptly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start date: as soon as possible. The project runs until end February 2019.</p>\n<p>For the postdoctoral researcher positions, please quote reference:<br>\nNR27842.  Closing date: 15 May 2013; salary: £27,854-£36,298 pa.</p>\n<p>For the research engineer positions, please quote reference NR27832.<br>\nClosing date: 14 May 2013; salary: £24,049-£27,047 pa.  Please<br>\nindicate the length tenure for which you are applying (one or three<br>\nyears).</p>",
