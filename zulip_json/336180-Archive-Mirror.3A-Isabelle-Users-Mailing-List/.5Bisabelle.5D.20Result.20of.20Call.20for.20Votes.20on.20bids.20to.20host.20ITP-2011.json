The<br>\nresult was computed using VoteEngine 0.99, downloaded from<br>\n<a href=\"http://vote.sourceforge.net/\">http://vote.sourceforge.net/</a>, and the output is shown below.  (I also<br>\nwrote my own little program to compute each round and checked that its<br>\nresults completely agreed with those of VoteEngine.  I also checked<br>\nand fixed spelling typos.)</p>\n<p>Congratulations to the team from The Netherlands on its winning bid!<br>\nAnd thank you to all of those who submitted bids, which we found to be<br>\nvery impressive.</p>\n<p>In the output below, we have of course:</p>\n<p>C = China<br>\nD = Denmark<br>\nN = Netherlands<br>\nS = Spain<br>\nU = USA</p>\n<p>..........</p>\n<p>VOTES   61<br>\nIRV<br>\nCand  Plurality score<br>\nN           12<br>\nS            9<br>\nC           17<br>\nD            9<br>\nU           14</p>\n<p>Unresolved Tie</p>\n<p>..........</p>\n<p>So I resolved the tie by branching: In one run, I removed Spain while<br>\nin the other, I instead removed Denmark.  The respective results are<br>\nbelow.  (Note: 3 people voted only for Denmark while 1 person voted<br>\nonly for Spain, which explains the discrepancy in \"VOTES\".)</p>\n<p>.......... removing Spain: ..........</p>\n<p>VOTES   60<br>\nIRV<br>\nCand  Plurality score<br>\nN           17<br>\nC           17<br>\nD           11<br>\nU           15</p>\n<p>Cand  Plurality score<br>\nN           20<br>\nC           21<br>\nU           16</p>\n<p>Cand  Plurality score<br>\nN           33<br>\nC           24</p>\n<p>Winner N</p>\n<p>.......... removing Denmark: ..........</p>\n<p>VOTES   58<br>\nIRV<br>\nCand  Plurality score<br>\nN           13<br>\nS           11<br>\nC           19<br>\nU           15</p>\n<p>Cand  Plurality score<br>\nN           20<br>\nC           21<br>\nU           16</p>\n<p>Cand  Plurality score<br>\nN           33<br>\nC           24</p>\n<p>Winner N</p>\n<p>..........</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nMatt Kaufmann (and Larry Paulson; ITP-10 co-chairs)</p>",
