When it does<br>\nfinish, it prints out a termination order.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to make use of the found termination order to shorten the<br>\nre-processing of the theory file when I make changes that wouldn't affect<br>\nthe termination proof?</p>\n<p>I have tried to do proof(relation &lt;termination order&gt;) and some of the<br>\ngoals are easy to prove uniformly (with  wf_mlex, mlex_less and auto) but<br>\nsome of the goals need individual attention (and there are a lot of them).</p>\n<p>Cheers</p>\n<p>Mark</p>",
