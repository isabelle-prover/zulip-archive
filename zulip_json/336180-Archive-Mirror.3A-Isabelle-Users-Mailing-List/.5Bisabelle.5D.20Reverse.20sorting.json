Douglas Maurer\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:maurer@email.gwu.edu\">maurer@email.gwu.edu</a>&gt;<br>\nYour question has an answer that is independent of any specific system such as Isabelle. Any sorting algorithm has a parameter which is a Boolean comparison function of two arguments. Let's call the function LEQ, and let's call the arguments A and B. Typically LEQ(A, B) returns true if A &lt;= B in some sense, and it returns false otherwise. To do a reverse sort, simply redefine LEQ(A, B) to return true if A &gt;= B in that same sense, and to return false otherwise. Now call your sort program with the new LEQ as its actual parameter, and you will automatically get a reverse sort.</p>\n<p>Sent from my iPhone</p>",
