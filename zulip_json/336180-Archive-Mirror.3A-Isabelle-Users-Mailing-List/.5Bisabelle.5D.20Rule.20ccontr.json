Looking through the library, I see over four <br>\ndozen uses of (rule ccontr) in proofs. Yet there are some proofs by <br>\ncontradiction in which (rule ccontr) is not used, and in which, in <br>\nfact, it wouldn't work if it were used. In particular, step 5 of the <br>\nproof of Cantor's theorem in \"A Tutorial Introduction to Structured <br>\nIsar Proofs\" is of this form; it is just the word \"proof\" by itself. <br>\nSo my question is: When do you use (rule ccontr), and when don't you <br>\nuse that rule? What are the criteria? -Douglas</p>",
