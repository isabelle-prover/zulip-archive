Unfortunately, in spite of our excellent speakers and their interesting programming language topics, this high-capacity room will be <br>\nhalf empty, hence the desperation. Registration is still open (and free).  </p>\n<p>All the best, <br>\n  Andrei </p>\n<p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br>\n<br>\n                  CALL FOR PARTICIPATION<br>\n<br>\nSouth of England Regional Programming Language Seminar (S-REPLS)<br>\n<br>\n                (Second Meeting)<br>\n<br>\n            Friday, 20th November 2015<br>\n<br>\n    Middlesex University, Hendon, London NW4 4BT</p>\n<p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=</p>\n<p>S-REPLS is a new and informal meeting for those with a professional interest in programming languages-whether it be academic or commercial-in the South of England region.
