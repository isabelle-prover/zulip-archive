My email client seems to be confused due to all the wifi connections/disconnections.</p>\n<p>SAT4J and SAT4J_Light do not rely on JNI, which is a technology for running binaries, which is always a risky undertaking. I suspect the issue is simply that you are using 64-bit Windows, and for all I know you might be the first user of Nitpick to do so. If you want to debug this further, I suggest we try a debugging session together (e.g. via Skype). Please let me know privately and we can set a time.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
