Eight page papers are due May 15, <br>\n2009. Details on paper submission follow the general description of the <br>\nworkshop below.</p>\n<p>Theme and Topics of Interest</p>\n<p>SAVCBS is focused on using formal (i.e., mathematical) techniques to <br>\nestablish a foundation for the specification and verification of <br>\ncomponent-based systems. Specification techniques are urgently needed<br>\nto support effective reasoning about systems composed from components. <br>\nComponent-based approaches also underscore the need for scaling advanced <br>\nverification techniques such as extended static analysis and model <br>\nchecking to the size of real systems. The workshop will consider <br>\nformalization of both functional and non-functional behavior (such as <br>\nperformance or reliability). Suggested research topics of interest <br>\ninclude (but are not limited to):</p>\n<p>* Techniques for component-based verification or reasoning<br>\n   * Component-based specification languages<br>\n   * Static analysis of components and component compositions<br>\n   * Verification-oriented design methodologies for components<br>\n   * Dynamic checking techniques, including run-time assertion or<br>\n     property checking</p>\n<p>* Specification and verification of non-functional component<br>\n     behavior (performance, memory, concurrency, etc.)</p>\n<p>* Unifying formal descriptions of concurrency properties with<br>\n     model-based behavioral descriptions of components</p>\n<p>* Balancing tradeoffs (automatic/manual verification,<br>\n     soundness/completeness, static/dynamic verification,<br>\n     testing/formal verification, scalability/coverage, etc.)</p>\n<p>* Theories of component composition<br>\n   * Industrial experience, such as adoption issues, with formal<br>\n     techniques for component-based systems</p>\n<p>* Case studies of applying formal techniques to component based systems<br>\n   * Educational experience or tactics for formal approaches to<br>\n     component-based systems</p>\n<p>Submissions should outline the current state of research or practice, <br>\ndescribe the most pressing shortcomings, and formulate goals for future <br>\ndevelopment.</p>\n<p>Challenge Problem</p>\n<p>One session during the workshop will be devoted to presenting solutions <br>\n(full or partial) to a challenge problem. This problem will present <br>\nfeatures that pose difficulties for current specification technologies. <br>\nThe session will be open both to presenters as well as participants of <br>\nthe workshop. Details on the challenge problem will be posted at <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/SAVCBS/2009/challenge.shtml\">http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/SAVCBS/2009/challenge.shtml</a>. Solutions should <br>\nillustrate innovative features of specification or verification as they <br>\npertain to this particular problem.</p>\n<p>Submissions</p>\n<p>Submissions must not exceed 8 pages. We encourage, but do not require, <br>\nuse of the ACM Conference format. We also suggest that you add page <br>\nnumbers to your submission, to make adding comments easier. Papers will <br>\nbe accepted in PDF or Postscript formats. Papers may be submitted <br>\non-line at <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=savcbs09\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=savcbs09</a> . We are <br>\nconsidering to invite best papers for submission to a journal special issue.</p>\n<p>Important dates:</p>\n<p>Paper submission deadline: May 15, 2009<br>\n        Notification date: June 10, 2009<br>\n        Final versions: June 20, 2009</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/SAVCBS/\">http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/SAVCBS/</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>Workshop Program Committee:<br>\nMarieke Huisman - University of Twente, Netherlands (chair)<br>\nJonathan Aldrich - Carnegie Mellon University, USA<br>\nMarsha Chechik - University of Toronto, Canada<br>\nJens Chr.
