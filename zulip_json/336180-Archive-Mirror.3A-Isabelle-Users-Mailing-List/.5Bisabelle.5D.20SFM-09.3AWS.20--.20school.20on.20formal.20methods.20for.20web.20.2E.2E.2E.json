It can be reached in a couple of<br>\nhours from the international airport \"G. Marconi\" of Bologna by<br>\nshuttle (from the airport to the railway station) + train (from<br>\nBologna to Forli<code>) + bus (from the railway station to Bertinoro)\nor taxi. The closest airport is the \"L. Ridolfi\" airport of Forli</code>,<br>\nwhich is 13 km away.</p>\n<p>Bertinoro is close to many splendid locations such as Urbino,<br>\nGradara, San Leo, and the Republic of San Marino, as well as some<br>\nless well-known locations like the thermal springs of Fratta Terme.</p>\n<p>Bertinoro can also be a base for visiting some of the better-known<br>\nItalian locations such as Bologna, Ravenna, Ferrara, Venezia,<br>\nPadova, Verona, Firenze, Pisa, and Siena.</p>\n<p>Bertinoro itself is picturesque, with its narrow streets and<br>\nwalkways winding around the central peak. The school will be held<br>\nat the Centro Residenziale Universitario (CRU), an ex-episcopal<br>\nfortress that has been converted by the University of Bologna into<br>\na modern conference center with computing facilities and Internet<br>\naccess. From the fortress it is possible to enjoy a beautiful vista<br>\nstretching from the Apennines to the Adriatic coast and the Alps<br>\nover the Po Valley.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZATION<br>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>\n<p>Scientific directors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marco Bernardo (University of Urbino - Italy)</li>\n<li>Luca Padovani (University of Urbino - Italy)</li>\n<li>Gianluigi Zavattaro (University of Bologna - Italy)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Secretary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monica Michelacci (CRU Bertinoro - Italy)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Webmaster:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alessandro Aldini (University of Urbino - Italy)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>APPLICATION<br>\n^^^^^^^^^^^</p>\n<p>Prospective participants should send by 16 March 2009<br>\nthe application form, available on the school web site,<br>\nto the two e-mail addresses below:</p>\n<p>Marco Bernardo<br>\n  bernardo AT <a href=\"http://sti.uniurb.it\">sti.uniurb.it</a></p>\n<p>Monica Michelacci<br>\n  mmichelacci AT <a href=\"http://ceub.it\">ceub.it</a></p>\n<p>by specifying in the form whether a grant is requested to cover<br>\npart of the registration fee (no grant can be requested to cover<br>\nthe accommodation fee or the travel expenses).</p>\n<p>The registration fee is 550 euros and includes the school material.</p>\n<p>The accommodation fee is 350 euros and covers the period May 31/June 7<br>\n(7 nights) in double room (to share with another participant),<br>\nhalf board (breakfast and lunch, dinner of May 31 included,<br>\nlunch of June 7 excluded).</p>\n<p>The reduced accommodation fee for the participants who do not<br>\nneed a room is 100 euros and covers the period June 1-6<br>\n(6 lunches).</p>\n<p>Notification of accepted/rejected applications and grant requests<br>\nwill be communicated by March 19.</p>\n<p>Registration to the school is due by April 10.</p>\n<p>No refund is possible for cancellation after April 30.</p>\n<p>SPONSORSHIPS<br>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>\n<p>Sponsorship for this event was kindly provided by the University<br>\nof Bologna under the International Summer School Programme.</p>",
