These two ingredients together make SMT<br>\ntechniques well-suited for use in larger automated reasoning and<br>\nformal verification efforts.</p>\n<p>Aims and Scope</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and users of<br>\nSMT tools and techniques. Continuing with the PDPAR tradition, we<br>\nespecially encourage submission of papers focused on pragmatic<br>\naspects. Relevant topics include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New decision procedures and new theories of interest</li>\n<li>Combination of decision procedures</li>\n<li>Novel implementation techniques</li>\n<li>Benchmarks and evaluation methodologies</li>\n<li>Applications and case studies</li>\n<li>Theoretical results</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission deadline                  : May 22, 2009<br>\nNotification of acceptance/rejection : June 22, 2009<br>\nFinal version due                    : June 29, 2009<br>\nWorkshop                             : August 2-3, 2009</p>\n<p>Paper Submission and Proceedings </p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Extended abstracts: contain preliminary report of work in progress.<br>\n  These will be judged based on the expected level of interest for the<br>\n  SMT community. They will be included in the informal proceedings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Original papers: contain original research (simultaneous submissions<br>\n  are not allowed) and sufficient detail to assess the merits and<br>\n  relevance of the submission. For papers reporting experimental<br>\n  results, authors are strongly encouraged to make their data available. <br>\n  Work in progress is welcome. Papers in this category will be included <br>\n  in the informal proceedings and published after the workshop in the<br>\n  ACM International Conference Proceedings Series (ISBN 978-1-60558-484-3).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Presentation-only papers: describe work recently published or<br>\n  submitted and will not be included in the proceedings. We see this<br>\n  as a way to provide additional access to important developments that<br>\n  SMT Workshop attendees may be unaware of.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers in all three categories will be peer-reviewed. Papers should not<br>\nexceed 10 pages (Postscript or PDF) and should be written in LaTeX,<br>\n11pt, one column, a4paper, standard margins. Technical details may be<br>\nincluded in an appendix to be read at the reviewers' discretion. Full<br>\nsubmission guidelines are at the workshop web page.</p>\n<p>Workshop Chairs</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bruno Dutertre       SRI International<br>\nOfer Strichman       Technion</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Domagoj Babic<br>\nClark Barrett        New York University<br>\nArmin Biere          Johannes Kepler University<br>\nAaron Bradley        CU Colorado<br>\nSylvain Conchon      Paris Sud University<br>\nLeonardo de Moura    Microsoft Research<br>\nDaniel Kroening      Oxford University<br>\nSava Krstic          Intel Corporation<br>\nRobert Nieuwenhuis   Technical University of Catalonia<br>\nSilvio Ranise        LORIA, Nancy<br>\nRoberto Sebastiani   Universita di Trento<br>\nCesare Tinelli       University of Iowa</p>",
