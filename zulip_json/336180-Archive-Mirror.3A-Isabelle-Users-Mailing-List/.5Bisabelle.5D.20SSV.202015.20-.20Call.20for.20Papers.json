However, many techniques are working under restrictive<br>\nassumptions that are invalidated by complex embedded systems software<br>\nsuch as operating system kernels, low-level device drivers, or<br>\nmicrocontroller code.</p>\n<p>The aim of this conference is to bring together researchers and<br>\ndevelopers from both academia and industry who are facing real software<br>\nand real problems with the goal of finding real, applicable solutions.<br>\nBy “real” we mean problems such as time-to-market or reliability that<br>\nthe industry is facing. A real solution is one that is applicable to the<br>\nproblem in industry and not one that only applies to an abstract,<br>\nacademic, toy version of it. In this event we will discuss software<br>\nanalysis and development techniques and tools; this forum will serve as<br>\na platform to discuss open problems and future challenges in dealing<br>\nwith existing and upcoming systems-level code.</p>\n<p>Topics include, but are not restricted to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Model checking</li>\n<li>Automated and interactive theorem proving</li>\n<li>Static analysis and type systems</li>\n<li>Automated testing</li>\n<li>Model-driven development</li>\n<li>Concurrency</li>\n<li>Security</li>\n<li>Embedded systems development</li>\n<li>Programming languages</li>\n<li>Verifying compilers</li>\n<li>Software certification</li>\n<li>Software tools</li>\n<li>Experience reports</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions</p>\n<p>Submissions must be made electronically through the EasyChair system<br>\nuntil September 28th, 2015. Papers should be up to 10 pages in pdf<br>\nformat and formatted in EPTCS style [http://info.eptcs.org]. Additional<br>\ndetails may be included in a clearly marked appendix, which will be read<br>\nat the discretion of the program committee. All will be subject to peer<br>\nreview under normal conference standards. Experience reports and papers<br>\non work in progress are welcome as long as there is a clear<br>\ncontribution. Submissions which are based or discuss a non-trivial piece<br>\nof software are required to make all those non-standard software parts<br>\navailable, which a referee may need, in order to check the claims of the<br>\nsubmission.</p>\n<p>Submitted papers must not have previously appeared in a journal or<br>\nconference with published proceedings and must not be concurrently<br>\nsubmitted to any other peer-reviewed workshop, symposium, conference or<br>\narchival journal. Any partial overlap with any such published or<br>\nconcurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated.</p>\n<p>Proceedings</p>\n<p>Proceedings will be published as an issue in Electronic Proceedings in<br>\nTheoretical Computer Science.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Jade Alglave, University College London<br>\nEzio Bartocci, TU Wien<br>\nAndrew Butterfield, Lero, Trinity College Dublin<br>\nFranck Cassez, Macquarie University<br>\nAna Cavalcanti, University of York<br>\nMads Dam, KTH Royal Institute of Technology<br>\nAlastair Donaldson, Imperial College London<br>\nStefania Gnesi, ISTI<br>\nChris Hawblitzel, Microsoft Research<br>\nJérome Hugues, ISAE<br>\nLimin Jia, CMU<br>\nTiziana Margaria, Lero, University of Limerick<br>\nToby Murray, NICTA and UNSW (Co-Chair)<br>\nJohn Regehr, University of Utah<br>\nDavid Sanán, NTU (Co-Chair)<br>\nKonrad Slind, Rockwell Collins<br>\nJun Sun, SUTD<br>\nAlwen Tiu, NTU<br>\nMark van den Brand, Eindhoven University of Technology</p>\n<p>Steering Committee</p>\n<p>Ralf Huuck, NICTA and UNSW<br>\nGerwin Klein, NICTA and UNSW<br>\nBastian Schlich, ABB Corporate Research</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
