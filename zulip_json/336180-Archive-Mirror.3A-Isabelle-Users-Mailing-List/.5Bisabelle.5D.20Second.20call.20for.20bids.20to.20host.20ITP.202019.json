This message concerns the first phase. A<br>\nlong-standing ITP/TPHOLs<br>\nconvention is that the conference should be held on a continent different<br>\nfrom the location of the previous meeting. For 2019, we therefore solicit<br>\nbids from prospective hosts located outside Europe. Similar to previous<br>\nyears, we expect bids to propose a date in July, August or September.</p>\n<p>Bids should be sent to <a href=\"mailto:itp2018@easychair.org\">itp2018@easychair.org</a> and should include at least<br>\nthe following information:</p>\n<p>• name and email address of a contact person<br>\n• names of other people involved<br>\n• address of website for the bid<br>\n• approximate dates of the conference<br>\n• structure (e.g., k workshop days and n days of presentations, excursion,<br>\netc.)<br>\n• advantages of the proposed venue</p>\n<p>Example of previous winning bids follow:</p>\n<p>• <a href=\"http://itp2011.cs.ru.nl/ITP2011/Bid_ITP11.html\">http://itp2011.cs.ru.nl/ITP2011/Bid_ITP11.html</a><br>\n• <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/itp2012/bid.html\">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/itp2012/bid.html</a><br>\n• <a href=\"http://www.irisa.fr/celtique/blazy/bid-itp13.html\">http://www.irisa.fr/celtique/blazy/bid-itp13.html</a></p>\n<p>The deadline for bids is Friday, March 2, 2018. Shortly after, all admitted<br>\nbids will be made public and the voting phase will take place. The people<br>\neligible to vote are those who are seriously considering attending ITP 2019.</p>",
