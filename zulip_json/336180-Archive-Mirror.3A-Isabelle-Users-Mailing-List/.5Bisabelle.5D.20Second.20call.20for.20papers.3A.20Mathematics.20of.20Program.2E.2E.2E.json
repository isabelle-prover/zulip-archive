Topics<br>\nof interest range from algorithmics to support for program<br>\nconstruction in programming languages and systems.</p>\n<p>The previous conferences were held in Twente, The Netherlands (1989),<br>\nOxford, UK (1992), Kloster Irsee, Germany (1995), Marstrand, Sweden<br>\n(1998), Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000), Dagstuhl, Germany (2002),<br>\nStirling, UK (2004, colocated with AMAST '04), Kuressaare, Estonia<br>\n(2006, colocated with AMAST '06) and Marseille, France (2008).<br>\nThe 2010 conference will be held in Lac-Beauport, a suburb of Québec<br>\nCity, Canada, and will be colocated with AMAST '10 (23-26 June 2010).</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<p>Roland Backhouse, University of Nottingham, UK.<br>\nOthers to be announced later.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>* Submission of abstracts: 7 December 2009<br>\n     * Submission of full papers: 14 December 2009<br>\n     * Notification of authors: 20 February 2010<br>\n     * Camera-ready version: 20 March 2010</p>\n<p>TOPICS</p>\n<p>Papers are solicited on mathematical methods and tools put to use in<br>\nprogram construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to<br>\nsupport for program construction in programming languages and<br>\nsystems. Some typical areas are type systems, program analysis and<br>\ntransformation, programming-language semantics, security and program<br>\nlogics. Theoretical contributions are welcome provided their relevance<br>\nfor program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome<br>\nprovided their mathematical basis is evident.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<p>Submission is in two stages. Abstracts (plain text, 10 to 20 lines)<br>\nmust be submitted by 7 December 2009. Full papers (pdf) adhering to<br>\nthe LaTeX llncs style must be submitted by 14 December 2009. There<br>\nis no official page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.<br>\nThe web-based system EasyChair will be used for submission<br>\n(<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=mpc2010\">https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=mpc2010</a>).</p>\n<p>Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted<br>\nconcurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. In<br>\nparticular, they must not be submitted to AMAST 2010. Accepted<br>\npapers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.</p>\n<p>The proceedings of MPC'10 will be published in the Lecture Notes in<br>\nComputer Science series of Springer-Verlag.</p>\n<p>After the conference, the authors of the best papers will be invited<br>\nto submit revised versions to a special issue of the Science of<br>\nComputer Programming journal of Elsevier.</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>Jules Desharnais         Université Laval, Québec, Canada (chair)</p>\n<p>Philippe Audebaud        Ecole Normale Supérieure Lyon, France<br>\nRalph-Johan Back         Abo Akademi University, Finland<br>\nEerke Boiten             University of Kent, UK<br>\nSharon Curtis            Oxford Brookes University, UK<br>\nJeremy Gibbons           University of Oxford, UK<br>\nLindsay Groves           Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand<br>\nIan Hayes                University of Queensland, Australia<br>\nEric Hehner              University of Toronto, Canada<br>\nZhenjiang Hu             National Institute of Informatics, Japan<br>\nJohan Jeuring            Utrecht University, Netherlands<br>\nChristian Lengauer       Universität Passau, Germany<br>\nBernhard Möller          Universität Augsburg, Germany<br>\nShin-Cheng Mu            Academia Sinica, Taiwan<br>\nDavid Naumann            Stevens Institute of Technology, USA<br>\nJosé Nuno Oliveira       Universidade do Minho, Portugal<br>\nAlberto Pardo            Universidad de la República, Uruguay<br>\nChristine Paulin-Mohring INRIA-Université Paris-Sud, France<br>\nSteve Reeves             University of Waikato, New Zealand<br>\nTim Sheard               Portland State University, USA<br>\nGeorg Struth             Sheffield University, UK<br>\nTarmo Uustalu            Institute of Cybernetics, Estonia</p>\n<p>VENUE</p>\n<p>The conference will be held in the Manoir St-Castin<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.hotelsvillegia.com/villegia_stcastin/pages-eg/\">http://www.hotelsvillegia.com/villegia_stcastin/pages-eg/</a>).<br>\nThis resort is located on the shore of Beauport lake,<br>\n15 minutes from downtown Québec City (<a href=\"http://www.quebecregion.com/e/\">http://www.quebecregion.com/e/</a>)<br>\nand 15 minutes from the Jean-Lesage International Airport.</p>\n<p>LOCAL ORGANIZERS</p>\n<p>The local organizers are Claude Bolduc, Jules Desharnais and Béchir Ktari.</p>\n<p>Enquiries regarding the programme (submission, etc.) should be addressed<br>\nto <a href=\"mailto:Jules.Desharnais@ift.ulaval.ca\">Jules.Desharnais@ift.ulaval.ca</a>.</p>",
