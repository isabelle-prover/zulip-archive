However, currently such a locale does not exist <br>\n(only a locale for rings is defined, which rules out the natural numbers), one cannot conveniently study <br>\nthe semiring of matrices of the natural numbers. </p>\n<p>To this end, I would like to modify the locale-structure in HOL-algebra as follows:</p>\n<p>An additional locale semiring:</p>\n<p>locale semiring = abelian_monoid R + monoid R for R (structure) +<br>\n  assumes l_distr: \"[| x ∈ carrier R; y ∈ carrier R; z ∈ carrier R |]<br>\n      ==&gt; (x ⊕ y) ⊗ z = x ⊗ z ⊕ y ⊗ z\"<br>\n    and r_distr: \"[| x ∈ carrier R; y ∈ carrier R; z ∈ carrier R |]<br>\n      ==&gt; z ⊗ (x ⊕ y) = z ⊗ x ⊕ z ⊗ y\"<br>\n    and l_null[simp]: \"x ∈ carrier R ==&gt; 𝟬 ⊗ x = 𝟬\"<br>\n    and r_null[simp]: \"x ∈ carrier R ==&gt; x ⊗ 𝟬 = 𝟬\"</p>\n<p>Prove the sublocale-property:</p>\n<p>context ring</p>\n<p>sublocale ring &lt;= semiring </p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Prove several properties like finsum_ldistr already in semiring.</p>\n<p>Of course, I can also just copy HOL/Algebra/Ring and modify it locally, <br>\nbut I believe that semirings should be valuable for other Isabelle users, too.</p>\n<p>If desired, I can update a recent repository version and discuss this change further on Isabelle-dev.</p>\n<p>Any comments are welcome,<br>\nRené</p>",
