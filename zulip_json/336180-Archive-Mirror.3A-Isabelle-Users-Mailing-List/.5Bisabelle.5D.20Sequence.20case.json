So you need to use the HOLCF continuous application <br>\noperator with it, which is written as an infix $ or \\&lt;cdot&gt; in xsymbol <br>\nsyntax. Similarly for the HD constant, which you will also probably need.</p>\n<p>The term \"HD $ (Filter (%x. fst(x)=a) $ xs)\" returns a value of type ('a * 'b) <br>\nlift, which is probably pretty close to what you want.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brian</li>\n</ul>",
