The syntax makes it tempting to write:</p>\n<p>session my_session = parent1 + parent2 +<br>\n       ...</p>\n<p>However, this is invalid. So I typically achieve what I want with an intermediate base session:</p>\n<p>session intermediate = parent1 +<br>\n       ... (* definition of parent2 repeated *)</p>\n<p>session my_session = intermediate +<br>\n       ...</p>\n<p>This works, but if theories in 'parent2' change, I end up effectively rebuilding its heap image<br>\ntwice. Also, if someone changes the definition of 'parent2' and I fail to notice and update my<br>\ncorresponding definition of 'intermediate' unexpected things may happen in future.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to achieve this without an intermediate session? Failing that, is there a more robust<br>\nway to specify this intermediate session? It's possible I'm just not being creative enough in how<br>\nI'm choosing to define these sessions.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your time,<br>\nMatthew</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
