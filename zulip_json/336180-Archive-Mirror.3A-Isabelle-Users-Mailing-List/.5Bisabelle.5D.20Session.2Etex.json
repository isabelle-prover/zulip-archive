All of it  <br>\nworks fine, except that now I want to use each individual document as  <br>\npart of a larger piece of work.  The problem is that when the Isabelle  <br>\nmake process completes successfully, I end up with a pdf, and the  <br>\ngenerated session.tex seems to disappear.  Does it disappear?  If not,  <br>\nwhere does the Isabelle make process put it?  The way I'm doing things  <br>\nat the minute is deliberately leaving a LaTeX error in the theory  <br>\nfile, which will then allow me to access the .tex files.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Peter</p>",
