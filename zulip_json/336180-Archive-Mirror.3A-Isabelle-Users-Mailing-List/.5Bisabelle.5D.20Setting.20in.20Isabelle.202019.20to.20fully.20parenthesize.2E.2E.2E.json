I understand that this document is marked as an old<br>\ntutorial on the Isabelle web site:<br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2019/doc/tutorial.pdf\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2019/doc/tutorial.pdf</a></p>\n<p>and thus it may contain some information that does not apply to Isabelle<br>\n2019.</p>\n<p>I saw the following text in that older tutorial, on page 6:</p>\n<p>\"A particular problem for novices can be the priority of operators. If you<br>\nare unsure, use additional parentheses. In those cases where Isabelle<br>\nechoes your input, you can see which parentheses are dropped — they were<br>\nsuperfluous. If you are unsure how to interpret Isabelle’s output because<br>\nyou don’t know where the (dropped) parentheses go, set the Proof General<br>\nflag Isabelle &gt; Settings &gt; Show Brackets\"</p>\n<p>I have looked through the settings I could find in the Mac and Linux<br>\nversions of Isabelle 2019, and tried doing some Google searches through the<br>\narchives of this email list, but have not found anything that looks similar.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to cause Isabelle 2019 output to fully parenthesize<br>\nexpressions, so that the order of operations can be determined without<br>\nknowing anything about operator precedence rules?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nAndy</p>\n<p>1.</p>",

This can be useful if you just want to understand one <br>\nparticular subgoal.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",
