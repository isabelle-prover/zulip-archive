You will not need these immediately and they may not even be relevant to your logic.</p>\n<p>IFOL.thy then introduces a type o of truth values for the formalism being defined. We do not of course identify this with the \"real\" type of truth values. The judgement Trueprop mediates between the two levels, and Trueprop(P) is most easily interpreted as \"P == True\".</p>\n<p>Then, the logical constants are introduced. The inference rules governing them are then introduced as axioms. And that is it! You only need to do more if you want special syntax (which you can see in this file) or automation.</p>\n<p>The discussion above presupposes that you are working in the natural deduction framework. To formalise a sequent calculus require some technical tricks, which you can see in the file Sequents.thy.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
