The question combines both my concerns about the<br>\nchanges associated with the new release and, also, some of my previous<br>\nconcerns. Unfortunately, I was not able to find an explicit Isabelle coding<br>\nstyle guide - please accept my apologies for asking this question if a<br>\ndocument that answers it already exists somewhere.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Should ⟦ S ⊆ 𝔘; T ⊆ 𝔘; τ S; τ T ⟧ ⟹ τ (S ∩ T) be preferred over S ⊆ 𝔘<br>\n⟹ T ⊆ 𝔘 ⟹ τ S ⟹ τ T  ⟹ τ (S ∩ T)?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Should ['a set, ('a set ⇒ bool), 'a set] ⇒ bool be preferred over 'a set<br>\n⇒ ('a set ⇒ bool) ⇒ 'a set ⇒ bool?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Should lemma ‹⟦ S ⊆ 𝔘; T ⊆ 𝔘; τ S; τ T ⟧ ⟹ τ (S ∩ T)› be preferred<br>\nover lemma \"⟦ S ⊆ 𝔘; T ⊆ 𝔘; τ S; τ T ⟧ ⟹ τ (S ∩ T)\"?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Should definition closed_ow :: ‹['a set, ('a set ⇒ bool), 'a set] ⇒<br>\nbool› be preferred over definition closed_ow :: \"['a set, ('a set ⇒ bool),<br>\n'a set] ⇒ bool\"?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In general, when should I use double quotation marks over cartouches if<br>\nboth options are available?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The reference manual states that 'hence' and 'thus' are, effectively,<br>\nlegacy features. Nevertheless, they are used consistently throughout the<br>\nIsabelle sources and there does not seem to be too much effort devoted to<br>\ntheir elimination. Somehow, I always preferred my code to be as concise as<br>\npossible and I find it difficult to understand why the readability is<br>\nsacrificed when using, for example, 'thus' instead of 'then show'.<br>\nTherefore, my question is whether there is a good chance that 'hence' and<br>\n'thus' will become obsolete in the future releases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I would like to understand if it is recommended to use locale structures<br>\nfor the definition of algebraic structures and abstract spaces. Somehow, I<br>\nalways found it easier and more natural to state all definitional elements<br>\nas explicit locale parameters (also, the main HOL library does not use<br>\nstructures). Nevertheless, this feature was introduced for a good reason<br>\nand there are certain libraries that rely on it (e.g. HOL-Algebra). I would<br>\nlike to make sure that it is not considered to be bad style not to use it<br>\nfor the development of new theories/libraries about algebraic structures or<br>\nabstract spaces (of course, provided, that these theories/libraries are not<br>\nmeant to extend one of the existing libraries that already uses structures).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thank you</p>",

Instead, I use Isar<br>\nconstructs: <code>assumes</code> and <code>shows</code> for lemma statements and <code>if</code> for the<br>\nintroduction rules in inductive definitions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>In general, when should I use double quotation marks over<br>\n    cartouches if both options are available?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The default setting for PDF generation is to drop quotation marks but<br>\npreserve cartouches. Therefore, I use cartouches in precisely those<br>\nplaces where the bracketing they add may be necessary to understand the<br>\ncode. In particular, I use quotation marks for propositions after things<br>\nlike <code>lemma</code> and <code>have</code>, but I use cartouches around field types in<br>\n<code>datatype</code> declarations and locale arguments after <code>interpretation</code>.<br>\nRegarding my use of cartouches, consider something like the following:</p>\n<p>datatype expr = App ‹expr ⇒ expr› ‹expr› | …</p>\n<p>Dropping the cartouches would result in <code>expr ⇒ expr expr</code>, which would<br>\nlook like there was only one field with this illegal type.</p>\n<p>All the best,<br>\nWolfgang</p>",
