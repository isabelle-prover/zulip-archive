This<br>\nmakes apply-scripts much more maintainable.</p>\n<p>However, the solves is quite tedious to write: When developing the<br>\nproof, you can only add it after your method works. And if something<br>\nbreaks, you have to remove the solve to inspect the failure.<br>\nIs it possible to have some nice short suffix syntax for solves,<br>\nsomething like \"apply auto!\", similar to \"apply auto []\" ?</p>\n<p>Can such a syntax be declared in without changing Isabelle, or would it<br>\nrequire a modification of the Isabelle sources?</p>",

This is slightly shorter than <br>\nremoving solves, but you could define f as an alias to the method fail and just write</p>\n<p>apply (auto;f)</p>\n<p>which looks almost like what you want.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
