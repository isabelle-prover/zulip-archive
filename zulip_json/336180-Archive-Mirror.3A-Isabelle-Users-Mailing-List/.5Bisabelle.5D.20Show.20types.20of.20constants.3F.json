The ability to see the types of variables by hovering<br>\nover them was a huge help. I wonder whether it would be possible to also<br>\nshow the types for constants in the popup (for the output)?</p>\n<p>Background: Isabelle's Word library has some constants, e.g.</p>\n<p>ucast :: 'a word =&gt; 'b word<br>\n    unat :: 'a word =&gt; nat</p>\n<p>which often give rise to unwanted polymorphism; similar to numerals.<br>\nWhile the [[show_consts]] option gives often useful hints, one still<br>\nneeds to guess a lot, in particular for very large goals.</p>\n<p>-- Lars<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/TjUICdEzKb63KvGIl3UyFn2G/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
