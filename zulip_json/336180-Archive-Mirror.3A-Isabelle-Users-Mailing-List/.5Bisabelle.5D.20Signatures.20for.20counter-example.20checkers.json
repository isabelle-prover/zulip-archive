For this, I am using Quickcheck's function 'quickcheck :  <br>\n(string * string list) list -&gt; int -&gt; Proof.state -&gt; (string * term)  <br>\nlist option' from the ML level. I was wondering whether it is possible  <br>\nto obtain this information from Refute and Nitpick. Checking at  <br>\nRefute's signature, it seems to have the function 'refute_term :  <br>\nProof.context -&gt; (string * string) list -&gt; term list -&gt; term -&gt; unit'  <br>\nwhich I have copied/rewrited to obtain 'my_refute_term : Proof.context  <br>\n-&gt; (string * string) list -&gt; term list -&gt; term -&gt; (term * term) list  <br>\noption' and gain this functionality. Can something like that be added  <br>\nto Refute/Nitpick signatures?</p>\n<p>BTW, excellent tools!</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Omar.</p>\n<p>\"The University of Edinburgh is a charitable body, registered in<br>\nScotland, with registration number SC005336.\"</p>",
