Hence the<br>\nwhole machinery breaks badly if e.g. a simplification rules applies to a<br>\nredex in ‹x› ‹y› ‹z› rsp. ‹r› ‹s› ‹t› since the resulting goal has<br>\nhardly any correspondence to existing theorems (*).</p>\n<p>Concerning simplification, the problem can be avoided issuing a<br>\ncongruence rule ‹⋀a b c. c.f a b c ≡ c.f a b c›. Initially my idea was<br>\nto provide such a congruence rule automatically. But this does not cover<br>\narbitrary instantiations – what should be a suitable congruence rule for<br>\n‹c.f (g x) v (h y)› involving free parameters ‹x› ‹y›? (A similar<br>\nsituation occurs e. g. in the AFP in session Affine_Arithmetic).</p>\n<p>At TUM we have discussed various alternatives, without a conclusive idea.</p>\n<p>Hence my question: who has experience with the problem described above<br>\n(*) and can describe typical situations where this occurs?</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/5gpDLYnGYxE2OLxC6FkHYhnJ/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",

Many of the cases that were prevented from looping by the weak case congruence loop anyway if the splitter can do the case division.</p>\n<p>Finally, this setup isn't really necessary. It permits the equations of more functional programs to be added to the simplifier safely, but not all o</p>\n<p>Finally, the Isabelle setup isn't necessary. HOL4 has roughly the same infrastructure, but no weak case congruences. I think the key difference is that the defining equations of a function aren't added to the simplifier by default.</p>",

It sometimes allows the equations of a functional program to be added to the simplifier set safely, but proofs about those programs usually have to handle the simplifier very carefully anyway. A simpler solution is just not to put these rules in the simplifier and single step them when needed - HOL4 does something like that and it roughly works.</p>\n<p>But, clearly the current behaviour is embedded pretty deeply into the current definitions and proofs. From memory we learned in l4v that changing the if congruence locally seemed safe but some functions from the library seemed to cause loops, and we only realised later that the congruence was the problem.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n    Thomas.</p>",
