It gives the message \"Unknown fact\", etc. Looking<br>\nin the Fun theory one sees that<br>\nits name has changed to \"fun_eq_iff\". However, the 2011 tutorial still uses<br>\nthe old name. It is not<br>\na big deal, but I think it is better to update the tutorial in this sense.</p>\n<p>Best!</p>",
