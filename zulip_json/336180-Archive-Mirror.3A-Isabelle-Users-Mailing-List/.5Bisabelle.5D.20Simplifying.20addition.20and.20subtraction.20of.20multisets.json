This is obviously equal to <br>\n\"{#a,c,d#}\".</p>\n<p>However, the simplifier fails to prove this and I was not able to find a <br>\nsetup of existing simplification rules to solve it.</p>\n<p>I ended up proving the following rule, which works in my particular case:</p>\n<p>lemma multiset_Diff_single_normalize:<br>\n   fixes a c assumes \"a â‰  c\"<br>\n   shows   \"({#a#} + B) - {#c#} = {#a#} + (B - {#c#})\"</p>\n<p>This, combined with add_ac, does the trick. (but only because I can, in <br>\nthis particular instance, decide whether two elements are equal, i.e. I <br>\nknow that b != c and b != d, even though the simplification of <br>\n\"{#a,b,c,d#} - {#b#}\" would be sound even if that were not the case)</p>\n<p>Is there some existing simproc that can be set up to do this automatically?</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",

Since <br>\nmultisets are similar to natural numbers in terms of their algebraic properties, I'd <br>\nsuggest that you look at the simprocs for natural numbers. I guess that you can generalise <br>\ncancel_diff_conv in src/HOL/Tools/Nat_Arith.ML appropriately to multisets.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
