Andrews: \"If G has a model, it has <br>\na denumerable model by the Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem [...] Since the domain of <br>\nindividuals of M is in one-one correspondence with the natural numbers, we may <br>\nassume it is well-ordered. (This will enable us to avoid any appeal to the <br>\nAxiom of Choice in the argument below.)\" [Andrews, 2002, p. 168]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If one publication (or maybe two) should be taken as main reference for <br>\nIsabelle (the logical framework, not an object logic like Isabelle/HOL)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>preferably a printed publication instead of just an online file - which one <br>\nwould you choose?<br>\nThe literature on Isabelle is so vast that it becomes difficult to single out a <br>\nspecific publication.<br>\nMy first guess would be<br>\n[29] Lawrence C. Paulson. Isabelle: A Generic Theorem Prover.

Those manuals continued to be updated for years afterwards, so that book is a snapshot, and it doesn't present any theory. The 1989 paper covers Isabelle as a logical framework. In the past year or two, papers have emerged giving an account of the semantics of Isabelle/HOL, including type classes and other extended definitional mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
