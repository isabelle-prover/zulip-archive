Just to make clear, it is working<br>\nfor local solutions anyway.<br>\nBy the way, I'm running Isabelle 2015 on OS X 10.10 (Yosemite).</p>\n<p>Thank you very much indeed.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Artur</p>",

Rather, the SystemOnTPTP service at Miami appears to be down. You can still use sledgehammer with provers installed on your machine, as long as it is powerful enough. Unfortunately, Vampire is not available for download at the moment either; possibly it will be after CADE in August.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
