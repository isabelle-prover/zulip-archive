I don't want to do that 6 times for 6 proofs that <br>\nmay get found like that.</p>\n<p>So, I set \"preplay_timeout=10\", where the default is <br>\n\"preplay_timeout=3\", and I normally don't try any proof which <br>\nSledgehammer hasn't replayed back to eliminate all unneeded facts. If <br>\nI'm desperate, I may do things different.</p>\n<p>I learned this from using \"verbose=true\". I would see Sledgehammer <br>\nreplaying a proof, and eliminating facts, but then it would timeout, <br>\nbecause there were lots of facts it needed to try and eliminate, and <br>\n\"preplay_timeout=3\" was too short.</p>\n<p>I don't change my Sledgehammer options much now, but by watching the <br>\noutput, I may see something that helps me automate Sledgehammer better <br>\nfor my needs.</p>\n<p>The Sledgehammer panel is convenient, but, say, 50% of the time, for a <br>\nnew theorem, I'm not going to get a proof. I will then want to run it <br>\nagain, by inserting the command \"sledgehammer\" in the file with <br>\n\"verbose=true\", to see if I get any information from Sledgehammer that <br>\nwill help me. Rather than run Sledgehammer twice 50% of the time, I'd <br>\nrather always use my own command 100% of the time to prevent that.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, I'll even learn something from just looking at the long <br>\nlist of facts it starts with, or that it's only found 5 facts <br>\napplicable, when it normally uses hundreds.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nGB</p>",
