I don't know this problem is a kind of<br>\nversion 2017's bug or not, but I think it is not. This is because I faced<br>\nit more often since last month with version 2016, so I changed to 2017<br>\nhoping it would help. Could I ask whether there are any settings or<br>\nchecking processes that I can do to sort this out?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nKawin</p>",
