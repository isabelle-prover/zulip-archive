Over time, some users have experienced some noticeable slowdowns as this data grows.</p>\n<p>Here's how to find out if you are affected. If you write</p>\n<p>sledgehammer [verbose, fact_filter = mash]</p>\n<p>and it takes more than a couple of seconds (ideally ~200 ms) before Sledgehammer prints the 1000-or-so selected facts, whereas</p>\n<p>sledgehammer [verbose, fact_filter = mepo]</p>\n<p>does it almost instantaneously, it means you are a victim of this issue. Three solutions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Disable MaSh. This can be done through the Isabelle/jEdit options. See \"isabelle doc sledgehammer\" for details. Alternative: add \"sledgehammer_params [fact_filter = mepo]\" in your preamble.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove \"~/.isabelle/mash_state\", to start afresh. Removing the file every so often means that you lose some of the learning, though.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are using the repository version, change 6a5a188ab3e7 addresses this issue (and c982a4cc8dc4, 44f4ffe2b210 further speed up MaSh).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
