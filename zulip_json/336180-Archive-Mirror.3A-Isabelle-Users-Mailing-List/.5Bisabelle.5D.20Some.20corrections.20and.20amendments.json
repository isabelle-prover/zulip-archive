Also, for the predicate of <br>\nprovability of theorems of the embedded (represented, formalized) logic, a <br>\nlabel is usually used, not a symbolic notation (e.g., Goedel uses \"Bew\" - for <br>\n\"beweisbare Formel\", the German expression for \"provable formula\" -, and <br>\nO'Connor in Coq uses \"SysPrf\"). Moreover, without some short introduction to <br>\nthe notation and the type system it is nearly impossible to analyze the proof <br>\nin detail unless one has advanced experience with the Isabelle proof assistant, <br>\nleaving aside that with a logical framework there are not only three, but four <br>\nlanguage levels involved, all of which one would ideally need to understand in <br>\norder to verify the proof.</p>\n<p>The result of the formal proof<br>\n    ~Bew(g) /\\ ~Bew(not g)<br>\ncan be interpreted in the sense that it is possible to construe a formula with <br>\nthe form of a sentence (i.e., a boolean-valued well-formed formula with no free <br>\nvariables) neither provable nor refutable.<br>\nNevertheless, the claim of \"incompleteness\" depends on a philosophical <br>\nassumption.<br>\nOne who shares the semantic view (model theory) will conclude that there is a <br>\nmeaningful (and true) sentence that is neither provable nor refutable, and will <br>\ncall the discrepancy between syntax and semantics \"incompleteness\".<br>\nBut one who shares the syntactic view will conclude that it is possible to <br>\ncreate a meaningless formula which has the form of a syntactically correct <br>\nsentence (similar, in natural language, to a grammatically correct but <br>\nmeaningless statement like \"mathematics is liquid\").</p>\n<p>Concerning the two objections of Ramana Kumar at<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-December/msg00061.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-December/msg00061.html</a><br>\nthe first one was a misunderstanding clarified at<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-January/msg00029.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2016-January/msg00029.html</a><br>\nBut the second, Ramana Kumar's claim that type \"tm\" can be defined like type <br>\n\"nat\", is not correct. Andrews' logic Q0, being an improved variant of Church's <br>\noriginal simple type theory, only allows the types iota (i) and omicron (o), <br>\nand combinations of them.<br>\nAndrews' type \"nat\" is such a combination ( nat := (o(oi)) ). On the contrary, <br>\nPaulson's type \"tm\" is an inductively defined type, which is not possible in Q0:<br>\n\"nominal_datatype tm = Zero | Var name | Eats tm tm\"<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Incompleteness/SyntaxN.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Incompleteness/SyntaxN.html</a><br>\nIn an e-mail, Paulson basically argued that there should be ways to introduce <br>\nfurther types (instead of restricting oneself to combinations of 'i' and 'o'). <br>\nThis is, of course, correct, but doesn't justify the specific mode of type <br>\nintroduction used here, namely the Backus-Naur form (BNF). The BNF was designed <br>\nto specify formal grammars in computer science, but (mathematical) types are <br>\nobjects that must have certain logical properties, such as being non-empty. <br>\nThus the introduction of additional mathematical types should be subject to <br>\nproof, and not a matter of mere declaration via the BNF.</p>\n<p>With some more knowledge about the concept of the current proof assistants, I <br>\ncan answer Ramana Kumar's question at<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00149.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00149.html</a><br>\nconcerning the motivation of my project announcement at<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html</a><br>\nfrom his perspective now.<br>\nCurrent proof assistants seem to follow the semantic approach, in which the <br>\ntheory is distinguished from a specific linguistic (formal) formulation, or use <br>\nof model theoretic notions like satisfiability is made. For example, in <br>\nIsabelle there are implementations of both axiomatic set theory (Isabelle/ZF) <br>\nand type theory (Isabelle/HOL), but neither one is explicitly preferred, and <br>\nthe question of which is more adequate for representing mathematics is not even <br>\nraised. (Although, unlike in informal mathematics, in formalized proofs type <br>\ntheory seems to prevail, e.g., within Isabelle the logic Isabelle/HOL, a <br>\npolymorphic version of Church's simple type theory.)<br>\nIf one follows the syntactic approach, then there is a desire for something <br>\nlike the ideal formulation or the natural language of formal logic and <br>\nmathematics. The main criterion is expressiveness [cf. Andrews, 2002, p. 205], <br>\nor, vice versa, the reducibility of mathematics to a minimal set of primitive <br>\nrules and symbols. If we leave away for a moment the restrictions of Q0 of <br>\nstill being a formulation of simple type theory (i.e., without type variables <br>\nand dependent types), all of formal logic and mathematics can be expressed on <br>\nthe basis of only a \"single rule of inference (substitution, from which the <br>\nrule of modus ponens is derived)\" and \"only two basic types (individuals and <br>\ntruth values) and only two basic constants (identity/equality and its <br>\ncounterpart, description)\"<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-July/msg00147.html</a><br>\nPaulson argued that natural deduction is far superior to Hilbert-style systems <br>\nfor automated proof. This is, of course, correct, since Hilbert-style <br>\nmetatheorems become symbolically representable in natural deduction as regular <br>\ntheorems (and not just metatheorems), but this only reflects the engineer's <br>\nperspective with the pragmatic aim of quickly obtaining proofs. For the <br>\nphilosopher it is not proof automation but expressiveness that is the main <br>\ncriterion, such that the method with the least amount of rules of inferences, <br>\ni.e., a Hilbert-style system, is preferred, and all other rules become derived <br>\nrules.<br>\nHence, from the perspective of the syntactic view, Andrews' elegant logic Q0 is <br>\nthe natural point to start with. Overcoming its restrictions by extending it to <br>\na polymorphic (with type variables) and dependent type theory (with dependent <br>\ntypes) is the motivation of my logic R0, which I hope to be able to publish <br>\nsoon.
