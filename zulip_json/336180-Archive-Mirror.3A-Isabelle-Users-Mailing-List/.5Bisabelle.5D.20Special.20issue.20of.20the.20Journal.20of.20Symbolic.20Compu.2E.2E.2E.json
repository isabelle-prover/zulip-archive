Topics of interest include<br>\n(but are not restricted to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Decidability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>decision procedures based on logical calculi such as:<br>\n   resolution, rewriting, tableaux, sequent calculi, or natural deduction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>decidability in combinations of logical theories</p>\n</li>\n<li>specialized decision procedures</li>\n<li>Complexity:</li>\n<li>complexity analysis for fragments of first- (or higher) order logic</li>\n<li>complexity analysis for combinations of logical theories<br>\n   (including parameterized complexity results)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tractability (in logic, automated reasoning, algebra, ...)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application domains for which complexity issues are essential<br>\n  (verification, security, databases, ontologies, ...)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission procedure<br>\n====================</p>\n<p>Submission to this special issue is completely open.<br>\nWe expect original articles (typically 15-30 pages; submission of<br>\nlarger papers will be evaluated depending on editorial constraints)<br>\nthat present high-quality contributions that  have not been previously<br>\npublished in an  archival venue and that must not be simultaneously<br>\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Submissions must comply with JSC's author guidelines. They must be<br>\nwritten in English and should be prepared in LaTeX using the<br>\n\"Elsevier Article Class (elsart.cls)\" with \"JSC add-on style (yjsco.sty)\"<br>\nand \"Harvard style references (elsart-harv.bst)\". The package \"JSC LaTex\"<br>\n(that contains all the necessary style files and a template) can be obtained<br>\nfrom  <a href=\"http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hong/jsc/JSC_LaTex_2007_Mar_12.zip\">http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hong/jsc/JSC_LaTex_2007_Mar_12.zip</a></p>\n<p>The introduction of the paper MUST explicitly address the following<br>\nquestions in succinct and informal manner:</p>\n<p>- What is the problem?<br>\n     - Why is the problem important?<br>\n     - What has so far been done on the problem?<br>\n     - What is the contribution of the paper on the problem?<br>\n     - Is the contribution original?     Explain why.<br>\n     - Is the contribution non-trivial?  Explain why.</p>\n<p>Submission to this special issue are hereby encouraged via the EasyChair<br>\nsubmission system (<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=addctjsc2008\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=addctjsc2008</a>)..</p>\n<p>The deadline for submissions is April 6th, 2008.</p>\n<p>Guest editors:<br>\n==============<br>\n  Silvio Ghilardi (U.
