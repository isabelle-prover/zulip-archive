The idea is to make it obvious at the first glance <br>\nwhether a variable is of that specific type or not. Can this be somehow <br>\ndone automatically for all these antiquotations?</p>\n<p>My naive approach would be to declare free constants of this type with <br>\nappropriate syntax for the latex output and instantiate all variables of <br>\nthis type in @{thm ...} antiquotations with such constants and use them <br>\nin @{term ...} expressions, too. However, this is very tedious and <br>\nerror-prone.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
