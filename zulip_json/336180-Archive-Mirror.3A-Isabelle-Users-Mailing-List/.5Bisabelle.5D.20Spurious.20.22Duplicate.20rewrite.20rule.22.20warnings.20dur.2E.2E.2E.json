Searching that manual, <br>\nI find 15 uses of the word \"debugging\" in that manual.<br>\nPersonally I prefer \"bug\" to \"error\" (which is what \"bug\" means, at <br>\nleast in the US) because \"error\" sounds more serious, more like an <br>\nerroneous way of thinking that would require a major rewrite to fix, <br>\nwhereas a \"bug\" is more typically either a typographical error or <br>\nsomething similar, that can be repaired in either one line or a very <br>\nfew lines.<br>\nIf \"bug\" means something different where you live, please advise. <br>\nThanks! -WDMaurer</p>",
