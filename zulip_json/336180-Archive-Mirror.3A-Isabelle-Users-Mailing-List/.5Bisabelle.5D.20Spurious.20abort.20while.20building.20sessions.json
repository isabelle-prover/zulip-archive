It can't be the exact same problem since those<br>\nissues only happened at the very end of the ML process, whereas in your<br>\ncase the problem happens much earlier.</p>\n<p>In any case, my guess would be that the ML process dies suddenly before<br>\nit can emit any kind of error messages. The OOM killer that Lars hinted<br>\nmentioned is a likely suspect.</p>\n<p>It might also be interesting to check if this also happens with Pure<br>\n(and if yes how often); what I did in the past was to write a small<br>\nshell script of \"isabelle build -b -c Pure\" in a while look that stops<br>\nat the first failure. Pure is good for that because it only takes about<br>\n10 seconds to build.</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",
