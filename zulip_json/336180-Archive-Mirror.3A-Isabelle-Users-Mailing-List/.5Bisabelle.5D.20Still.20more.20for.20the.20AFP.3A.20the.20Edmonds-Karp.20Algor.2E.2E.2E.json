Abstract below, the entry itself is at the URL <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/EdmondsKarp_Maxflow.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/EdmondsKarp_Maxflow.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>\n<p>Formalizing the Edmonds-Karp Algorithm </p>\n<p>Peter Lammich and S. Reza Sefidgar</p>\n<p>We present a formalization of the Ford-Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a network. Our formal proof closely follows a standard textbook proof, and is accessible even without being an expert in Isabelle/HOL--- the interactive theorem prover used for the formalization. We then use stepwise refinement to obtain the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, and formally prove a bound on its complexity. Further refinement yields a verified implementation, whose execution time compares well to an unverified reference implementation in Java. This entry is based on our ITP-2016 paper with the same title.</p>",
