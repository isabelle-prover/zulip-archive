        "content": "<p>From: Edward Schwartz &lt;<a href=\"mailto:edmcman@cmu.edu\">edmcman@cmu.edu</a>&gt;<br>\nHi,</p>\n<p>I just wanted to follow-up in case anyone finds this thread in the archive.<br>\n I spoke too quickly.  Julian's solution <em>does</em> ensure that the Assumption<br>\nS fact is available during the induction.  However, S still remains<br>\nunconnected to Foo arg, the current induction form. Because of this, I<br>\ncannot show Assumption (Foo arg).</p>\n<p>I was able to get the proof to work by including the assumption as part of<br>\nthe induction hypothesis, as Tobias suggested.  I had tried this before,<br>\nactually, but was running into trouble because I did not use the next<br>\ncommand between induction cases.  This was very confusing to me, because I<br>\nnormally don't need to use next.  I guess it matters here because each<br>\ninduction case will add to the assumptions, and so it needs to be reset.</p>\n<p>Thank you to both Julian and Tobias for the help.</p>\n<p>Edward</p>",
