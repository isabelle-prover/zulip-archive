Suppose I first define</p>\n<p>locale ab_locale</p>\n<p>which is based off the record (a_object::'a, b_object::'b), and later<br>\ndecide it would be useful to have a more general</p>\n<p>locale a_locale</p>\n<p>which is based off the record (a_object::'a). Could I make ab_object a<br>\nsublocale of a_object (here I would just want to set the a_object's equal)?</p>\n<p>-Holden</p>",

However, I <br>\nsuspect that your situation resembles the following.</p>\n<p>record 'a a = a_object :: 'a<br>\nrecord ('a, 'b) ab = \"'a a\" + b_object :: 'b<br>\nlocale a = fixes r_a :: \"'a a\"<br>\nlocale ab = fixes r_b :: \"('a, 'b) ab\" begin<br>\nsublocale a r_b .</p>\n<p>Here, the sublocale command fails because r_b has type \"(_, _) ab\" which is incompatible <br>\nwith type \"_ a\" as required by locale a. The reason is that the locales use the closed <br>\nrecord types \"_ a\" and \"(_, _) ab\" instead of the extensible record schemes that the <br>\nrecord package uses internally. If you generalise your locales to schemes, it works in <br>\nthis setting:</p>\n<p>locale a = fixes r_a :: \"('a, 'more) a_scheme\"<br>\nlocale ab = fixes r_b :: \"('a, 'b, 'more) ab_scheme\" begin<br>\nsublocale a r_b .</p>\n<p>What happens here is the following: The type parameter 'more from locale a gets <br>\ninstantiated with the extension type ('b, 'more) ab_ext which implements the extension of <br>\nrecord type ab over record type a.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
