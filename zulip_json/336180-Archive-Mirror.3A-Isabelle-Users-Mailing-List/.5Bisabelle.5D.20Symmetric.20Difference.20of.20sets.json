It defines a locale \"boolean\" for<br>\nboolean algebras, and also a sublocale \"boolean_xor\" for those that<br>\nalso have the xor operation defined. Originally the library was<br>\nintended to support bitwise arithmetic, but it should work perfectly<br>\nwith a symmetric difference operation on sets.</p>\n<p>If you do a locale interpretation with your symmetric difference<br>\noperation, the locale will generate lots of useful lemmas for you<br>\nautomatically, such as associativity, commutativity, distributive laws<br>\nwith intersection, etc.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brian</li>\n</ul>",
