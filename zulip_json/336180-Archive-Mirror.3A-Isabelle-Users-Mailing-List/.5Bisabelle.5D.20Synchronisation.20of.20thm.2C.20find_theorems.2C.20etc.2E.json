If I open this in<br>\nIsabelle/jEdit and start a new lemma at the bottom, I can start working on this interactively while<br>\nIsabelle continues to prove the above lemmas in parallel in the background. I can even use the<br>\nlemmas for which Isabelle has not yet processed the proof. This is very pleasant.</p>\n<p>However, if I try to invoke something like <code>thm</code> or <code>find_theorems</code>, these appear to block until<br>\nprocessing reaches that point. Is there a reason for this? It seems surprising to me that I can use<br>\na lemma, but cannot inspect it:</p>\n<p>...<br>\n     lemma foo: \"...\"<br>\n       thm bar (* no output until serial processing reaches this point *)<br>\n       apply bar (* works fine, even before the above line has been processed *)</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nMatt</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
