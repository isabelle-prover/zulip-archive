Thus I have recently restricted it to input syntax. I am <br>\nundecided whether to remove it completely or not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It complicates the syntax<br>\n   (although I don't think it gives rise to ambiguities)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is an ad hoc extension of list comprehension (which we also support as <br>\ninput syntax)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, it is quite concise and readable and I have recently seen a close <br>\nrelative in some book.</p>\n<p>Let me know in case you feel strongly about it one way or the other.</p>\n<p>Tobias<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/_edQeBHc4VIkXFvR0-VqkkOo/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
