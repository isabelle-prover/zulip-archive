The<br>\n  conference will be held in Brasília from 26-29 September 2017.</p>\n<p>TABLEAUX 2017 will be co-located with both the 11th International<br>\n  Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS 2017) and the<br>\n  8th International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP<br>\n  2017).</p>\n<p>TOPICS<br>\n  Tableau methods offer a convenient and flexible set of tools for<br>\n  automated reasoning in classical logic, extensions of classical<br>\n  logic, and a large number of non-classical logics. For large groups<br>\n  of logics, tableau methods can be generated automatically.  Areas<br>\n  of application include verification of software and computer<br>\n  systems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its<br>\n  required inference engines, teaching, and system diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>* tableau methods for classical and non-classical logics<br>\n      (including first-order, higher-order, modal, temporal,<br>\n      description, hybrid, intuitionistic, substructural,<br>\n      relevance, non-monotonic logics) and their proof-theoretic<br>\n      foundations;</p>\n<p>* related methods (SMT, model elimination, model checking,<br>\n      connection methods, resolution, BDDs, translation approaches);</p>\n<p>* sequent calculi and natural deduction calculi for classical<br>\n      and non-classical logics, as tools for proof search and proof<br>\n      representation;</p>\n<p>* flexible, easily extendable, light weight methods for theorem<br>\n      proving;</p>\n<p>* novel types of calculi for theorem proving and verification<br>\n      in classical and non-classical logics;</p>\n<p>* systems, tools, implementations, empirical evaluations and<br>\n      applications (provers, logical frameworks, model checkers, ...);</p>\n<p>* implementation techniques (data structures, efficient<br>\n      algorithms, performance measurement, extensibility, ...);</p>\n<p>* extensions of tableau procedures with conflict-driven<br>\n      learning, generation of proofs; compact (or humanly readable)<br>\n      representation of proofs;</p>\n<p>* decision procedures, theoretically optimal procedures;<br>\n    * applications of automated deduction to mathematics, software<br>\n      development, verification, deductive and temporal<br>\n      databases, knowledge representation, ontologies, fault<br>\n      diagnosis or teaching.</p>\n<p>We also welcome papers describing applications of tableau<br>\n  procedures to real world examples. Such papers should be tailored<br>\n  to the tableau community and should focus on the role of<br>\n  reasoning, and logical aspects of the solution.</p>\n<p>WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS<br>\n  Proposals for Workshops and Tutorial sessions have been solicited<br>\n  in a separate call, which can be found at<br>\n<a href=\"http://tableaux2017.cic.unb.br/#cfw\">http://tableaux2017.cic.unb.br/#cfw</a>.</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION DETAILS<br>\n  The conference proceedings will published in the Springer<br>\n  LNAI/LNCS series, as in previous editions.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>\n  Submissions are invited in two categories:</p>\n<p>A  Research papers, which describe original theoretical<br>\n       research, original algorithms, or applications, with length<br>\n       up to 15 pages.<br>\n    B  System descriptions, with length up to 9 pages.</p>\n<p>Submissions will be reviewed by the PC, possibly with the help of<br>\n  external reviewers, taking into account readability, relevance<br>\n  and originality.</p>\n<p>For category A, theoretical results and algorithms must be<br>\n  original, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions<br>\n  will be reviewed taking into account correctness, theoretical<br>\n  elegance, and possible implementability.</p>\n<p>For category B submissions, a working implementation must be<br>\n  accessible via the internet, which includes sources. The aim of a<br>\n  system description is to make the system available in such a way<br>\n  that users can use it, understand it, and build on it.</p>\n<p>Accepted papers in both categories will be published in the<br>\n  conference proceedings. Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the<br>\n  llncs style and must be submitted electronically as PDF files via<br>\n  the EasyChair system:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tableaux2017\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tableaux2017</a>.</p>\n<p>For all accepted papers at least one author is required to attend<br>\n  the conference and present the paper. A paper title and a short<br>\n  abstract of about 100 words must be submitted before the paper<br>\n  submission deadline. Further information about paper submissions<br>\n  will be made available at the conference website. Formatting<br>\n  instructions and the LNCS style files can be obtained via<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/lncs\">http://www.springer.com/lncs</a>.</p>\n<p>BEST PAPER AWARD<br>\n  The TABLEAUX 2017 Best Paper Award will be presented to the best<br>\n  submission nominated and chosen by the Program Committee among<br>\n  the accepted papers. The eligibility criteria will place emphasis<br>\n  on the originality and significance of the contribution, but<br>\n  readability and the overall technical quality, including correctness<br>\n  and completeness of results, will be also considered. The TABLEAUX<br>\n  Best Paper Award was established in 2015 and it is a permanent<br>\n  initiative of TABLEAUX.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\n    18 Apr 2017     Abstract submission<br>\n    25 Apr 2017     Paper submission<br>\n     8 Jun 2017     Notification of paper decisions<br>\n     3 Jul 2017     Camera-ready papers due<br>\n 23-25 Sep 2017     Workshops &amp; Tutorials<br>\n 25-29 Sep 2017     TABLEAUX Conference</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>\n  Peter Baumgartner     National ICT Australia, Canberra<br>\n  Maria Paola Bonacina  Università degli Studi di Verona<br>\n  Laura Bozzelli        Universidad Politécnica de Madrid<br>\n  Torben Braüner        Roskilde University<br>\n  Serenella Cerrito     Ibisc, Université d'Evry Val d'Essonne<br>\n  Agata Ciabattoni      Technische Universität Wien<br>\n  Clare Dixon           University of Liverpool<br>\n  Pascal Fontaine       LORIA, INRIA, Université de Lorraine<br>\n  Didier Galmiche       LORIA, Université de Lorraine<br>\n  Martin Giese          Universitetet i Oslo<br>\n  Laura Giordano        DISIT, Università del Piemonte Orientale<br>\n  Rajeev Gore           The Australian National University<br>\n  Volker Haarslev       Concordia University<br>\n  George Metcalfe       Universität Bern<br>\n  Angelo Montanari      Università degli Studi di Udine<br>\n  Barbara Morawska      Technische Universität Dresden<br>\n  Boris Motik           University of Oxford<br>\n  Leonardo de Moura     Microsoft Research<br>\n  Neil Murray           SUNY at Albany<br>\n  Cláudia Nalon         Universidade de Brasília<br>\n  Linh Anh Nguyen       Uniwersytet Warszawski<br>\n  Hans de Nivelle       Uniwersytet Wrocławski<br>\n  Nicola Olivetti       LSIS, Aix-Marseille Université<br>\n  Jens Otten            Universitetet i Oslo<br>\n  Valeria de Paiva      Nuance Communications<br>\n  Nicolas Peltier       Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,<br>\n                        Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble<br>\n  Elaine Pimentel       Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte<br>\n  Giselle Reis          Carnegie Mellon University-Qatar<br>\n  Philipp Ruemmer       Uppsala Universitet<br>\n  Katsuhiko Sano        Hokkaido University<br>\n  Renate Schmidt        The University of Manchester<br>\n  Cesare Tinelli        The University of Iowa<br>\n  Alwen Tiu             Nanyang Technological University<br>\n  David Toman           University of Waterloo<br>\n  Josef Urban           České vysoké učení technické v Praze</p>\n<p>LOCAL CONFERENCE ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE<br>\n  Cláudia Nalon, Universidade de Brasília, Brazil<br>\n  Daniele Nantes Sobrinho, Universidade de Brasília, Brazil<br>\n  Elaine Pimentel, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil<br>\n  João Marcos, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil</p>\n<p>CONFERENCE CHAIR<br>\n  Cláudia Nalon, University of Brasília, Brazil</p>\n<p>PC CHAIRS<br>\n  Cláudia Nalon, University of Brasilia, Brazil<br>\n  Renate Schmidt, The University of Manchester, UK</p>",
