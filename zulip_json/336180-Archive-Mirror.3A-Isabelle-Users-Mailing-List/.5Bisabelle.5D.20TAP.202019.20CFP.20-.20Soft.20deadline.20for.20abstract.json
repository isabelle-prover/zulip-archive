Formal techniques for counter-example generation<br>\nbased on, for example, symbolic execution, SAT/SMT-solving or<br>\nmodel checking, furnish evidence for the potential of a combination of<br>\ntest and proof. The combination of predicate abstraction with testing-like<br>\ntechniques based on exhaustive enumeration opens the perspective<br>\nfor novel techniques of proving correctness. On the practical side,<br>\ntesting offers cost-effective debugging techniques of specifications<br>\nor crucial parts of program proofs (such as invariants).  Last but not<br>\nleast, testing is indispensable when it comes to the validation of the<br>\nunderlying assumptions of complex system models involving<br>\nhardware and/or system environments. Over the years, there is<br>\ngrowing acceptance in research communities that testing and proving<br>\nare complementary rather than mutually exclusive techniques.</p>\n<p>The TAP conference aims to promote research in the intersection of<br>\ntesting and proving by bringing together researchers and practitioners<br>\nfrom both areas of verification.</p>\n<p>Topics of Interest</p>\n<hr>\n<p>TAP's scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology,<br>\nincluding foundational work, tool development, and empirical<br>\nresearch. Its topics of interest center around the connection between<br>\nproofs (and other static techniques) and testing (and other dynamic<br>\ntechniques). Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the<br>\nfollowing topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verification and analysis techniques combining proofs and tests</li>\n<li>Program proving with the aid of testing techniques</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deductive techniques supporting the automated generation of test<br>\nvectors and oracles<br>\n   (theorem proving, model checking, symbolic execution, SAT/SMT<br>\n   solving, constraint logic programming, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deductive techniques supporting novel definitions of coverage criteria,</p>\n</li>\n<li>Program analysis techniques combining static and dynamic analysis</li>\n<li>Specification inference by deductive and dynamic methods</li>\n<li>Testing and runtime analysis of formal specifications</li>\n<li>Search-based technics for proving and testing</li>\n<li>Verification of verification tools and environments</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications of test and proof techniques in new domains,<br>\n  such as security, configuration management, learning</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combined approaches of test and proof in the context of formal<br>\n  certifications (Common Criteria, CENELEC, …)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies, tool and framework descriptions, and experience<br>\n  reports about combining tests and proofs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission Instructions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>TAP 2019 accepts papers of three kinds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Regular research papers: full submissions describing original<br>\nresearch, of up to 16 pages (excluding references).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tool demonstration papers: submissions describing the design and<br>\nimplementation of an analysis/verification tool or framework, of up<br>\nto 8 pages (excluding references). The tool/framework described in<br>\na tool demonstration paper should be available for public use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short papers: submissions describing preliminary findings, proofs<br>\nof concepts, and exploratory studies, of up to 6 pages (excluding<br>\nreferences).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are planning to publish the proceedings in the Formal Methods subline<br>\nof Springer's LNCS series.
