TFPIE aims<br>\nto be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas and work-in-progress on<br>\nthe use of functional programming in education are discussed. The one-day<br>\nworkshop will foster a spirit of open discussion by having a review process for<br>\npublication after the workshop. The program chair of TFPIE 2018 will screen<br>\nsubmissions to ensure that all presentations are within scope and are of<br>\ninterest to participants. After the workshop, presenters will be invited to<br>\nsubmit revised versions of their articles for publication in the journal<br>\nElectronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).</p>\n<p>Scope<br>\n=====</p>\n<p>TFPIE 2018 welcomes submissions describing techniques used in the classroom,<br>\ntools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any creative use of<br>\nfunctional programming (FP) to aid education in or outside Computer Science.<br>\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FP and beginning CS students</li>\n<li>FP and Computational Thinking</li>\n<li>FP and Artificial Intelligence</li>\n<li>FP in Robotics</li>\n<li>FP and Music</li>\n<li>Advanced FP for undergraduates</li>\n<li>FP in graduate education</li>\n<li>Engaging students in research using FP</li>\n<li>FP in Programming Languages</li>\n<li>FP in the high school curriculum</li>\n<li>FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics</li>\n<li>FP and Philosophy</li>\n<li>The pedagogy of teaching FP</li>\n<li>FP and e-learning: MOOCs, automated assessment etc.</li>\n<li>Best Lectures – more details below</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to papers, we are requesting best lecture presentations. What’s your<br>\nbest lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a fun way to present FP<br>\nconcepts to novices or perhaps an especially interesting presentation of a<br>\ndifficult topic? In either case, please consider sharing it. Best lecture topics<br>\nwill be selected for presentation based on a short abstract describing the<br>\nlecture and its interest to TFPIE attendees.</p>\n<p>Submissions<br>\n===========</p>\n<p>Potential presenters are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-6 pages) or a<br>\ndraft paper (up to 16 pages) in EPTCS style. The authors of accepted<br>\npresentations will have their preprints and their slides made available on the<br>\nworkshop's website. Papers and abstracts can be submitted via EasyChair at the<br>\nlink below.</p>\n<p>After the workshop, presenters will be invited to submit (a revised version of)<br>\ntheir article for review. The PC will select the best articles for publication<br>\nin the journal Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).<br>\nArticles rejected for presentation and extended abstracts will not be formally<br>\nreviewed by the PC.</p>\n<p>Submission page: <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfpie2018\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfpie2018</a></p>\n<p>Important dates<br>\n===============</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission deadline: May 15th, Anywhere on Earth.</li>\n<li>Notification: May 21st</li>\n<li>Workshop: June 14th</li>\n<li>Submission for formal review: August 17th</li>\n<li>Notification of full article: October 5th</li>\n<li>Camera ready: November 2nd</li>\n</ul>",
