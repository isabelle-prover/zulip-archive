However, TPHOLs is merging with IJCAR in 2006,<br>\nand so it was decided at the business meeting of TPHOLs 2005 that the<br>\norganizers of TPHOLs 2005 would organize the bidding for TPHOLs 2007.<br>\nThere are two phases: solicitation of bids, and voting.</p>\n<p>This message concerns the second phase. Two bids were received to<br>\nhost TPHOLs 2007:</p>\n<p>Klaus Schneider and Jens Brandt proposed a bid to host TPHOLs 2007 at<br>\nthe University of Kaiserslautern, Germany.<br>\nBid web page: <a href=\"http://rsg.informatik.uni-kl.de/misc/bid-TPHOLs2007/\">http://rsg.informatik.uni-kl.de/misc/bid-TPHOLs2007/</a></p>\n<p>Carsten Schuerman proposed a bid to host TPHOLs 2007 at the IT<br>\nUniversity of Copenhagen, Denmark.<br>\nBid web page: <a href=\"http://www.logosphere.org/tphols-2007/bid.html\">http://www.logosphere.org/tphols-2007/bid.html</a></p>\n<p>Anyone who is seriously considering attending TPHOLs 2007 is entitled<br>\nto vote. The voting procedure employed will be Single Transferable<br>\nVote, but in the present case of two bids this is equivalent to simply<br>\nvoting for your preferred choice. To vote please send an email to<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:joe.hurd@comlab.ox.ac.uk\">joe.hurd@comlab.ox.ac.uk</a> in the following format:</p>\n<p>Your preferred bid to host TPHOLs 2007</p>\n<p>Your Name</p>\n<p>Including your name is for the sole purpose of preventing ballot<br>\nstuffing: all votes will remain secret. The deadline for voting is<br>\nFriday 3 February 2006.</p>",
