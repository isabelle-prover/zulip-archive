The<br>\nconference will be held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on 18-21 August 2008.</p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The program committee welcomes submissions on all aspects of theorem<br>\nproving in higher order logics, and on related topics in theorem proving<br>\nand verification. This includes, but is not limited to, the following<br>\ntopics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Formal semantics of specification, modeling, and programming languages:<br>\n  formal synthesis, validated compilation, formal design flows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specification and verification of hardware: microprocessors, memory<br>\n  systems, buses, pipelines, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specification and verification of software: program verification,<br>\n  refinement, and synthesis for functional, declarative and imperative<br>\n  languages, proof carrying code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formalization of mathematical theories.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advances in theorem prover technology: proof automation and decision<br>\n  procedures, induction, combination of deductive and algorithmic<br>\n  approaches, incorporation of theorem provers into larger<br>\n  systems, combination of theorem provers with other provers and tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Industrial application of theorem provers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Proof Pearls: concise and elegant presentations of interesting examples.</li>\n<li>Other topics, including: security algorithms, specification and<br>\n  requirement analysis of systems, user interfaces for theorem provers,<br>\n  development and extension of higher order logics, and application of<br>\n  theorem proving technology to new domains of science, e.g., biology.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submissions are invited in the following categories:</p>\n<p>* Category A: Full research paper<br>\n     * Category B: Emerging trends</p>\n<p>Submissions under category A will be fully refereed. Accepted papers<br>\nwill be published as a volume of Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer<br>\nScience series, which will be available at the conference.  Authors of<br>\naccepted Category A papers are expected to present their work at the<br>\nconference.  Submissions under category B will not be formally<br>\nrefereed, but their content and relevance will be<br>\nreviewed. Submissions accepted in this category will be published in a<br>\ntechnical report of Concordia University, which will be available at<br>\nthe conference. Authors of accepted Category B papers are expected to<br>\npresent a brief outline of their work at the conference and to prepare<br>\na poster for display at the conference venue.</p>\n<p>Submissions must describe original unpublished work not submitted for<br>\npublication elsewhere. They may be no more than 16 pages in length,<br>\nincluding references, and must be prepared using the LNCS style.  The<br>\nPC chair should be informed of closely related work concurrently<br>\nsubmitted to a conference or journal. All contributions should be<br>\nsubmitted electronically through the conference submission web page.</p>\n<p>Important dates</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Category A       Category B<br>\n    Abstract submission          15 Feb 2008           -<br>\n    Submission deadline          22 Feb 2008       2 May 2008<br>\n    Notification of acceptance   15 April 2008     25 Jun 2008<br>\n    Camera-ready copy due        15 May 2007       25 Jul 2008</p>\n<p>Conference Chair</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Sofiene Tahar, Concordia University</p>\n<p>Program Chairs</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Otmane Ait Mohamed, Concordia University<br>\n   Cesar Munoz, National Institute of Aerospace</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Mark Aagaard (University of Waterloo)<br>\nOtmane Ait Mohamed (Concordia University)<br>\nHasan Amjad (Middlesex University)<br>\nYves Bertot (INRIA)<br>\nJens Brandt (University of Kaiserslautern)<br>\nJean-Christophe Filliatre (CNRS)<br>\nThierry Coquand (Gteborg University)<br>\nGanesh Gopalakrishnan (University of Utah)<br>\nMike Gordon (University of Cambridge)<br>\nHanne Gottliebsen (Queen Mary, University of London)<br>\nJim Grundy (Intel)<br>\nElsa Gunter (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)<br>\nJohn Harrison (Intel)<br>\nJason Hickey (California Institute of Technology)<br>\nPeter Homeier (Department of Defense)<br>\nJoe Hurd (Galois)<br>\nPaul Jackson (University of Edinburgh)<br>\nThomas Kropf (Bosch)<br>\nJohn Matthews (Galois)<br>\nCesar Munoz (National Institute of Aerospace)<br>\nTobias Nipkow (Technische Universitt Mnchen)<br>\nSam Owre (SRI International)<br>\nChristine Paulin-Mohring (Universit Paris-Sud)<br>\nLawrence Paulson (University of Cambridge)<br>\nKlaus Schneider (University of Kaiserslautern)<br>\nKonrad Slind (University of Utah)<br>\nSofiene Tahar (Concordia University)<br>\nMatthew Wilding (Rockwell Collins)<br>\nBurkhart Wolff (ETH-Zurich)</p>\n<p>Steering Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Mike Gordon (University of Cambridge)<br>\nJohn Harrison (Intel)<br>\nMatt Kaufmann (University of Texas, Austin)<br>\nJohn Matthews (Galois)<br>\nTobias Nipkow (Technische Universitt Mnchen)<br>\nMichael Norrish (National ICT Australia)<br>\nLawrence Paulson (University of Cambridge)<br>\nKlaus Schneider(University of Kaiserslautern)<br>\nSofiene Tahar (Concordia University)<br>\nLaurent Thry (INRIA Sophia Antipolis)</p>",
