It was <br>\nfelt that the broader scope of ITP is a more accurate reflection of the <br>\nactual focus of TPHOLs and its openness to other communities like ACL2 <br>\nusers.</p>\n<p>Note that although ITP 2010 formally incorporates the TPHOLs and ACL2 <br>\nWorkshop series, no such commitment has been made beyond 2010; the new <br>\nagreement is only about changing the name.</p>\n<p>This is not a formal vote, but if you have strong objections to this <br>\ndecision, please address them to the TPHOLs Steering Committee by <br>\nreplying to this email. We will try to take your arguments into account.</p>\n<p>Tobias Nipkow<br>\nTPHOLs Steering Committee chair</p>",
