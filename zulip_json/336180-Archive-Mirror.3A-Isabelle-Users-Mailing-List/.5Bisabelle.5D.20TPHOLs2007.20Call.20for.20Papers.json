This includes, but is not limited to, the<br>\nfollowing topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Formal semantics of specification, modelling, and programming<br>\n   languages: formal synthesis, validated compilation, formal design<br>\n   flows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specification and verification of hardware: microprocessors,<br>\n   memory systems, buses, pipelines, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specification and verification of software: program verification,<br>\n   refinement, and synthesis for functional, declarative and imperative<br>\n   languages; proof carrying code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formalization of mathematical theories.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advances in theorem prover technology: proof automation and decision<br>\n   procedures, induction, combination of deductive and algorithmic<br>\n   approaches, incorporation of theorem provers into larger systems,<br>\n   combination of theorem provers with other provers and tools. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Industrial application of theorem provers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proof Pearls: concise and elegant presentations of interesting<br>\n   examples.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other topics, including: security algorithms, properties, and<br>\n   policies; specification and requirements analysis of systems;<br>\n   user interfaces for theorem provers; development and extension of<br>\n   higher order logics.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<p>Submissions are invited in the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Category A: Full research paper</li>\n<li>Category B: Emerging Trends</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions under category A will be fully refereed, and accepted papers<br>\nwill be published as a volume of Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in<br>\nComputer Science series (<a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html</a>),<br>\nwhich will be available at the conference. Authors of accepted papers<br>\nare expected to present their work at the conference.</p>\n<p>Submissions under category B will not be formally refereed, but their<br>\ncontent and relevance will be reviewed. Those submissions accepted will<br>\nbe published in a technical report of the University of Kaiserslautern,<br>\nwhich will also be available at the conference. Authors of accepted papers<br>\nare expected to present a brief outline of their work at the conference<br>\nand to prepare a poster for display at the conference venue. Unless<br>\notherwise requested, submissions rejected under category A will also<br>\nbe considered for inclusion under category B.</p>\n<p>Papers should be no more than 16 pages in length and should be written<br>\nusing LaTeX2e and the LNCS style file, which is available from<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>.
