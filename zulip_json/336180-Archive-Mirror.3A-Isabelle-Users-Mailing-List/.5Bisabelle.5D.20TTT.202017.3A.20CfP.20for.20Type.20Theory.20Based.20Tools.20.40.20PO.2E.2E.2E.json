Note the early deadline]</p>\n<p>Overview<br>\n=======<br>\nThe aim of this workshop is to showcase modern tools based on type<br>\ntheory, whether designed for programming or for verification, whether<br>\nacademic projects or used in an industrial setting. It will provide a<br>\nforum to highlight and discuss their common and their distinctive<br>\nfeatures, and the future directions of development of the tools. The<br>\nprogram will consist of invited and contributed talks, and will<br>\nencourage informal discussion. Abstracts will be displayed on the<br>\nwebsite of the workshop but there will be no proceedings. We solicit<br>\nabstract submissions proposing demos, case studies, describing the<br>\nimpact of a theoretical result on practice, or any other aspect of the<br>\ndevelopment and use of tools based on type theory. In particular, we<br>\nwelcome submissions about prototype implementations and promising work<br>\nin progress, as soon as they have the potential of raising interesting<br>\ndiscussions.</p>\n<p>This workshop is funded by the EUTypes COST project<br>\n(<a href=\"https://eutypes.cs.ru.nl/\">https://eutypes.cs.ru.nl/</a>).
