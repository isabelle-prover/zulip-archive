No regular displays. All new displays at our place are <br>\n1080p these days. And the Output of the sledgehammer tool and the panel <br>\nitself don't really fit on the side if you give it a try.

The complete lack of feedback in<br>\nthe editor pane about sledgehammer is one of the reasons why I continue<br>\nto invoke sledgehammer by typing.</p>\n<p>(Of course there is more to it. In the editor, I can change \"by (metis<br>\nfoo bar baz)\" relatively easily to \"sledgehammer (add: foo bar baz)\". I<br>\ndon’t know how I would do a similar thing with the panel. Maybe with<br>\nmore interaction in the panel (such as “update this failing metis call<br>\nby using its lemmas in the sledgehammer panel”).</p>\n<p>But UI guided interaction will always be limited in expressiveness and<br>\nefficiency, compared to a textual interface.
