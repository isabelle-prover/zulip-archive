It has hosted<br>\nthe IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2007),<br>\nthe 24th International Conference on Automated Deduction<br>\n(CADE 2011), and the 22nd European Symposium on Algorithms (ALGO 2014).</p>\n<p>TOPICS<br>\nTableaux methods offer a convenient and flexible set of tools<br>\nfor automated reasoning in classical logic, extensions of classical<br>\nlogic, and a large number of non-classical logics. For large<br>\ngroups of logics, tableaux methods can be generated automatically.<br>\nAreas of application include verification of software and computer<br>\nsystems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its required<br>\ninference engines, teaching, and system diagnosis.<br>\nThe conference series aims to bring together researchers interested in all<br>\naspects of tableaux - theoretical foundations, applications,<br>\nand implementation techniques.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>tableaux methods for classical and non-classical logics<br>\n(e.g. modal, temporal, description, intuitionistic, substructural,<br>\nfuzzy, paraconsistent logics) and their proof theoretic<br>\nfoundations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>related methods (model elimination, model checking, connection<br>\nmethods, resolution, BDDs).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>sequent calculi for classical and non-classical logics,<br>\nas tools for proof search and proof representation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>flexible, easily extendable, light weight methods for theorem proving.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>novel types of calculi for theorem proving and verification<br>\nin classical and non-classical logics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>systems, tools, implementations and applications (provers,<br>\nlogical frameworks, model checkers, ... ).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>implementation techniques (data structures, efficient algorithms,<br>\nperformance measurement, extendibility, ... ).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>extensions of tableaux procedures with conflict-driven learning,<br>\ngeneration of proofs; compact (or humanly readable) representation<br>\nof proofs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>decision procedures, theoretically optimal procedures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>applications of automated deduction to mathematics, software<br>\ndevelopment, protocol verification, or teaching.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TABLEAUX 2015 also welcomes papers describing applications of tableaux<br>\nprocedures to real world examples. Such papers should be tailored to<br>\nthe tableaux community and should focus on the role of reasoning,<br>\nand logical aspects of the solution.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>\nSubmissions are invited in two categories:</p>\n<p>A Research papers, which describe original theoretical research,<br>\noriginal algorithms, or applications, with length<br>\nup to 15 pages.<br>\nB System descriptions, with length up to 10 pages.</p>\n<p>Submissions will be reviewed by the PC, possibly will help of<br>\nexternal reviewers, taking into account readability, relevance<br>\nand originality.</p>\n<p>For category A, theoretical results and algorithms must be original,<br>\nand not submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions will be reviewed<br>\ntaking into account correctness, theoretical prettyness, and possible<br>\nimplementability.</p>\n<p>For category B submissions, a working implementation<br>\nmust be available on the internet, which includes sources.<br>\nThe aim of a system description is to make the system available<br>\nin such a way that users can use it, understand it, and build on it.</p>\n<p>Accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference<br>\nproceedings (within the LNAI series of Springer).</p>\n<p>For accepted papers in both of the categories, at least one author<br>\nis required to attend the conference and present the paper.</p>\n<p>Further information and instructions about submissions can be found<br>\non the conference website http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl&lt;<a href=\"http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl/\">http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl/</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>Abstract submission deadline: May 8th, 2015<br>\nPaper submission deadline: May 15th, 2015<br>\nAuthor Notification: July 1st, 2015<br>\nFinal Version: July 17th 2015<br>\nConference: September 21st-24th, 2015</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Marc Bezem, University of Bergen, Norway<br>\nAgata Ciabattoni, Vienna University of Technology, Austria<br>\nDavid Delahaye, National Conservatory of Arts and Professions, Paris,<br>\nFrance<br>\nUlrich Furbach, University of Koblenz, Germany<br>\nDidier Galmiche, Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France<br>\nSilvio Ghilardi, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Italy<br>\nRajeev Gore, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia<br>\nStephane Graham-Lengrand, Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France<br>\nReiner Haehnle, Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany<br>\nKonstantin Korovin, University of Manchester, UK<br>\nGeorge Metcalfe, University of Bern, Switzerland<br>\nDale Miller, INRIA Saclay-Ile-de-France, France<br>\nBarbara Morawska, Technische Universitaet Dresden, Germany<br>\nBoris Motik, University of Oxford, UK<br>\nClaudia Nalon, University of Brasilia, Brasil<br>\nSara Negri, University of Helsinki, Finland<br>\nLinh Anh Nguyen, University of Warsaw, Poland<br>\nHans de Nivelle (chair), University of Wroclaw, Poland<br>\nJens Otten, University of Potsdam, Germany<br>\nAndrei Popescu, Middlesex University London, UK<br>\nRenate Schmidt, University of Manchester, UK<br>\nLuca Vigano, King's College, London, UK<br>\nBruno Woltzenlogel-Paleo, Vienna University of Technology, Austria</p>\n<p>WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Workshops have been solicited in separate call, which can<br>\nbe found on http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl&lt;<a href=\"http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl/\">http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl/</a>&gt; or<br>\nhttp://frocos2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl&lt;<a href=\"http://frocos2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl/\">http://frocos2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl/</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Tutorials for FroCoS/TABLEAUX will be solicited in a separate call, which<br>\nwill be published later.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Please note that Middlesex University's preferred way of receiving all correspondence is via email in line with our Environmental Policy.
