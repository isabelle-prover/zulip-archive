Thanks to a decision of the EPTCS editorial board<br>\n  adapting to the specific situation, the proceedings already received<br>\n  the approval to be published by EPTCS.</p>\n<p>ThEdu'20 Scope:</p>\n<p>Computer Theorem Proving is becoming a paradigm as well as a<br>\n  technological base for a new generation of educational software in<br>\n  science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The workshop brings<br>\n  together experts in automated deduction with experts in education in<br>\n  order to further clarify the shape of the new software generation and<br>\n  to discuss existing systems.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full Papers:         14 June 2020</li>\n<li>Author Notification: 12 July 2020</li>\n<li>Revised papers due:  13 Sept.2020</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Topics of interest include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>methods of automated deduction applied to checking students' input;</li>\n<li>\n<p>methods of automated deduction applied to prove post-conditions<br>\n   for particular problem solutions;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>combinations of deduction and computation enabling systems to<br>\n   propose next steps;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>automated provers specific for dynamic geometry systems;</p>\n</li>\n<li>proof and proving in mathematics education.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<p>We welcome submission of full papers presenting original unpublished work<br>\n  which is not been submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>All contributions will be reviewed (blind review) by three members<br>\n  of the PC for each submission, to meet the high standards of EPTCS.</p>\n<p>The authors should comply with the \"instructions for authors\", LaTeX<br>\n  style files and accept the \"Non-exclusive license to distribute\" of<br>\n  EPTCS: Instructions for authors (<a href=\"http://info.eptcs.org/\">http://info.eptcs.org/</a>) LaTeX style<br>\n  file and formatting instructions (<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org/\">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>) Copyright<br>\n  (<a href=\"http://copyright.eptcs.org/\">http://copyright.eptcs.org/</a>)</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted via EasyChair,  <br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu20\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu20</a>.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Francisco Botana, University of Vigo at Pontevedra, Spain<br>\n  David Cerna, Johannes Kepler University, Austria<br>\n  Joao Marcos, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil (co-chair)<br>\n  Filip Maric, University of Belgrade, Serbia<br>\n  Adolfo Neto, Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná, Brazil<br>\n  Walther Neuper, Graz University of Technology, Austria (co-chair)<br>\n  Pedro Quaresma, University of Coimbra, Portugal (co-chair)<br>\n  Philippe R.
