The net outcome <br>\nis that we can write \"THE x. f x\" interchangeably with \"The f\". What I'm <br>\ntrying to say is that everything you find on 'THE' (where lemma names <br>\nusually use the lowercase \"the\") is in fact a statement about 'The' <br>\n(i.e., informally speaking The and THE are the same). The axiomatization <br>\nin HOL is</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>the_eq_trivial: \"(THE x. x = a) = (a::'a)\"</p>\n<p>(which could equivalently be written as \"The (%x. x = a) = (a::'a)\").</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How can I prove theorems that involve The? For example, it would seem that</p>\n<p>EX x. f x ==&gt; a = The f ==&gt; f a<br>\nThis is not a valid fact as can be found out by nitpicking again (sorry <br>\nfor the joke, I mean the Isabelle tool nitpick this time). Just type</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>lemma \"Ex x. f x ==&gt; a = The f ==&gt; f a\"<br>\n   nitpick</p>\n<p>and nitpick will show you a counter-example.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The f = (THE x. f x)<br>\nThis is just reflexivity of \"op =\", since the left-hand side and <br>\nright-hand side are equal (just using syntactic sugar on the right).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>lemma \"The f = (THE x. f x)\"<br>\n     by (rule refl)</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",
