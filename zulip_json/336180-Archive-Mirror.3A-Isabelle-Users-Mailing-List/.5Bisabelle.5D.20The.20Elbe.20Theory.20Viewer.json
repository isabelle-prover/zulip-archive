Some theory files <br>\nreally look fine with it. I built it in order to view theories without <br>\nhaving installed proof general or Isabelle. It is called Elbe 0.94, which <br>\nis also the name of a river in my home town. It can be used to edit and <br>\npreview theories and also to directly run batch programs, *.cmd or *.bat. <br>\nAn extension to other languages is planned. There are minor <br>\nincompatibilities with the font Isabelle.ttf. Because there could be more <br>\nbugs the program contains a simple feedback dialogue. The download page is</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cococo.de/index.jsp?content=elbe\">http://cococo.de/index.jsp?content=elbe</a> </p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nJD</p>",
