We introduced the context only as a type and did not use<br>\na predicate to restrict the left side of function application to values.</p>\n<p>We not only used Isabelle/HOL, but Thomas used HOL4/HOL-Foot to model<br>\nproblem 1 and problem 2.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Final score: 585 / 600</p>\n<p>Rank: 7</p>\n<p>Comments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Problem 2: definition of \"red\" does not impose the context C to have<br>\n  values on the lhs of applications. (-10 points)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Problem 3: the definition of ring_buffer is somewhat difficult to read.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>If you want to see our submission, you can find it here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/vstte-2012-verification-competition/msg/c4073adfca97b904\">http://groups.google.com/group/vstte-2012-verification-competition/msg/c4073adfca97b904</a></p>\n<p>Greetings,<br>\n  Johannes</p>",

        "content": "<p>From: Burkhart Wolff &lt;<a href=\"mailto:Burkhart.Wolff@lri.fr\">Burkhart.Wolff@lri.fr</a>&gt;<br>\nDear all,</p>\n<p>apparently I was the only one from the Isabelle community that <br>\nwas present at the awards show of the VSTTE 2012 competition.<br>\nI will therefore give a brief report and share some observations<br>\nwhich might be relevant for teams that are interested to<br>\nparticipate in future instances of this event.</p>\n<p>The VSTTE Modeling and Verification contest <br>\n(<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/vstte2012/compet/\">https://sites.google.com/site/vstte2012/compet/</a>)<br>\nis an  open competition for all sorts of modeling and verification <br>\nenvironments. To be solved in about 2 days  by fixed teams <br>\nup to 4 members, the problems  are from the domain<br>\nof verification of sequential algorithms<br>\n(see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx2c3R0ZTIwMTJ8Z3g6OWE2MjQ3YzA5ZmRjOWQ4\">https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx2c3R0ZTIwMTJ8Z3g6OWE2MjQ3YzA5ZmRjOWQ4</a><br>\nfor the problem description sheet).<br>\nThe algorithms are so generic that they<br>\ncould be addressed by Isabelle/Simpl, but also<br>\nin Isabelle/HOL directly. Termination proofs of nonstandard<br>\nrecursions were an important part of the problem solutions.</p>\n<p>The submission to the competition ended 10.11. 2011,<br>\nthe results have been posted on 28.1.2012.</p>\n<p>They reads as follows:<br>\nGold medal (600 points):<br>\nTeam \"acl2-dkms\": Jared Davis, Matt Kaufmann, J Strother Moore, and Sol Swords with ACL2.<br>\nTeam \"KIV\": Gidon Ernst, Gerhard Schellhorn, Kurt Stenzel, and Bogdan Tofan using KIV.<br>\nSilver medal (595 points):<br>\nTeam \"LeinoMueller\": K. Rustan M. Leino and Peter Müller with Dafny.<br>\nTeam \"SRI\": Sam Owre and Natarajan Shankar using PVS.<br>\nBronze medal (590 points):<br>\nTeam \"eam\": Ernie Cohen and Michał Moskal with VCC.<br>\nTeam \"JasonAndNadia\": Jason Koenig and Nadia Polikarpova with Dafny.</p>\n<p>So, unfortunately, no Isabelle team made it among the top 6. </p>\n<p>Interestingly, both winning teams had 4 members and made several attempts to model and verify the same<br>\nproblem. Jay explained that they set up a telephone conference one hour after the opening of the competition,<br>\nand then attacked various problems off-line, (besides the competition, all of them had other duties. Jay was,<br>\nfor example, attending a faculty meeting in the meantime ... ), joined regularly<br>\ntheir results and rotated responsabilities for problems later on. In the late phase, the entire team<br>\nconcentrated on the remaining problems.</p>\n<p>A look on the winning teams shows also that it helps to have an established team and tool chain<br>\n(for imperative problems or not). The leading field was close - \"eam\" \"lost\" only because of a minor<br>\nmodeling problem in a precondition. </p>\n<p>The competition allowed even modifications of the tools during the competition; apparently<br>\nno winning team made use of this option ...</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>bu</p>",
