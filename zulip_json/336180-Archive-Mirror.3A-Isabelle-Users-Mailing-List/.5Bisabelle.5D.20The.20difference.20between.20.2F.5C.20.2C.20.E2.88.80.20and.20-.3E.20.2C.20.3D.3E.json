        "content": "<p>From: Larry Paulson &lt;<a href=\"mailto:lp15@cam.ac.uk\">lp15@cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>\nThis is a fundamental question about Isabelle as a logical framework. Isabelle provides general inference mechanisms for combining proofs and for proving not just simple statements, but what are essentially inference rules. This requires a form of universal quantification and a form of implication that operate outside the level of logical assertions.</p>\n<p>The advantage of having separate symbols can be seen when comparing Isabelle proofs with those done in other implementations of higher-order logic. Let suppose that you have proved the theorem</p>\n<p>P(x,y) ==&gt; Q(y) ==&gt; P (x, f x).</p>\n<p>With Isabelle, the quantification over x and y and the implications for P and Q are dealt with automatically, whether you use this “forwards” or “backwards”. But in a traditional HOL system, you’ll devote effort to removing the quantifiers and reasoning with the implications. And the difference is even greater when you use or derive specialist induction rules.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
