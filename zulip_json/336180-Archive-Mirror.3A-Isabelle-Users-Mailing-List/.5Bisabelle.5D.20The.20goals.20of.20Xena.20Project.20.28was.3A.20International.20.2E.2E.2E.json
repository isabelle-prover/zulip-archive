It was nearly 5 hours of work (including solution and formal<br>\nverification). I stopped for a coffee and food. So, I think that an<br>\nInternational Olympiad in Isabelle will be possible in such conditions.</p>\n<p>The problem was ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS in the following link:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~wwu/riddles/putnam.shtml\">https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~wwu/riddles/putnam.shtml</a></p>\n<p>My solution is here (it is not the most elegant formalization, because I<br>\nwas in a hurry trying to be as fast as possible):<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/josephcmac/Folklore-and-miscellaneous-results-in-number-theory/blob/master/ArithProgRelPrimes.thy\">https://github.com/josephcmac/Folklore-and-miscellaneous-results-in-number-theory/blob/master/ArithProgRelPrimes.thy</a></p>\n<p>After the formal verification, my understanding of the problem was much<br>\nbetter than before.</p>\n<p>I hope that one day the goals of the so-called Xena Project, i.e.,<br>\nmathematical education with proof assistants, will be a current reality in<br>\nmost of universities of the world:<br>\n<a href=\"https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2018/10/07/what-is-the-xena-project/\">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2018/10/07/what-is-the-xena-project/</a></p>\n<p>Competition is the best way to motivate people to do something new.</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nJosé M.</p>\n<p>El lun., 18 jun. 2018 a las 8:19, Max Haslbeck (&lt;<a href=\"mailto:haslbema@in.tum.de\">haslbema@in.tum.de</a>&gt;)<br>\nescribió:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear José,</p>\n<p>we had a similar idea for a \"proving contest\", implemented a prototype<br>\nversion<br>\nand tested it with the Isabelle group here in Munich.<br>\nSimon and I wrote up a few pages documenting the idea:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www21.in.tum.de/~haslbema/documents/provingcontests_draft18.pdf\">http://www21.in.tum.de/~haslbema/documents/provingcontests_draft18.pdf</a></p>\n<p>We are planning to push this further in future.<br>\nThe technical details aside, I think, the hardest part is to find suitable<br>\ntasks (mathematical theorems, riddles, programs + their verification, ...)<br>\nthat are solvable within - say - 5 hours.</p>\n<p>cheers,<br>\nmax</p>\n<p>2018-06-17 16:04 GMT+02:00 José Manuel Rodriguez Caballero &lt;<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:josephcmac@gmail.com\">josephcmac@gmail.com</a>&gt;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello,<br>\n  I just want to suggest, as an abstract possibility, that in order to<br>\nintroduce proof-assistants in popular culture, to organize an<br>\nInternational<br>\nOlympiad in Isabelle could be a good strategy. I imagine such an Olympiad<br>\nas many high school students in a room, in front of their computers,<br>\ntrying<br>\nto mechanize the proof of a hard theorem from elementary mathematics that<br>\nis written on a blackboard, e.g., a theorem due to Erdos or Ramanujan. To<br>\nuse papers to write the arguments is forbidden: the proof should go from<br>\ntheir brain to Isabelle in a direct way. The first student who finishes<br>\nthe<br>\nproof win (this can be checked in an automatic).</p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nJosé M.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
