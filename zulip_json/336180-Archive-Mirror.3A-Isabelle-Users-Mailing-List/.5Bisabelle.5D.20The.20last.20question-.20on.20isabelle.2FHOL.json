It encourages me to try more. I corrected my model by the help of <br>\nyour answer. It gets realy like Otway-Rees.<br>\nBut it is still too slow andÂ can not prove the lemmas. It would be realy kind of you if you do me your last favor and tell me what is the reason and how I can fix it.<br>\nI have enclosed the file by this e-mail.<br>\n<br>\nThank you very much<br>\nRegards<br>\nShadi Shiri<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/5MJPW4W95YCBfOzN_Md7DOzw/Final-Kryptonight.thy\">Final Kryptonight.thy</a></p>",

The problem is that these properties  <br>\ntypically require inductive proofs, but you simply invoke \"blast\" and  <br>\nexpect Isabelle to do the rest. Secrecy properties are difficult to  <br>\nprove and they are not suitable as exercises for beginners. I suggest  <br>\nthat you read the Isabelle tutorial and spend some months working on  <br>\nsimpler problems before attempting to verify security protocols.<br>\nLarry Paulson</p>",
