No metis proof can be found for the <br>\nparticular situation, but a good smt proof comes to the rescue. Only <br>\noccasionally do the ATPs resort to smt proofs, but when the ATPs need <br>\nto, they seem to do it at the right time.</p>\n<p>If I say good things about tools like smt, then maybe certain developers <br>\nwill keep doing good things to help it help me.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nGB<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/0hoOp9lzF4V01MaJb0ORVNon/120211_sfS_smt_proof.png\">120211_sfS_smt_proof.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/0hoOp9lzF4V01MaJb0ORVNon/120211_sfS_smt_proof.png\" title=\"120211_sfS_smt_proof.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/0hoOp9lzF4V01MaJb0ORVNon/120211_sfS_smt_proof.png\"></a></div>",
