Papaspyrou\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:nickie@softlab.ntua.gr\">nickie@softlab.ntua.gr</a>&gt;<br>\nWhen generating the graph of theorem dependencies for a non-trivial theorem in a<br>\nquite large theory, one usually does not want to see all of his/her theorems<br>\nthere.  A concrete example: one may have a group of ten related minor lemmata<br>\nthat are used in the proof of a large theorem.  It would be nice if these ten<br>\ncould be \"grouped\" together as a single node in the dependency graph.</p>\n<p>At the moment, the only way I know to achieve this effect is to put the ten<br>\nlemmata in a separate theory.  Wouldn't it be nice if the dependency graph could<br>\n understand, for example, the sectioning mechanism?  Has anyone tried to do what<br>\nI suggest?  Or have a different workaround?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nNikos.</p>",
