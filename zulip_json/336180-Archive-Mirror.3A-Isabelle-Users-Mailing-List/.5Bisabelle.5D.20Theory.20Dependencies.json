Hence, I really do not want to rebuild it if not necessary. As <br>\nyou see, there are no real dependencies in the target (except the ML <br>\nfile). So whenever I call 'isabelle make' it is only built when it does <br>\nnot already exist (which means that I have to manually remove it <br>\nwhenever I have to rebuild). It would be more convenient if all the <br>\nnecessary dependencies could be integrated into the IsaMakefile <br>\nautomatically. Hence my question, is there an established way of finding <br>\nthe (transitive) theory dependencies of a given thy/ML-file? If not, <br>\nwhat are the relevant Isabelle/ML-functions?</p>\n<p>A nice feature would be 'isabelle dependencies &lt;files&gt;', for use inside <br>\nan IsaMakefile.</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",
