This theory instantiates the order type<br>\nclass for lists like this:</p>\n<p>definition \"(xs::'a list) &lt;= ys == prefixeq xs ys\"<br>\ndefinition \"(xs::'a list) &lt; ys == xs &lt;= ys &amp; Not (ys &lt;= xs)\"</p>\n<p>It then goes on to lift theorems about the constants 'prefixeq' and<br>\n'prefix' to the constants 'op &lt;=' and 'op &lt;', adding simp/intro/elim<br>\nattributes in the process. However, a few things seem to have gone<br>\nwrong here. First off, we have:</p>\n<p>lemmas prefixI [intro?] = prefixeqI [folded less_eq_list_def]<br>\nlemmas strict_prefixI [intro?] = prefixI [folded less_list_def]</p>\n<p>The first line hides the fact Sublist.prefixI, so the theorem declared<br>\nin the second line is just a duplicate of the one in the first and the<br>\n'folded less_list_def' attribute is applied in vain.</p>\n<p>However, even when using the fully qualified fact Sublist.prefixI, it<br>\ndoesn't work the way I assume it was intended to, since 'op &lt;' is not<br>\ndefined in terms of 'prefix', so the 'folded less_list_def' attribute<br>\nstill doesn't apply.</p>\n<p>Attached are my attempts at fixing these and a few other issues.<br>\nPlease let me know if I should have posted this on the developer<br>\nmailing list.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n Julian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/qBSRHc0PqN9c1jq3yFlIJukU/Prefix_Order.patch\">Prefix_Order.patch</a></p>",
