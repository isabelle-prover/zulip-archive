They come in combination with several other operations like positions (paths to subtrees), contexts (trees containing one hole), etc.</p>\n<p>The whole formalization is available at <a href=\"http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/ceta/\">http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/ceta/</a><br>\nwhere most likely, you’re mainly interested in the theory thys/Rewriting/Term.thy<br>\n(e.g., <a href=\"http://cl2-informatik.uibk.ac.at/rewriting/mercurial.cgi/IsaFoR/file/v2.23/thys/Rewriting/Term.thy\">http://cl2-informatik.uibk.ac.at/rewriting/mercurial.cgi/IsaFoR/file/v2.23/thys/Rewriting/Term.thy</a>)</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nRené</p>",
