This helps to avoid a certain forms of memory leak: there could<br>\nbe 10^5 or 10^6 intermediate theory values that are not needed later on, due<br>\nto the mandatory Thm.transfer applied later.</p>\n<p>In Isabelle2019 and afterwards, more and more tools do Thm.trim_context to<br>\nsave memory, but also as reminder that a proper Thm.transfer is required to<br>\nrevive the retrieved thm: after Thm.trim_context you get an exception on<br>\nThm.theory_of_thm if you forget Thm.transfer.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
