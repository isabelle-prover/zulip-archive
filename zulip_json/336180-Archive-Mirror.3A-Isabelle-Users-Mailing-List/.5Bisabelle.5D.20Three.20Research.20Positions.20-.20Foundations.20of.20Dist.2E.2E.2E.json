Thanks,<br>\nPeter</p>\n<p>RESEARCH ASSOCIATE/RESEARCH ASSISTANT (THREE POSTS)<br>\nFoundations of Distributed Computation</p>\n<p>Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge</p>\n<p>&lt;<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/advert2.html\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/advert2.html</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Ref No: NR60<br>\nGrade: NRAS Salary: 20,044 - 30,002 pa. <br>\nGrade: RAST Salary: 20,044 - 22,289 pa</p>\n<p>Limit of tenure: Up to two years for two Research Associate positions;<br>\none year for one Research Assistant position.</p>\n<p>Three Research Assistant/Research Associate positions are available in<br>\nthe foundations of distributed computation, funded by EPSRC grants<br>\nEP/C510712 (Sewell, Gibbens, Norrish) and GR/T11715 (Sewell, Pitts).</p>\n<p>The work spans several areas:</p>\n<p>* Design, semantics and implementation of programming language<br>\n       constructs for distribution - covering type-safe communication,<br>\n       naming, version change, module systems, and dynamic linking.</p>\n<p>* Formal specification, automated testing and proof about<br>\n       real-world network protocols.</p>\n<p>* Tool support for mechanisation of large semantic definitions.<br>\n    * Reasoning about executable distributed programs.</p>\n<p>It builds on previous work on the experimental Acute programming<br>\nlanguage, on the NetSem semantics of real-world network protocols, and<br>\non the concerns of the POPLmark challenge problem in semantic<br>\nmechanisation. Details of all these can be found at<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/index.html#PAPERS\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/index.html#PAPERS</a>&gt;.</p>\n<p>For the two-year positions you should have a PhD in Computer Science,<br>\nwith a strong background in one or more of the following:</p>\n<p>* Programming Language Semantics<br>\n    * Programming Language Implementation (especially with respect to OCaml)<br>\n    * Automated proof assistants (especially one or more of HOL,<br>\n       Isabelle, Coq, and Twelf).</p>\n<p>* Network Protocols<br>\n    * Distributed Systems</p>\n<p>The one-year appointment may be either at the postdoctoral level<br>\n(Research Associate) as above, or at a post-graduate level (Research<br>\nAssistant). For the latter you should have a good first-class degree<br>\nin Computer Science. For a suitably experienced candidate it may be<br>\npossible to upgrade to a Senior Research Associate appointment.</p>\n<p>Enquiries about the project should be addressed to Dr Peter Sewell,<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/</a>&gt;.</p>\n<p>To apply please send as soon as possible a letter of application<br>\nincluding a brief statement of the particular contribution you would<br>\nmake to the project, a CV, a completed PD18 form<br>\n(&lt;<a href=\"http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/personnel/forms/pd18/\">http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/personnel/forms/pd18/</a>&gt;) and the<br>\nnames and contact details (postal and email addresses) of 2 referees to</p>\n<p>Kate Ellis<br>\n  University of Cambridge<br>\n  Computer Laboratory<br>\n  15 JJ Thomson Avenue<br>\n  Cambridge<br>\n  CB3 0FD<br>\n  United Kingdom</p>\n<p>or by e-mail (with documents in PDF format) to <a href=\"mailto:personnel-admin@cl.cam.ac.uk\">personnel-admin@cl.cam.ac.uk</a>.<br>\nClosing date: 20 April 2006.</p>",
