The<br>\nmaster_directory has actually become a bit less relevant to Isabelle/ML<br>\nuser codes, because Resources.parse_files and<br>\nResources.provide_parse_files have taken over the details of managing<br>\nexternal sources in a way that also works with the Prover IDE (but that<br>\nimportant change is not document either -- it needs to be derived from<br>\nthe typical uses in the sources).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And imao this line: \"ThyLoad ~&gt; Thy_Load\" in the NEWS file is useless the<br>\nstructure does not even exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>NEWS contains the cumulative (immutable) history of user-relevant<br>\nchanges. The renaming of \"ThyLoad ~&gt; Thy_Load\" belongs to Isabelle2009-2<br>\n(June 2010). This can be seen in the SideKick tree view of<br>\nIsabelle/jEdit -- the NEWS file says in the very beginning:</p>\n<p>Note: Isabelle/jEdit shows a tree-view of the NEWS file in Sidekick.</p>\n<p>I find it very hard to work without the Prover IDE these days. It is<br>\nrelevant for the NEWS file, ROOT files, ML files, thy files ...</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

Asking us to be 100% consistent in terms of determining what is relevant for the NEWS file is asking too much of mere human beings.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, you can assume that the vast majority of changes to the ML interface are not going to be documented (beyond the Mercurial history). This is unfortunate, but documenting every change would put a too heavy burden on the developers, given the ratio \"users of ML interface : developers\". For a project with 10, 100, or 1000 users (and, hopefully, more developers and higher salaries for them and no requirement to publish or perish), the situation would be different.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
