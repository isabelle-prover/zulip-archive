I think you are right that a uniqueness quantifier is useful to have, for Isabelle/HOL as well as for FOL. We are likely to introduce such a thing. While we welcome contributions, they should normally take the form of small snippets of new material as opposed to entire revised files.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
