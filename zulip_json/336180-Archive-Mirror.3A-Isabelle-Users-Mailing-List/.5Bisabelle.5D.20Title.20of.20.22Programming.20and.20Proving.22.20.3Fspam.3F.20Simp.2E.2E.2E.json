Isabelle has many <br>\ndifferent manuals from many different angles looking at the system, and a <br>\nlong time-span covered in the writing of the texts. Larry even goes as far <br>\nsaying, that nobody reads manuals anyway. Nonetheless I spend myself a lot <br>\nof time to keep the main reference manuals up-to-date, with more and more <br>\nexamples.  And others have updated various tutorials over time.</p>\n<p>Concerning \"guidance\", that is also an open issue for the Prover IDE. When <br>\nI start Netbeans, it guides me quickly through the process of producing a <br>\nsimple Java program.  Little of that is there in Isabelle/jEdit so far. <br>\nAt least in Isabelle2012, you should get a near 100% success rate in <br>\nstarting it up on your platform, whatever it is (excluding *BSD).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>at least I have /usr/share/doc/isabelle-2012/doc/Contents when <br>\ninstalling from the Gentoo Linux package</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Better ignore these home-made derivatives of the official Isabelle <br>\ndistribution, they will always be 1 or 2 steps behind the real thing.</p>\n<p>Many years ago, I was fond of making OS packages myself as a hobby, long <br>\nbefore Debian and Gentoo existed.  It is rather pointless for Isabelle <br>\nnow, because the distribution is constructed in a way what would be called <br>\n\"portable application\" these days.  So you don't care about \"installing\" <br>\nit, you just put it somewhere and run it.  (This annoys packagers, because <br>\nthey become obsolete, but users usually like it.)</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
