One way to achieve the necessary level of assurance<br>\nis to use formal specification and proof. Tool support for this<br>\napproach has steadily grown in sophistication and power, to the point<br>\nwhere the specification and verification of important system<br>\ninfrastructure is an emerging fact.</p>\n<p>To survey the state of the art and discuss future possibilities and<br>\nchallenges, we are pleased to announce a two day research meeting, to<br>\nbe held in honour of Professor Mike Gordon on the occasion of his 60th<br>\nbirthday.  The meeting will be held on Tuesday 25 and Wednesday 26<br>\nMarch 2008 at the Royal Society, London.</p>\n<p>The following speakers will present their research:</p>\n<p>Mike Gordon, Cambridge University<br>\n    John Harrison, Intel<br>\n    Sava Krstic, Intel<br>\n    Xavier Leroy, INRIA<br>\n    Tom Melham, Oxford University<br>\n    Robin Milner, Cambridge University<br>\n    J Moore, University of Texas at Austin<br>\n    Tobias Nipkow, Technical University of Munich<br>\n    Michael Norrish, NICTA<br>\n    Larry Paulson, Cambridge University<br>\n    Peter Sewell, Cambridge University<br>\n    Laurent Thery, INRIA</p>\n<p>An important part of the meeting will be poster presentation sessions,<br>\nin which attendees may present their research.  Detailed information<br>\nabout how to submit an abstract for a poster presentation, and to<br>\nregister for the meeting, will be announced in due course.</p>\n<p>Organizing Committee:</p>\n<p>Richard Boulton, Icera<br>\n   Joe Hurd, Galois<br>\n   Konrad Slind, University of Utah</p>\n<p>For all enquiries about the Festschrift, please use the email address  <br>\n<a href=\"mailto:info@ttvsi.org\">info@ttvsi.org</a></p>",
