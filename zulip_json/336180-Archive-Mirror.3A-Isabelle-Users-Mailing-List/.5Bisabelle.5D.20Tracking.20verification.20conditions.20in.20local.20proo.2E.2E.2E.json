The usual way is to create a dummy<br>\ndefinition and wrap it around the \"...\" of \"A1\" and not unfolding it.</p>\n<p>This results with a rule of the same rule with the form:</p>\n<p>definition \"my_wrap ... = ...\"</p>\n<p>lemma R_rule:<br>\n assumes A1:\"my_wrap ....\"<br>\n  shows \"....\"<br>\n unfolding my_wrap_def<br>\nproof &lt;&gt;</p>\n<p>The result will be each time I apply \"R_rule\" as an intro rule I can get<br>\nthe verification condition<br>\n  my_wrap ...., that indicate that this verification condition is coming<br>\nfrom \"A1\" of \"R_rule\".</p>\n<p>my question is:</p>\n<p>Is there a way to use the label \"A1\" automatically to do the tracking? I<br>\nmean without the need of \"my_wrap\"!<br>\nAnyone else is using this kind of trick a lot or it is just me who is using<br>\nthis trick by ignoring that something better and automatic exist already?</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Yakoub</p>",
