This seemed like a simple application of the rule “of_int_eq_0_iff” however I was unable to successfully apply this rule.<br>\nOn further probing I found that I was unable to prove the following lemma</p>\n<p>lemma of_int_eq_0_imp1: “of_int i = 0 ==&gt; i = 0”</p>\n<p>by any means whatsoever. That is, unless I declare the lemma within the context ring_char_0. Then the lemma can easily be proved as follows:</p>\n<p>context ring_char_0 begin<br>\nlemma of_int_eq_0_imp1: “of_int i = 0 ==&gt; i = 0”<br>\nusing of_int_eq_iff [of i 0] by simp<br>\nend</p>\n<p>But then I cannot apply this lemma outside of this context, which is what my main theorem requires (it resides within a different context).</p>\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>",
