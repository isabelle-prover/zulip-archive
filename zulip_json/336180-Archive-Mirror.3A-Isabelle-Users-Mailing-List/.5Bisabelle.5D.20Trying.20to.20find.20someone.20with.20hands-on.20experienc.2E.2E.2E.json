I have familiarized myself with the Isabelle<br>\nenvironment as well as another base UTP framework which is already encoded<br>\nin Isabelle. My work will extend this encoded base framework.</p>\n<p>I need someone who has had hands-on experience in Isabelle Theorem Prover<br>\nto help me out in some of the syntax issues and choices in modelling some<br>\nextensions to the existing encoding extensions. I'd like to sit down with<br>\nsomeone(or maybe skype/google hangout) to work-through my required encoding<br>\nand the modifications I've already made towards encoding the framework.</p>\n<p>I'm happy to travel anywhere within UK, if required, and also pay a<br>\nreasonable fee for his/her time.</p>\n<p>I would be very grateful if someone to contact me via this email.</p>\n<p>rgrds<br>\nIbrahim</p>",
