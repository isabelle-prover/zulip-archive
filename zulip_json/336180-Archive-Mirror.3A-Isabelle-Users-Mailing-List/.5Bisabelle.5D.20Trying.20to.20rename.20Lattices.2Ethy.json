The renaming is like this:</p>\n<p>HOL.thy is renamed       i12H02hol_0ed.thy<br>\n     Orderings.thy is renamed i12H03ord_0ed.thy<br>\n     Groups.thy is renamed    i12H04grp_0ed.thy</p>\n<p>I try to rename Lattices.thy, but it appears that the main requirement <br>\nis that the first letter of the name be capital \"L\". Names that have <br>\nworked are these:</p>\n<p>L2.thy<br>\n     Lattice2.thy<br>\n     Lattices_i12H05lat_0ed.thy</p>\n<p>If the first letter of the name is lowercase, such as \"lattices.thy\" or <br>\n\"iLattices.thy\", it gets down to line 75,</p>\n<p>lemma dual_semilattice:<br>\n        \"class.semilattice_inf sup greater_eq greater\"</p>\n<p>and it gives this error:</p>\n<p>Type unification failed: No type arity HOL.bool :: iLattices.sup<br>\n    Failed to meet type constraint:<br>\n    Term:  op ⊔ :: (??'a∷iLattices.sup ⇒ (??'a∷iLattices.sup ⇒<br>\n       ??'a∷iLattices.sup))<br>\n    Type:  (HOL.bool ⇒ (HOL.bool ⇒ HOL.bool))</p>\n<p>If the first letter of the name is capitalized, but not \"L\", such as <br>\n\"Attices.thy\", it gets to line 431,</p>\n<p>lemma dual_boolean_algebra:</p>\n<p>and gives the error:</p>\n<p>Type unification failed: Occurs check! [and so forth]</p>\n<p>It's no big deal. It just messes up my naming scheme, and the fact that <br>\nI've renamed the other three files causes me to wonder about this.</p>\n<p>If there's no problem, maybe someone can at least tell me something <br>\nlike, \"Yea, don't do that\".</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nGB</p>",

It<br>\nappears that the errors you get are caused by various locale<br>\npredicates (like class.boolean_algebra or class.semilattice_inf)<br>\nhaving different argument orders. If you rearrange the arguments into<br>\nthe right order again, everything else should work.</p>\n<p>For example, here are the argument orders for the boolean_algebra<br>\nlocale predicate, before and after:</p>\n<p>\"Lattices.thy\": class.boolean_algebra ?minus ?uminus ?inf ?less_eq<br>\n?less ?sup ?bot ?top<br>\n\"Attices.thy\":  class.boolean_algebra ?inf ?less_eq ?less ?sup ?bot<br>\n?top ?minus ?uminus</p>\n<p>I have no idea why the the argument order would depend on the theory<br>\nname. This seems like a really undesirable \"feature\".</p>\n<p>I would suggest to the other developers that we adopt a more<br>\npredictable behavior: How about having the class/locale definition<br>\ndetermine the argument order? For example, with</p>\n<p>class boolean_algebra = distrib_lattice + bounded_lattice + minus + uminus +<br>\n  assumes ...</p>\n<p>the class.boolean_algebra predicate should first have arguments of<br>\nclass.distrib_lattice, followed by those of class.bounded_lattice<br>\n(filtering out duplicates), and finally minus and uminus.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brian</li>\n</ul>",
