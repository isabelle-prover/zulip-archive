(It is independent of the code generator, so the tracing settings for the code <br>\ngenerator do not apply.)</p>\n<p>Here is a command that enables as much tracing as possible:</p>\n<p>code_pred<br>\n  [show_steps,<br>\n   show_proof_trace,<br>\n   show_intermediate_results,<br>\n   show_mode_inference,<br>\n   show_modes,<br>\n   show_compilation,<br>\n   show_invalid_clauses]<br>\n  my_inductive_predicate</p>\n<p>Just delete those options that you are not interested in. Probably you want to keep <br>\nshow_mode_inference.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
