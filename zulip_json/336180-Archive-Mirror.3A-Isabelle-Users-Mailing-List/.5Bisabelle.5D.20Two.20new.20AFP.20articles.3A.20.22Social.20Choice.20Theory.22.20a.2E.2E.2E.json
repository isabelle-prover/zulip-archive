The goal <br>\nwas to make precise the classical statements and proofs of these <br>\nresults, and to provide a foundation for more recent results such as the <br>\nGibbard-Satterthwaite and Duggan-Schwartz theorems.<br>\n<a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/SenSocialChoice.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/SenSocialChoice.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Fun With Tilings<br>\nTobias Nipkow and Lawrence Paulson</p>\n<p>Tilings are defined inductively. It is shown that one form of mutilated <br>\nchess board cannot be tiled with dominoes, while another one can be <br>\ntiled with L-shaped tiles.<br>\nPlease add further fun examples of this kind!<br>\n<a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/devel-entries/FunWithTilings.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/devel-entries/FunWithTilings.shtml</a></p>",
