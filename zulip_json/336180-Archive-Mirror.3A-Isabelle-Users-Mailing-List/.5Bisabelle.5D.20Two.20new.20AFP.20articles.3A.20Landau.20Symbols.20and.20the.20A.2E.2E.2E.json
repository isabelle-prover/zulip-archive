A number of simplification <br>\nprocedures are provided for additional convenience: cancelling of dominated <br>\nterms in sums under a Landau symbol, cancelling of common factors in products, <br>\nand a decision procedure for Landau expressions containing products of powers of <br>\nfunctions like x, ln(x), ln(ln(x)) etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Landau_Symbols.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Landau_Symbols.shtml</a></p>\n<p>The Akra-Bazzi theorem and the Master theorem<br>\nManuel Eberl</p>\n<p>This article contains a formalisation of the Akra-Bazzi method based on a proof <br>\nby Leighton. It is a generalisation of the well-known Master Theorem for <br>\nanalysing the complexity of Divide &amp; Conquer algorithms. We also include a <br>\ngeneralised version of the Master theorem based on the Akra-Bazzi theorem, which <br>\nis easier to apply than the Akra-Bazzi theorem itself.</p>\n<p>Some proof methods that facilitate applying the Master theorem are also <br>\nincluded. For a more detailed explanation of the formalisation and the proof <br>\nmethods, see the accompanying paper (publication forthcoming).</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/F9o1Ovq-RnpL4eQwPPF8_DGJ/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
