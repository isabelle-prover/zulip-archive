This entry provides a<br>\n  formalisation of the Cauchy index, which is then shown to be related<br>\n  to the winding number. In addition, this entry also offers a tactic<br>\n  that enables users to evaluate the winding number by calculating<br>\n  Cauchy indices.</p>\n<p>Count the Number of Complex Roots</p>\n<p>Based on evaluating Cauchy indices through remainder sequences, this<br>\n  entry provides an effective procedure to count the number of complex<br>\n  roots (with multiplicity) of a polynomial within a rectangle box or a<br>\n  half-plane. Potential applications of this entry include certified<br>\n  complex root isolation (of a polynomial) and testing the Routh-Hurwitz<br>\n  stability criterion (i.e., to check whether all the roots of some<br>\n  characteristic polynomial have negative real parts).</p>\n<p>For more information, have a look at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Winding_Number_Eval.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Winding_Number_Eval.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Count_Complex_Roots.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Count_Complex_Roots.html</a></p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nRen√©</p>",
