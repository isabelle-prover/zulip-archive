A special<br>\nfocus will be a) on the formalization of traffic rules using logic and b) the<br>\nconsideration of uncertainties in the future behavior of other traffic<br>\nparticipants as well as uncertainties originating from the object retrieval<br>\nof environment sensors (e.g. video cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, etc.). Using formal<br>\nverification techniques for hybrid systems should ensure legally correct<br>\nmaneuvers despite the aforementioned uncertainties. Results should be<br>\ndemonstrated in simulations and a real automated vehicle.</p>\n<p>Job requirements:</p>\n<p>- Excellent Master's degree or Ph.D in computer science, mathematics,<br>\n      engineering, or related disciplines (e.g., physics).</p>\n<p>- A solid grounding in logic.<br>\n    - Experience in at least one of the following areas:<br>\n        Theorem proving and formal verification.<br>\n        Development of domain-specific languages.<br>\n        Control theory, signals and systems.</p>\n<p>The positions will be filled as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>This is a joint project by Matthias Althoff<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www6.in.tum.de/en/people/prof-dr-ing-matthias-althoff\">http://www6.in.tum.de/en/people/prof-dr-ing-matthias-althoff</a>) and Tobias<br>\nNipkow (<a href=\"http://www.in.tum.de/~nipkow/\">http://www.in.tum.de/~nipkow/</a>) at the Technical University Munich.
