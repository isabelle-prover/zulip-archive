Let M be a module over the ring R<br>\n(R-module for short). The R-module of finite maps from elements in M to R,<br>\nwhich are homomorphisms, is denoted M* and it is called the dual R-module<br>\nof M. An Abelian group is the same as an R-module, where R is the ring of<br>\nintegers, denoted Z. If M a free Z-module, i.e. a free Abelian group, then<br>\nM* can be identified with the above-mentioned frag of HOL Light, endowed<br>\nwith the componentwise addition. Reference for dual modules:<br>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_module\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_module</a></p>\n<p>The problem is that Abstract Algebra concerns the properties of structures<br>\nwhich are independent from their concrete presentations. For any R-module<br>\nM, its dual R-module M* depends upon both M and a set S of generators of M.<br>\nIn general, for a given M, there are many choices of the set S. So, in<br>\norder to prove a property of M from a property of M*, the set S should be<br>\narbitrary from the beginning of the proof. Otherwise, the property of M*<br>\nwill be translated into a property of the pair (M, S), not just of M.<br>\nAbstract Algebra is not interested in the pair (M, S), although<br>\nComputational Algebra may be interested in such a pair.</p>\n<p>This problem was the main motivation for the introduction of the concept of<br>\nnatural transformation, and then for the development of Category Theory.<br>\nFor example, there is a natural transformation between M and M** (its<br>\ndouble dual, i.e., the dual of its dual).</p>\n<p>References for natural transformations:<br>\nText (advanced): <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/natural+transformation\">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/natural+transformation</a><br>\nVideo (elementary introduction): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LJC-XD5Ffo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LJC-XD5Ffo</a></p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\nJose M.</p>\n</blockquote>",
