He already foresaw a binding of variables connecting both term and type (subscript) level. (Gordon positively refers to Tom Melham's extension of HOL [Gordon, 2000, p. 175, fn. 7]. R0 incorporates type abstraction as a standard feature.)</p>\n<p>Mike Gordon suggesting type abstraction for HOL: “The syntax and semantics of type variables are currently being studied by several logicians. A closely related area is the theory of ‘second order’ λ-terms like λα. λx:α. x, perhaps such terms should be included in the HOL logic.” [Gordon, 2001, p. 22]</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/fom.pdf\">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/fom.pdf</a> &lt;<a href=\"http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/fom.pdf\">http://www.owlofminerva.net/files/fom.pdf</a>&gt;, p. 7</p>\n<p>Besides this, the article is excellent.<br>\nI was astonished that it even mentions the awareness of social class distinctions (white vs. brown coats), as in<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/archive/mjcg/plans/NorthThamesGasBoard.html#white-versus-brown-coats\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/archive/mjcg/plans/NorthThamesGasBoard.html#white-versus-brown-coats</a> &lt;<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/archive/mjcg/plans/NorthThamesGasBoard.html#white-versus-brown-coats\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/archive/mjcg/plans/NorthThamesGasBoard.html#white-versus-brown-coats</a>&gt;<br>\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04002.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04002.pdf</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04002.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04002.pdf</a>&gt;, p. 2</p>\n<p>Ken Kubota</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ken Kubota<br>\n<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.4444/100\">http://doi.org/10.4444/100</a> &lt;<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.4444/100\">http://doi.org/10.4444/100</a>&gt;</p>",
