Exercising this sport a bit more, there is some hope <br>\nthat for the next release full types/sorts can be included by default.</p>\n<p>The user may then inspect hyperlinks or tooltips hierarchically to reveal <br>\nmore and more of the information that is implicit in the document model.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
