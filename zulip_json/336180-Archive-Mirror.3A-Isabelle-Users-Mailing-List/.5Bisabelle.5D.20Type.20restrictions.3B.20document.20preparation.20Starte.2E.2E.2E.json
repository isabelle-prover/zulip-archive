Colin has already covered your feedback on <br>\nauction theory; he is our expert for economics.  Let me reply on the <br>\nIsabelle-specific things, with some more questions to everyone, covering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>defining restrictions of existing types</li>\n<li>tutorial.pdf vs. isar-ref.pdf</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2012-11-01 02:07 Tim (McKenzie) Makarios:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We would like to contribute our formalisation to the AFP, but are unsure about the procedure: once accepted and published, can we submit updates?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes; see <a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/updating.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/updating.shtml</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks, and sorry; I should have noticed that on the AFP homepage.  I <br>\nthink that after another revision (according to the other feedback <br>\ncollected here, plus some other things we wanted to do anyway), we will <br>\nsubmit.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>It would be nice to be able to introduce proper types (not just type_synonyms) for things such as non-negative real vectors.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Have you seen section 8.5.2 of tutorial.pdf in Isabelle's doc folder?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have, but wasn't sure whether/how it applies to what we are doing. <br>\nIIUC this is about defining completely new types from scratch, whereas <br>\nwe are rather interested in restricting existing types.</p>\n<p>Plus, a question to everyone reading this: I haven't worked with the <br>\nTutorial too much, but mainly consulted the Isar Reference.  The <br>\nTutorial does proofs in the \"apply(rule)\" style, which we don't consider <br>\nhelpful for our target audience; we prefer textbook style.  Of course, <br>\nI'm sure, for \"apply(rule)\" proof there is a straightforward translation <br>\nto Isar, but for me, being a relative beginner, this is not yet _so_ <br>\nstraightforward.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm quite interested in what you're doing; after working with Isabelle<br>\nfor my Master's project, I'm now musing about auction theory: â€¦</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interesting!  (I just can't add anything to Colin's comment.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In preparation for this,<br>\nI tried running Isabelle's document preparation system on Vickrey.thy<br>\n(see chapter 4 of isar-ref.pdf, and possibly other parts of Isabelle's<br>\ndocumentation).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So far we haven't bothered to generate a document from our <br>\nformalisation, but I agree that we should soon do.  I see that chapter <br>\n4.2 of the Tutorial also documents this.  So I should learn how to do it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Second, your \"text {* ... *}\" portions don't always contain valid LaTeX.<br>\n  I made minimal changes to get your document to compile, but I haven't<br>\nhad time to read it yet.  I've attached my edited version of your<br>\nVickrey.thy, so you can see what changes I've made.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks for these!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've made almost no<br>\neffort to make it look as you intended</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well, as I said, I have not yet _intended_ anything ;-)</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Christoph</p>",
