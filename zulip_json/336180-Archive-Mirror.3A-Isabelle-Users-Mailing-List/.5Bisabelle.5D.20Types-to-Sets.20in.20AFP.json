Namely, although importing “HOL-Types_To_Sets.Types_To_Sets” in my theory and processing it with Isabelle/jEdit works fine, I’m having trouble to properly set up the ROOT file of the session:</p>\n<p>chapter AFP<br>\nsession Nullstellensatz (AFP) = Groebner_Bases + “HOL-Types_To_Sets” + ...</p>\n<p>makes Isabelle complain about the “Types_To_Sets” part.</p>\n<p>So, my question is: Can/should one use “types-to-sets” in AFP entries, and if yes, how?</p>\n<p>If the answer is “no” it’s not a big problem, because I only need “types-to-sets” for proving the field-theoretic version of the Nullstellensatz from its (more important and better-known) geometric version. This is probably not so important and could thus be omitted.</p>\n<p>Thank you and best regards,<br>\nAlexander</p>",

In the last several weeks I dedicated a nontrivial amount of<br>\ntime towards the improvement of the functionality associated with the<br>\npackage. At the moment, I am in the process of finalising my work on the<br>\nupdate of one of my own large scale application of the Types-To-Sets (<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-Types_To_Sets_Ext\">https://github.com/xanonec/HOL-Types_To_Sets_Ext</a>) using the improved<br>\nframework and, also, writing a user manual for it. *However, none of the<br>\nwork that I am referring to is publicly available at the moment.*</p>\n<p>To this end, I provided several Isar commands that make the framework much<br>\nmore convenient to use and, also, drastically reduce the amount of<br>\nboilerplate code that was previously needed.</p>\n<p>In particular, it is now possible to write</p>\n<p>locale preorder_ow =<br>\n  ord_ow 𝔘 le ls<br>\n  for 𝔘 :: \"'ao set\" and le (infix \"≤⇩o⇩w\" 50) and ls (infix \"&lt;⇩o⇩w\" 50) +<br>\n  assumes less_le_not_le:<br>\n    \"⟦ x ∈ 𝔘; y ∈ 𝔘 ⟧ ⟹ x &lt;⇩o⇩w y ⟷ x ≤⇩o⇩w y ∧ ¬ (y ≤⇩o⇩w x)\"<br>\n    and order_refl[iff]: \"x ∈ 𝔘 ⟹ x ≤⇩o⇩w x\"<br>\n    and order_trans: \"⟦ x ∈ 𝔘; y ∈ 𝔘; z ∈ 𝔘; x ≤⇩o⇩w y; y ≤⇩o⇩w z ⟧ ⟹ x<br>\n≤⇩o⇩w z\"</p>\n<p>(* The relativized definitions and transfer rules still need to be provided<br>\nmanually. However, the framework does not utilise the locale local_typedef<br>\nand other tools associated with it. Once the transfer rules are proven, it<br>\nis sufficient to write: *)</p>\n<p>context preorder_ow<br>\nbegin</p>\n<p>tts_relativize<br>\n  types: (?'a 𝔘) (*target type for the relativization and the associated<br>\ncarrier set*)<br>\n  substituting preorder_ow_axioms<br>\n  applying [unfolded implicit_ord, var_simplified ne_simp, simplified]<br>\n(*this part is optional - it merely applies a list of attributes after the<br>\nrelativization is complete*)<br>\n  in<br>\n  ne_transp_less = transp_less and<br>\n  ne_transp_le = transp_le and (<em>...</em>)<br>\n(* other theorems...<br>\nthe names of the relativized facts can be generated automatically and<br>\nsupport for partial relativization is also provided *)</p>\n<p>The command also saves the outcome of the relativization in a database and<br>\nthe framework provides various diagnostic commands. For example, it is now<br>\npossible to see a list of theorems that have not been relativised yet for a<br>\ngiven type constructor or a given axiomatic type class by writing something<br>\nsimilar to</p>\n<p>tts_statistics sort Orderings.preorder</p>\n<p>It is very likely that I will finish the work that I was planning before<br>\nthe end of the next week and make the tool publicly available through my<br>\nrepository. However, if anyone is interested in trying out the current<br>\nversion, I can send it privately within a day or so.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
