Hofmann and M. Felleisen (eds), POPL'07. <br>\n  12 pages, 2007, to appear. </p>\n<p>Abstract:<br>\nWe present a formal model of memory that both captures the low-level <br>\nfeatures of C's pointers and memory, and that forms the basis for an <br>\nexpressive implementation of separation logic. At the low level, we do not <br>\ncommit common oversimplifications, but correctly deal with C's model of <br>\nprogramming language values and the heap. At the level of separation logic, <br>\nwe are still able to reason abstractly and efficiently. We implement this <br>\nframework in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL and demonstrate it on two case <br>\nstudies. We show that the divide between detailed and abstract does not <br>\nimpose undue verification overhead, and that simple programs remain easy to <br>\nverify. We also show that the framework is applicable to real, security- <br>\nand safety-critical code by formally verifying the memory allocator of the <br>\nL4 microkernel.</p>\n<p>URL:<br>\n<a href=\"http://ertos.nicta.com.au/research/l4.verified/kmalloc.pml\">http://ertos.nicta.com.au/research/l4.verified/kmalloc.pml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
