However, when typesetting inference rules (using mathpartir) with very long premises I have the problem that these exceed the line. This  is also mentioned as a limitation in the Latex sugar document. I am wondering if anyone knows a good workaround for this problem. Inserting latex linebreaks by using text{<em>...</em>} does not seem to work and editing the generated Latex documents is also not a very pleasant task.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,<br>\nBjörn</p>",

If you do not <br>\nlike the centering and the margins mathpatir inserts by default, <br>\nyou can try to play with switches like</p>\n<p>\\mprset{flushleft}</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nChristian</p>",
