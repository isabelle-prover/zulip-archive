Is this a typo or am I missing something else? For example:</p>\n<p>\"The name ac_simps refers to the list of all three theorems; similarly<br>\nthere is ac_simps.\"</p>\n<p>\"Simplify using ac_simps and ac_simps.\"</p>\n<p>\"apply (simp add: ac_simps ac_simps)\"</p>\n<p>It looks like some kind of search/replace went wrong perhaps?</p>\n<p>-Andrew</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/tutorial.pdf\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/tutorial.pdf</a></p>",

In the past we had plus_ac and <br>\ntimes_ac, now we have ac_simps (although the others still exist). The tutorial, <br>\nalthough technically still correct, is not state of the art any longer. Hence we <br>\ndon't invest much energy when updating it. But thanks for pointing this out, it <br>\nwould be better to fix it.</p>\n<p>Tobias<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/8gDPsrcITtcvQBFqAXfiQVI9/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
