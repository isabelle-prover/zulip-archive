We welcome  participation  and contributions from  the<br>\ntheorem proving, formal methods  and tools, and HCI  communities, both<br>\nto  report on experience   with existing systems,  and  to discuss new<br>\ndirections.</p>\n<p>UITP 2006 is a one-day workshop to be held on Monday, August 21st 2006<br>\nin Seattle, USA, as a FLoC'06 workshop.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>David Aspinall        (University of Edinburgh, UK)<br>\nYves Bertot           (INRIA Sophia Antiplois, France)<br>\nPaul Cairns           (University College London, UK)<br>\nEwen Denney           (NASA Ames Research Center, USA)<br>\nChristoph Lüth        (University of Bremen, Germany)<br>\nMichael Norrish       (NICTA, Australia)<br>\nFlorina Piroi         (RISC Linz, Austria)<br>\nAarne Ranta           (Chalmers University, Sweden)<br>\nMakarius M.
