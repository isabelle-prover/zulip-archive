We welcome  participation  and contributions from  the<br>\ntheorem proving, formal methods  and tools, and HCI  communities, both<br>\nto  report on experience   with existing systems,  and  to discuss new<br>\ndirections.</p>\n<p>UITP 2006 is a one-day workshop to be held on Monday, August 21st 2006<br>\nin Seattle, USA, as a FLoC'06 workshop.</p>\n<p>Submissions</p>\n<p>We  encourage submission  of  short abstracts  or  papers (from  4--20<br>\npages).  Submissions will  be reviewed by the  program  committee.  We<br>\nwill invite  authors of accepted  submissions to talk  at the workshop<br>\n(slots of 20--30 minutes are expected).   Submissions presented at the<br>\nworkshop will be included in informal proceedings to be distributed at<br>\nthe workshop and made available electronically afterward.</p>\n<p>Suggested topics include, but are not restricted to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Novel and traditional interfaces for interactive proof systems<br>\n   including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>command line based user interfaces</li>\n<li>graphical user interfaces</li>\n<li>natural language based user interfaces</li>\n<li>Bridging the gap between human-oriented and machine-oriented<br>\n proofs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Design principles for interfaces</p>\n</li>\n<li>Representation languages for proofs and mathematical objects</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tools for exploration, visualization and explanation of<br>\n   mathematical objects and proofs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User-evaluation of interfaces</p>\n</li>\n<li>Integration of proof systems into e-learning environments</li>\n<li>Web-based services for proof systems</li>\n<li>Implementation experiences</li>\n<li>System descriptions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Authors   are encouraged to bring     along versions of their  systems<br>\nsuitable for informal  demonstration during breaks  in the  program of<br>\ntalks.</p>\n<p>The workshop  proceedings will  be  distributed at  the workshop as  a<br>\ncollection of the accepted papers.  Final  versions of accepted papers<br>\nhave    to be prepared   with LaTeX.   Following  up  the workshop the<br>\n(revised)  accepted  papers will be  published in  a   volume of ENTCS<br>\ndevoted to the workshop.</p>\n<p>Dates</p>\n<p>Deadline for submissions:  May 15th 2006<br>\nNotification:              June 20th 2006<br>\nFinal versions due:        July 10th 2006<br>\nWorkshop:                  August 21st 2006</p>\n<p>Submission is via EasyChair (thanks to Andrei Voronkov)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/UITP-06/\">http://www.easychair.org/UITP-06/</a></p>\n<p>More information can be found on the UITP web page at</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~omega/workshops/UITP06/\">http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~omega/workshops/UITP06/</a></p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>David Aspinall        (University of Edinburgh, UK)<br>\nYves Bertot           (INRIA Sophia Antiplois, France)<br>\nPaul Cairns           (University College London, UK)<br>\nEwen Denney           (NASA Ames Research Center, USA)<br>\nChristoph Lüth        (University of Bremen, Germany)<br>\nMichael Norrish       (NICTA, Australia)<br>\nFlorina Piroi         (RISC Linz, Austria)<br>\nAarne Ranta           (Chalmers University, Sweden)<br>\nMakarius M.
