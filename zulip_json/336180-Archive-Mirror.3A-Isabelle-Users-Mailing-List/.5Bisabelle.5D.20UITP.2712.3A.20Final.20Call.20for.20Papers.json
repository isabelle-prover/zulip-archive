In<br>\nmany cases, interfaces remain relatively basic and<br>\nunder-designed. More and more, this is becoming an obstacle for<br>\nthe wider adoption of theorem proving technologies outside the<br>\nacademic community.</p>\n<p>The User Interfaces for Theorem Provers workshop series provides<br>\na forum for researchers interested in improving human interaction<br>\nwith interactive proof systems, be it theorem provers, formal<br>\nmethod tools, and other tools manipulating and presenting<br>\nmathematical formulas.<br>\nFor the forthcoming 10th UITP workshop, we invite contributions<br>\nfrom the theorem proving, formal methods and tools, and HCI<br>\ncommunities, both to report on experience with existing systems,<br>\nand to discuss new directions. Topics covered include, but are<br>\nnot limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Application-specific interaction mechanisms or designs for<br>\n   prover interfaces;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experiments and evaluation of prover interfaces;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Languages and tools for authoring, exchanging and presenting<br>\n   proof;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implementation techniques (e.g. web services, custom<br>\n   middleware, DSLs);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integration of interfaces and tools to explore and construct<br>\n   proof;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Representation and manipulation of mathematical knowledge or<br>\n   objects;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Visualisation of mathematical objects and proof;</p>\n</li>\n<li>System descriptions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submitted papers should describe previously unpublished work<br>\n(completed or in progress), and not be longer than twelve<br>\npages. We encourage concise but relevant papers. Submissions<br>\nshould be in PDF format, and typeset with the EasyChair LaTeX<br>\ndocument class (which can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org\">www.easychair.org</a>),<br>\nor in similar style.</p>\n<p>Submission are via EasyChair. All papers will be peer reviewed by<br>\nmembers of the programme committee and selected by the organizers in<br>\naccordance with the referee reports.</p>\n<p>Proceedings</p>\n<p>Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings, which will be<br>\navailable in printed form at the workshop. After the workshop, revised<br>\npapers can be submitted to a postproceedings, which will appear in EPTCS.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>Submission deadline:      01.05.2012<br>\n Acceptance notification:  01.06.2012<br>\n Camera-ready copy:        15.06.2012</p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>David Aspinall, University of Edinburgh, UK<br>\n Serge Autexier, DFKI, Germany<br>\n Christoph Benzmueller, Articulate Software, USA<br>\n Herman Geuvers, Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands<br>\n Cezary Kaliszyk, University of Innsbruck, Austria, (PC co-chair)<br>\n Christoph Lüth, DFKI, Germany (PC co-chair)<br>\n Adam Naumowicz, University of Białystok, Poland<br>\n Claudio Sacerdoti Coen, University of Bologna, Italy<br>\n Geoff Sutcliffe, University of Miami, United States<br>\n Enrico Tassi, INRIA, France<br>\n Josef Urban, Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands<br>\n Makarius Wenzel, Université Paris-Sud 11, France</p>",
