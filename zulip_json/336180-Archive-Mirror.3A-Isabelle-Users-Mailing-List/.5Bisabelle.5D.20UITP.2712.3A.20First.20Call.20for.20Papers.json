In<br>\nmany cases, interfaces remain relatively basic and<br>\nunder-designed. More and more, this is becoming an obstacle for<br>\nthe wider adoption of theorem proving technologies outside the<br>\nacademic community.</p>\n<p>The User Interfaces for Theorem Provers workshop series provides<br>\na forum for researchers interested in improving human interaction<br>\nwith interactive proof systems, be it theorem provers, formal<br>\nmethod tools, and other tools manipulating and presenting<br>\nmathematical formulas.</p>\n<p>For the forthcoming 10th UITP workshop, we invite contributions<br>\nfrom the theorem proving, formal methods and tools, and HCI<br>\ncommunities, both to report on experience with existing systems,<br>\nand to discuss new directions. Topics covered include, but are<br>\nnot limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Application-specific interaction mechanisms or designs for<br>\n   prover interfaces;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experiments and evaluation of prover interfaces;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Languages and tools for authoring, exchanging and presenting<br>\n   proof;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implementation techniques (e.g. web services, custom<br>\n   middleware, DSLs);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integration of interfaces and tools to explore and construct<br>\n   proof;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Representation and manipulation of mathematical knowledge or<br>\n   objects;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Visualisation of mathematical objects and proof;</p>\n</li>\n<li>System descriptions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submitted papers should describe previously unpublished work<br>\n(completed or in progress), and not be longer than twelve<br>\npages. We encourage concise but relevant papers. Submissions<br>\nshould be in PDF format, and typeset with the EasyChair LaTeX<br>\ndocument class (which can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.easychair.org\">www.easychair.org</a>),<br>\nor in similar style.</p>\n<p>Submission will be via EasyChair. All papers will be peer reviewed by<br>\nmembers of the programme committee and selected by the organizers in<br>\naccordance with the referee reports.</p>\n<p>Proceedings</p>\n<p>Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings, which will be<br>\navailable in printed form at the workshop. After the workshop, revised<br>\npapers can be submitted to a postproceedings, which will appear in an<br>\narchivable electronic format, preferably published open access.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>Submission deadline:      01.05.2012<br>\n Acceptance notification:  01.06.2012<br>\n Camera-ready copy:        15.06.2012</p>\n<p>PC Chairs</p>\n<p>Christoph LÃ¼th   (DFKI, Germany)<br>\nCezary Kaliszyk  (University of Innsbruck, Austria)</p>\n<p>The full program committee will be announced soon.</p>\n<p>More information about the workshop series can be found at the UITP<br>\nInterest Group web page <a href=\"http://www.uitp-ig.org\">www.uitp-ig.org</a>.</p>",
