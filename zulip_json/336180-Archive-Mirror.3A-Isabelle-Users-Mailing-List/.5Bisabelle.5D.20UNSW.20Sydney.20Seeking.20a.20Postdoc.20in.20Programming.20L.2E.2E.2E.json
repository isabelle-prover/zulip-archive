We<br>\nare the creators of seL4, the world's first fully formally verified operating system<br>\nkernel with extreme performance and strong security &amp; correctness proofs. Our highly<br>\ninternational team is located on the UNSW campus, close to the beautiful beaches of<br>\nsunny Sydney, Australia, one of the world's most liveable cities.</p>\n<p>We are offering a two-year postdoctoral researcher position that would allow you to join<br>\nus in Sydney, move things forward, and have a global impact.</p>\n<p>Cogent is a language we designed that co-generates code and proofs in order to ease<br>\nthe verification of systems components around seL4. Potential topics include designing<br>\nand implementing new domain-specific programming languages extending Cogent, writing<br>\nformal specifications and proofs in Isabelle/HOL, developing formally verified<br>\ninfrastructure for building secure systems on top of seL4, contributing to improved<br>\nproof automation and reasoning techniques, and applying formal proof to real-world<br>\nsystems and tools.</p>\n<p>To apply you should have (or be about to obtain) a PhD degree in Computer Science,<br>\nMathematics, or similar.</p>\n<p>You should also possess a significant subset of the following skills:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>functional programming in a language like Haskell, ML, or OCaml</li>\n<li>first-order or higher-order formal logic</li>\n<li>basic experience in C</li>\n<li>ability and desire to quickly learn new techniques</li>\n<li>ability and desire to work in a larger team</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you additionally have experience</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>in software verification with an interactive theorem prover such as<br>\n  Isabelle/HOL, HOL4, Coq, or Agda, and/or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>with programming languages and verified or certifying compilers</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>you should definitely apply!</p>\n<p>You will work with a unique world-leading combination of OS and formal methods<br>\nexperts, students at undergraduate and PhD level, engineers, and researchers from<br>\n5 continents, speaking over 15 languages.</p>\n<p>Trustworthy Systems is a fun, creative, and welcoming workplace with flexible<br>\nhours &amp; work arrangements.</p>\n<p>We value diversity in all forms and welcome applications from people of all ages,<br>\nincluding people with disabilities, and those who identify as LGBTIQ.
