The theories define, in various different ways, many common notions, such as abstraction, refinement, choice, termination, feasibility, locality, concurrency and communication.  Despite these differences, such theories may be unified in a way which greatly facilitates their study and comparison.  Moreover, such a unification offers a means of combining different languages describing various facets and artifacts of software development in a seamless, logically consistent way.</p>\n<p>Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) is widely acknowledged as one of the most significant such unification approaches. Based on their pioneering work, the aims of the UTP Symposium series are to reaffirm the significance of the ongoing UTP project and to stimulate efforts to advance. The Symposium provides a focus for the sharing of results by those already actively contributing, and raises awareness of the benefits of such unifying theoretical frameworks among the wider computer science and software engineering communities.</p>\n<p>To this end the Symposium welcomes contributions on all the themes that can be related to the Unifying Theories of Programming.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>Papers may be up to 20 pages in length and should be prepared using LaTeX in Springer LNCS paper format.  Submissions should be made through the UTP 2014 EasyChair site; instructions are at <a href=\"http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~pat/UTP2014\">http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~pat/UTP2014</a></p>\n<p>PUBLICATION</p>\n<p>Symposium post-proceedings will appear in Springer's Lectures Notes in Computer Science, as in past editions of the Symposium.
