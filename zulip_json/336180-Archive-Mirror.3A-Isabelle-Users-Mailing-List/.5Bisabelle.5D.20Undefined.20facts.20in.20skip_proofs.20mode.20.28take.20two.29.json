It is just an adhoc way to omit certain important <br>\nthings. It does change the meaning of theory content and proof documents. <br>\nIt is a way to produce surprises.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'd like to have Jenkins produce proof documents.

If you want proof documents <br>\nfor a particular version, you need to produce them with its regular build <br>\nprocess.  This takes a bit more time due to extra latex runs, but should <br>\nnot be a big deal.</p>\n<p>In the next big renovation of Isabelle document preparation, the relevant <br>\ninformation for documents might be stored persistently in the log file and <br>\nused for separate generation of HTML browser_info or LaTeX documents in an <br>\nauthentic manner.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
