All facts in this case are then available under <br>\nthe name XXX, and the induction hypothesis under the name XXX.IH.</p>\n<p>However, if my lemma contains == instead of = in the assumptions, then <br>\nthe induction method still works, and the name XXX still contains all <br>\nfacts, but XXX.IH is not defined.</p>\n<p>This is illustrated by the attached theory (works with Isabelle2019 and <br>\nIsabelle2020-RC1).</p>\n<p>Is this expected behavior? If so, what is the rationale?</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/cSB7mXvDCTSeoPX4X1LuNrLi/Scratch.thy\">Scratch.thy</a></p>",
