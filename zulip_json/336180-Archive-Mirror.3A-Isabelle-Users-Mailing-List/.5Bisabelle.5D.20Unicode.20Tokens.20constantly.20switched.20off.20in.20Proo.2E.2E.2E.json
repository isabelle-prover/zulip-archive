I can enable<br>\nit and it will work, but even when I save the settings, it will be<br>\ndisabled again upon the next start of Proof General. In fact, merely<br>\nopening another file switches it off - but only for the buffer<br>\ncontaining that file, if I switch back to the other buffer, it's<br>\nswitched on again.</p>\n<p>This problem occurs only on my laptop, which runs a 32 bit Ubuntu 12.04<br>\nwith emacs version 24.1.50.1 and the latest Isabelle 2012 from the<br>\nwebsite. I have tried deleting all emacs configuration files I could<br>\nfind and completely reinstalling Isabelle but the problem remained.</p>\n<p>Another, possibly related, problem is that proof hiding does not work.<br>\nWhenever a proof is processed completely, all the Unicode tokens<br>\ndisappear in the processed portion of the input, i.e. I see<br>\n\\&lt;Longrightarrow&gt; instead of ‚üπ.</p>\n<p>I realise that this is a minor issue and the development of Proof<br>\nGeneral is in a bit of a limbo at the moment, but this is starting to<br>\nrather annoy me and I thought it might be a good idea to ask on the<br>\nmailing list in order to find out of somebody else is experiencing the<br>\nsame problems and knows a fix.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nManuel</p>",
