I already set the completion dialogue delay to 0 and that helps<br>\na bit, but I still have to press return every time and that's annoying.<br>\nI want jedit to replace the abbreviations with the corresponding Unicode<br>\ntokens immediately when I type them, like Proof General does, since this<br>\nenables me to type much faster.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to do this, and if not, is it possible to add an option<br>\nfor this in future releases of jedit?</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nManuel</p>",
