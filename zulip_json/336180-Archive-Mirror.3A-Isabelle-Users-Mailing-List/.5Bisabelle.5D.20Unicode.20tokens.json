I've done a bit more testing <br>\nwith Proof General 3.7.1 and 3.7.1.1 and Emacs 22 and 23.  <br>\nAlthough my testing hasn't been exhaustive, here are my <br>\nconclusions:</p>\n<p>If X-Symbol has been active, but is then turned off, then when <br>\nUnicode tokens are turned on, any instances of \\&lt;^sub&gt; will <br>\ndisappear (causing Isabelle to refuse to process the buffer), but <br>\nonly when you scroll up or down to where they are in the buffer <br>\n--- if none are visible when you turn Unicode tokens on, then you <br>\ncan still successfully process the whole buffer.  As long as X-<br>\nSymbol is never turned on this problem doesn't occur.</p>\n<p>With Unicode tokens turned on, I can enter and process \\&lt;^sub&gt; <br>\ncorrectly, but the next character doesn't actually appear as a <br>\nsubscript.  To get, for example, a * with a subscript R, I can <br>\ncopy and paste it from the output buffer, or I can type *\\&lt;^sub&gt;R <br>\nand then turn Unicode tokens off and back on again.  This is <br>\nannoying, but I can live with it for now.</p>\n<p>When Unicode tokens are turned on, everything in the Format menu <br>\nis greyed out.</p>\n<p>Tim<br>\n&lt;&gt;&lt;<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/5MX6JpMrEGfqvrvEFn6k_DQk/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
