The same behaviour occurs with the latest development version. Switching off “auto quickcheck” and “auto solve direct” didn’t help (and indeed I think they are only relevant at top level anyway).</p>\n<p>I think it may lie deep in the Isar level and is connected with matching the statement that you want to show with the conjecture you stated earlier. Replacing “show” by “have” eliminates the problem, but that is no solution: obviously you need to show your result. It also works if you first declare as follows:</p>\n<p>declare [[unify_search_bound = 5]]</p>\n<p>Let’s hope somebody else has a more precise diagnosis and solution.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
