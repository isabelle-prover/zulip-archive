For some reason I never got the notice that there was <br>\na new version, Isabelle 2014. However, I now have installation <br>\ninstructions for Isabelle 2014 on all three major platforms. Here is <br>\nmy question: On the major platforms, how do I uninstall Isabelle <br>\n2013? I say this because I don't want to install Isabelle 2014, only <br>\nto find out that at least one of the platforms is confused because it <br>\nhas two copies of some piece of Isabelle, one for 2013 and one for <br>\n2014, and it chooses the wrong one, and I end up with a hybrid <br>\nmishmash of 2013 and 2014 that doesn't work at all. Or am I worrying <br>\nabout nothing? -WDMaurer</p>",
