That's <br>\na scary thought; proving what you didn't prove.</p>\n<p>There are some related user-list emails about this, on doing an official <br>\nrun of a sessions to catch that sort of thing. I got the verbose flag <br>\nfrom this one by L.Hupel:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-October/msg00106.html\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2015-October/msg00106.html</a></p>\n<p>It also talks about a part of the problem I've experienced. A metis <br>\nproof is good, and applied with a 'by' command, but then I make changes, <br>\nand then some metis proof doesn't kick out. It just churns away forever, <br>\nbut I don't know about it. The 'by' statement still results in the <br>\ntheorem being used after that.</p>\n<p>For some reason either errors aren't showing up in the sidebar, or <br>\n\"purple proof action\" isn't showing up there. It could be because I <br>\nchanged \"Editor Reparse Limit\" from 10000 to 100000. Regardless, I need <br>\nthat so that errors clear on big commented out sections in the THY.</p>\n<p>I've gone official now, by finally starting to run the sessions with <br>\n'isabelle build', which is nothing extraordinary. What's special is that <br>\nI both edit the 'ROOT' file, and run 'isabelle build -v -D .', in the THY.</p>\n<p>That can be done with my custom 'I.bash' and 'I.prog' commands, which <br>\nare not to be talked about here, only admired.</p>\n<p>The first attached screen shot shows my experiments with <br>\n'quick_and_dirty' mode, running the session with the option friendly <br>\n'I.bash', which runs a script without writing it to a file. There are <br>\nothers, or were, like I.perl, I.pypy, and I.polyml. I still need to set <br>\nup I.nodejs.</p>\n<p>When I tried again, things went bad with running 'isabelle' in the PIDE. <br>\nThings were spawning other things too much.</p>\n<p>The 2nd screenshot shows my switch to the very useful 'I.prog', where <br>\nI'm just using it to write a file, and run bash. It can be used with any <br>\ncompiled language or scripting language, for which bash files and makes <br>\nfiles have been set up, or with any build tool, like Ruby rake.</p>\n<p>Again, not something to be talked about, only speculatively admired. Is <br>\nit wannabe-ware? Or is the real thing? Options. It has 'em. Help? Use <br>\nthe 'h' switch, in your mind.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nGB<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/T-DGNx__PLgNDohXj4yMAzKW/151027_IDE_bash_isa_build.png\">151027_IDE_bash_isa_build.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/_kbGfJhzDAIbGQJ7lTNi4w24/151027_IDE_build_ext_cons.png\">151027_IDE_build_ext_cons.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/T-DGNx__PLgNDohXj4yMAzKW/151027_IDE_bash_isa_build.png\" title=\"151027_IDE_bash_isa_build.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/T-DGNx__PLgNDohXj4yMAzKW/151027_IDE_bash_isa_build.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/_kbGfJhzDAIbGQJ7lTNi4w24/151027_IDE_build_ext_cons.png\" title=\"151027_IDE_build_ext_cons.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/_kbGfJhzDAIbGQJ7lTNi4w24/151027_IDE_build_ext_cons.png\"></a></div>",
