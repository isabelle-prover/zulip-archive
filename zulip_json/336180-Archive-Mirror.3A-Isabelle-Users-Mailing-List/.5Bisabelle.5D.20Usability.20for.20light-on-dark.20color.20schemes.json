There is also a patch in<br>\nsrc/Tools/jEdit/patches that sets the default style (style zero, i.e. no<br>\nstyle) in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>A small number of us use light-on-dark color schemes. I even have a<br>\njEdit macro that will set the majority of such a color scheme for you<br>\n(ping me if you'd like a copy). To set sane defaults in jEdit and then<br>\nhave the Isabelle plugin ignore them is a bit inconvenient. For example,<br>\na HOL implication is Markup.DELIMITER, which is hardcoded to black. If<br>\nyou have a dark background, black on dark is bad.</p>\n<p>You can apply the attached patch to an Isabelle 2015 setup, no<br>\nmodifications to jEdit required. It will use jEdit's text area default<br>\nforeground text color instead of Color.BLACK. It will also override<br>\nextended style 0 to be the default text foreground color with user's<br>\ndefault font.</p>\n<p>For submission into Isabelle proper, the changes to rendering.scala are<br>\nfine, but the style(0) override shouldn't make it in to the official<br>\nrepo. That should be adjusted in<br>\nsrc/Tools/jEdit/patches/extended_styles instead.</p>\n<p>It's a pretty trivial modification, but makes lives of cave-dwellers<br>\nmuch happier.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Rafal Kolanski<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/rVlv9eRn2MS9VYGlMcPbGlH8/light_on_dark_usability_2015.patch\">light_on_dark_usability_2015.patch</a></p>",
