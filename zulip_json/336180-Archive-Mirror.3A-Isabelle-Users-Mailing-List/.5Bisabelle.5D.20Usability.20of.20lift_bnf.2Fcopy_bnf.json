They are on my list of things to improve. Eventually, I’ll report here when this happens.</p>\n<p>Thanks for sharing,<br>\nDmitriy</p>",

For example:</p>\n<p>map_fmap ≡ λf. Abs_fmap ∘ op ∘ (map_option f) ∘ fmlookup</p>\n<p>This is as expected. However, I noticed some problems when working with<br>\nthese constants wrt to other Isabelle tools and the BNF package itself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The defining equations are not exported. I had to obtain them via</p>\n<p>BNF_Def.bnf_of @{context} @{type_name fmap}<br>\n  |&gt; the<br>\n  |&gt; BNF_Def.map_def_of_bnf</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I can't give them a custom name. If I want to rename 'map_fmap' to<br>\n'fmmap', I need to explicitly add an abbreviation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lifting is not set up for these constants which makes proving lemmas<br>\nover e.g. 'map_fmap' and the lifted version of 'op ++' very tedious.<br>\nHere's an example:</p>\n<p>private lift_definition<br>\n  fmmap0 :: \"('b ⇒ 'c) ⇒ ('a, 'b) fmap ⇒ ('a, 'c) fmap\"<br>\n  is \"λf m. map_option f ∘ m\"<br>\nby simp</p>\n<p>lemma fmmap0: \"fmmap = fmmap0\"<br>\nunfolding fmmap0_def (* prove via defining equation of 'fmmap' *)</p>\n<p>lemma fmmap_add[simp]: \"fmmap f (m ++⇩f n) = fmmap f m ++⇩f fmmap f n\"<br>\nunfolding fmmap0<br>\nby transfer' (auto simp: map_add_def fun_eq_iff split: option.splits)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I introduced an auxiliary constant which is equivalent to 'map_fmap',<br>\nbut defined using 'lift_definition' instead of manually. I can use that<br>\nequivalence to rewrite propositions to make them amenable for 'transfer'.</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nLars</p>\n<p>¹ Yes, I'm aware of FinFun, Fin_Map and Mapping, but neither of these<br>\nfit my purpose.</p>",

If you look at \"isabelle doc datatypes\", you will find a syntactic item called map-rel in the syntax of \"lift_bnf\" and \"copy_bnf\". You can use that to specify custom names to the map function and the relator, e.g.</p>\n<p>lift_bnf ('a, 'b) fmap [wits: Map.empty] for map: fmmap<br>\n       by auto</p>\n<p>I hope this helps.</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
