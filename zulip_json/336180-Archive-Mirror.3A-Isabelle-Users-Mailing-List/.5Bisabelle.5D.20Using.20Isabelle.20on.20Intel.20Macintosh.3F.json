Homeier\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:palantir@earthlink.net\">palantir@earthlink.net</a>&gt;<br>\nI am planning on buying a new Macintosh soon with an 64-bit architecture Intel Core<br>\n2 Duo microprocessor (Merom).  I believe that Isabelle/HOL will run on this machine,<br>\nwith the PowerPC instruction set interpreted by Apple's \"Rosetta\" <br>\nsoftware.  However, since this is slower than running native code, I would greatly<br>\nprefer to use a port of Isabelle to the native instruction set.  This of course <br>\ndepends on a port of PolyML.  There is already an Intel version of PolyML for Linux,<br>\nFreeBSD, etc. listed at <a href=\"http://www.polyml.org/download.html\">http://www.polyml.org/download.html</a>, but this does not appear<br>\nto exactly fit what we need.</p>\n<p>I see from the above web page that a general user cannot easily port PolyML to a<br>\nnew architecture, since the database needs to be specially constructed.  This is<br>\nbeyond my skill at present.  Is anyone else working on this?</p>\n<p>Apple has completed their transition away from PowerPC to Intel, already has substantial<br>\nsupport for creating 64-bit software at the command line, and plans to ship their<br>\nnext version of OS X (Leopard) next spring with full support for 64-bit.  To simplify<br>\nmatters, one can compile a program on the Macintosh to produce a \"Universal\"<br>\nbinary, which contains versions for both PowerPC and for Intel.  I'd like to<br>\nask that someone create a Universal binary version of PolyML.</p>\n<p>It would be very helpful, and would be used by many people.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>Peter</p>",

One area of possible application is a port of my higher order quotients project from HOL4 to Isabelle/HOL.  I believe this would be a good learning experience for me, and possibly useful to others.  When speaking with Christian Urban during FLoC about his nominal datatypes package, he shared that having higher order quotients available might have made his project easier.</p>\n<p>Peter</p>",
