Here's a small example:</p>\n<p>theory EvenDouble<br>\nimports Main<br>\nbegin</p>\n<p>fun evenb :: \"nat ⇒ bool\" where<br>\n\"evenb 0 = True\" |<br>\n\"evenb (Suc 0) = False\" |<br>\n\"evenb (Suc (Suc n)) = evenb n\"</p>\n<p>primrec double :: \"nat ⇒ nat ⇒ nat\" where<br>\n\"double 0 y = y\" |<br>\n\"double (Suc x) y = double x (Suc (Suc y))\"</p>\n<p>lemma dd: \"double (Suc x) y = Suc (Suc (double x y))\" <br>\nby (induct x arbitrary: y) simp_all</p>\n<p>theorem even_double: \"evenb (double x 0)\"<br>\nproof (induct x)<br>\n  case (Suc x) thus ?case by (simp only: dd) simp<br>\nqed simp</p>\n<p>end</p>\n<p>I do not like the proof of even_double because the whole point is to show <br>\nthe main critical step, and I feel like that is lost by just chaining a <br>\ncouple of methods together.  However, being a total noob, I cannot see <br>\nhow to insert that intermediate simplification explicitly before showing <br>\nthe ?case. In particular, everything that I put between \"thus ?case\" and <br>\nthe \"case\" causes the induction hypothesis to be removed from my current <br>\nfacts, and I do not want to remove facts; I just want to show that single <br>\nsimplification and then use the facts later.  How do I do this in Isar?</p>",
