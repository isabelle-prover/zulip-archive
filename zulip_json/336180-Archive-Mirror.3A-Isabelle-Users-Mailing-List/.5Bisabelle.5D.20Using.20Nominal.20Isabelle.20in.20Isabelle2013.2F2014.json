I ugess it is my<br>\nown variant of the _FCB lemmas (which I didn’t figure out how to use<br>\nsuccesfully).</p>\n<p>Greetings,<br>\nJoachim<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/Db8kG1YUiV0hGwDnTw1prQ7t/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",

Nominal_function throws up some<br>\nproof obligations, which cannot be discharged by just using <br>\npat_completeness.

Yes, <br>\nnominal_functions are harder to define, but it allows you to <br>\ndefine more functions. So if you had problems with nominal_primrec <br>\nin Nominal1, chances are you can define the function with nominal_function.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nChristian </p>\n<p>On Friday, August 1, 2014 at 10:31:44 (+0100), Dominic Mulligan wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Christian,</p>\n<p>Thanks for your speedy reply.
