The Haskell file I am trying to convert imports Data.Word, Data.Map and Data.Set, which I believe should all have Isabelle equivalents, though I am having trouble telling that to Haskabelle. I tried following the instructions in the documentation and adding an adaption for Word, under the \"types\" section,<br>\n  \"Data.Word.Word\"      \"32 word\"<br>\n but it still gives the the following error message:<br>\n&lt;interactive&gt;: user error (The module \"Data.Word\" imported from module \"Test.Model\" cannot be found at \"../Data/Word.hs\"!)</p>\n<p>Any advice on how to get these working would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nAndrew Boyton</p>",
