However, I only want to  <br>\ndo this in the final LaTeXed version of the file.  How do I go about  <br>\ntelling the isatool-LaTeX compiler to interpret</p>\n<p>{# as \\Lbag</p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p>#} as \\Rbag?</p>\n<p>I'd also like to specify</p>\n<p>{#} as \\emptyset or \\Lbag \\Rbag</p>\n<p>but I don't know if this last one would cause problems owing to an  <br>\noverlap with the first one.</p>\n<p>I've looked through the document mark-up section, but the method of  <br>\naddressing the problem there was by redefining the syntax in  <br>\nIsabelle.  I don't really want to do this, unless it is necessary.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Peter</p>",
