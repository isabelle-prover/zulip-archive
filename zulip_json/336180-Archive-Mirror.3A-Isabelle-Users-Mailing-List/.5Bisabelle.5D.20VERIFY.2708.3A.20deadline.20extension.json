What are the deduction techniques?</p>\n<p>in connection with IJCAR 2008</p>\n<p>August 10-11, 2008, Sydney, Australia</p>\n<p>[http://www.uni-koblenz.de/~beckert/verify08/]</p>\n<p>The formal verification of critical information systems has a long tradition<br>\nas one of the main areas of application for automated theorem<br>\nproving. Nevertheless, the area is of still growing importance as the number<br>\nof computers affecting everyday life and the complexity of these systems are<br>\nboth increasing. The purpose of the VERIFY workshop series is to discuss<br>\nproblems arising during the formal modeling and verification of information<br>\nsystems and to investigate suitable solutions. Possible perspectives include<br>\nthose of automated theorem proving, tool support, system engineering, and<br>\napplications.</p>\n<p>The VERIFY workshop series aims at bringing together people who are interested<br>\nin the development of safety and security critical systems, in formal methods,<br>\nin the development of automated theorem proving techniques, and in the<br>\ndevelopment of tool support. Practical experiences gained in realistic<br>\nverifications are of interest to the automated theorem proving community and<br>\nnew theorem proving techniques should be transferred into practice. The<br>\noverall objective of the VERIFY workshops is to identify open problems and to<br>\ndiscuss possible solutions under the theme</p>\n<p>What are the verification problems? What are the deduction techniques?</p>\n<p>The scope of VERIFY includes topics such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ATP techniques in verification          + Information flow control</li>\n<li>Case studies (specif. &amp; verific.)           + Refinement &amp; Decomposition</li>\n<li>Combination of verification tools           + Reliability of mobile computing</li>\n<li>Integration of ATPs and CASE-tools          + Reuse of specifications &amp; proofs</li>\n<li>Compositional &amp; modular reasoning           + Management of change</li>\n<li>Experience reports on using verification    + Safety-critical systems</li>\n<li>Gaps between problems and techniques        + Security models</li>\n<li>Formal methods for fault tolerance          + Tool support for formal methods</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions are encouraged in one of the following two categories:</p>\n<p>A.  Regular papers: Submissions in this category should describe previously<br>\n      unpublished work (completed or in progress), including descriptions of<br>\n      research, tools, and applications.  Papers must be formatted following the<br>\n      Springer LNCS guidelines and be 6-15 pages long.</p>\n<p>B.  Discussion papers: Submissions in this category are intended to initiate<br>\n      discussions and should address controversial issues, and may include<br>\n      provocative statements.  Papers must be formatted following the Springer<br>\n      LNCS guidelines and be 3-15 pages long.</p>\n<p>Submission of papers is via EasyChair at:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=verify08\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=verify08</a></p>\n<p>The workshop proceedings will be distributed at the workshop as a collection<br>\nof the accepted papers; they will also be made available as CEUR Workshop<br>\nProceedings.</p>\n<p>Program &amp; Workshop Chairs<br>\n   B.
