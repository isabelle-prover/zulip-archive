VMCAI'09 is co-located with the POPL'09 conference.</p>\n<p>The program of VMCAI'09 will consist of invited lectures, tutorials,<br>\nrefereed research papers, and tool demonstrations. Research<br>\ncontributions can report new results as well as experimental<br>\nevaluations and comparisons of existing techniques. Topics include,<br>\nbut are not limited to:</p>\n<p>program verification          program certification<br>\n    model checking                debugging techniques<br>\n    abstract interpretation       abstract domains<br>\n    static analysis               type systems<br>\n    deductive methods             optimization</p>\n<p>Submissions can address any programming paradigm, including concurrent, <br>\nconstraint, functional, imperative, logic and object-oriented programming. <br>\nPapers must describe original work, be written and presented in English, and <br>\nmust not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that <br>\nare simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed <br>\nproceedings. The proceedings will  be published by Springer in <br>\nthe Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. </p>\n<p>The page limit for submissions is 15 pages in Springer's LNCS format. <br>\nAdditional material may be placed in an appendix, to be read at the discretion <br>\nof the reviewers.
