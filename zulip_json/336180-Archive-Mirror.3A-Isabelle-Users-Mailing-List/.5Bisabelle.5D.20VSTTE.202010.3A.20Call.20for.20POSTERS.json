Through the introduction of a POSTER session <br>\nat VSTTE 2010, we are aiming to widen the body of researchers that are <br>\ninvolved in the Verified Software Initiative (VSI) and its related<br>\nChallenges (more details on VSTTE &amp; VSI are provided below). </p>\n<p>Limited financial support will be available if necessary to enable <br>\nattendance of both MSc and PhD students whose posters are accepted. <br>\nSpecifically, we aim to attract students who are already engaged in <br>\ntheories or tools or experiments relevant to verification; and give <br>\nthem an opportunity to meet other students and researchers engaged <br>\nin complementary experiments or theories or tools. Note that the<br>\nPOSTER session is open to all researchers, not just students. <br>\nWith regards to submissions, we require the following:</p>\n<p>1. 1-page abstract of your research<br>\n    2. Poster OR a poster plan <br>\n    3. For students, a supporting statement from your supervisor </p>\n<p>Submissions should be sent electronically to <a href=\"mailto:vstte10@macs.hw.ac.uk\">vstte10@macs.hw.ac.uk</a>.</p>\n<p>The timetable for POSTER authors is as follows:</p>\n<p>JUNE 18:  Submission of abstract &amp; poster (plan) deadline<br>\nJUNE 30:  Notification of decision<br>\nJULY 31:  Camera-ready abstract deadline <br>\nAUGUST 17:  Poster session</p>\n<p>Note that a collection of abstracts for the accepted posters <br>\nwill be distributed at the conference.

This conference is part of the Verified Software Initiative<br>\n(VSI), a fifteen-year, cooperative, international project directed<br>\nat the scientific challenges of large-scale software verification.<br>\nVSI also includes UKCRC's Grand Challenge 6, i.e. Dependable Systems<br>\nEvolution. VSTTE is open to anyone who is interested in participating<br>\nactively in the VSI effort.</p>\n<p>SCOPE<br>\nThe goal of this conference is to advance the state of the art in<br>\nthe science and technology of software verification through the<br>\ninteraction of theory development, tool evolution, and experimental<br>\nvalidation.  Authors are encouraged to submit work in progress,<br>\nparticularly if the work involves collaboration, theory unification,<br>\nand tool integration.

The technical programme<br>\nwill take place in the Edinburgh Conference Centre (Riccarton campus),<br>\nwhere accommodation will be available at very competitive rates for<br>\nfestival time. Social events will be arranged within the city centre,<br>\nmaking VSTTE an unique cultural and scholarly event for 2010!</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tom Ball (Microsoft Research, Redmond)</li>\n<li>Gerwin Klein (National ICT Australia)</li>\n<li>Matthew Parkinson (University of Cambridge)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WORKSHOPS<br>\nIn addition to the main conference, VSTTE will host two workshops on August 19th:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>VS-Theory focuses on theoretical foundations of software verification. <br>\nTopics range from the difficult and essential study of soundness of delicate <br>\nproof methods, to the discovery of new specification techniques and proof <br>\nmethods, to dramatic simplification or unification of existing methods, to as <br>\nyet unknown breakthroughs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>VS-Tools &amp; Experiments focuses on the development of verification tools and <br>\ntheir experimental evaluation. Possible topics include interfaces between tools, <br>\ntool integration platforms, and case studies. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The workshops will provide a forum to present new, possibly unfinished work and will <br>\nalso give the opportunity to propose research challenges, which will help form a research <br>\nagenda for the Verified Software Initiative. </p>\n<p>Papers must be written in English using Springer LNCS style. The page limit is 10 pages<br>\nfor technical papers and 5 pages for proposals of verification challenges. The proceedings will be <br>\npublished as a technical report. </p>\n<p>SUMMER SCHOOL<br>\nThere will be a two-day summer-school preceding the main conference on the 14 and<br>\n15 August. The summer school will give a broad overview of software verification <br>\ntechniques,  addressing both bottom-up and top-down approaches with a strong focus<br>\non the formal representation and reasoning themes. The school consists of eight <br>\nintroductory lectures, each concentrating on an unique aspect of one or both of the <br>\noverall themes. The topics of the lectures include inductive theorem proving; SAT and <br>\nSMT solving; proof planning and rippling; rely/guarantee conditions; separation <br>\nlogic; operating system verification; formal analysis of security.</p>\n<p>The following will present at the summer school:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Atkey (University of Strathclyde) &amp; Ewen Maclean (Heriot-Watt University) </li>\n<li>Alan Bundy &amp; Lucas Dixon (University of Edinburgh)</li>\n<li>Cliff Jones (University of Newcastle)</li>\n<li>Gerwin Klein (National ICT Australia)</li>\n<li>J Strother Moore (University of Texas at Austin)</li>\n<li>Natarajan Shankar (SRI)</li>\n<li>Graham Steel (INRIA)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The school is intended for PhD students and researchers working within one or both of <br>\nthese themes, however familiarity with any of the techniques is not a prerequisite. <br>\nAll lectures are meant to be introductory.  For more information see:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/events/ssfrr-2010/\">http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/events/ssfrr-2010/</a></p>\n<p>COMPETITION<br>\nA verification competition will be held at VSTTE 2010. The challenge is<br>\nto develop a machine-verified piece of software with respect to a given<br>\nspecification. The competition will be conducted over a 2.5 hour period<br>\non some evening of the conference. The problem will be presented with a<br>\nlogical specification and test cases over .5 hours including time for<br>\ndiscussion with 2 hours to construct a solution. Each competing team<br>\ncan feature up to three members. You can use any tool or combination of<br>\ntools as well as libraries, but you cannot modify these tools.  You can<br>\nreinterpret the specification to suit your tools and methods, but you<br>\nwill be judged on the fidelity of your interpretation. The goal is to<br>\nproduce an executable program and a replayable proof that the program<br>\nmeets the specification.  It will be possible to code the solution using<br>\nintegers and arrays. The solutions will be judged for soundness</p>\n<p>(absence of bugs) and completeness (presence of proofs). The three best<br>\nsolutions will be selected and the respective teams will be invited to<br>\nmake presentations at the tools/experiments workshop. You must<br>\nregister a copy of the  verification system with the judges prior to the<br>\ncompetition with instructions for replaying proofs and running the<br>\nprograms.</p>\n<p>CONFERENCE CHAIR<br>\nAndrew Ireland (Heriot-Watt University; <a href=\"mailto:A.Ireland@hw.ac.uk\">A.Ireland@hw.ac.uk</a>)</p>\n<p>PROGRAM CHAIRS<br>\nPeter O'Hearn (Queen Mary, University of London; <a href=\"mailto:ohearn@dcs.qmul.ac.uk\">ohearn@dcs.qmul.ac.uk</a>)<br>\nGary T.
