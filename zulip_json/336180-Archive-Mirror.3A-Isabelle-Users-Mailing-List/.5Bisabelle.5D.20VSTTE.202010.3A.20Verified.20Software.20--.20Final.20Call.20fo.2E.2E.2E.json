This conference is part of the Verified Software Initiative<br>\n(VSI), a fifteen-year, cooperative, international project directed<br>\nat the scientific challenges of large-scale software verification.<br>\nVSI also includes UKCRC's Grand Challenge 6, i.e. Dependable Systems<br>\nEvolution. VSTTE is open to anyone who is interested in participating<br>\nactively in the VSI effort.</p>\n<p>SCOPE<br>\nThe goal of this conference is to advance the state of the art in<br>\nthe science and technology of software verification through the<br>\ninteraction of theory development, tool evolution, and experimental<br>\nvalidation.  Authors are encouraged to submit work in progress,<br>\nparticularly if the work involves collaboration, theory unification,<br>\nand tool integration.

The technical programme<br>\nwill take place in the Edinburgh Conference Centre (Riccarton campus),<br>\nwhere accommodation will be available at very competitive rates for<br>\nfestival time. Social events will be arranged within the city centre,<br>\nmaking VSTTE an unique cultural and scholarly event for 2010!</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tom Ball (Microsoft Research, Redmond)</li>\n<li>Gerwin Klein (National ICT Australia)</li>\n<li>Matthew Parkinson (University of Cambridge)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>\nSubmitted research papers and system descriptions must be original and<br>\nnot submitted for publication elsewhere.  Research paper submissions are<br>\nlimited to 15 proceedings pages in LNCS format and must include a<br>\ncogent and self-contained description of the ideas, methods and results,<br>\ntogether with a comparison to existing work. System descriptions<br>\nare also limited to 15 proceedings pages in LNCS format. Submissions<br>\nof theoretical, practical, and experimental contributions<br>\nare equally encouraged, including those that focus on specific problems<br>\nor problem domains. Papers can be submitted at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=vstte10\">https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=vstte10</a>.</p>\n<p>Submissions that arrive late, are not in the proper format, or are too<br>\nlong will not be considered.  The proceedings of VSTTE 2010 will be<br>\npublished by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series. Authors of accepted<br>\npapers will be requested to sign a form transferring copyright of their<br>\ncontribution to Springer-Verlag. The use of LaTeX and the Springer<br>\nllncs class files, obtainable from <a href=\"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html\">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>,<br>\nis strongly encouraged.</p>\n<p>WORKSHOPS<br>\nIn addition to the main conference, VSTTE will host two workshops on August 19th:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>VS-Theory focuses on theoretical foundations of software verification. <br>\nTopics range from the difficult and essential study of soundness of delicate <br>\nproof methods, to the discovery of new specification techniques and proof <br>\nmethods, to dramatic simplification or unification of existing methods, to as <br>\nyet unknown breakthroughs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>VS-Tools &amp; Experiments focuses on the development of verification tools and <br>\ntheir experimental evaluation. Possible topics include interfaces between tools, <br>\ntool integration platforms, and case studies. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The workshops will provide a forum to present new, possibly unfinished work and will <br>\nalso give the opportunity to propose research challenges, which will help form a research <br>\nagenda for the Verified Software Initiative. </p>\n<p>Papers must be written in English using Springer LNCS style. The page limit is 10 pages<br>\nfor technical papers and 5 pages for proposals of verification challenges. The proceedings will be <br>\npublished as a technical report. </p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\nMarch 29 2010: Conference paper submission deadline<br>\nMay 10 2010: Decisions on papers<br>\nMay 21 2010: Workshop paper submission<br>\nJune 1 2010: Final conference paper versions due<br>\nJune 25 2010: Decisions on workshop papers<br>\nJuly 23 2010: Final workshop paper version<br>\nAugust 16-18 2010: Main conference<br>\nAugust 19 2010: Workshops</p>\n<p>RESEARCH STUDENT SUPPORT<br>\nA limited number of grants, cover registration and travel, will be available to support PhD <br>\nstudents wishing to attend VSTTE 2010. More details to follow via the website.</p>\n<p>SUMMER SCHOOL<br>\nThere will be a two-day summer-school preceding the main conference on the 14 and <br>\n15 August. The summer school will give a broad overview of software verification <br>\ntechniques,  addressing both bottom-up and top-down approaches with a strong focus <br>\non the formal representation and reasoning themes. The school consists of eight <br>\nintroductory lectures, each concentrating on an unique aspect of one or both of the <br>\noverall themes. The topics of the lectures include inductive theorem proving; SAT and <br>\nSMT solving; proof planning and rippling; rely/guarantee conditions; separation <br>\nlogic; operating system verification; and formal analysis of security.</p>\n<p>The school is intended for PhD students and researchers working within one or both of <br>\nthese themes, however familiarity with any of the techniques is not a prerequisite. <br>\nAll lectures are meant to be introductory.

The challenge is<br>\nto develop a machine-verified piece of software with respect to a given<br>\nspecification. The competition will be conducted over a 2.5 hour period<br>\non some evening of the conference. The problem will be presented with a<br>\nlogical specification and test cases over .5 hours including time for<br>\ndiscussion with 2 hours to construct a solution. Each competing team<br>\ncan feature up to three members. You can use any tool or combination of<br>\ntools as well as libraries, but you cannot modify these tools.  You can<br>\nreinterpret the specification to suit your tools and methods, but you<br>\nwill be judged on the fidelity of your interpretation. The goal is to<br>\nproduce an executable program and a replayable proof that the program<br>\nmeets the specification.  It will be possible to code the solution using<br>\nintegers and arrays. The solutions will be judged for soundness<br>\n(absence of bugs) and completeness (presence of proofs). The three best<br>\nsolutions will be selected and the respective teams will be invited to<br>\nmake presentations at the tools/experiments workshop. You must<br>\nregister a copy of the  verification system with the judges prior to the<br>\ncompetition with instructions for replaying proofs and running the<br>\nprograms.</p>\n<p>CONFERENCE CHAIR<br>\nAndrew Ireland (Heriot-Watt University; <a href=\"mailto:A.Ireland@hw.ac.uk\">A.Ireland@hw.ac.uk</a>)</p>\n<p>PROGRAM CHAIRS<br>\nPeter O'Hearn (Queen Mary, University of London; <a href=\"mailto:ohearn@dcs.qmul.ac.uk\">ohearn@dcs.qmul.ac.uk</a>)<br>\nGary T.
