The<br>\nfocus of the conference is the development of systematic methods for<br>\nspecifying, building, and verifying software.  The goal of<br>\nthis conference is to advance the state of the art through the<br>\ninteraction of theory development, tool evolution, and experimental<br>\nvalidation.  Historically,  the conference came out of the Verified<br>\nSoftware Initiative (VSI), a cooperative, international initiative<br>\ndirected at the scientific challenges of large-scale software<br>\nverification.  A verification competition will be held in parallel <br>\nto the conference. </p>\n<p>Topics of interest include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specification and verification techniques</li>\n<li>Tool support for specification languages</li>\n<li>Tool for various design methodologies</li>\n<li>Tool integration and plug-ins</li>\n<li>Automation in formal verification</li>\n<li>Tool comparisons and benchmark repositories</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combination of tools and techniques<br>\n(e.g. formal vs. semiformal, software specification<br>\nvs. engineering techniques)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customizing tools for particular applications</p>\n</li>\n<li>Challenge problems</li>\n<li>Refinement methodologies</li>\n<li>Requirements modeling</li>\n<li>Specification languages</li>\n<li>Specification/verification case-studies</li>\n<li>Software design methods</li>\n<li>Program logic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS</p>\n<p>Submitted research papers and system descriptions must be original and<br>\nnot submitted for publication elsewhere.  Research paper submissions<br>\nare limited to 15 proceedings pages in LNCS format and must include a<br>\ncogent and self-contained description of the ideas, methods and<br>\nresults, together with a comparison to existing work. System<br>\ndescriptions are also limited to 15 proceedings pages in LNCS<br>\nformat. Authors are encouraged to submit work in progress, particularly if the<br>\nwork involves collaboration, theory unification, and tool integration.<br>\nPapers can be submitted at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vstte2012\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vstte2012</a></p>\n<p>Submissions that arrive late, are not in the proper format, or are too<br>\nlong will not be considered.  The proceedings of VSTTE 2012 will be<br>\npublished by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series.  Authors of accepted<br>\npapers will be requested to sign a form transferring copyright of<br>\ntheir contribution to Springer-Verlag.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>August 31, 2011:     Conference Paper Submission Deadline<br>\nOctober 20, 2011:    Notification of acceptance<br>\nNovember 15, 2011:   Final conference paper versions due<br>\nJanuary 28-29, 2012: Main conference</p>\n<p>CONFERENCE CHAIR</p>\n<p>Ernie Cohen, European Microsoft Innovation Center </p>\n<p>PROGRAM CHAIRS</p>\n<p>Rajeev Joshi,  NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>\nPeter MÃ¼ller, ETH Zurich<br>\nAndreas Podelski, University of Freiburg</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>To be announced</p>\n<p>PUBLICITY CHAIR</p>\n<p>Gudmund Grov, University of Edinburgh</p>\n<p>STEERING COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>Tony Hoare, Microsoft Research<br>\nJay Misra, UT Austin<br>\nNatarajan Shankar, SRI International<br>\nJim Woodcock, University of York</p>",
