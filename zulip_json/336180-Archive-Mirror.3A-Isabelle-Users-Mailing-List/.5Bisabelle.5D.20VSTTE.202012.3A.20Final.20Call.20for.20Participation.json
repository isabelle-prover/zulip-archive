The<br>\nfocus of the conference is the development of systematic methods for<br>\nspecifying, building, and verifying software.  The goal of<br>\nthis conference is to advance the state of the art through the<br>\ninteraction of theory development, tool evolution, and experimental<br>\nvalidation.  Historically,  the conference came out of the Verified<br>\nSoftware Initiative (VSI), a cooperative, international initiative<br>\ndirected at the scientific challenges of large-scale software<br>\nverification.  An informal verification competition has been held <br>\nand the winner will be announced during the conference.</p>\n<p>KEYNOTE SPEAKERS</p>\n<p>Rupak Majumdar, Max Planck Institute for Software Systems<br>\nWolfgang Paul,  Saarland University</p>\n<p>TUTORIALS</p>\n<p>Francesco Logozzo, Microsoft Research<br>\nRustan Leino, Microsoft Research</p>\n<p>PROGRAM</p>\n<p>The full program is available at the conference web site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/vstte2012/program\">https://sites.google.com/site/vstte2012/program</a></p>\n<p>VENUE</p>\n<p>The conference is co-located with POPL and will be held at <br>\nthe Sheraton Society Hill Hotel in Philadelphia's historic district.<br>\nFor hotel rate details and booking please see the POPL webpage:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cse.psu.edu/popl/12/\">http://www.cse.psu.edu/popl/12/</a></p>\n<p>REGISTRATION</p>\n<p>Registration is handled by the POPL registration.
