Submissions of theoretical, practical, and<br>\n  experimental contributions are equally encouraged, including those<br>\n  that focus on specific problems or problem domains. We are especially<br>\n  interested in submissions describing large-scale verification efforts<br>\n  that involve collaboration, theory unification, tool integration, and<br>\n  formalized domain knowledge. We also welcome papers describing novel<br>\n  experiments and case studies evaluating verification techniques and<br>\n  technologies.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest for VSTTE include education, requirements modeling,<br>\n  specification languages, specification/verification/certification case<br>\n  studies, formal calculi, software design methods, automatic code generation,<br>\n  refinement methodologies, compositional analysis, verification tools<br>\n  (e.g., static analysis, dynamic analysis, model checking, theorem proving,<br>\n  satisfiability), tool integration, benchmarks, challenge problems, and<br>\n  integrated verification environments.</p>\n<p>Paper Submissions</p>\n<p>We accept both long (limited to 16 pages) and short (limited to 10 pages)<br>\n  paper submissions. Short submissions also cover Verification Pearls<br>\n  describing an elegant proof or proof technique. Submitted research papers<br>\n  and system descriptions must be original and not submitted for publication<br>\n  elsewhere. Each submission will be evaluated by at least three members of<br>\n  the Program Committee. We expect that one author of every accepted paper<br>\n  will present their work at the conference.</p>\n<p>Paper submissions must be written in English using the LNCS LaTeX format<br>\n  (<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\">http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>)<br>\n  and must include a cogent and self-contained description of the ideas,<br>\n  methods, results, and comparison to existing work.</p>\n<p>Papers will be submitted via EasyChair at the VSTTE 2017 conference page<br>\n  (<a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vstte2017\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vstte2017</a>). The post-conference<br>\n  proceedings of VSTTE 2017 will be published in the LNCS series. Authors<br>\n  of accepted papers will be requested to sign the copyright transfer form.<br>\n  A selection of best papers will be invited for publication in the Journal<br>\n  of Automated Reasoning.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>* June Andronick (University of New South Wales, Australia)<br>\n  * Christel Baier (TU Dresden, Germany)<br>\n  * Sandrine Blazy (Université de Rennes 1, France)<br>\n  * Arthur Charguéraud (Inria, France)<br>\n  * Ernie Cohen (Amazon Web Services, USA)<br>\n  * Rayna Dimitrova (MPI-SWS, Germany)<br>\n  * Carlo A.
