The Working Conference on<br>\nVerified Software: Theories, Tools and Experiments (VSTTE) is the main<br>\nforum for advancing the initiative. VSTTE brings together experts<br>\nspanning the spectrum of software verification in order to foster<br>\ninternational collaboration on the critical research challenges. The<br>\ntheoretical work includes semantic foundations and logics for<br>\nspecification and verification, and verification algorithms and<br>\nmethodologies. The tools cover specification and annotation languages,<br>\nprogram analyzers, model checkers, interactive verifiers and proof<br>\ncheckers, automated theorem provers and SAT/SMT solvers, and integrated<br>\nverification environments. The experimental work drives the research<br>\nagenda for theory and tools by taking on significant<br>\nspecification/verification exercises covering hardware, operating<br>\nsystems, compilers, computer security, parallel computing, and<br>\ncyber-physical systems.</p>\n<p>The 2020 edition of VSTTE will be the 12th working conference in the<br>\nseries, and will be co-located with CAV 2020 and ISSTA 2020 in Los<br>\nAngeles, USA.</p>\n<p>We welcome submissions describing significant advances in the production<br>\nof verified software, i.e., software that has been proved to meet its<br>\nfunctional specifications. Submissions of theoretical, practical, and<br>\nexperimental contributions are equally encouraged, including those that<br>\nfocus on specific problems or problem domains. We are especially<br>\ninterested in submissions describing large-scale verification efforts<br>\nthat involve collaboration, theory unification, tool integration, and<br>\nformalized domain knowledge. We also welcome papers describing novel<br>\nexperiments and case studies evaluating verification techniques and<br>\ntechnologies.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest for this conference include, but are not limited to,<br>\neducation, requirements modeling, specification languages,<br>\nspecification/verification/certification case studies, formal calculi,<br>\nsoftware design methods, automatic code generation, refinement<br>\nmethodologies, compositional analysis, verification tools (e.g., static<br>\nanalysis, dynamic analysis, model checking, theorem proving,<br>\nsatisfiability), tool integration, benchmarks, challenge problems, and<br>\nintegrated verification environments.</p>\n<p>Work on diverse verification technologies, e.g., static analysis,<br>\ndynamic analysis, model checking, theorem proving, satisfiability, is<br>\nparticularly encouraged.</p>\n<p>General Chair</p>\n<p>Natarajan Shankar (SRI International)</p>\n<p>Program Chairs</p>\n<p>Maria Christakis (MPI-SWS, Germany)<br>\n    Nadia Polikarpova (UCSD, USA)</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Christel Baier (TU Dresden, Germany)<br>\n    Nikolaj Bjørner (Microsoft Research, USA)<br>\n    Supratik Chakraborty (IIT Bombay, India)<br>\n    Eva Darulova (MPI-SWS, Germany)<br>\n    Ankush Desai (UC Berkeley and AWS, USA)<br>\n    Gidon Ernst (LMU Munich, Germany)<br>\n    Grigory Fedyukovich (Florida State University, USA)<br>\n    Pietro Ferrara (Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy)<br>\n    Jean-Christophe Filliâtre (CNRS, France)<br>\n    Carlo A.
