The goal of this conference is to advance <br>\nthe state of the art in the science and technology of software verification,<br>\nthrough the interaction of theory development, tool evolution, and<br>\nexperimental validation.  </p>\n<p>We welcome submissions describing significant advances in the <br>\nproduction of verified software, i.e., software that has been <br>\nproved to meet its functional specifications.  We are<br>\nespecially interested in submissions describing large-scale<br>\nverification efforts that involve collaboration, theory unification,<br>\ntool integration, and formalized domain knowledge.  We welcome papers<br>\ndescribing novel experiments and case studies evaluating verification<br>\ntechniques and technologies.  Topics of interest include education,<br>\nrequirements modeling, specification languages,<br>\nspecification/verification case-studies, formal calculi, software<br>\ndesign methods, automatic code generation, refinement methodologies,<br>\ncompositional analysis, verification tools (e.g., static analysis, dynamic<br>\nanalysis, model checking, theorem proving, satisfiability), tool<br>\nintegration, benchmarks, challenge problems, and integrated<br>\nverification environments.</p>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSION</p>\n<p>Papers will be evaluated by at least three members of the <br>\nProgram Committee. We are accepting both long (limited to 16 pages) <br>\nand short (limited to 10 pages) paper submissions, written in English.  <br>\nShort submissions also cover Verification Pearls describing an<br>\nelegant proof or proof technique.  Submitted research papers and<br>\nsystem descriptions must be original and not submitted for publication<br>\nelsewhere.  </p>\n<p>Research paper submissions must be in LNCS format and must<br>\ninclude a cogent and self-contained description of the ideas, methods,<br>\nresults, and comparison to existing work.
