However, the increased complexity now asks for a<br>\n    more explicit treatment of adaptation. A central goal is to check<br>\n    that the adaptation does not violate global system properties or<br>\n    leads to inconsistent system configurations.</p>\n<p>This workshop is the first that aims at considering adaptation as<br>\n    a cross-cutting system aspect that needs to be explicitly<br>\n    addressed in system design and verification. The program committee<br>\n    welcomes submissions on formal modeling, specification,<br>\n    verification, and implementation of adaptive systems.<br>\n    This includes, but is not limited to, the following topics:</p>\n<p>* formal modeling of adaptation<br>\n    * programming language concepts for adaptive systems<br>\n    * specification and verification methods of adaptive systems<br>\n    * dynamic verification techniques for adaptation<br>\n    * new applications of software/hardware adaptation<br>\n    * dynamic adaptation of hardware and/or hardware/software<br>\n      partitioning</p>\n<p>* self-healing and self-optimizing systems</p>\n<p>Format of the Workshop:</p>\n<p>The workshop is co-located with the International Conference on<br>\n    Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics and will be held in<br>\n    Kaiserslautern, Germany, on September 14th, 2007.</p>\n<p>Proceedings:</p>\n<p>Submissions will be fully refereed, and accepted papers will be<br>\n    published first as a technical report of the University of<br>\n    Kaiserslautern (available at the workshop). Second, it is planned<br>\n    to publish the accepted papers as a volume of ENTCS after the<br>\n    workshop (decision pending). Authors of accepted papers are<br>\n    expected to present their work at the conference.</p>\n<p>Submission Guidelines:</p>\n<p>Submissions should describe new approaches, case studies or<br>\n    results in the areas described above.<br>\n      Papers must be submitted by email to<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:schneider@informatik.uni-kl.de\">schneider@informatik.uni-kl.de</a>.<br>\n    Submissions should be no more than 16 pages in length and should<br>\n    be written using LaTeX2e and the ENTCS style file that is<br>\n    available at <a href=\"http://www.entcs.org\">http://www.entcs.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Program Committee:</p>\n<p>* Betty Cheng, Michigan State University, USA<br>\n    * Mike Gordon, University of Cambridge, UK<br>\n    * Arnd Poetzsch-Heffter, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany<br>\n    * Wolfgang Reif, University of Augsburg, Germany<br>\n    * Klaus Schneider, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany<br>\n    * Robert de Simone, INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, France</p>\n<p>Workshop Organizers:</p>\n<p>* Arnd Poetzsch-Heffter, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany<br>\n    * Klaus Schneider, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany</p>",
