During the competition, participants work for 90 minutes on relatively small but intriguing verification challenges.</p>\n<p>With the VerifyThis Long-Term Challenge we would like to see how far the formal verification community can get within 6 months if they collaborate to verify a real-world software application.</p>\n<p>The VerifyThis Long-Term Challenge is starting now, and it will be open until 29th of February, 2020. We would like to encourage everybody in the formal verification community to participate in this challenge, and to use their tools and technique to tackle parts of the challenges.</p>\n<p>More information about the challenge is available at <a href=\"https://verifythis.github.io\">https://verifythis.github.io</a>.</p>",
