It is a<br>\nsuccessor of the program verification competition held at FoVeOOS 2011.</p>\n<p>The aims of the competition are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>to bring together those interested in formal verification, and to<br>\n  provide an engaging, hands-on, and fun opportunity for discussion</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to evaluate the usability of logic-based program verification tools in<br>\n  a controlled experiment that could be easily repeated by others.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The competition will offer a number of challenges presented in natural<br>\nlanguage. Participants have to formalize the requirements, implement a<br>\nsolution, and formally verify the implementation for adherence to the<br>\nspecification.</p>\n<p>There are no restrictions on the programming language and verification<br>\ntechnology used. The correctness properties posed in problems will have<br>\nthe input-output behavior of programs in focus. Solutions will be judged<br>\nfor correctness, completeness and elegance. A separate call for problem<br>\ncontributions is forthcoming.</p>\n<p>SCHEDULE</p>\n<p>The problem-solving session will take place on August 30th. On the<br>\nfollowing day, the participants will have the opportunity to discuss<br>\nsolutions with the judges, and the preliminary results will be announced<br>\nat a plenary session of FM 2012.</p>\n<p>PARTICIPATION</p>\n<p>Participation is open for anybody interested. Teams of up to two people<br>\nare allowed. Physical presence on site is required. We particularly<br>\nencourage participation of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>student teams (this includes PhD students)</li>\n<li>non-developer teams using a tool someone else developed</li>\n<li>several teams using the same tool</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The competition is a satellite event of the FM 2012. Participants must<br>\nregister on the FM website AND send an email to <a href=\"mailto:fm2012@verifythis.org\">fm2012@verifythis.org</a><br>\nlisting team composition and tools.</p>\n<p>PRIZES</p>\n<p>Prizes will be awarded in the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>best team</li>\n<li>best student team</li>\n<li>tool used by most teams</li>\n<li>tool providing most assistance to the user</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ORGANIZERS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marieke Huisman, University of Twente, the Netherlands</li>\n<li>Vladimir Klebanov, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany</li>\n<li>Rosemary Monahan, National University of Ireland Maynooth</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CONTACT</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:fm2012@verifythis.org\">fm2012@verifythis.org</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://fm2012.verifythis.org/\">http://fm2012.verifythis.org/</a></p>\n<p>Dr Rosemary Monahan<br>\nPrinciples of Programming Research Group<br>\nDepartment of Computer Science,<br>\nNUI Maynooth, Maynooth, Co.
