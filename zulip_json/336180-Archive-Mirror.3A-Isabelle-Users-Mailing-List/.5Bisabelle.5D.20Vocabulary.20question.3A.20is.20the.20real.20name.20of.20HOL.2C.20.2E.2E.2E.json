I came to  <br>\na question related to HOL and type theory, and though this may be the best  <br>\nplace to ask for, due to Isabelle being very close to it.</p>\n<p>I landed onto this paper:  <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/PUBS/inconsist-hol.pdf\">http://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/PUBS/inconsist-hol.pdf</a></p>\n<p>In the abstract, it says “HOL, or its type theoretic variant λHOL”. Does  <br>\nthat mean the real name of HOL with simple type theory is λHOL? And also,  <br>\ndoes that mean there exist(ed) an HOL outside any type theory? (for the  <br>\nlatter, I don't see how, but may be I'm too much biased on this). Or I am  <br>\nmisunderstanding this sentence?</p>\n<p>With thanks, and have a nice day.</p>",

To tell more, my guess is: HOL is a  <br>\nfriendly name, and λHOL is a more formal name with a reference to the  <br>\nlambda‑cube, so not a new logic (if I'm not wrong).</p>\n<p>With thanks for your concern</p>",
