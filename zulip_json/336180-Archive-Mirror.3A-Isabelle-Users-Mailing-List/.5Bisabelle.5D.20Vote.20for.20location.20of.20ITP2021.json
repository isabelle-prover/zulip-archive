It has already<br>\nbeen decided that ITP 2020 will be incorporated into IJCAR 2020, the<br>\nInternational Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning, to be held in<br>\nParis. However, we are already looking forward to 2021.</p>\n<p>Anyone who is seriously considering attending ITP 2021 is entitled to<br>\nvote. We received two bids, for Rome and London.  Details of the bids<br>\ncan be viewed at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itp19.cecs.pdx.edu/itp-2021/\">https://itp19.cecs.pdx.edu/itp-2021/</a></p>\n<p>where you will also find voting instructions. The deadline for voting is</p>\n<p>Friday, 2 August, 2019</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>John Harrison, John O'Leary, and Andrew Tolmach<br>\nITP 2019 organizers</p>",
