Originally born as formal<br>\nmethod for reasoning about abstract data types, it now covers new<br>\nspecification frameworks and programming paradigms (such as<br>\nobject-oriented, aspect-oriented, agent-oriented, logic and higher-order<br>\nfunctional programming) as well as a wide range of application areas<br>\n(including information systems, concurrent, distributed and mobile systems).<br>\nThe workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing<br>\nwork, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.</p>\n<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST<br>\nTypical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Foundations of algebraic specification</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other approaches to formal specification, including process calculi<br>\nand models of concurrent, distributed and mobile computing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specification languages, methods, and environments</p>\n</li>\n<li>Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques</li>\n<li>Model-driven development</li>\n<li>Graph transformations, term rewriting and proof systems</li>\n<li>Integration of formal specification techniques</li>\n<li>Formal testing and quality assurance, validation, and verification</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WORKSHOP FORMAT AND LOCATION<br>\nThe workshop will take place over four days, Thursday to Sunday, at<br>\nHotel International Sinaia. Presentations will be selected on the basis<br>\nof submitted abstracts.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>\nTo be announced</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\nSubmission deadline for abstracts: June 15, 2014<br>\nNotification of acceptance: June 30, 2014<br>\nEarly registration: July 5, 2014<br>\nFinal abstract due: July 25, 2014<br>\nWorkshop in Sinaia: September 4-7, 2014</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>\nThe scientific program of the workshop will include presentations of<br>\nrecent results and ongoing research. The presentations will be selected<br>\non the basis of the submitted abstracts according to originality,<br>\nsignificance, and general interest.<br>\nThe abstracts have to be submitted electronically according to the<br>\ninstructions published on the workshop homepage.</p>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS<br>\nAfter the workshop, selected authors will be invited to submit full<br>\npapers for the refereed proceedings, which will be published as a volume<br>\nof Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Springer).</p>\n<p>SPONSORSHIP<br>\nThe workshop takes place under the auspices of IFIP WG 1.3.</p>\n<p>WADT STEERING COMMITTEE<br>\nMichel Bidoit (France)<br>\nAndrea Corradini (Italy)<br>\nJose Fiadeiro (UK)<br>\nRolf Hennicker (Germany)<br>\nHans-Jorg Kreowski (Germany)<br>\nTill Mossakowski (Germany) [chair]<br>\nFernando Orejas (Spain)<br>\nFrancesco Parisi-Presicce (Italy)<br>\nGrigore Rosu (United States)<br>\nAndrzej Tarlecki (Poland)</p>\n<p>ORGANIZING COMMITTEE<br>\nRazvan Diaconescu (Romania)<br>\nMihai Codescu (Germany)<br>\nIonut Tutu (UK)</p>\n<p>CONTACT INFORMATION<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:wadt2014@gmail.com\">wadt2014@gmail.com</a><br>\nHomepage: <a href=\"http://wadt2014.cs.ovgu.de\">http://wadt2014.cs.ovgu.de</a></p>",
