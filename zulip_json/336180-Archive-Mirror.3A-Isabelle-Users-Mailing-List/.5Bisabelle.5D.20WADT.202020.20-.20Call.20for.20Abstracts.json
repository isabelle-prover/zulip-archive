April 2020</p>\n<p>Co-located with ETAPS 2020</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Submission link:  <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wadt2020\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wadt2020</a><br>\nAbstract Submission Deadline: 14.2.2020<br>\nNotification: 24.2.2020</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The algebraic approach to system specification encompasses many<br>\naspects of the formal design of software systems. Originally born as a<br>\nformal method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now covers<br>\nnew specification frameworks and programming paradigms (such as<br>\nobject-oriented, aspect oriented, agent-oriented, logic and<br>\nhigher-order functional programming) as well as a wide range of<br>\napplication areas (including information systems, concurrent,<br>\ndistributed and mobile systems). The workshop will provide an<br>\nopportunity to present recent and ongoing work, to meet colleagues,<br>\nand to discuss new ideas and future trends.</p>\n<p>The workshop takes place under the auspices of IFIP WG 1.3.</p>\n<p>WADT 2020 will have three thematic streams and one general stream:</p>\n<p>Graph Transformation – chair: Andrea Corradini, Italy<br>\nSystem Modelling – chair: Alexander Knapp, Germany<br>\nDeductive Software Verification – chair: Marieke Huismanm, The Netherlands<br>\nGeneral Stream - chair: Markus Roggenbach, UK</p>\n<hr>\n<p>GRAPH TRANSFORMATION STREAM</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The  graph   transformation  stream  seeks  contributions  addressing<br>\ntheoretical,  application oriented  or tool  related aspects  of graph<br>\ntransformation, or  any combination of  them. Here is  a non-exclusive<br>\nlist of topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Foundations of algebraic and set-based approaches to graph transformation</li>\n<li>Relations between graph transformation and other computational models</li>\n<li>Analysis, verification, validation and testing of graph transformation systems</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications to software engineering, including software architectures, refactoring,<br>\n business processes, access control and service-orientation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Applications to computing paradigms such as bio-inspired, string diagrams, quantum, ubiquitous, and visual computing</p>\n</li>\n<li>Tools based on or supporting the development of graph transformation systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>SYSTEM MODELLING STREAM</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The system modelling stream seeks contributions in the (co-)algebraic<br>\nand model-based tradition of system specification and verification,<br>\nfor which typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Systems modelling</li>\n<li>System views and consistency</li>\n<li>Real-time, Hybrid, and Cyber-physical systems</li>\n<li>Modelling languages, like UML, SysML, etc., and their profiles</li>\n<li>Model transformations</li>\n<li>Model-based testing</li>\n<li>Tools for systems specification, testing, and verification</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>DEDUCTIVE SOFTWARE VERIFICATION STREAM</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The deductive software verification stream seeks contributions<br>\naddressing theoretical or tool-related contributions in the area of<br>\ndeductive software verification. Also experience reports are<br>\nwelcome. Here is a non-exclusive list of topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Foundations of deductive software verification and program logics</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advancing deductive software verification techniques to new programming languages,<br>\n or different programming paradigms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automating deductive software verification</p>\n</li>\n<li>Combinations of deductive software verification techniques with other formal methods</li>\n<li>Applications of deductive software verification on industrial case studies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This stream will be scheduled in such a way that there will be no overlap with the VerifyThis workshop at Etaps 2020.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>GENERAL STREAM</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest for the general stream are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Foundations of algebraic specification</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other approaches to formal specification, including process calculi and <br>\n models of concurrent, distributed, and cyber-physical systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specification languages, methods, and environments</p>\n</li>\n<li>Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques</li>\n<li>Integration of formal specification techniques</li>\n<li>Formal testing and quality assurance, validation, and verification</li>\n<li>Algebraic approaches to cognitive sciences, including computational creativity</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The scientific programme of the workshop will include presentations of<br>\nrecent results and ongoing research. The presentations will be<br>\nselected by the relevant PC Chair on the basis of submitted abstracts<br>\naccording to originality, significance and general interest. The<br>\nabstracts must be up to two pages long including references. If a<br>\nlonger version of the contribution is available, it can be made<br>\naccessible on the web and referenced in the abstract.</p>\n<p>The abstracts have to be submitted electronically via the EasyChair<br>\nsystem using the following link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wadt2020\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wadt2020</a></p>\n<p>After the workshop, authors will be invited to submit full papers for<br>\nthe refereed post-proceedings. All submissions will be reviewed by the<br>\nWADT 2020 PC (TBA); selection will be based on originality, soundness and<br>\nsignificance of the presented ideas and results. The proceedings are<br>\nlikely to be published as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer<br>\nScience (LNCS) by Springer. The deadline for submissions will be<br>\n19.5.2020 , with notifications of acceptance by<br>\n26.6.2020. Camera-ready versions will be required by 17.7.2020.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Wolfgang Ahrendt (Sweden)   <br>\nAndrea Corradini (Italy) [Co-Chair] <br>\nClaire Dross (France)<br>\nFrancisco Durán (Spain)<br>\nRachid Echahed (France)<br>\nJose Fiadeiro (UK)<br>\nReiko Heckel (UK)   <br>\nMarieke Huisman (The Netherlands) [Co-Chair] <br>\nAlexander Knapp (Germany) [Co-Chair] <br>\nLeen Lambers (Germany)<br>\nStephan Merz (France)   <br>\nRosemary Monahan (Ireland)<br>\nTill Mossakowski (Germany)<br>\nIulian Ober (France)    <br>\nPeter Ölveczky (Norway) <br>\nWytse Oortwijn (Switzerland)<br>\nFernando Orejas (Spain)<br>\nCarlos Pombo (Argentina)<br>\nMarkus Roggenbach (UK) [Co-Chair] <br>\nPierre-Yves Schobbens (Belgium) <br>\nIonut Tutu (Romania)<br>\nMattias Ulbrich (USA)<br>\nAntonio Vallecillo (Spain)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>STEERING COMMITTEE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Andrea Corradini (Italy)<br>\nJosé Fiadeiro (UK)<br>\nRolf Hennicker (Germany)<br>\nAlexander Knapp (Germany)<br>\nHans-Jörg Kreowski (Germany)<br>\nTill Mossakowski (Germany)<br>\nFernando Orejas (Spain)<br>\nLeila Ribeiro (Brazil)<br>\nMarkus Roggenbach (UK) [Chair]<br>\nGrigore Roșu (United States)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<hr>\n<p>14.2.2020 Abstract Submission<br>\n24.2.2020 Notification<br>\n3.4.2020 Camera Ready Abstract<br>\n25.4.2020 &amp; 26.4.2020 Workshop<br>\n19.5.2020 Submission deadline for full papers<br>\n26.6.2020 Notification on full papers<br>\n17.7.2020 Camera ready final version of the papers</p>",
