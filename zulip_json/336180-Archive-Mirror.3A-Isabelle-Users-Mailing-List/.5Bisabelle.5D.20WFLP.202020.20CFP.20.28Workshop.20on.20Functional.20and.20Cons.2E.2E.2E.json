WFLP has a reputation for being a lively and<br>\nfriendly forum, and it is open for presenting and discussing work in<br>\nprogress, technical contributions, experience reports, experiments,<br>\nreviews, and system descriptions.</p>\n<p>The 28th International Workshop on Functional and (Constraint) Logic<br>\nProgramming (WFLP 2020) will be organized by the University of Bologna,<br>\nItaly, as part of Bologna Federated Conference on Programming Languages<br>\n2020 and it will be held entirely on-line due to the coronavirus<br>\npandemic.</p>\n<p>Previous WFLP editions were WFLP 2019 (Cottbus, Germany), WFLP 2018<br>\n(Frankfurt am Main, Germany), WFLP 2017 (Würzburg, Germany), WFLP 2016<br>\n(Leipzig, Germany), WFLP 2014 (Wittenberg, Germany), WFLP 2013 (Kiel,<br>\nGermany), WFLP 2012 (Nagoya, Japan), WFLP 2011 (Odense, Denmark), WFLP<br>\n2010 (Madrid, Spain), WFLP 2009 (Brasilia, Brazil), WFLP 2008 (Siena,<br>\nItaly), WFLP 2007 (Paris, France), WFLP 2006 (Madrid, Spain), WCFLP<br>\n2005 (Tallinn, Estonia), WFLP 2004 (Aachen, Germany), WFLP 2003<br>\n(Valencia, Spain), WFLP 2002 (Grado, Italy), WFLP 2001 (Kiel, Germany),<br>\nWFLP 2000 (Benicassim, Spain), WFLP'99 (Grenoble, France), WFLP'98 (Bad<br>\nHonnef, Germany), WFLP'97 (Schwarzenberg, Germany), WFLP'96 (Marburg,<br>\nGermany), WFLP'95 (Schwarzenberg, Germany), WFLP'94 (Schwarzenberg,<br>\nGermany), WFLP'93 (Rattenberg, Germany), and WFLP'92 (Karlsruhe,<br>\nGermany).</p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<p>The topics of interest cover all aspects of functional and logic<br>\nprogramming. They include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Functional programming</li>\n<li>Logic programming</li>\n<li>Constraint programming</li>\n<li>Deductive databases, data mining</li>\n<li>Extensions of declarative languages, objects</li>\n<li>Multi-paradigm declarative programming</li>\n<li>Foundations, semantics, non-monotonic reasoning, dynamics</li>\n<li>Parallelism, concurrency</li>\n<li>Program analysis, abstract interpretation</li>\n<li>Program and model manipulation</li>\n<li>Program transformation, partial evaluation, meta-programming</li>\n<li>Specification,</li>\n<li>Verification</li>\n<li>Debugging</li>\n<li>Testing</li>\n<li>Knowledge representation, machine learning</li>\n<li>Interaction of declarative programming with other formalisms</li>\n<li>Implementation of declarative languages</li>\n<li>Advanced programming environments and tools</li>\n<li>Software techniques for declarative programming</li>\n<li>Applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The primary focus is on new and original research results, but<br>\nsubmissions describing innovative products, prototypes under<br>\ndevelopment,<br>\napplication systems, or interesting experiments (e.g., benchmarks) are<br>\nalso encouraged. Survey papers that present some aspects of the above<br>\ntopics from a new perspective, and experience reports are also welcome.</p>\n<p>Papers must be written and presented in English. Work that already<br>\nappeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings<br>\nmay<br>\nbe submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).</p>\n<p>Submission Guidelines</p>\n<p>Submission is via Easychair submission website for WFLP 2020:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wflp2020\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wflp2020</a></p>\n<p>Authors are invited to submit papers in the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular research paper</li>\n<li>Work-in-progress report</li>\n<li>System description</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regular research papers must describe original work, be written and<br>\npresented in English, and must not substantially overlap with papers<br>\nthat have been formally published or that are simultaneously submitted<br>\nto a journal, conference, or workshop with formal proceedings. They<br>\nwill<br>\nbe judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness,<br>\noriginality, and clarity. For work-in-progress reports and system<br>\ndescriptions, less formal rules apply, and presentation-only<br>\nsubmissions<br>\n(talk and discussion, but no paper in the formal proceedings) are<br>\npossible. Please contact the PC chair with any questions.</p>\n<p>All submissions must be formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer<br>\nScience style. Submissions cannot exceed 15 pages including references<br>\nbut excluding well-marked appendices not intended for publication.<br>\nReviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers<br>\nshould<br>\nbe intelligible without them. However, all submissions (especially<br>\nwork-in-progress reports and system descriptions) may be considerably<br>\nshorter than 15 pages.</p>\n<p>Proceedings</p>\n<p>All papers accepted for presentation at the conference will be<br>\npublished<br>\nin informal proceedings publicly available at the Computing Research<br>\nRepository. According to the program committee reviews, submissions can<br>\nbe<br>\ndirectly accepted for publication in the formal post-conference<br>\nproceedings.<br>\nThe formal post-conference proceedings will be published in both<br>\nelectronic<br>\nand paper formats by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science<br>\nseries.<br>\nAfter the conference, all authors accepted only for presentation will<br>\nbe<br>\ninvited to revise and/or extend their submissions in the light of the<br>\nfeedback<br>\nsolicited at the conference. Then, after another round of reviewing,<br>\nthese<br>\nrevised papers may also be published in the formal proceedings.</p>\n<p>Therefore, all accepted papers will be published in open-access, and<br>\nthe<br>\nauthors can also decide to publish their work in the Springer LNCS<br>\nformal<br>\nproceedings.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Sergio Antoy (Portland State University, USA)<br>\nDemis Ballis (University of Udine, Italy)<br>\nMoreno Falaschi (Università di Siena, Italy)<br>\nMichael Hanus (University of Kiel, Germany) (Co-Chair)<br>\nHerbert Kuchen (University of Muenster, Germany)<br>\nDale Miller (INRIA and LIX/Ècole Polytechnique)<br>\nClaudio Sacerdoti Coen (University of Bologna, Italy) (Co-Chair)<br>\nKonstantinos Sagonas (Uppsala University, Sweden)<br>\nEnrico Tassi (INRIA, France)<br>\nJanis Voigtländer (University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany)<br>\nJohannes Waldmann (HTWK Leipzig, Germany)</p>\n<p>Organizing Committee</p>\n<p>Claudio Sacerdoti Coen (University of Bologna, Italy) (Co-Chair)</p>",
