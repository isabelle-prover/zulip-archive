With advances in language<br>\n    technology demanding deep understanding of ever larger and more<br>\n    complex languages, this need has become urgent. The goal of the WMM<br>\n    workshops is to bring researchers who are (or would like to be) using<br>\n    automated proof assistants for programming language metatheory<br>\n    together with developers of proof assistants with an interest in<br>\n    supporting research in programming languages.</p>\n<p>This WMM is an occasion to look back at five years of intensive effort<br>\n    on formalizing programming languages. The centerpiece of the event<br>\n    will be a series of invited talks in which major players in the area<br>\n    look both back and forward, offering their perspectives on what has<br>\n    been achieved and what challenges remain.</p>\n<p>There will also be a session of short contributed presentations by<br>\n    workshop participants, selected from submitted abstracts.</p>\n<p>Invited Speakers</p>\n<p>* Andrew Appel, Princeton University<br>\n     * Karl Crary, Carnegie Mellon University<br>\n     * Amy Felty, University of Ottawa<br>\n     * Christian Urban, TU Munich<br>\n     * Steve Zdancewic, University of Pennsylvania</p>\n<p>CALL FOR ABSTRACTS</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>* Submission deadline for abstracts: 21 July, 2010<br>\n   * Author Notification: 15 August, 2010<br>\n   * Workshop: Saturday, 25 September, 2010</p>\n<p>Scope</p>\n<p>* Tool demonstrations: proof assistants, logical frameworks,<br>\n     visualizers, etc.</p>\n<p>* Libraries for programming language metatheory<br>\n   * Novel formalization techniques<br>\n   * Investigation of formalization issues, especially with respect to<br>\n     variable binding</p>\n<p>* Examples of formalized programming language metatheory<br>\n   * Analysis and comparison of solutions to the POPLmark challenge<br>\n   * Proposals for new challenge problems that benchmark programming<br>\n     language work</p>",
