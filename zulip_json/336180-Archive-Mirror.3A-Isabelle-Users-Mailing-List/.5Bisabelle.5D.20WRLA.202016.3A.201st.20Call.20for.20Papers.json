It<br>\ncan be used for specifying a wide range of systems and languages in various<br>\napplication domains. It also has good properties as a metalogical framework<br>\nfor representing logics. Several successful languages based on rewriting<br>\n(ASF+SDF, CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude) have been designed and implemented. The aim<br>\nof WRLA is to bring together researchers with a common interest in rewriting<br>\nand its applications, and to give them the opportunity to present their<br>\nrecent work, discuss future research directions, and exchange ideas.<br>\nThe 2016 edition of WRLA will mark its 20th anniversary since its first<br>\nedition in Asilomar, California, in 1996.</p>\n<p>The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>A. Foundations</p>\n<p>* foundations and models of rewriting and rewriting logic, including<br>\n     termination, confluence, coherence and complexity</p>\n<p>* unification, generalisation, narrowing, and partial evaluation<br>\n   * constrained rewriting and symbolic algebra<br>\n   * graph rewriting<br>\n   * tree automata<br>\n   * rewriting strategies<br>\n   * rewriting-based calculi and explicit substitutions</p>\n<p>B. Rewriting as a Logical and Semantic Framework</p>\n<p>* uses of rewriting and rewriting logic as a logical framework,<br>\n     including deduction modulo</p>\n<p>* uses of rewriting as a semantic framework for programming language<br>\n     semantics</p>\n<p>* rewriting semantics of concurrency models, distributed systems, and<br>\n     network protocols</p>\n<p>* rewriting semantics of real-time, hybrid, and probabilistic systems<br>\n   * uses of rewriting for compilation and language transformation</p>\n<p>C.  Rewriting Languages</p>\n<p>* rewriting-based declarative languages<br>\n   * type systems for rewriting<br>\n   * implementation techniques<br>\n   * tools supporting rewriting languages</p>\n<p>D. Verification Techniques</p>\n<p>* verification of confluence, termination, coherence, sufficient<br>\n     completeness, and related properties</p>\n<p>* temporal, modal and reachability logics for verifying dynamic<br>\n     properties of rewrite theories</p>\n<p>* explicit-state and symbolic model-checking techniques for<br>\n     verification of rewrite theories</p>\n<p>* rewriting-based theorem proving, including (co)inductive theorem <br>\nproving</p>\n<p>* rewriting-based constraint solving and satisfiability<br>\n   * rewriting-semantics-based verification and analysis of programs</p>\n<p>E. Applications</p>\n<p>* applications to logic, mathematics and physics<br>\n   * rewriting models of biology, chemistry, and membrane systems<br>\n   * security specification and verification<br>\n   * applications to distributed, network, mobile, and cloud computing<br>\n   * specification and verification of real-time, probabilistic, and<br>\n     cyber-physical systems</p>\n<p>* specifications and verification of critical systems<br>\n   * applications to model-based software engineering<br>\n   * applications to engineering and planning</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<p>TBA</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<p>We solicit submissions of regular papers, tool papers, and<br>\nwork-in-progress papers.</p>\n<p>Regular papers must contain original contributions, be clearly written,<br>\ninclude appropriate references, and comparison with related work. They must<br>\nbe unpublished and not submitted simultaneously for publication<br>\nelsewhere.</p>\n<p>Tool papers have to present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel<br>\nextensions to an existing tool. They should provide a short description of<br>\nthe theoretical foundations with relevant citations, emphasise the <br>\ndesign and<br>\nimplementation, and give a clear account of the tool's functionality. The<br>\ndescribed tools must be publicly available via the web.</p>\n<p>Work-in-progress papers present early-stage work or other types of <br>\ninnovative<br>\nor thought-provoking work related to the topics of the workshop. The<br>\ndifference between work-in-progress and regular papers is that <br>\nwork-in-progress<br>\nsubmissions represent work that has not reached yet a level of<br>\ncompletion that would warrant the full-refereed selection process. We<br>\nencourage researchers and practitioners to submit work-in-progress papers as<br>\nthis provides a unique opportunity for sharing valuable ideas, eliciting<br>\nuseful feedback on ongoing work, and fostering discussions and <br>\ncollaborations<br>\namong colleagues.</p>\n<p>All submissions should be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer<br>\nLNCS papers, and should be submitted electronically using EasyChair at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wrla2016\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wrla2016</a></p>\n<p>Regular and work-in-progress papers should not exceed 15 pages including<br>\nreferences. Tool papers can have a maximum of 6 pages including references<br>\nand may have an appendix of up to 4 additional pages with usage details and<br>\ntool demonstration.</p>\n<p>PUBLICATION</p>\n<p>All submissions will be evaluated by the program committee. Regular papers,<br>\ntool papers, and work-in-progress papers that are accepted will be presented<br>\nat the workshop and included in the pre-proceedings, which will be available<br>\nduring the workshop. Following the tradition of the last editions, it is<br>\nexpected the regular papers, tool papers, and invited presentations to be<br>\npublished as a volume in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)<br>\nseries to be distributed after the workshop.</p>\n<p>A special issue of the Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in<br>\nProgramming (JLAMP) will be devoted to extended versions of selected papers<br>\nfrom WRLA 2016.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>Kyungmin Bae, SRI International, USA<br>\n   Mark van den Brand, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands<br>\n   Roberto Bruni, University of Pisa, Italy<br>\n   Stefan Ciobaca, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, Romania<br>\n   Manuel Clavel, IMDEA Software Institute, Spain<br>\n   Francisco Durán, Universidad de Málaga, Spain<br>\n   Joerg Endrullis, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands<br>\n   Santiago Escobar, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, Spain<br>\n   Maribel Fernández, King's College London, UK<br>\n   Kokichi Futatsugi, JAIST, Japan<br>\n   Thomas Genet, IRISA/Université de Rennes 1, France<br>\n   Jürgen Giesl, RWTH Aachen, Germany<br>\n   Deepak Kapur, University of New Mexico, USA<br>\n   Helene Kirchner, INRIA, France<br>\n   Alexander Knapp, Universitat Augsburg, Germany<br>\n   Alberto Lluch Lafuente, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark<br>\n   Dorel Lucanu, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, Romania (chair)<br>\n   Salvador Lucas, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, Spain<br>\n   Narciso Martí-Oliet, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain<br>\n   José Meseguer, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA<br>\n   Ugo Montanari, University of Pisa, Italy<br>\n   Pierre-Etienne Moreau, Université de Lorraine, France<br>\n   Vivek Nigam, Federal University of Paraíba, Brasil<br>\n   Kazuhiro Ogata, JAIST, Japan<br>\n   Peter Ölveczky, University of Oslo, Norway<br>\n   Miguel Palomino, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain<br>\n   Christophe Ringeissen, INRIA-Lorraine Nancy, France<br>\n   Grigore Rosu, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA<br>\n   Vlad Rusu, INRIA Lille Nord-Europe, France<br>\n   Ralf Sasse, ETH Zurich, Switzerland<br>\n   Traian-Florin Serbanuta, University of Bucharest, Romania<br>\n   Mark-Oliver Stehr, SRI International, USA<br>\n   Carolyn Talcott, SRI International, USA<br>\n   Martin Wirsing, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Germany</p>\n<p>CONTACT INFORMATION</p>\n<p>For more information, please contact the organizers<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:dlucanu@info.uaic.ro\">dlucanu@info.uaic.ro</a><br>\nor visit the workshop web page<br>\n<a href=\"http://fmse.info.uaic.ro/events/WRLA2016/\">http://fmse.info.uaic.ro/events/WRLA2016/</a></p>",
