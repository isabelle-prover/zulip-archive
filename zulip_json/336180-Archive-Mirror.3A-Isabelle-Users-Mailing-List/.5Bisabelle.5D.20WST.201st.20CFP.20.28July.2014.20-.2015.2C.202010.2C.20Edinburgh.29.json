There will be no formal reviewing. The accepted papers will<br>\nbe made available electronically before the workshop.</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wst2010\">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wst2010</a></p>\n<p>Final versions should be created using LaTeX and the style file<br>\neasychair.cls (<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/coolnews.cgi\">http://www.easychair.org/coolnews.cgi</a>).</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>Paper submission      April 11<br>\nNotification          April 25<br>\nFinal versions due    May   30<br>\nWorkshop date         July  14-15</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKER</p>\n<p>The keynote will be given by Elvira Albert from the<br>\nComplutense University of Madrid.</p>\n<p>CONFERENCE VENUE</p>\n<p>The workshop will be held as a satellite workshop of RTA and IJCAR<br>\nat the Federated Logic Confernce (FLoC) which takes place in the<br>\nSchool of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>Michael Codish<br>\nSamir Genaim<br>\nAlexander Krauss<br>\nGeorg Moser<br>\nAlbert Rubio<br>\nAndrey Rybalchenko<br>\nPeter Schneider-Kamp (chair)<br>\nJohannes Waldmann</p>",
