(Unless I make a mistake the \"function\" construction is too <br>\nverbose, and maybe too complex, for regular developpers not so found of <br>\nlogic?)</p>\n<p>However, I am a bit confused with this construction since it does not <br>\ncompain (or at least warn the user) with partial functions... though <br>\nwhen programming in Ocaml (for instance) such warning are common.</p>\n<p>Is there a simple solution to switch on such messages?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\n<p>Thomas</p>",
