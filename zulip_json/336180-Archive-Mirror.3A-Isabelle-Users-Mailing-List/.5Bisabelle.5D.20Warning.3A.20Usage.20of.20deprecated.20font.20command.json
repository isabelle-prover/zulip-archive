In<br>\ncontrast \\rm would radically change the font to the standard roman font. <br>\nIf this is wanted, you should have typed \\rmfamily to change the font. <br>\nYou can see the difference if you wanted something like bold and<br>\nitalic, because both </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>{\\bf\\it only italic}<br>\n   {\\it\\bf only bold}</p>\n<p>do not work, but</p>\n<p>\\textbf{\\textit{bold and italic}}<br>\n  \\textit{\\textbf{italic and bold}}</p>\n<p>do. Who knew?</p>\n<p>Anyway, only very few packages seem to actually complain about<br>\nthis change (KOMAscript is one of the few) and certainly the \"world\"<br>\nseems to not have noticed nor have cared. It seems, yes the change makes <br>\nmore sense and is technically more correct, but is still a pain in the<br>\nbackside writing \\textbf{} for {\\rm }. But somehow such inflictions on <br>\nusers sound a tad familiar.....;o) </p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nChristian</p>\n<p>PS: I googled for </p>\n<p>KOMAscript \\bf deprecated  </p>\n<p>and then </p>\n<p>\\rmfamily \\rm Latex2e</p>\n<p>to find the relevant info.</p>",

IIRC, some compond macros like \\rm and \\bf where not <br>\nreally discontinued, but left as useful abbreviations for the longer and <br>\nmore systematic forms.</p>\n<p>What did make a big difference, though, was \\emph with its built-in italic <br>\ncorrection, to replace ancient \\em.  The \"new\" \\emph macros is also the <br>\ndeeper reason, why the slightly odd mix of text mode and math mode in <br>\nIsabelle documentation preparation looks reasonably well: it is used to <br>\nlet LaTeX insert italic corrections, even if there is not really italic <br>\ntext.</p>\n<p>I am all for removing ancient junk, but I am unsure about the KOMA guy -- <br>\nhe seems to like unconventional things just to be different.  The TeX <br>\nworld is untyped and unscoped, so any real cleanup of old macros is <br>\nunrealistic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I can’t assess if the warning is correct, but would still appreciate if<br>\nthis could be adjusted in the next Isabelle release.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just as a general concept, the Isabelle document preparation emits certain <br>\nLaTeX sources that probably make sense in many situations.  The real <br>\nsemantics is determined by the collection of style files that are loaded <br>\nin root.tex, but this sometimes requires some re-adjustments in the <br>\nprelude.</p>\n<p>So the easiest way to avoid KOMA complaining could something like</p>\n<p>\\def\\bf{\\normalfont\\bfseries}</p>\n<p>in your root.tex.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
