The error seems<br>\nto be triggered by a sublocale relation that I introduced. Moreover, the<br>\nterm \"StdMap hm_ops\" is type-correct, and actually proven as a lemma. </p>\n<p>If anyone has an idea what it is, or has experienced a similar behaviour<br>\nand knows what it is, please respond ... otherwise I will invest<br>\nprobably quite much time to boil it down to a simple example that I can<br>\npost on the list.</p>",
