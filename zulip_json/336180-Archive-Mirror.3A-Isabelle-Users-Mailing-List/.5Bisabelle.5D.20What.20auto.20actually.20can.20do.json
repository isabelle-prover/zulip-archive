On page 72 in the<br>\ntutorial, the proof for imp_uncurry seems to use only natural deduction. How<br>\ncome the user needs to manually decide each step and not use auto for it?<br>\nWhat rules does auto actually have and what can/can't it do?</p>\n<p>Thanks for the help.</p>\n<p>Steve</p>",

That means that <br>\nsome rules that are setup as 'natural deduction' rules as well as <br>\nrewriting are used for proving goals.</p>\n<p>1) Only because some tutorial states a proof in some detail, does not <br>\nnecessarily mean that it would not be provable using just an automatic <br>\nmethod.</p>\n<p>2) Even if there is a natural deduction proof for some goal, the <br>\nautomated methods might fail to produce it due to lack of time, <br>\nmisconfiguration, etc.</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",
