In <br>\nIsabelle 2014, it tries 12, and the three additional ones are <br>\n\"algebra\", \"meson\", and \"satx\". In the new Isabelle/Isar Reference <br>\nManual for 2014, I have found descriptions of \"algebra\" and \"meson\", <br>\nbut not of \"satx\". Using Google on satx method Isabelle, I find a <br>\nstatement from Makarius that \"It looks like the proof methods 'sat' <br>\nand 'satx' and the command 'refute' have seen a renaissance,\" but <br>\nnothing about what these actually do. Is there a description of <br>\n\"satx\" anywhere that I can download? Thanks!</p>",

By default, the applied SAT solver is an ML implementation of a simplified version of the conflict-driven clause learning approach used by modern SAT solvers. Alternatively, external SAT solvers such as Minisat or zChaff can be invoked for better performance.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>Sascha</p>",
