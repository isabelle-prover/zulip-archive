Douglas Maurer\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:maurer@gwu.edu\">maurer@gwu.edu</a>&gt;<br>\nAfter receiving Florian Haftmann's helpful response to my problem <br>\nwith \\&lt;emptyset&gt;, I decided to try to extend this to be able to work <br>\nwith \\&lt;int&gt; (the Z in a special font that means the set of all <br>\nintegers). There is a button for this under Letter in the Symbols <br>\npane. Accordingly, just like the use of notation Set.empty <br>\n(\"\\&lt;emptyset&gt;\"), I tried notation <a href=\"http://Int.int\">Int.int</a> (\"\\&lt;int&gt;\"). The \\&lt;int&gt; came <br>\nout properly on the screen as the Z in a special font. Then I tried <br>\nusing it. If I write lemma \"(a&lt;(b::int))\\Longrightarrow (a+c&lt;b+c) by <br>\nsimp, that works. But if I substitute \\&lt;int&gt; for int in the above, <br>\nthen \\&lt;int&gt; again comes out on the screen as the Z in a special font, <br>\nbut the proof doesn't go through. I tried replacing <a href=\"http://Int.int\">Int.int</a> in the <br>\nnotation statement by just int, but that doesn't work either. I <br>\nsuspect that there is something wrong with <a href=\"http://Int.int\">Int.int</a>, but I don't know <br>\nwhat syntax to try next.</p>",

To change the notation for <br>\ntypes, use the command type_notation instead of notation. In your particular case with <br>\nint, the notation command did not complain, because there is also the function <a href=\"http://Int.int\">Int.int</a> <br>\n(which converts natural numbers into integers).</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nAndreas</p>",

If you <br>\nwant to have subscripts for identifiers, you must stick to \\&lt;^sub&gt;. If the index consists <br>\nof several letters, each must carry its own \\&lt;^sub&gt; as in x\\&lt;^sub&gt;1\\&lt;^sub&gt;2. Conversely, <br>\nwhen you define your own syntax for a function in which terms are subscripted, only use <br>\n\\&lt;^bsub&gt; and \\&lt;^esub&gt;, but not \\&lt;^sub&gt;. Otherwise, you will get strange effects.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
