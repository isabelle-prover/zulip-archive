Isabelle does have <br>\nnotation for the empty set, namely {} (so for example {} union X is <br>\nX; {} intersect X is {}; and these can be proved by simp) but these <br>\ndon't work if {} is replaced by the empty-set symbol, even though <br>\n\\&lt;em does auto-complete to that symbol. Is there a good reason for <br>\nthis? If not, perhaps it could be fixed in the next version. (When I <br>\nteach discrete mathematics, I always use that symbol instead of {} .)</p>",

You can add it using e.g. 'notation <br>\nSet.empty (\"\\&lt;emptyset&gt; \")' (untested, refer to the Isar reference <br>\nmanual for details).\" I tested that, and it does work. Thanks! (I <br>\nstill think it should be built in, though.)</p>",
