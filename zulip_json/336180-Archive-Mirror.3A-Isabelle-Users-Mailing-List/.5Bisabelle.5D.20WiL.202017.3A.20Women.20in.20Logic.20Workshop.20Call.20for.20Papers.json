The workshop intends to follow the<br>\npattern of meetings such as Women in Machine Learning (WiML,<br>\n<a href=\"http://wimlworkshop.org/\">http://wimlworkshop.org/</a>) or Women in Engineering (WIE,<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering\">http://www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering</a>) that have<br>\nbeen taking place for quite a few years.</p>\n<p>Women are chronically underrepresented in the LICS community;<br>\nconsequently they sometimes feel both conspicuous and isolated, and<br>\nhence there is a risk that the under-representation is<br>\nself-perpetuating.</p>\n<p>The workshop will provide an opportunity for women in the field to<br>\nincrease awareness of one another and one another's work, to combat<br>\nthe feeling of isolation. It will also provide an environment where<br>\nwomen can present to an audience comprised of mostly women,<br>\nreplicating the experience that most men have at most LICS meetings,<br>\nand lowering the stress of the occasion; we hope that this will be<br>\nparticularly attractive to early-career women.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest of this workshop include but are not limited to the<br>\nusual Logic in Computer Science (LICS) topics. These are listed as<br>\nautomata theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,<br>\nconcurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,<br>\nconstructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,<br>\ndescription logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects<br>\nof program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,<br>\nhigher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic,<br>\nlogic in artificial intelligence, logic programming, logical aspects<br>\nof bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational complexity,<br>\nlogical aspects of quantum computation, logical frameworks, logics of<br>\nprograms, modal and temporal logics, model checking, probabilistic<br>\nsystems, process calculi, programming language semantics, proof<br>\ntheory, real-time systems, reasoning about security and privacy,<br>\nrewriting, type systems and type theory, and verification.</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>\nContributions should be written in English and submitted in the form<br>\nof full papers (with a maximum of 10 pages) or short papers (with a<br>\nmaximum of 5 pages). They must be unpublished and not submitted<br>\nsimultaneously for publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The papers should be prepared in latex using the LICS style (IEEE<br>\nProceedings 2-column 10pt). LaTeX style files are available at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/\">http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/</a>.<br>\nPlease use IEEEtran.cls version V1.8b, released on 26/08/2015.</p>\n<p>The submission should be in the form of a PDF file uploaded to the WiL<br>\n2017 Easychair page (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2017\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2017</a>)<br>\nbefore the submission deadline of February 17th, 2017, anywhere on<br>\nEarth.</p>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS<br>\nWe plan to publish a post conference volume at ENTCS or other equally<br>\nvisible outlet.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\nPaper submission deadline:  February 17th, 2017<br>\nAuthor notification:  March 15th, 2017<br>\nContribution for Proceedings:  15 April 2017<br>\nFinal program:  1 May 2017</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Claudia Nalon (University of Brasilia, Brasil)</li>\n<li>Catuscia Palamidessi (INRIA Saclay and LIX, France)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SCIENTIFIC AND ORGANIZING COMMITTEE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Valeria de Paiva (Chair, Nuance Communications, USA)</li>\n<li>Adriana Compagnoni (Stevens Institute of Technology, USA)</li>\n<li>Amy Felty (University of Ottawa, Canada)</li>\n<li>Anna Ingolfsdottir (Reykjavik University, Iceland)</li>\n<li>Ursula Martin (University of Oxford, UK)</li>\n<li>Brigitte Pientka (McGill University, Canada)</li>\n<li>Alexandra Silva (University College London, UK)</li>\n<li>Perdita Stevens (University of Edinburgh, UK)</li>\n</ul>",
