The workshop follows the pattern of<br>\nmeetings such as Women in Machine Learning (WiML,<br>\n<a href=\"http://wimlworkshop.org/\">http://wimlworkshop.org/</a>) or Women in Engineering (WIE,<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering\">http://www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering</a>) that have<br>\nbeen taking place for quite a few years.</p>\n<p>Women are chronically underrepresented in the LICS community;<br>\nconsequently they sometimes feel both conspicuous and isolated, and<br>\nhence there is a risk that the under-representation is<br>\nself-perpetuating.</p>\n<p>The workshop will provide an opportunity for women in the field to<br>\nincrease awareness of one another and one another's work, to combat<br>\nthe feeling of isolation. It will also provide an environment where<br>\nwomen can present to an audience comprised of mostly women,<br>\nreplicating the experience that most men have at most LICS meetings,<br>\nand lowering the stress of the occasion; we hope that this will be<br>\nparticularly attractive to early-career women.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest of this workshop include but are not limited to the<br>\nusual Logic in Computer Science (LICS) topics. These are: automata<br>\ntheory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,<br>\nconcurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,<br>\nconstructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,<br>\ndescription logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects<br>\nof program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,<br>\nhigher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic,<br>\nlogic in artificial intelligence, logic programming, logical aspects<br>\nof bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational complexity,<br>\nlogical aspects of quantum computation, logical frameworks, logics of<br>\nprograms, modal and temporal logics, model checking, probabilistic<br>\nsystems, process calculi, programming language semantics, proof<br>\ntheory, real-time systems, reasoning about security and privacy,<br>\nrewriting, type systems and type theory, and verification.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perdita Stevens (University of Edinburgh, UK)</li>\n<li>TBA</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\nPaper submission deadline:  31 March 2018<br>\nAuthor notification:  8 May 2018<br>\nContribution for Informal Proceedings:  31 May 2018</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>\nContributions should be written in English and can be submitted in the<br>\nform of full papers (with a maximum of 10 pages), short papers (with a<br>\nmaximum of 5 pages), or talk abstracts (1 page).</p>\n<p>Provisional formatting instructions: Papers and abstracts should be<br>\nprepared in latex using the ACM SIGPLAN Proceedings 2-column 10pt<br>\nformat.
