The workshop follows the pattern<br>\nof meetings such as Women in Machine Learning (WiML,<br>\n<a href=\"http://wimlworkshop.org/\">wimlworkshop.org/</a>) or Women in Engineering (WIE,<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering\">www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering</a>) that have been<br>\ntaking place for quite a few years.</p>\n<p>Women are chronically underrepresented in the LiCS community. The<br>\nworkshop will provide an opportunity for women in the field to<br>\nincrease awareness of one another and one another’s work, to combat<br>\nthe feeling of isolation. It will also provide an environment where<br>\nwomen can present to an audience comprising mostly women, replicating<br>\nthe experience that most men have at most LiCS meetings, and lowering<br>\nthe stress of the occasion; we hope that this will be particularly<br>\nattractive to early-career women.</p>\n<p>Previous versions of Women in Logic (Reykjavik, Iceland 2017 and<br>\nOxford, UK 2018) were very successful in showcasing women's work and<br>\nas catalysts for recognition of the need for change in the<br>\ncommunity. Our extended program committee tries to cover most areas of<br>\nLogic in Computer Science.  These include but are not limited to the<br>\nusual Logic in Computer Science (LICS) topics. These are: automata<br>\ntheory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,<br>\nconcurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,<br>\nconstructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,<br>\ndescription logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects<br>\nof program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,<br>\ngames and logic, higher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi,<br>\nlinear logic, logic in artificial intelligence, logic programming,<br>\nlogical aspects of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational<br>\ncomplexity, logical aspects of quantum computation, logical<br>\nframeworks, logics of programs, modal and temporal logics, model<br>\nchecking, probabilistic systems, process calculi, programming language<br>\nsemantics, proof theory, real-time systems, reasoning about security<br>\nand privacy, rewriting, type systems and type theory, and<br>\nverification.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anne Condon (University of British Columbia, Canada)</li>\n<li>Zena Ariola (University of Oregon, USA)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\nPaper submission deadline:  21 April 2019<br>\nAuthor notification:  7 May 2019<br>\nContribution for Informal Proceedings:  23 May 2019</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>\nContributions should be written in English and can be submitted in the<br>\nform of full papers (with a maximum of 10 pages), short papers (with a<br>\nmaximum of 5 pages), or talk abstracts (1 page).</p>\n<p>Formatting instructions: Papers and abstracts should be<br>\nprepared using the Easychair style<br>\n(<a href=\"https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors\">https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors</a>).</p>\n<p>The submission should be in the form of a PDF file uploaded to the WiL<br>\n2019 Easychair page (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2019\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2019</a>)<br>\nbefore the submission deadline of 21 April 2019, anywhere on Earth.</p>\n<p>PROCEEDINGS<br>\nWe plan to publish an informal post conference volume at ENTCS or<br>\nother equally visible outlet.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZING AND PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br>\nSince our workshop is especially keen on making sure that women get to<br>\nknow the work of other women, we have a large program committee.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sandra Alves (Universidade do Porto, Portugal)</li>\n<li>Agata Ciabattoni (TU-Wien, Austria)</li>\n<li>Amy Felty (Co-Chair, University of Ottawa, Canada)</li>\n<li>Maribel Fernandez (King's College London, UK)</li>\n<li>Sara Kalvala (University of Warwick, UK)</li>\n<li>Delia Kesner (Université Paris Diderot, France)</li>\n<li>Ursula Martin (University of Oxford, UK)</li>\n<li>Valeria de Paiva (Co-Chair, Nuance, USA)</li>\n<li>Catuscia Palamidessi (École Polytechnique, France)</li>\n<li>Brigitte Pientka (Co-Chair, McGill University, Canada)</li>\n<li>Elaine Pimentel (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil)</li>\n<li>Giselle Reis (Carnegie Mellon University, Qatar)</li>\n<li>Simona Ronchi Della Rocca (Università degli Studi di Torino, Italy)</li>\n<li>Alexandra Silva (University College London, UK)</li>\n<li>Perdita Stevens (University of Edinburgh, UK)</li>\n<li>Valeria Vignudelli (Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, France)</li>\n</ul>",
