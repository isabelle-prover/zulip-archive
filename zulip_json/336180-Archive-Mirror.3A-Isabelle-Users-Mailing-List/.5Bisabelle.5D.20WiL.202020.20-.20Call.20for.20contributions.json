Its main purpose is to promote the excellent<br>\nresearch done by women, with the ultimate goal of increasing their<br>\nvisibility and representation in the community. Our aim is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>provide a platform for female researchers to share their work and<br>\n achievements;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>increase the feelings of community and belonging, especially among<br>\n junior faculty, post-docs and students through positive interactions<br>\n with peers and more established faculty;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>establish new connections and collaborations;</p>\n</li>\n<li>foster a welcoming culture of mutual support and growth within the<br>\nlogic research community.<br>\nWe believe these aspects will benefit women working in logic and computer<br>\nscience, particularly early-career researchers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previous versions of Women in Logic (Reykjavik, Iceland 2017,<br>\nOxford, UK 2018 and Vancouver, Canada 2019) were very successful<br>\nin showcasing women's work and as catalysts for recognition of the<br>\nneed for change in the community.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to: automata<br>\ntheory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,<br>\nconcurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,<br>\nconstructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,<br>\ndescription logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects<br>\nof program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,<br>\ngames and logic, higher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi,<br>\nlinear logic, logic in artificial intelligence, logic programming,<br>\nlogical aspects of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational<br>\ncomplexity, logical aspects of quantum computation, logical<br>\nframeworks, logics of programs, modal and temporal logics, model<br>\nchecking, probabilistic systems, process calculi, programming language<br>\nsemantics, proof theory, real-time systems, reasoning about security<br>\nand privacy, rewriting, type systems and type theory, and<br>\nverification.</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>\nTBA</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\nAbstract submission deadline: April 22, 2020<br>\nNotification: May 21, 2020</p>\n<p>SUBMISSIONS<br>\nAbstracts should be written in English (1-2 pages),<br>\nand prepared using the Easychair style<br>\n(<a href=\"https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors\">https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors\">https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors</a>&gt;).</p>\n<p>The abstracts should be uploaded to the WiL 2020 Easychair page<br>\nas a PDF file  (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2020\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2020</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2020\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2020</a>&gt;)<br>\nbefore the submission deadline of April 22, 2020, anywhere on Earth.</p>\n<p>ORGANIZING AND PROGRAM COMMITTEE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sandra Alves (Co-chair, University of Porto)</li>\n<li>Amy Felty (University of Ottawa)</li>\n<li>Delia Kesner (Université de Paris)</li>\n<li>Sandra Kiefer (Co-chair, RWTH Aachen University) </li>\n<li>Koko Muroya (RIMS Kyoto University)</li>\n<li>Daniele Nantes (University of Brasília)</li>\n<li>Valeria de Paiva (Samsung Research America)</li>\n<li>Brigitte Pientka (McGill University)</li>\n<li>Sonja Smets (ILLC - University of Amsterdam)</li>\n<li>Ana Sokolova (Co-chair, University of Salzburg)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>",
