Please I am finding it difficult to get the installation pack for<br>\nwidows 32 I can only get the 64 bit version which does not instal on 32 bit<br>\nversion. I would be grateful if you can help out. Thanks<br>\nOkonkwo Chidi</p>",

Also note that<br>\n32bit has a hard limit of approx. 3.5 GB memory, but Isabelle requires a<br>\nbit more than that.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, you can go back to an older Isabelle release where 32bit<br>\nWindows was still supported and make some small experiments with it,<br>\ne.g. see <a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2017\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2017</a></p>\n<p>If you only have old hardware and cannot replace that easily, I<br>\nrecommend to delete Windows and install a version of Linux specifically<br>\nfor low resources, e.g. see<br>\n<a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/lightweight-linux-beginners\">https://itsfoss.com/lightweight-linux-beginners</a> -- Linux is more<br>\nefficient than Windows in the use of limited resources.</p>\n<p>Your CPU might be actually 64bit and you can use current 64bit Linux<br>\nwith current 64bit Isabelle. But a minimum of 4 GB memory is still<br>\nrequired, better 8 GB: you can buy extra memory rather cheaply for old<br>\ncomputers.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
