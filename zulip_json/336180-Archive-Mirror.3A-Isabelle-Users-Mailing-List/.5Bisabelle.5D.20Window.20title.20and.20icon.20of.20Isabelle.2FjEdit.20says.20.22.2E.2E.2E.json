It might be an easy fix to change<br>\nthe title to \"Isabelle/jEdit\" and to replace the icon with Isabelle's.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Christoph</p>",

Changing the default title of some jEdit \"view\" was <br>\nindeed very easy, which I have done in <br>\n<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/commits/6a35bc1ee210\">https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/commits/6a35bc1ee210</a></p>\n<p>Then I became more ambitious to polish the application icons and titles on <br>\nall platforms, so it converged to what was on Mac OS X already: the main <br>\nidentification is the distribution name, e.g. \"Isabelle2013-2\" and icons <br>\nare mostly that of Isabelle -- hopefully now smooth and properly scaled on <br>\nall OS versions in the portfolio (as of Isabelle2013-2-RC3).</p>\n<p>jEdit as the underlying text editor pops up its own identity and branding <br>\noccasionally, so users should get some idea about this Jekyll &amp; Hyde <br>\nsituation.  The Isabelle/jEdit manual provides further clues about what <br>\n\"jEdit\" is (with links to its fine manuals) and what the additions of <br>\n\"Isabelle/jEdit\" actually are.  This is practically relevant to find out <br>\nabout the full potential of the combination, and to discuss problems and <br>\nlimitations in the proper department.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
