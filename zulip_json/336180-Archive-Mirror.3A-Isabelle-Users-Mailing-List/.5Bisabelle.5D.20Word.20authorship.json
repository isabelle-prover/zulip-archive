IMHO these are:</p>\n<p>1) HOL-Word (in the distribution)<br>\n    Authors: a couple (according to theory file headers)</p>\n<p>2) Word_Lib (in the AFP)<br>\n    Authors: many (according to official AFP meta data)</p>\n<p>3) Native_Word (in the AFP)<br>\n    Authors: one plus one contributor (according to official AFP<br>\n          meta data)</p>\n<p>1) and 2) are collections around word types, whereas 3) has a particular<br>\nfocus, an observation which is based both on content and the number of<br>\nothers.</p>\n<p>2) and 3) have a tendency to augment developments from HOL-Word or other<br>\nHOL sessions in order to serve a certain purpose better.  An example:<br>\nNative_Word provides code equations for symbolic computation of bit<br>\noperations on ints, something which is typically directly provided by<br>\nthe corresponding session.</p>\n<p>In the past this has already led to a silent spreading of material from<br>\n2) and 3) to 1), without a particular attribution of authorship.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, it is not so uncommon that scattered generic material<br>\nfrom AFP entries (often organized in theories named More_*, Auxiliary,<br>\nPreliminaries, …) finds its way to the distribution.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, this time the restructuring might turn out more<br>\nextensive in the end and deserve more explicit attribution of<br>\nauthorship: one idea is that eventually HOL-Word vanishes into two or<br>\nthree library theories in the distribution and special operations end up<br>\nin Word_Lib (caveat: this is just an idea).</p>\n<p>What do the authors of these sessions think?</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/EOO9lyQPeuA7X1KIWyVQQQUH/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",

From my side, it's <br>\nperfectly fine if auxiliary material from Native_Word moves into the Isabelle distribution <br>\nin whatever form. If you want to move the whole AFP entry into the distribution, then <br>\nthat's also fine with me, but then I'd like to be mentioned in the theory headers. The <br>\nmain reason for creating Native_Word as an AFP entry in the first place was that the <br>\ncode_printing declarations therein enlarge the trusted code base. So even if Native_Word <br>\nmoves as a whole into the distribution, I think it would still be good to keep it separate <br>\nfrom the rest of the HOL-Word formalization.</p>\n<p>IIRC Peter Lammich's contribution to Native_Word is essentially contained in the Uint type <br>\nof unspecified bit size.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",

Indeed my hope is that there is<br>\nroom for movement in the opposite direction: move specialized material<br>\nfrom the distribution into the AFP.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n    Florian<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/AZXQokaXqdzpWrt21ZG9hjEJ/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
