WordMain.thy was renamed to Word.thy between the 2008 and the 2009 <br>\nrelease: <a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/d9294387ab0e\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/d9294387ab0e</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And now more specific:</p>\n<p>3) Why does<br>\ntypes word32 = \"32 word\"<br>\ngive an inner syntax error? it is the first line after \"begin\" in<br>\nWordExamples.thy and i thought this should work out of the box.<br>\nWhere could be my mistake?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When you open WordExamples.thy with the normal HOL image loaded, then <br>\nIsabelle picks \"Library/Word.thy\" by default when you say \"imports <br>\nWord\". This is another, incompatible, development.</p>\n<p>You can either manually adapt the import and write</p>\n<p>imports \"~~/src/HOL/Word/Word\"</p>\n<p>or your built the HOL-Word image, which contains HOL and the Word <br>\nlibrary. To do this, go to <del>/src/HOL where </del> is your Isabelle <br>\ninstallation path, and run</p>\n<p>isabelle make HOL-Word</p>\n<p>After that you can select the image in Proof General under \"Isabelle -&gt; <br>\nLogics\".</p>\n<p>Hope this helps,</p>\n<p>Alex</p>",

Another renaming of theories back to the old one (it's not that much fun to fix things back and forth) or a renaming of Library/Word or big warning letters in HOL/Word/Word.thy and WordExamples.thy? </p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<p>ps: theory name spaces anyone? ;-)</p>",
