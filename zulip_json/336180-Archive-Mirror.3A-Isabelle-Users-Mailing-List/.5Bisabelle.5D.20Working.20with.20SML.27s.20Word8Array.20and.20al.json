There use to be an  <br>\n<code>Efficient_nat</code> theory, which is not there any more. According to  <br>\n<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2013-2/NEWS\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2013-2/NEWS</a> , it was replaced by  <br>\n<code>Code_Target_Int</code>, <code>Code_Binary_Nat</code>, <code>Code_Target_Nat</code> and  <br>\n<code>Code_Target_Numeral</code>.</p>",
