Its aim is the exchange<br>\nof experiences and ideas for pushing these technologies further into<br>\nthe mainstream: to explore methods or tools from ATP that could be<br>\nbenefit ITP and vice versa; to advance the integration and convergence<br>\nof these technologies, e.g., by considering tools and techniques from<br>\nmathematics, programming languages or AI; to bring ATP and ITP work<br>\nflows closer to mathematical and engineering practice.</p>\n<p>Workshop topics include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>proof automation for ITP: from tactics and decision procedures <br>\n  via FOL to fragments of CoC and HOL; ATP with types and data types;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ATP with large data sets (as generated by ITP systems): machine <br>\n  learning and other AI approaches, proof management;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>theory hierarchies in ITP/ATP systems: their design and management;<br>\n  ideas and techniques from mathematics and programming;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>use and user experience: ATP/ITP uses and integrations in fields<br>\n  like formalised mathematics or hardware/software verification.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Invited speakers (joint with the PxTP workshop):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bart Jacobs (KU Leuven, Belgium)</li>\n<li>Georges Gonthier (Microsoft Research - Inria)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions: To foster discussions, we ask for submissions of extended<br>\nabstracts of 2 to 4 pages as well as for full papers of at most 15<br>\npages. If submissons are based on previously published material that<br>\nshould be stated clearly. Presentations will be selected based on the<br>\nquality of their contribution and their relevance to the workshop.<br>\nAll accepted submissions will be published online at the workshop web<br>\nsite. Quality of submissions permitting, we are planning their<br>\nconsidation for a journal special issue after the workshop. Papers<br>\nmust be submitted via EasyChair.</p>\n<p>Important dates:</p>\n<p>Abstract submission: May 15, 2015 (<em>extended</em>)<br>\nPaper submission: May 22, 2015 (<em>extended</em>)<br>\nNotification: June 16, 2015<br>\nFinal Version: June 25, 2015<br>\nWorkshop: August 2, 2015</p>\n<p>Program committee:</p>\n<p>Christoph Benzmüller<br>\nNicolai Bjørner<br>\nSimon Foster<br>\nMike Gordon<br>\nTim Griffin<br>\nSebastiaan Joosten<br>\nChantal Keller<br>\nGerwin Klein<br>\nAssia Mahboubi<br>\nAndrei Paskevich<br>\nStephan Schulz</p>\n<p>Organisers:</p>\n<p>Damien Pous (ENS Lyon, France) <br>\nGeorg Struth (University of Sheffield, UK) <br>\nTjark Weber (Uppsala University, Sweden)</p>",
