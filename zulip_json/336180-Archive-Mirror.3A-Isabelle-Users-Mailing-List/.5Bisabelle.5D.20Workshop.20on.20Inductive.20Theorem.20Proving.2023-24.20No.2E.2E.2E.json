In addition to talks we hope for a lot of interaction between participants and an opportunity to actually try out some of the available theorem provers. There will be demos and tutorials on some of the current inductive theorem proving systems: Dafny (Rustan Leino, Microsoft Research), HipSpec (Dan Rosen et al. Chalmers) and Zeno (Will Sonnex et al, Imperial/Cambridge). We would also welcome talks on challenging problems for inductive provers as well as new directions of research.</p>\n<p>Registration is by email to Sophia Drossopoulou: s.drossopoulou@imperial.ac.uk&lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:s.drossopoulou@imperial.ac.uk\">s.drossopoulou@imperial.ac.uk</a>&gt;.
