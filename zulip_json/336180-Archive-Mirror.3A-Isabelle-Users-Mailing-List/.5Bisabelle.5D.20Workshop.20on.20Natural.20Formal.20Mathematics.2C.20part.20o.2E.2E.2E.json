If <br>\nformal mathematics is to become part of mainstream mathematics, its <br>\nformalizations and user experience have to become more \"natural\". This <br>\nworkshop broadly addresses the issue of naturality in formal mathematics.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<p>The notion of naturality in mathematics generally<br>\n     Natural input and output languages for formal mathematics systems<br>\n     Parsing natural mathematical language<br>\n     Controlled natural languages (CNL) for mathematics<br>\n     Making formal mathematics documents readable<br>\n     Naturality of foundational theories (types, sets, HOL, ...)<br>\n     Naturality of proof methods<br>\n     Natural proof structures and granularities<br>\n     Natural structurings of formalized mathematical texts and libraries<br>\n     Mathematical type setting (LaTeX) and formal mathematics<br>\n     Examples of natural formalizations</p>\n<p>Invited speaker: tba</p>\n<p>Submissions: We call for submissions of extended abstracts and <br>\ndemonstration proposals presenting work related to the workshop's topics <br>\nof interest. To promote Natural Formal Mathematics unfinished or <br>\nexploratory work will also be welcome. Electronic submission is done <br>\nthrough EasyChair. Extended abstracts and demonstration proposals should <br>\nbe 1 page, formatted in LaTeX using the style onecolceurws.</p>\n<p>Submission deadline: June 15 2020<br>\n     Notification of acceptance: July 01 2020</p>\n<p>Accepted papers and demonstrations should be presented online and live, <br>\nto allow for questions and discussions. Abstracts will be made available <br>\nonline.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Florian Rabe, Erlangen (co-chair)<br>\n     Peter Koepke, Bonn (co-chair)<br>\n     Merlin Carl, Flensburg<br>\n     Marcos Cramer, Dresden<br>\n     Adam Grabowski, Bialystok<br>\n     Michael Junk, Konstanz<br>\n     Cezary Kaliszyk, Innsbruck<br>\n     Andrea Kohlhase, Neu-Ulm<br>\n     Aarne Ranta, Gothenburg<br>\n     Josef Urban, Prague</p>",
