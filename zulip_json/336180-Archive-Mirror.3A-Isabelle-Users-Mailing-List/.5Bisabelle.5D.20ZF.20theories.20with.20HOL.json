I found this in func.thy under ZF which define<br>\nfunctions, function space and many other stuff. The problem is I need to<br>\nuse HOL as well and I couldn't becuase they are different platform. So is<br>\nthere such away to connect between ZF and HOL? or I should redefine this<br>\nfunc theory in HOL which too hard. I found that there is HOL-ZF logic<br>\nsession but I'm not sure if it include definitions like in func theory in<br>\nZF.</p>\n<p>Regards</p>\n<p>Omar</p>",
