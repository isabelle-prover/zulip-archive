He was 79. Manna was a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery and was a pioneer in the use of formal methods for automated reasoning, verification, and synthesis, on which subjects he authored or co-authored nine books. He served on the faculties of the Weizmann Institute and Stanford University for many years and was recipient of Guggenheim and Fullbright fellowships and of the Herbrand Award for distinguished contributions to automated reasoning. He is survived by his wife of half a century, Nitza, children, Irit, Hagit, Yonit, and Amit, and five grandchildren, and by his 29 doctoral students. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him.</p>",
