Istallation \"Isabelle Text\" and choosing it as a font (in Tools &gt; Options &gt; Fonts) did not help, ans I did not notice any reaction at all.</p>\n<p>Aften this, I wanted to turn off Unicode Tokens at all (In Emacs Proof General I can choose Proof General &gt; Options &gt; Unicode Tokens to turn off), but I did not find a way how to do this.</p>\n<p>In general, it is hard to find the analogy for most of commands from Proof General Menue. For example, I often use sledgehammer (Isabeele &gt; Commands &gt; Sledgehammer), show and hide types (Isabelle &gt; Settings &gt; Show types), do search (Proof general &gt; Find theorems), etc. Some of this actions (like search in the whole library) are crutial. How to do the same in I3P?</p>\n<p>Sincerely, <br>\nBogdan.</p>",
