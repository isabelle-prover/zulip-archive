In particular, if a rewrite rule contains a conditional  <br>\nexpression (that is, if-then-else) then Isabelle will automatically  <br>\nperform a case split on the condition during simplification.  <br>\nSometimes, both cases will be presented to you; at other times,  <br>\nIsabelle may succeed in proving one of the cases and present you with  <br>\nthe other one. That is what you are seeing.</p>\n<p>It might help if you went through the examples in the tutorial.<br>\nLarry Paulson</p>",
