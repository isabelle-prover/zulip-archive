I have found<br>\nfunctions Transfer.transfer_raw_add and Transfer.transfer_raw_del, but I've<br>\nrealised that there must have been some renaming of the theorems when they<br>\nwhere added to the database of transfer rules, because the name I gave to<br>\nthe theorems when declaring them doesn't work to add or remove them. So<br>\nwhat names can I use to access them?</p>\n<p>I'm thinking that it's not just the name, but that something else has to be<br>\ndone to the transfer rules to be usable by the transfer engine (adding<br>\nTransfer.Rel to rules that relate two constants?). This probably means that<br>\nif I want to add the rules at the ML level I also have to do that first. Am<br>\nI on the right track?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n<p>Daniel</p>",

E.g.,<br>\nLocal_Theory.note ((Binding.empty, [transfer_attr]), [transfer_rule])<br>\nwhere transfer_attr = Attrib.internal (K Transfer.transfer_add).</p>\n<p>If you are in a global context, you can use Thm.attribute_declaration. <br>\n(e.g., Thm.attribute_declaration Transfer.transfer_add transfer_rule).</p>\n<p>Ondrej</p>",
