But I don't even know how to begin to<br>\nprove that (exactly) one of them other than H intersects H at h.</p>\n<p>Part of my problem is that I'm working through a learning curve for<br>\nIsabelle and a separate learning curve for analysis, and I'm not sure which<br>\none I'm struggling with at any given time.</p>\n<p>Can anyone offer some advice here?

Maybe that won't be hard?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1. Generalize your proof to any CW-complex (these are generalizations<br>\n   of graphs). To implement this one in Isabelle/HOL require more coffee than<br>\n   the graph theoretical version, but it is conceptually simpler than its<br>\n   particular case for the polytopes.</p>\n<p>Okay, but I don't understand what CW-complex is. I don't understand any of<br>\nthe following terms yet: homotopy, closed ball, attaching map, covered,<br>\nHausdorf space, homeomorphism, boundary... Those are just from the first<br>\ntwo paragraphs on the wikipedia description. I do believe you when you say<br>\nthat it's easier to express these ideas with CW complexes, but...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a way, this <em>seems</em> like it's sort of like saying: the program I want to<br>\nwrite in C would be easier to express in ML, but I only have access to a C<br>\ncompiler, so in order to express things in that nice elegant way, I have to<br>\nfirst implement ML in C...</p>\n<p>Once the cost of implementing ML (or CW) is added to the budget, the \"hard\"<br>\nway probably turns out to be quicker.</p>\n<p>Am I wrong about this? Is there an introductory book about CW complexes<br>\nthat defines everything step by step that I could follow? Or...<br>\nalternatively, do you see this stuff already existing under different names<br>\nin Isabelle? Or... Do you feel like writing a CW-complex theory? :D</p>\n<p>(To be fair, the available language for discussing polytopes in Isabelle is<br>\nturning out to be pretty limited, too, but at least I have vague memories<br>\nof high school geometry to fall back on... )</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1.

For the hypercube,<br>\n   Euler formula is just a calculation that you can carry out by induction on<br>\n   the dimension.</p>\n<p>Let's say I get this far...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How can I demonstrate that a polytope has connected edges, the way a graph<br>\n(or presumably a CW complex) does?</p>\n<p>To me this means that two edges share a vertex, or two faces share an edge,<br>\nand so on in higher dimensions... Which is to say that they are adjacent,<br>\nand we're back to my original question: how to show that such things exist?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is some wisdom about proving theorems from Alexander Grothendieck<br>\nthat could be useful for computer scientists and programmers (I hope<br>\nsomeday some will write a book entitled Grothendieck for computer<br>\nscientists.).
