Is there a solution for this?</p>\n<p>I experimented with another idea to have each glossary entry an own<br>\nIsabelle theory file but I could not specify where exactly the file<br>\nshould be included in the proof document.</p>\n<p>Writing the dictionary entries as simple sections would not give me<br>\ncontrol of the typesetting if I want to change it for each entry<br>\nlater, globally.</p>\n<p>Do you see a neat solution here?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gergely</li>\n</ul>",
