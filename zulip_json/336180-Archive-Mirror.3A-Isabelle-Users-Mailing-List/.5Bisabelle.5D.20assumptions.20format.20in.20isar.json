But, if there is nothing to simplify, the trick does not <br>\nwork. I can use the \"apply insert\" within isar proofs, but it's not so <br>\nnice :-)</p>\n<p>Does anyone have an idea how I can put the hypotheses within the goal <br>\n(another trick like \"apply simp\" that would work even if there is <br>\nnothing to simplify would work :-) ?</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Julien</p>",
