No I <br>\nhave my own closure operation on sets that is also transitive and I <br>\nwould like transitivity to be applied automatically to. So how do I set <br>\nup a corresponding lemma (and how was it down for _^*)?</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>christian</p>",

The set up  <br>\nis at the end of ~~/src/HOL/Transitive_Closure.thy.  The solver is  <br>\nneeded since transitivity rules normally make the simplifier loop.</p>\n<p>In order to configure it for your own closure operation, you need to  <br>\nsupply the right lemmas and a function decomp, which identifies  <br>\nsuitable assumptions in the subgoal.  Follow the instructions in ~~/ <br>\nsrc/Provers/trancl.ML.  Get in touch if there are questions (or if  <br>\nyour transitivity hold relative to a locale).</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Clemens</p>",
