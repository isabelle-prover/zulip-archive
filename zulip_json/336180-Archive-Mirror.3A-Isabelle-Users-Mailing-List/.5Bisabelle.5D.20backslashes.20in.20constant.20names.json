When I try, say, to declare <br>\n(in HOL)</p>\n<p>constdefs<br>\n   \"\\in\"  :: \"['a, 'a set] =&gt; bool\"     (infixl 50)<br>\n   \"a \\in S == a:S\"</p>\n<p>Isabelle complains about a bad escape character. However, it will <br>\nswallow the definition if I write \"\\\\in\" (and the output will show <br>\n\"\\in\"). Now, when I try to do something similar in Pure, the output will <br>\nbe \"\\\\in\", and the PDF document shows the constant name as ``in.</p>\n<p>Should I consider backslashes to be disallowed (as a strict reading of <br>\nsection 7.2.2 of the reference manual seems to indicate)?</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Stephan</p>",
