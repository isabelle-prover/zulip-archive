You can also see that <br>\nboth balls were eliminated by auto in</p>\n<p>from foo have \"(f 0) ∨ (f 1)\" using abset0 abset1 by (auto)</p>\n<p>But when I try to prove the last line, I get</p>\n<p>Failed to apply initial proof method:<br>\nusing this:<br>\n    ∀a∈abset. ∀b∈abset. f a ∨ f b<br>\n    0 ∈ abset<br>\n    1 ∈ abset<br>\ngoal (1 subgoal):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>f 0 ∨ f 1</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, this would not work</p>\n<p>from foo have \"(f 0) ∨ (f 1)\" using abset0 abset1 ..</p>\n<p>So I wonder: what are the proof and the .. commands doing that they can <br>\nsuccessfully deal with one ball but not with two consecutive applications of <br>\nwhatever rule they are using? And what rule (or rules) are they using in the <br>\nsuccessful cases? (It would be good in general to have a way to ask Isar what <br>\nit has done in one step, this has been brought up before in this list[0].) If <br>\nyou could give me an example in an apply-style proof of what rules are being <br>\napplied and how, that would be great.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>\n<p>[0] <a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2015-August/\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/htdig/cl-isabelle-users/2015-August/</a><br>\nmsg00166.html</p>",
