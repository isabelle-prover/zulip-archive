What we need is a proper POSIX kill command, <br>\notherwise we could have used MinGW bash today -- it is a native Windows <br>\nprogram. Poly/ML 5.6, which is used in Isabelle2016, is already native on <br>\nWindows. Cygwin is mainly used for add-on tools, like the ATPs for <br>\nSledgehammer.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
