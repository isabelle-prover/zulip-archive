I remember HOL4 theorem prover have good support in bdd.</p>\n<p>I know Schirmer's formal account and proof of bdd normalization, but it seems that this formalization does not fit my need well.</p>\n<p>what I need: semantically judge whether a boolean function is equal to False; besides, I also need know its structure:<br>\nwhether it is a Var or boolean conjunction, or disjunction.</p>\n<p>In short, a bdd formalization should be a normal form of boolean functions.</p>\n<p>If you are intersting, please see the attcahed paper, please see fig1 and 3. I want to formalize and prove these algorithms.<br>\nwhat I need is the support for such an formalization.</p>\n<p>regards </p>\n<p>Yongjian Li<br>\nLaboratory of Computer Science<br>\nInstitute of Software<br>\nChinese Academy of Sciences<br>\nP.O.Box 8718, Beijing 100080<br>\nP.R.

A <br>\ndescription of it is given in a paper published in FM'2012:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.irit.fr/~Mathieu.Giorgino/Publications/GiSt2012BDD.html\">http://www.irit.fr/~Mathieu.Giorgino/Publications/GiSt2012BDD.html</a></p>\n<p>The only available version on this page is still Isabelle 2011 but we <br>\nalso have updated it for Isabelle 2012, and we plan to submit it to the <br>\nAFP sooner or later.</p>\n<p>It is based on the Imperative_HOL theory provided in the Isabelle/HOL's <br>\nlibrary and thus uses a monad to model the imperative statements.</p>\n<p>It also uses the Isabelle Collection Framework available on the AFP.</p>\n<p>I hope it will correspond to your wishes. Please ask any further <br>\nquestion you could have about it.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mathieu</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IRIT, Universit√© Paul Sabatier<br>\nToulouse, France</p>",
