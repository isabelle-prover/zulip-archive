In contrast, the non-strict version, \"linear_order_on\", <em>does</em> make this restriction.</p>\n<p>In which case, can I propose that the definition be updated to (something like): </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>definition \"NEW_strict_linear_order_on A r ≡ strict_linear_order_on A r ∧ (r ⊆ A × A)\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On another, slightly-related, matter -- I was hoping to find a lemma capturing the \"order-extension principle\". Something a bit like:</p>\n<p>\"if p is a strict partial order on A, then there exists a strict linear order on A that is a superset of p\". [I haven't formulated this very precisely, but can do.]</p>\n<p>This doesn't immediately appear to be in the HOL library, but seems an obvious candidate for inclusion. Did I miss it somewhere under a different name?</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nJohn</p>",

The \"_on\" suffix means different things <br>\nin \"refl_on\" and \"total_on\", which is the source of your complaint. I'll have to <br>\nfigure out if the difference is intentional (I suspect it was) and if it can be <br>\nabolished. For \"strict_linear_order_on\" it is probably not hard, because that <br>\none is hardly used, but \"total_on\" is a diffent matter...</p>\n<p>This may take a little while.</p>\n<p>Tobias<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/E3zEFHO3m5XeGFQLzaAEZcZE/smime.p7s\">smime.p7s</a></p>",
