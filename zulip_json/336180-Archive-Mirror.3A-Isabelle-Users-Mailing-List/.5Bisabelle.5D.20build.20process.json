I also run several versions of Isabelle which <br>\nleads to confusion about which heaps go with which version. The solution <br>\nI use is to make a directory \"~/isabelle/etc\" and in there make a file <br>\ncalled \"settings\", which contains the following:</p>\n<p>ISABELLE_OUTPUT=\"$ISABELLE_HOME/heaps\"<br>\nISABELLE_BROWSER_INFO=\"$ISABELLE_HOME/browser_info\"</p>\n<p>Isabelle automatically looks in this directory for this file when it <br>\nstarts up and makes Isabelle use the heaps into the <br>\n\"$ISABELLE_HOME/heaps\" directory. This should allow you to remove <br>\n\"~/isabelle/heaps\" directory and either rerun the build script, or use <br>\nisatool to remake your heap files; from now on the heap files used will <br>\ncorrespond to the version of isabelle you run. The heaps will be inside <br>\n\"$ISABELLE_HOME/heaps\".</p>\n<p>hope this helps,<br>\nlucas</p>\n<p>Jeremy Dawson wrote:</p>",
