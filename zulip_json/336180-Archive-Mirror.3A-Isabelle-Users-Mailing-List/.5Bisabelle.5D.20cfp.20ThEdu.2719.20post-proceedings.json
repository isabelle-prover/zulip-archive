Now <br>\n  postproceedings are planned to collect the contributions upgraded to <br>\n  full papers. The contributions' topics are diverse according to ThEdu's <br>\n  scope, and this is a call open for everyone, also those who did not <br>\n  participate in the workshop. All papers will undergo review according to <br>\n  EPTCS standards.</p>\n<p>THedu'19 Scope:</p>\n<p>Computer Theorem Proving is becoming a paradigm as well as a <br>\n  technologica base for a new generation of educational software in <br>\n  science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The workshop brings <br>\n  together experts in automated deduction with experts in education in <br>\n  order to further clarify the shape of the new software generation and to <br>\n  discuss existing systems.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>methods of automated deduction applied to checking students' input;</li>\n<li>\n<p>methods of automated deduction applied to prove post-conditions for<br>\n   particular problem solutions;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>combinations of deduction and computation enabling systems to propose <br>\n   next steps;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>automated provers specific for dynamic geometry systems;</p>\n</li>\n<li>proof and proving in mathematics education.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call for papers:            16 Sep 2019</li>\n<li>Submission (full papers):   18 Nov 2019</li>\n<li>Notification of acceptance: 16 Dec 2019</li>\n<li>Revised papers due:         20 Jan 2020</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<p>We welcome submission of papers presenting original unpublished work <br>\n  which is not been submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The authors should comply with the \"instructions for authors\", LaTeX<br>\n  style <br>\n  files and accept the \"Non-exclusive license to distribute\" of<br>\n  EPTCS: Instructions for authors (<a href=\"http://info.eptcs.org/\">http://info.eptcs.org/</a>) LaTeX style<br>\n  file and formatting instructions (<a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org/\">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>) Copyright <br>\n  (<a href=\"http://copyright.eptcs.org/\">http://copyright.eptcs.org/</a>)</p>\n<p>Papers should be submitted via easychair,   <br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu19\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thedu19</a>.</p>\n<p>In case the accepted contributions finally do not reach the standards of <br>\n  EPTCS in number, there will be an alternative to publish as a techreport <br>\n  at CISUC <a href=\"https://www.cisuc.uc.pt/publications\">https://www.cisuc.uc.pt/publications</a>.</p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<p>Francisco Botana, University of Vigo at Pontevedra, Spain<br>\n  João Marcos, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil<br>\n  Filip Maric, University of Belgrade, Serbia<br>\n  Adolfo Neto, Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná, Brazil<br>\n  Walther Neuper, Graz University of Technology, Austria (co-chair)<br>\n  Pedro Quaresma, University of Coimbra, Portugal (co-chair)<br>\n  Philippe R.
