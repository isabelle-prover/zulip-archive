If I well understood, this means<br>\nthat proofs cannot be done using either \"apply smt\" or \"by smt\" (please<br>\ncorrect me if I am wrong). This was also pointed out in Gerwin's Style<br>\nGuide (section: \"Do not use smt in proofs you need to maintain over longer<br>\ntime\"): <a href=\"http://proofcraft.org/blog/isabelle-style.html\">http://proofcraft.org/blog/isabelle-style.html</a></p>\n<p>(i) Is there an automatic way to change \"smt\" by some automatic reasoning<br>\ninternal to Isabelle, e.g., metis, auto, simp?</p>\n<p>(ii) In case of a negative answer for (i), which are the steps \"by hand\"<br>\nrecommended for such a task?</p>\n<p>Sincerely yours,<br>\nJosé M.</p>",

The result of <br>\nthis command depends on external tools that are not under our control <br>\nand may stop working in the future.\"</p>\n<p>This was removed in commit 48c7802 (afp-devel) by Gerwin Klein.</p>\n<p>I am curious why this is no longer a necessity? As I understood, the <br>\nreason was not the fact that the proof is not replayed (as in the case <br>\nof smt_oracle), but that the behavior of smt depends on Z3, and thus <br>\nbreaks easily when Z3 changes.</p>\n<p>Is my understanding correct? Has this situation changed? Or has merely <br>\nthe policy changed and the expectation is that smt proofs are just fixed <br>\nonce Z3 changes make them the smt proofs break?</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nDominique.</p>",

The policy has changed, because we were observing very few failures of this kind in other Isabelle code where we did not have the restriction, and this has been played out similarly on the AFP since we changed it. We are also changing Z3 versions less often than we used to. I.e. the benefit of allowing smt outweighs the drawbacks. </p>\n<p>I should probably update my style guide accordingly as well.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",

So if you have</p>\n<p>smt lemma_1 … lemma_n</p>\n<p>you can see if it still works with lemma_1 [of a b], where a and b are constants in your problem. Once you’ve done that, then insert </p>\n<p>using lemma_1 [of a b]</p>\n<p>and try sledgehammer again. You might get a much better proof.</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
