I do<br>\nnot know why when I try to read the manuals I meet always message of<br>\nerror. Thanks to tell me how to translate (1) in isar. That will help<br>\nme. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please consult the table of ascii equivalents of mathematical symbols in <br>\n  the appendix of the Tutorial on Isabelle/HOL.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The second question that I want to ask here is maybe very naive, but I<br>\ndo not feel shame. Is it possible to use isabelle just to check it a<br>\npropositional formula is intuionistically valid, or just classically<br>\nvalid? For example: can isabelle tell me that (p \\lor \\neg p) is not<br>\n(intuitionistically) valid? And what about first order intuitionist</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>apply iprover (* for intuitionistic logic *)<br>\napply blast   (* for classical logic *)</p>\n<p>Regards<br>\nTobias</p>",
