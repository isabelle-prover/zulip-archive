(axioms which ensures the existence of an infimum operation)<br>\nbegin<br>\n   definition<br>\n      \"inf_l a b = ...\"<br>\nend</p>\n<p>interpretation semilattice_inf \"op &lt;=\" \"op &lt;\" \"inf_l\";<br>\n   by ...</p>\n<p>The problem is now when I state some lemmas:</p>\n<p>lemma l1: \"inf_l (a:'a::A) b &lt;= a\"<br>\nlemma (in A) l2: \"inf_l a b &lt;= a\"</p>\n<p>The first problem is that although lemmas l1 and l2 seem similar, they <br>\ncannot<br>\nbe applied in the same contexts. Lemma l2 seem more general than lemma l1.</p>\n<p>The second problem. The fact that inf_l is an infimum operation, given <br>\nby the<br>\ninterpretation,  is available when proving lemma l1, but not when <br>\nproving lemma l2.<br>\nHow should I state the interpretation such that it becomes available <br>\nwhen proving<br>\na lemma like l2?</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>Viorel Preoteasa</p>",
