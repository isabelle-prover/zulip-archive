We cannot really get rid of \"norm :: complex\", we<br>\ncan only \"hide\" it by an abbreviation (as it is done now).</p>\n<p>I for one think that even in light of this new information, \"cmod\"<br>\nprobably does more harm than good. The term \"modulus (of a complex<br>\nnumber)\" is definitely being used, but so is \"norm (of a complex number)\".</p>\n<p>I still find \"cmod\" a lot more cryptic than \"norm\", and just for the<br>\nsake of uniformity it makes sense to just call it \"norm\".</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",

The return type of this function is polymorphic, so we have the abbreviation</p>\n<p>abbreviation indicat_real :: \"'a set ⇒ 'a ⇒ real\" where \"indicat_real S ≡ indicator S”</p>\n<p>to cover the common case where the return value should have type real.
