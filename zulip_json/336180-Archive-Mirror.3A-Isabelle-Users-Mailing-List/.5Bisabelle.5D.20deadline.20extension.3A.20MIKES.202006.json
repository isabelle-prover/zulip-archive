Despite a<br>\nperiod of low popularity a decade ago, there is a new realisation, in<br>\nacademia and industry, of the usefulness of microkernels. This is<br>\nespecially true in the embedded systems domain where the reduced size<br>\nand increased dependability of microkernel-based systems have made<br>\nthem particularly attractive. The MIKES workshop will bring together<br>\nresearchers and developers from industry and academia to discuss</p>\n<p>* emerging novel concepts,<br>\n    * analysis approaches, and<br>\n    * case studies</p>\n<p>in the area of microkernels.</p>\n<p>MIKES 2006 seeks papers that describe original research in the area of<br>\nmicrokernels. This includes but is not limited to:</p>\n<p>* case studies<br>\n    * real-time behaviour<br>\n    * temporal analysis<br>\n    * formal/functional verification<br>\n    * portability<br>\n    * API proposals<br>\n    * security and safety</p>\n<p>Papers describing new ideas, promising approaches, experiences with<br>\npractical systems are considered particularly appropriate. Papers will<br>\nbe 6 pages in IEEE conference paper format. The material must be<br>\nunpublished and not under submission elsewhere. Proceedings will be<br>\npublished as a technical report by National ICT Australia (NICTA).</p>\n<p>Submission Procedure</p>\n<p>Papers and abstracts should be submitted electronically at<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.easychair.org/MIKES2006/\">http://www.easychair.org/MIKES2006/</a>. Papers can be in PDF or<br>\npostscript format.</p>\n<p><strong>* Pre-submission of abstracts is required. </strong>*</p>\n<p>Abstracts are submitted by ticking the \"Abstract Only\" box at the<br>\nbottom of the new submission form. Updated abstracts and papers<br>\nthemselves are submitted by updating the original submission.</p>\n<p>Note: Extension to deadlines</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>Abstract submission deadline: May 22nd<br>\n    Paper Submission deadline: May 27th<br>\n    Notification of acceptance: June 12th<br>\n    Camera ready papers: July 7th</p>\n<p>Organisers</p>\n<p>Gernot Heiser, NICTA/UNSW, Australia<br>\n    Stefan M.
