From the command line, you can specify the -p option to point to any emacs client. For example,</p>\n<p>/Applications/Isabelle2011.app/Isabelle/bin/isabelle emacs -p /Applications/Isabelle2009-2.app/Contents/Resources/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs</p>\n<p>(all on one line) will launch Isabelle2011 with the Emacs from Isabelle2009-2, assuming the applications are installed at the same places as on my Mac (they should be by default).</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
