I would assume not at all, as it is not listed in [1] :-)</p>\n<p>In \"open inductive predicate\", you have to associate the words to the<br>\nright, i.e. \"open (inductive predicates)\". The idea is that you can<br>\nmodularize your inducrive predicates and inductive proofs, something<br>\nthat I often want to do when working with programming language<br>\nsemantics. There is not much deep theory, but rather it’s making the<br>\nobvious (namely that the cases of inductive proofs are independent)<br>\nexploitable. See [1] for more details (motivation, examples, user<br>\nguide).</p>\n<p>In your entry, if I am not mistaken, \"open\" refers to topology.</p>\n<p>Greetings,<br>\nJoachim</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"http://pp.ipd.kit.edu/uploads/publikationen/molitor15masterarbeit.pdf\">http://pp.ipd.kit.edu/uploads/publikationen/molitor15masterarbeit.pdf</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/YfLW2ZNhNSZ4grRVMe9_IrMg/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>",
