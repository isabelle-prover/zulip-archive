When I do \"isabelle build\" (on Isabelle2013-RC1), the generated pdf includes only those theories for which I did not specify [document = false] in my ROOT file.</p>\n<p>However, the generated html pages include <em>all</em> the theories together. I would like to have just <em>my</em> theories listed on the index.html page, and any references to third-party theories linking to their respective pages at <a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/library/HOL/\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/library/HOL/</a>. Could somebody kindly explain how to achieve this?</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\njohn</p>",

For instance, each occurrence of \\&lt;oplus&gt; comes out nicely as ⊕ in both the pdf output and the html output, but \\&lt;rightharpoonup&gt; comes out as ⇀ in the pdf output and as \\&lt;rightharpoonup&gt; in the html output. How can I this and other symbols print nicely in the html output? </p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\njohn</p>",
