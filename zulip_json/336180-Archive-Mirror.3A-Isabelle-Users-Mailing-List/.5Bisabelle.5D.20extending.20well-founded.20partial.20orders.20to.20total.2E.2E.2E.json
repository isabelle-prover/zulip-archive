(I shall only use the fact that the original relation R is wellfounded.)</p>\n<p>Imagine R as a forest, having the minimal elements as roots of the trees and having the branches of the trees possibly crossing each other.  We traverse this forest in a breadth-first way by transfinite induction and wellorder it \"on levels\" by performing the following steps on a state consisting of a wellorder W.  </p>\n<p>1) Start with W = {}</p>\n<p>2) In the successor case: Get the set M of minimal elements of R that are not in (the field of) W, and let V be a well-order on M. Take W' to be the concatenation (ordinal sum) of W and V.  </p>\n<p>3) In the limit case: Take the union: the result is a wellorder, since the chain involved in the union has the property that each element is not only a subset, but also an initial segment of any later one.  </p>\n<p>The final W has exhausted the whole R, hence it is the desired wellorder.  </p>\n<p>My AFP formalization ordinals</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Ordinals_and_Cardinals.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Ordinals_and_Cardinals.shtml</a></p>\n<p>(hopefully) provides the necessary ingredients: Initial segments in Wellorder_Embedding, ordinal sum in theory Constructions_on_Wellorders, and a transfinite recursion combinator (a small adaptation of the wellfounded combinator) in theory Wellorder_Relation. </p>\n<p>Best regards, <br>\n   Andrei </p>\n<p>--- On Fri, 1/18/13, <a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users-request@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users-request@lists.cam.ac.uk</a> &lt;<a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users-request@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users-request@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt; wrote:</p>\n<p>From: <a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users-request@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users-request@lists.cam.ac.uk</a> &lt;<a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users-request@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users-request@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt;<br>\nSubject: Cl-isabelle-users Digest, Vol 91, Issue 14<br>\nTo: <a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a><br>\nDate: Friday, January 18, 2013, 8:13 AM</p>\n<p>Send Cl-isabelle-users mailing list submissions to<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users@lists.cam.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p>To subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit<br>\n<a href=\"https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/cl-isabelle-users\">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/cl-isabelle-users</a><br>\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users-request@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users-request@lists.cam.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p>You can reach the person managing the list at<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:cl-isabelle-users-owner@lists.cam.ac.uk\">cl-isabelle-users-owner@lists.cam.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p>When replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific<br>\nthan \"Re: Contents of Cl-isabelle-users digest...\"</p>\n<p>Today's Topics:</p>\n<p>1.
