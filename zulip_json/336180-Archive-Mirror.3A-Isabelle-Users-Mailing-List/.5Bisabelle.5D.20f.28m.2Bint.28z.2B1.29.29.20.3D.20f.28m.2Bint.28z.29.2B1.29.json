But there must be a simple <br>\nproof of this somewhere, because, when I ask if the two arguments of <br>\nf are equal, like this:<br>\nlemma \"(m+int(z+1)) = (m+int(z)+1)\" try0<br>\nthen that is true by simp. Surely if e1=e2, then we must have <br>\nf(e1)=f(e2); indeed, if I enter:<br>\nlemma \"[|(e1::int)=e2|] ==&gt; f(e1)=f(e2)\" try0<br>\nthen that is also true by simp. I have been able to prove other facts <br>\nof the form (e1=e2 implies f(e1)=f(e2)) directly; for example, if I <br>\nenter<br>\nlemma \"f(m+int(Suc z)) = f(m+int(z+1))\" try0<br>\nthen that is again true by simp.<br>\nI have not used Find Theorems before, and perhaps I am misusing it. <br>\nWhen I enter:<br>\n\"f(_) = f(_)\"<br>\ninto the Find window, it says: Found nothing. When I enter:<br>\n\"_(_) = _(_)\"<br>\ninto the Find window, it says: Found 6934 theorem(s). When I enter:<br>\n\"_(_+_) = _(_+_)\"<br>\ninto the Find window, it says: Found 17 theorem(s); but I checked all <br>\n17, and none of them seem to be relevant.<br>\nAny help will be appreciated.
