Please see Philippa's email below for more details...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Dear all,</p>\n<p>I would like to draw your attention to a current  Imperial advert for six lectureships at <a href=\"http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/job-vacancies/\">http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/job-vacancies/</a>. The target areas for this year  are theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, software reliability, and hardware and systems; all should be interpreted widely. In addition, exceptional candidates in other areas are encouraged to apply.</p>\n<p>Deadline: 7th January 2019.</p>\n<p>This year, we have a good chance  to be able to hire in (some of) the theory theme, the programming language theme, and the analysis and verification theme in the Department. The target areas of theoretical computer science and software reliability link directly to these  themes.  Since I arrived at Imperial in 2001, there has not been a single target area associated with these themes, until now.</p>\n<p>We  have six lectureships available, rather than the usual one or two, due to a decision from  central Imperial to expand the Department.  This is a real opportunity, as there is much more flexibility than in previous years. I very much encourage excellent candidates to apply for these positions. </p>\n<p>Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me, or other academics in the Department, if you have any questions. </p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nPhilippa</p>",
