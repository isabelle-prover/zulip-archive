It is quite normal for processing to reach the end of the file even though significant parts of proofs are continuing to execute. You need to check that there is no red anywhere in the sidebar.

If ever there is an error in a theory, the whole  <br>\nprocess will fail. Most people want to at least produce a PDF file for  <br>\ntheir theories, so the theory is always checked this way.</p>\n<p>To understand all of this, you may have a look at “The Isabelle System  <br>\nManual” which is the file <code>doc/system.pdf</code>.</p>",

Humans see things which seems obvious to them (while sometimes  <br>\nare wrong, and that's why there are machine‑checked proofs) which machines  <br>\nso far can't easily see (while machines are a lot more exact than humans).  <br>\nWhen it happens, you can help it.</p>\n<p>When you feel something should be obvious according to a simple lemma, you  <br>\ncan search for it with the “Find” panel or test a more simpler proof to  <br>\nsee if Isabelle can solve it. If the “Find” panel is not visible, go to  <br>\n“Plugins -&gt; Isabelle -&gt; Find Panel” and it will show‑up.</p>\n<p>Here, may be you expected Isabelle to automatically swap the two sides of  <br>\nthe equality. If so, you wanted a the theorem like <code>A = B ==&gt; B = A</code>. If  <br>\nyou type <code>_ = _ ==&gt; _ = _</code> in the search bar of the Find panel and hit  <br>\nenter, you will see the first result is <code>HOL.sym</code>, which may be what you  <br>\nwant for this case. You then explicitly tell Isabelle to use <code>HOL.sym</code> in  <br>\nthe proof.</p>\n<p>The Find panel is a lot useful if you have a guess of what you need.</p>",
