For _ list, for example, none of the following commands find the functions <br>\ndefined by the datatype declaration in List.thy (in Isabelle2015):</p>\n<p>find_consts \"(_ ⇒ _) ⇒ _ list ⇒ _ list\" (* map not found *)<br>\nfind_consts \"(_ ⇒ _ ⇒ bool) ⇒ _ list ⇒ _ list ⇒ bool\" (* list_all2 not found *)<br>\nfind_consts \"_ list ⇒ _ set\" (* set not found *)</p>\n<p>Could this be changed such that find_consts can find them? I was puzzled today in our <br>\nIsabelle course when I wanted to search for map and find_consts simply did not show it.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
