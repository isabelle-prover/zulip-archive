That means if you state a<br>\nproposition with \"have\" or \"show\", it will run the proof (in your<br>\nexample, using \"by\") in the background. In order to increase<br>\nparallelism, it'll continue processing the remaining theory. It does<br>\nthat by optimistically assuming that the proof will proceed, hence<br>\n\"asserting\" the statement. To notify the user that there are still some<br>\npending proofs, Isabelle/jEdit uses the purple background.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is this a valid proof? Can I simply ignore this colouring?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, you can't. The system continues processing the rest of your theory<br>\nso that you can go on with your work, but that doesn't mean you can just<br>\nassume that everything still pending is ultimately correct.</p>\n<p>Obviously the system doesn't know how long it should wait for the proof<br>\nto complete. That's up to the user to decide.</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nLars</p>",
