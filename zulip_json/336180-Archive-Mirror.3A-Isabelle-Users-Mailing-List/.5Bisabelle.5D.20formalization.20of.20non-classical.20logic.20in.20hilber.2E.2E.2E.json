For now I only need a first-order variant (higher orders will be<br>\nneeded later) of an alternative to<br>\nMTL&lt;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_t-norm_logic\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_t-norm_logic</a>&gt;.<br>\nThis formalisation should be in Hilbert style (some axioms and one MP rule).</p>\n<p>I already tried to create the theory by taking the IFOL.thy and editing the<br>\nconnectives definitions and axioms according to my needs. Then I was able to<br>\nprove some basic theorems but it came out it is quite difficult to write and<br>\nhard to read these proofs since Isabelle's Pure is based on natural<br>\ndeduction and these proofs are in Hilbert calculus.</p>\n<p>My first decision was to prove many natural deduction rules which I then<br>\nwould provide to Isabelle's simplifier, but I think the simplifier is also<br>\nment for natural deduction style proofs and thus it would be useles in this<br>\ncase (?) (without some coding on the ML level).</p>\n<p>Then I got the idea to formalize the whole logic inside HOL since the<br>\nmeta-level of this logic is classical and HOL has many tools already set<br>\nup). But here I am not sure if the HOL's tools (like the simplifier)<br>\nwouldn't affect proving in my logic somehow unintentionally (turning some<br>\nunprovable goals into provable ones etc.).</p>\n<p>[Actual question]<br>\nNow I am not sure if it is wise to continue writing completely new logic<br>\nbased on Pure and setting the simplifier to fit this logic or if it would be<br>\nbetter (or at least possible) to make this formalization inside HOL.</p>\n<p>I add that this logic should later serve to formalization of Fuzzy Class<br>\nTheory &lt;<a href=\"http://www.mathfuzzlog.org/index.php/Fuzzy_Class_Theory\">http://www.mathfuzzlog.org/index.php/Fuzzy_Class_Theory</a>&gt;.</p>\n<p>The first attempt of the formalization is in the attached file. I am aware<br>\nthat the proofs are very bad, I am still learning how proving in Isabelle<br>\nreally works...</p>\n<p>Thanks for any advice, I will gladly provide more precise information if<br>\nneeded.</p>\n<p>Regards</p>\n<p>Tomas Beranek<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/PhdAx1aPs0JNX4N7q59BKjaj/MTL_Delta.thy\">MTL_Delta.thy</a></p>",
