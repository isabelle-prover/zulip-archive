One of the planned papers is an Isar tutorial.</p>\n<p>I would do this here in Hungary for family reasons and since I have the<br>\nnecessary infrastructure. </p>\n<p>Please let me know if you know any funding source that would support such a<br>\nscheme.</p>\n<p>I can send my research proposal upon request.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gergely</li>\n</ul>",
