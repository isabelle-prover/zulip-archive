If you <br>\nhave installed everything according to <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/installation.html\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/installation.html</a> (bottom part) then document <br>\npreparation should work as described in the Isabelle manuals.  See <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle/doc/system.pdf\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle/doc/system.pdf</a> chapter 3, or <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle/doc/isar-ref.pdf\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle/doc/isar-ref.pdf</a> chapter 4.</p>\n<p>(I've tried this a few months ago.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/faq.html\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/faq.html</a> i found <br>\nout it is possible to make a so called heap image.

Note that in contrast to what the FAQ <br>\nsuggests, the fundamental isabelle-process provides even more basic heap <br>\npersistence.  The system manual will tell you a few more things.  (In <br>\npractice the main problem will be to convince Proof General not to time <br>\nout and abort, while Isabelle is busy writing a heap image.)</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
