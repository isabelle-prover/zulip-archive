The system always gets stuck when it processes some thy file, and there are no warnings, no errors. It seems the system is just not responding. CPU usage is about 40-50%, memory is about 1.5G-3G. I have tried windows64 version 2016-1 and 2017, there's the same problem. The following is the screeshot</p>\n<p>The problem has confused me for a few days, I'll be very grateful if some experienced uses may kindly help me out.<br>\n      Thank you very much!<br>\n                                                                                              Guo Fan<br>\n                                                                                               2018.5.8<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/xxuAjQbcoYoX2xKlZpI9pMhz/A2DF918D4A2B8D42.0904F15A.jpg.jpg\">A2DF918D@4A2B8D42.0904F15A.jpg.jpg</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/xxuAjQbcoYoX2xKlZpI9pMhz/A2DF918D4A2B8D42.0904F15A.jpg.jpg\" title=\"A2DF918D@4A2B8D42.0904F15A.jpg.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/xxuAjQbcoYoX2xKlZpI9pMhz/A2DF918D4A2B8D42.0904F15A.jpg.jpg\"></a></div>",
