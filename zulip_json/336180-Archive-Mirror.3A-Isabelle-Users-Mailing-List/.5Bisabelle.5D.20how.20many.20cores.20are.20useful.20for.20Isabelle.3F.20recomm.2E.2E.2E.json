That is why I usually build heap images on a remote<br>\nworkstation and then rsync them over to my laptop (just 2 weeks ago<br>\nMakarius helped me to write an Isabelle tool that automates this, in<br>\ncase anybody is interested; currently this \"heap_copy\" tool---which<br>\nshould rather be named \"remote_build\"---is part of IsaFoR).</p>\n<p>The workstation has 12 CPUs (6 physical cores + hyperthreading) and 32GB<br>\nof RAM and as a corollary our setup is:</p>\n<p>ISABELLE_BUILD_OPTIONS=\"threads=12\"<br>\nISABELLE_BUILD_JAVA_OPTIONS=\"-Xms1024m -Xmx4096m -Xss4m\"</p>\n<p>ML_PLATFORM=\"$ISABELLE_PLATFORM64\"<br>\nML_HOME=\"$POLYML_HOME/$ML_PLATFORM\"<br>\nML_OPTIONS=\"-H 1500 --gcthreads 6\"</p>\n<p>In both cases I use 64bit Poly/ML (via changing ML_HOME) since IsaFoR<br>\nneeds more RAM than can be addressed with the 32bit version. If you do<br>\nnot need 64bit, don't do this, since 32bit Poly/ML is probably around<br>\ntwice as fast.</p>\n<p>With this setup we sometimes (rarely) see a speedup around 9. So at<br>\nleast for IsaFoR it seems that up to 8 CPUs are <em>really</em> useful (of<br>\ncourse if you also want to work on the same machine, more would be<br>\nbetter ;)).</p>\n<p>hope this helps</p>\n<p>chris</p>",
