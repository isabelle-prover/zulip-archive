I was thinking it<br>\nwould be something like apply (rule myLemma[THEN/OF allI]). However,<br>\nthat doesn't work, and nothing else I've tried has either. You'd think<br>\nthere would be a way, but as far as I can tell, there's no<br>\nattribute-based analogue of RS or (rule ...). So I have to state the<br>\nlemma sans ALL as a new lemma and prove it.</p>\n<p>Note, I'm sure there's plenty of nice ways to do it in Isar, but I've<br>\ngiven up on Isar for now because my goals are quite large and I can't<br>\nfigure out how to get around stating them over and over in full, even<br>\nwith higher-order-unification-based abbreviation.</p>\n<p>Chris Capel</p>",
