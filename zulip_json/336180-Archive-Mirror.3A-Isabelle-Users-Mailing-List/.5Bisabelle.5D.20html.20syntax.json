I have tried to achieve this by writing</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>notation (html) tdisj (infix \"#\" 55)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>but that didn't work. I don't want to use the hash symbol in the script itself, because it is already too overloaded. In a similar vein, I should like to replace all the \"\\&lt;ast&gt;\" symbols with proper \"*\" symbols. </p>\n<p>Any suggestions welcomed! Thanks very much,</p>\n<p>John</p>",

It is based on <br>\na hard-wired interpretation of some of the infinitely many Isabelle <br>\nsymbols as HTML entities (see Isabelle/src/Pure/Thy/html.ML).</p>\n<p>If you really care much about the HTML output, you can try some <br>\npost-processing with perl and regular expressions.</p>\n<p>BTW, the (* source comments *) in your text are not part of the formal <br>\ndocument.  Once the HTML rendering becomes more serious (closer to the <br>\nIsabelle LaTeX document preparation system), such raw comments will be <br>\nsuppressed in the same way as LaTeX igores text after % comments.</p>\n<p>The proper way to include informal text into theory sources is like this:</p>\n<p>text {* blah blah *}</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>-- {* blah blah *}</p>\n<p>The former is a command on its own, the latter can be attached to other <br>\ncommands in arbitrary places.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
