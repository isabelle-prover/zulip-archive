But I wonder what level of knowledge you want to have. Maybe it's enough if you read the following early paper:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Formath/milner-ind-defs.pdf\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Formath/milner-ind-defs.pdf</a></p>\n<p>That's in the setting of set theory, so it is untyped and simple. Working with types adds some complications, and if you want to include recursive datatypes, it gets a lot more complicated still.</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
