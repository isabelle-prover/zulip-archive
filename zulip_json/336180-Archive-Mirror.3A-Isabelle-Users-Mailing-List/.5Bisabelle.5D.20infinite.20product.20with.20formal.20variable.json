(This material is new and will be included with Isabelle 2018.) There is a theorem allowing you to prove that this infinite product converges without actually evaluating it. And it's a simple matter to prove by induction that the partial products have the form (1 - x^(2^n)), provided of course that norm x &lt; 1. So it shouldn't be difficult to prove that the infinite product equals 1.</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",

This means that a sequence of FPSs<br>\nconverges iff each coefficient stabilises eventually (i.e. does not<br>\nchange anymore). I believe this is a standard definition.</p>\n<p>Now, there is probably some connection between convergence these power<br>\nseries as analytic functions in the complex plane and the convergence,<br>\nbut I am not sure about this and we don't have it in Isabelle yet<br>\nanyway. Perhaps you know more about this than I do.</p>\n<p>However, you can prove this limit directly on the topology of FPSs<br>\n(which I sketched above). The proof is a bit fiddly, but it basically<br>\nboils down to showing the following key lemma:</p>\n<p>lemma \"fps_nth (∏k=0..n. 1 + fps_X ^ (2 ^ k)) m = (if m &lt; 2 ^ (n+1) then<br>\n1 else 0)\"</p>\n<p>This means that the m-th coefficient of the n-th partial product is 1 if<br>\n2^(n+1) &gt; m and 0 otherwise, and the reasoning involves the uniqueness<br>\nof the binary representation of m. I don't know what proof you had in<br>\nmind, but my guess would be that it was something like this.</p>\n<p>With this lemma, it is then trivial to show the actual convergence:</p>\n<p>lemma \"(λn. ∏k=0..n. 1 + fps_X ^ (2 ^ k)) ⇢ Abs_fps (λ_. 1)\"</p>\n<p>So the partial products converge to the FPS whose coefficients are all<br>\n1, i.e. 1 + x + x² + x³ + …</p>\n<p>This is, of course, precisely 1 / (1 - x), and we have that fact in<br>\nIsabelle as well.</p>\n<p>For the full proof, see the attachment.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/PNhmupPVNxvt8YsDgjRXlXU3/Scratch.thy\">Scratch.thy</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/7DNSOnoqyZcxCwrz3j4Qr5DY/pEpkey.asc\">pEpkey.asc</a></p>",
