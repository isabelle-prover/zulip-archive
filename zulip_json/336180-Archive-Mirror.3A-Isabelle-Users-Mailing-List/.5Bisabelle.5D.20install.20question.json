It will give you the better system at small cost -- retraining your <br>\nfingers to unlearn ESCAPE META ALT CONTROL SHIFT.

As often, it helps to de-install some debs and install directly from <br>\nthe source: <a href=\"http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/\">http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/</a></p>\n<p>When starting up one Emacs with Proof General, it has initially one chance <br>\nto change its personality to \"coq\", \"isar\", etc. and then locks into that. <br>\nTo switch to a different prover you would need a different instance of <br>\nEmacs.</p>\n<p>That is an old problem of Emacs / Proof General.  Divinating around such <br>\nissues, especially with Debian defaults, used to be second nature for me <br>\nuntil October 2011, when Isabelle/jEdit became \"official and stable\" as <br>\nIsabelle front-end for the first time.  Since then we've had Isabelle2012 <br>\n(May 2012) and Isabelle2013 (February 2013) with Isabelle/jEdit getting <br>\nmore and more advanced and leaving Proof General further and further <br>\nbehind, so it is mostly a nostalgic thing now.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
