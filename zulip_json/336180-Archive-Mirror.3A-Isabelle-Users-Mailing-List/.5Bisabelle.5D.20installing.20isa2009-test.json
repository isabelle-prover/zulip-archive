If so, you need to adapt it in two ways:</p>\n<p>* User settings are now in ~/.isabelle/etc/settings so former ~/isabelle<br>\n     needs to be renamed to ~/.isabelle</p>\n<p>Note that old Isabelle2008/etc/settings:ISABELLE_HOME_USER can be<br>\n     adapted to refer to the new directory as well -- no need to keep<br>\n     several copies here.</p>\n<p>* Former ISABELLE_INTERFACE is superceded by PROOFGENERAL_HOME</p>\n<p>As usual you can avoid local settings by putting Proof General into a <br>\nstandard place (or symlinking it), e.g. like this:</p>\n<p>Isabelle2008/<br>\n   isa2009-test/<br>\n   ProofGeneral-3.7.1/<br>\n   ProofGeneral -&gt; ProofGeneral-3.7.1</p>\n<p>Now both Isabelle installations should detect this ProofGeneral by <br>\ndefault, without any extra settings.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
