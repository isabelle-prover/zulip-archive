Unfortunately, this marker renders ?thesis unusable for show <br>\nstatements.</p>\n<p>Here's a minimal example:</p>\n<p>locale l = fixes x assumes \"x = x\"<br>\ninterpretation l \"Suc 0\"<br>\nproof -<br>\n   (* ?thesis here is \"Pure.prop (HOL.Trueprop (l (Suc 0)))\" *)<br>\n   show \"PROP ?thesis\"   (* does not work -&gt; failed to refine any pending goal *)<br>\n   show \"Trueprop (l (Suc 0))\"  (* works *)</p>\n<p>Why do interpretation and sublocale statements add this Pure.prop marker to ?thesis? And <br>\nwhat is Pure.prop needed for at all?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
