Doing that, I discovered the <br>\nfollowing: It is sometimes convenient to have specialized rules for more <br>\nspecific types. For example I use</p>\n<p>lemma subsetI2: assumes \"!!x y. (x,y) : S ==&gt; (x,y) : T\" shows \"S &lt;= T\"</p>\n<p>rather often at the beginning of some proof (usually about binary <br>\nrelations). That is, a corresponding proof starts as follows:</p>\n<p>proof (rule subsetI2)</p>\n<p>What I would like to have instead is</p>\n<p>proof</p>\n<p>Now, declaring subsetI2 as 'intro' doesn't help. Still, the more general <br>\nrule subsetI is used. So my question is, how do I specify, when several <br>\nrules would be applicable, which one is used by the 'rule' method? The <br>\nsame problem arises, when there are several introduction rules for some <br>\nconstant. As far as I figured out, as long as the types are at the same <br>\nlevel (in contrast to the above subsetI2, where the original rule can be <br>\napplied on 'a set, but subsetI2 can only be applied on ('a * 'a)set), <br>\nthe order in which rules are declared as 'intro' does matter. Is that <br>\ncorrect or was it just a coincidence in my case?</p>\n<p>best regards</p>\n<p>chris</p>",
