At that time, <br>\nPG was still officially supported and IIRC it did not terminate the whole Isabelle <br>\nprocess. Nowadays, I noted that I can reduce memory consumption by loading less theories <br>\nin parallel in PG. From what I understand, Isabelle processed theories that are loaded in <br>\nthe background in parallel like jEdit does. Only the currently active theory gets <br>\nprocessed incrementally (and slowly) in PG.
