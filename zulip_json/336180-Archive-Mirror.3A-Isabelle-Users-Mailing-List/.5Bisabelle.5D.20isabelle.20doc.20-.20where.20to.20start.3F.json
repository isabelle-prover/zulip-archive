Is the use of this tool documented <br>\nanywhere?</p>\n<p>In Isabelle2005 you could get to a terminal type interface to Isar by, <br>\nas I recall, using the command Isabelle instead of isabelle.  Is <br>\nanything like this possible in Isabelle 2017?  (I've seen the reference <br>\nto isabelle console, but that's for entering ML commands not Isar commands)</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Jeremy</p>",

As such, you may of course edit<br>\nunsaved files, but there is no good reason to. When you start your<br>\ntheory, you can directly save it without waiting until your program<br>\nexits. Press \"Ctrl-S\" (or \"Cmd-S\" on a Mac I believe) to save and select<br>\na more appropriate location.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I tried the suggestion of a path name, but it didn't seem to like the<br>\nsymbol /</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Path-qualified names have to be enclosed in double quotes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How do I tell this tool where to look for theory files?Â  And is its use<br>\ndocumented anywhere?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Isabelle will always, with some exceptions like \"Main\", look for imports<br>\nrelative to the location of the theory you are editing. There is, as far<br>\nas I know, no way to change this (and it is hardly necessary).</p>\n<p>(However, it is also possible to use so-called session-qualified<br>\nimports. Whether or not that is necessary depends on your project.)</p>\n<p>There is a dedicated manual for Isabelle/jEdit:<br>\n&lt;<a href=\"https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2017/doc/jedit.pdf\">https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2017/doc/jedit.pdf</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Hope that helps!</p>",
