I thought it might be nice to use a different QED symbol depending on which method I had used, so I made a little symbol, based loosely on the Isabelle cubes logo.</p>\n<p>In case anybody else would like to do something similar, here is some LaTeX/TikZ code for generating the symbol I used. There is a bit more info, and a picture, on the following page: <a href=\"http://johnwickerson.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/isabelle-qed/\">http://johnwickerson.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/isabelle-qed/</a></p>\n<p>\\usepackage{tikz}<br>\n\\newcommand{\\isabelleqed}{%<br>\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[x=0.8mm, y=0.8mm, baseline=-0.3mm, line join=round]<br>\n\\begin{scope}[yslant=-0.5]<br>\n  \\draw (0,0) rectangle +(1,1);<br>\n  \\draw (2,1) rectangle +(1,1);<br>\n  \\draw (1,2) rectangle +(1,1);<br>\n\\end{scope}<br>\n\\begin{scope}[yslant=0.5]<br>\n  \\filldraw (1,-1) rectangle +(1,1);<br>\n  \\filldraw (3,-2) rectangle +(1,1);<br>\n  \\filldraw (2,0) rectangle +(1,1);<br>\n\\end{scope}<br>\n\\begin{scope}[yslant=0.5,xslant=-1]<br>\n  \\draw (1,0) rectangle +(1,1);<br>\n  \\draw (2,-1) rectangle +(1,1);<br>\n  \\draw (3,1) rectangle +(1,1);<br>\n\\end{scope}<br>\n\\end{tikzpicture}%<br>\n}</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nJohn</p>",
