The isabelle <br>\nwrapper merely invokes \"make -f IsaMakefile\" within the standard settings <br>\nenvironment.  The idea is to use that make file as default.  In Unix <br>\ncommand line tools repeated options either accumulate, or have a tendency <br>\nto prefer the last occurrence, although this is not fully standardized. <br>\nSo the meaning of some extra -f is hard to predict.</p>\n<p>Since the basic principle behind isabelle make is to do nothing specific, <br>\napart from providing some reasonable defaults, you can always invoke <br>\ncompletely different make command lines like that:</p>\n<p>isabelle env make -f other-makefile</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
