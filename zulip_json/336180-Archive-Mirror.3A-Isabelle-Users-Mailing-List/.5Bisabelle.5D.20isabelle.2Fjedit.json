My concern is usability, not theoretical<br>\nelegance. Coming up with a proof is a challenging task in itself, and<br>\nit is better that the user interface helps creating it, and you need<br>\nnot remember technicalities in order to advance your proof.</p>\n<p>What do the developers think?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gergely</li>\n</ul>",

Isabelle/jEdit is not just another <br>\nclone of Proof General, but based on a timeless and stateless model of <br>\ncontinous document processing.

Emacs has little other GUI <br>\nelements than menus, so we used them 15 years ago.  jEdit has more <br>\npossibilities to be put into proper use eventually.

The frontend isn't <br>\neverything, and someday people will be putting great frontends on a lot <br>\nof the other proof assistants, so I predict.</p>\n<p>It's a bunch of things: documentation, language syntax, the logic <br>\nengine, the editor, support, funding, etc. From my research, Isabelle is <br>\nthe overall winner, but then, I like it's natural deduction foundation. <br>\nSomeone else might need something like Coq's logic, not that I know much <br>\nabout it all.

I believe there  <br>\nare many purely intuitionist proof by exposition of good artifacts, that  <br>\nthe Isabelle jEdit tuple is a good one (teasing and playing with words).</p>\n<p>Note that you have the option to set Isabelle's flag from within a theory  <br>\nfile, ex. like writing “using [[simp_trace=true]]” in a proof body. You  <br>\nmay hide from the produced PDF document, using a special comment syntax,  <br>\nlike writing “(<em>&lt;</em>)using <a href=\"http://*&gt;*\">[simp_trace=true]</a>”. By the way, I believe  <br>\nthere may be a tiny issue with the simp_trace flags, … will open a thread  <br>\nabout it later.</p>\n<p>Cheers</p>",
