Norton is a big player in anti-virus.</p>\n<p>I'll give my two cents about your Isabelle.exe not getting past Norton.</p>\n<p>First, I've downloaded and executed hundreds of cracked and hacked <br>\nWindows applications, and many, many didn't pass Norton's initial scan, <br>\nor they got shut down by Norton after I executed them.</p>\n<p>Second, I know that Norton is more aggressive, which results in false <br>\npositives. I know this because it has flagged applications hacked by <br>\ncertain hacker groups that don't have a reputation for malicious <br>\nhacking, and which other forum commenters weren't complaining about as <br>\nbeing infected.</p>\n<p>Third, though Norton has flagged hacked applications that I didn't think <br>\nwere infected, I've also executed hundreds of free applications from <br>\nreputable sites, and I can't remember Norton shutting any of them down.</p>\n<p>Fourth, any hacking is going to be the attaching of the hacker's code to <br>\nthe normal code and jumping around in the code. Launch4j is executing <br>\nother people's code, so it kind of fits that description.</p>\n<p>It could be that less skilled hackers have used launch4j code to hack <br>\napplications, with the result being that Norton has some kind of <br>\nsignature on Launch4j code because it's been used by hackers. That's <br>\nspeculation on my part. I'm not a hacker.</p>\n<p>Fifth, surely there is code out there that will execute Isabelle without <br>\ngetting shut down by Norton. I say that because, ASSIGN, a hacking <br>\ngroup, has hacked many an application that Norton is completely happy with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't see any instructions in the folder \"\"isabelle2012-rc3\" or <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2012-RC3/\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2012-RC3/</a> that tells me <br>\nanything about how to start Isabelle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is more text in <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2012-RC3/installation.html\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2012-RC3/installation.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the 2011 release, <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/isabelle/download.html\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/isabelle/download.html</a>, the basic <br>\ninstall instructions are on the download page.
