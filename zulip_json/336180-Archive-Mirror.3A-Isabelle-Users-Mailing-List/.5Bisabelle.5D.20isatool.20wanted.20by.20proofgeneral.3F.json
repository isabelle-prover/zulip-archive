Both systems are running Emacs 21.4.1.  I have <br>\nfull control over one of the systems, but very limited control over the <br>\nother (it is a server or general student use).  I have downloaded <br>\npolyml-5.3.0.tar.gz, ProofGeneral-3.7.1.1.tar.gz, <br>\nIsabelle2009-1_bundle.tar.gz, and HOL_x86-linux.tar.gz and unpacked then <br>\ninto a local directory.  I have added the (load-file <br>\n\"&lt;proofgeneral_home&gt;/generic/proof-site.el\") line to my .emacs file.  <br>\nWhen I go to start up Isabelle by</p>\n<p>isabelle emacs</p>\n<p>it gets into loading Proof General, but then stalls, claiming \"File mode <br>\nspecification error:  (void-variable image-load-path)\".  When I try <br>\nstarting up emacs and then visiting a file, say tmp.thy, again it <br>\nproceeds to start loading Proof General, but then in the mini-buffer it asks</p>\n<p>\"Please give the full path to `isatool' (RET if you don't have it): &lt;cwd&gt;\"</p>\n<p>At first I was attempting to load Isabelle onto the student server, onto <br>\nwhich I had loaded previous versions.  I assumed that I must have left <br>\nsome trace of the old version and had some path set incorrectly <br>\nsomewhere.  But the problem persisted even after I had deleted all old <br>\nfiles.  So I tried doing the installation on a machine that had just <br>\nbeen freshly loaded with a fairly generic linux and had never had <br>\nIsabelle on it, and the problem appeared there as well, with exactly the <br>\nsame behavior.  I have tried looking through the ProofGeneral files, <br>\nincluding interface and interface-setup.el and I cannot find the source <br>\nof the problem.  I know that Emacs 22.2.1  is the preferred version of <br>\nEmacs, but the COMPATIBILITY file does indicate the Emacs 21.4.1 should <br>\nwork with poorer support for X-Symbol sub/superscripts.  I have used <br>\nEmacs 21.4.1 with acceptable results before.  I would appreciate help in <br>\ntrying to get Isabelle working again with it.<br>\n---Elsa</p>",
