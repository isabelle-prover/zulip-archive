In <br>\nparticular, the wrong name \"jEdit\" for the Prover IDE will cause some <br>\nconfusion and misunderstandings over there.</p>\n<p>Like many other open-source projects, there is a slight decline in <br>\nenthusism and idealism recently.  This is an opportunity to reverse the <br>\ntrend, and show that there are professional users of the platform who care <br>\nabout its continued maintenance.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
