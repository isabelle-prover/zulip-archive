However,  <br>\nthe initially selected cession in this list, is not the default one and  <br>\nmay be another one instead, the one which was selected during a previous  <br>\nexecution of Isabelle/jEdit. Is this on purpose? Isn't it confusing?</p>\n<p>It works fine, that's just about what the UI reflects (does not clearly  <br>\nshow what the current logic cession is).</p>",
