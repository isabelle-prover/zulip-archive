I<br>\ndon't know a good way to tell so I'm basing that on what it says in the<br>\n\"About\" screen in the jEdit menu. On the other hand, typing \"java -version\"<br>\nat the command line returns this:<br>\njava version \"1.8.0\"<br>\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0-b132)</p>\n<p>Second, I use OS X to remap my keyboard to the dvorak layout, but when I<br>\nuse a modifier key such as control jEdit interprets my keypress<br>\nincorrectly. I can even see this happening from the keyboard test utility<br>\nunder the troubleshooting menu. This makes it impossible for me to use<br>\ncertain shortcuts or to even use certain keys. This looks similar to my<br>\nproblem:<br>\n<a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8028617\">https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8028617</a></p>\n<p>Third, when I use sledgehammer remote_vampire always gives an error about<br>\nSystemOnTPTP, which makes me think remote_vampire is broken at the moment.<br>\nSo instead of continuing to hammer their website, I wanted to remove<br>\nremote_vampire. So I removed remote_vampire in the jEdit options, but it<br>\nseemed to have no effect. I had to add a line like this to my<br>\ntheory: sledgehammer_params[cvc4 z3 spass e]</p>\n<p>Fourth, at this point I wanted to go back to using emacs so that at least<br>\nthe first two issues would go away. The official tutorial, dated May of<br>\nthis year, even has this to say:<br>\n\"The recommended interface for Isabelle/Isar is the (X)Emacs-based Proof<br>\nGeneral [1, 2].\" But when I tried to connect Proof General to Isabelle, I<br>\ndiscovered that it never connects because tty support was removed! So is<br>\nProof General still the recommended interface as the tutorial says?</p>\n<p>Fifth, there have been several times when I thought Isabelle accepted my<br>\nproof, but actually there was an error and jEdit makes this difficult to<br>\nsee. It's hard to explain this one without lots of screenshots. The problem<br>\nseems to be that jEdit tries to be clever and runs parts of the proof in<br>\nparallel or something. Is there a way to make it work like Proof General<br>\nwhere you can enter and retract the steps one at a time and explicitly?<br>\nI've tried toggling the \"Auto Update\" checkbox but then I can't tell what<br>\npart of the buffer has been accepted. Also, I don't see a way to make a<br>\nshortcut for requesting an update. Switching back to the mouse constantly<br>\nis annoying. So for now I use the \"Auto Update\" feature but I don't have a<br>\ngood way to be sure Isabelle has completely accepted my input. It's also<br>\neasy to accidentally interrupt slow queries, such as sledgehammer which is<br>\nmildly annoying and a waste of time.</p>\n<p>Sixth, I like to version control my configuration files and put them on<br>\ngithub so that I can easy restore my account or setup a new account on a<br>\nnew computer. How do I export my jEdit settings?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nJason</p>",
