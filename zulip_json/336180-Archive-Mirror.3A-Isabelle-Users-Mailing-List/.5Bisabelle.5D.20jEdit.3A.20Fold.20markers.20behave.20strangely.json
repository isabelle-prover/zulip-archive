(To prevent misunderstanding: I mean this little<br>\ngray triangles, that occur on the left-side of the text-editor box, and<br>\ncan be used to fold block-structured text, usually source-code)</p>\n<p>1) When editing the file <em>before</em> a folded part, in some cases the<br>\nfolded part just disappears! Sometimes, there will be some fold-markers<br>\nat odd positions, and unfolding them brings back the content, sometimes<br>\nthe folded part and all related fold-markers just disappear. Luckily,<br>\nthis effect is only temporary, if you save the current file, all the<br>\nmarkers and contents are back at their right positions.</p>\n<p>2) The folding is not appropriate for Isabelle. For example, folding a<br>\nproof ... qed block eats up all following white space *and the next<br>\ncommand*. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these issues make code-folding completely unusable for<br>\nIsabelle/jEdit. Am I missing something obvious, or am I the first one<br>\nwho tried code-folding?</p>",
