You can get most of the logical <br>\nsymbols by just typing their ASCII approximation. As soon as the <br>\napproximation fits a symbol a popup will show up where you can choose <br>\n(maybe between several different symbols). E.g.,<br>\nAfter typing \"--&gt;\" I have a popup containing just ⟶, and after typing /\\ <br>\nI get ∧.

This is one of the many <br>\nboundary cases of the editor event model and the continous updates of the <br>\nprover document model disagree about the time/space continuum.  There used <br>\nto be many NPEs from jEdit in the past, but a few anomalies are still left <br>\nover.</p>\n<p>Above you probably have yet another boundary case: if the command is the <br>\nlast one in the buffer, jEdit makes a special case for the text address in <br>\nthe buffer -- it strips of the last newline.  Thus your caret actually <br>\npoints to nowhere, and the display is conservative in not updating itself. <br>\nIn reality you usually have at least an 'end' command following.</p>\n<p>In the next round if refinements, the relation of the Output panel(s) -- <br>\nthere can be multiple -- to the source needs to be made more explicit, and <br>\nthe connection to editor events made more robust. Recently on Google maps <br>\nI've seen some nice ways to indicate the boundary of an area (municipality <br>\netc.) as the search result.  It should also be made easy to type in one <br>\nspot while watching output from another spot.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",

It is easy to add such abbreviations on<br>\n     the fly, also in a mode-specific manner.  There are separate key<br>\n     sequences (jEdit actions) to define and use abbreviations.</p>\n<p>Isabelle/jEdit does not do anything by default here.  It is up to the<br>\n     user to define jEdit abbreviations on demand.</p>\n<p>* The Isabelle/jEdit completion popup works via the Sidekick plugin,<br>\n     with special wiring to accomodate Isabelle symbols or keyword syntax.</p>\n<p>See the Plugin options for Sidekick for a number of properties that<br>\n     can be changed here.</p>\n<p>The completion table is provided by Isabelle/Scala, also the<br>\n     syntactic rules for word boundaries etc.  Both the table of outer<br>\n     syntax keywords and the information of etc/symbols are taken as a<br>\n     starting point.  For symbols you can complete the symbol name (e.g.<br>\n     \"forall\"), actual symbol (e.g. \"\\&lt;forall&gt;\") or optional symbol<br>\n     abbreviation (e.g. \"!\").  There are some boundary cases when there is<br>\n     an overlap with keywords, e.g. \"and\".</p>\n<p>In principle you can define further symbol mappings and abbreviations in <br>\nISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/symbols, but some care is required to avoid <br>\nfundamental changes of the unicode rendering, otherwise copy-pasted <br>\nmaterial cannot be exchanged with other people via email etc.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
