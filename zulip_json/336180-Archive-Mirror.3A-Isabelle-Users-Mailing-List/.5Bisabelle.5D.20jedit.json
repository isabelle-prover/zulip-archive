How can I get rid of as<br>\nmuch of the grey area around the file buffer and the output window? I mean<br>\nespecially the panels between the two windows and the one below the output<br>\nwindow. (Thanks to Dimitriy I have already been able to remove the grey area to<br>\nthe left of the file buffer). The two windows should remain horizontal.</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nTobias</p>",

For example, you can probably get 1-2 more lines <br>\nby removing all dockables from the bottom line, and retaining a floating <br>\nversion of Output (there can be more than one).  You can then make the two <br>\nwindows slightly overlapping, to hide some of their decoration.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is possible to scale the font size of the Output panel down, <br>\nsay to 85% of the main text font.</p>\n<p>In the course that we have had on Mon/Tue, we had the opposite sitation. <br>\nThe projector had a resolution of 1920x1080, and the window decorations <br>\nand menus were rather tiny.  The TextArea font size only applies to the <br>\nmain text buffer and the output panel.</p>\n<p>The equipment in the LRI building is from last year, and all the rooms <br>\nhave rather high-resolution displays or projectors by default.  The time <br>\nof classic 1024x768 seems to be over.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
