Preconditions and<br>\n   postconditions of these operations can be used to describe the<br>\n   possible steps in the problem space; thus, ATP-systems can be used<br>\n   to check if an operation sequence given by the user does actually<br>\n   present a problem solution. Such \"Problem Solution Languages\"<br>\n   encompass declarative proof languages like Isabelle/Isar or Coq's<br>\n   Mathematical Proof Language, but also more specialized forms such<br>\n   as, for example, geometric problem solution languages that express a<br>\n   proof argument in Euclidean Geometry or languages for graph theory.</p>\n<p>* Consistent Mathematical Content Representation: libraries of<br>\n   existing ITP-Systems, in particular those following the LCF-prover<br>\n   paradigm, usually provide logically coherent and human readable<br>\n   knowledge. In the leading provers, mathematical knowledge is covered<br>\n   to an extent beyond most courses in applied sciences. However, the<br>\n   potential of this mechanised knowledge for education is clearly not<br>\n   yet recognised adequately: renewed pedagogy calls for enquiry-based<br>\n   learning from concrete to abstract --- and the knowledge's logical<br>\n   coherence supports such learning: for instance, the formula 2.Pi<br>\n   depends on the definition of reals and of multiplication; close to<br>\n   these definitions are the laws like commutativity etc. Clearly, the<br>\n   complexity of the knowledge's traceable interrelations poses a<br>\n   challenge to usability design.</p>\n<p>* User-Guidance in Stepwise Problem Solving: Such guidance is<br>\n   indispensable for independent learning, but costly to implement so<br>\n   far, because so many special cases need to be coded by<br>\n   hand. However, CTP technology makes automated generation of<br>\n   user-guidance reachable: declarative languages as mentioned above,<br>\n   novel programming languages combining computation and deduction,<br>\n   methods for automated construction with ruler and compass from<br>\n   specifications, etc --- all these methods 'know how to solve a<br>\n   problem'; so, using the methods' knowledge to generate user-guidance<br>\n   mechanically is an appealing challenge for ATP and ITP, and probably<br>\n   for compiler construction!</p>\n<p>In principle, mathematical software can be conceived as models of<br>\nmathematics: The challenge addressed by this workshop is to provide<br>\nappealing models for mathematics assistants which are interactive and<br>\nwhich explain themselves such that interested students can<br>\nindependently learn by inquiry and experimentation.</p>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We welcome submission of extended abstracts (4 pages max) presenting<br>\noriginal unpublished work which is not been submitted for publication<br>\nelsewhere.</p>\n<p>All accepted extended abstracts will be presented at the workshop, and<br>\nthe extended abstracts will be made available online.
