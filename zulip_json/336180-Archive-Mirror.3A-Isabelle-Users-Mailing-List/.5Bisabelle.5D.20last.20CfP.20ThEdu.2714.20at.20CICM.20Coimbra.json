Preconditions and<br>\n   post-conditions of these operations can be used to describe the<br>\n   possible steps in the problem space; thus, ATP-systems can be used<br>\n   to check if an operation sequence given by the user does actually<br>\n   present a problem solution. Such \"Problem Solution Languages\"<br>\n   encompass declarative proof languages like Isabelle/Isar or Coq's<br>\n   Mathematical Proof Language, but also more specialised forms such<br>\n   as, for example, geometric problem solution languages that express a<br>\n   proof argument in Euclidean Geometry or languages for graph theory.</p>\n<p>* Consistent Mathematical Content Representation: libraries of<br>\n   existing ITP-Systems, in particular those following the LCF-prover<br>\n   paradigm, usually provide logically coherent and human readable<br>\n   knowledge. In the leading provers, mathematical knowledge is covered<br>\n   to an extent beyond most courses in applied sciences. However, the<br>\n   potential of this mechanised knowledge for education is clearly not<br>\n   yet recognised adequately: renewed pedagogy calls for enquiry-based<br>\n   learning from concrete to abstract --- and the knowledge's logical<br>\n   coherence supports such learning: for instance, the formula 2.Pi<br>\n   depends on the definition of reals and of multiplication; close to<br>\n   these definitions are the laws like commutativity etc. Clearly, the<br>\n   complexity of the knowledge's traceable interrelations poses a<br>\n   challenge to usability design.</p>\n<p>* User-Guidance in Step-wise Problem Solving: Such guidance is<br>\n   indispensable for independent learning, but costly to implement so<br>\n   far, because so many special cases need to be coded by<br>\n   hand. However, TP technology makes automated generation of<br>\n   user-guidance reachable: declarative languages as mentioned above,<br>\n   novel programming languages combining computation and deduction,<br>\n   methods for automated construction with ruler and compass from<br>\n   specifications, etc --- all these methods 'know how to solve a<br>\n   problem'; so, using the methods' knowledge to generate user-guidance<br>\n   mechanically is an appealing challenge for ATP and ITP, and probably<br>\n   for compiler construction.</p>\n<p>* Pedagogical strategies: Using TP technologies in learning<br>\n   environments call for strategies for linking and adapting the<br>\n   availble tools for specific educational needs and new methods for<br>\n   the management of mathematical knowledge capable of filling the gap<br>\n   between repositories and end-user system and new visual and/or<br>\n   natural language interfaces to allow the use of rigorous reasoning<br>\n   methods and tools.</p>\n<p>In principle, mathematical software can be conceived as models of<br>\n   mathematics: The challenge addressed by this workshop is to provide<br>\n   appealing models for mathematics assistants which are interactive<br>\n   and which explain themselves such that interested students can<br>\n   independently learn by inquiry and experimentation.</p>\n<p>Submission</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We welcome submission of extended abstracts and demonstration<br>\nproposals presenting original unpublished work which is not been<br>\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere.</p>\n<p>All accepted extended abstracts and demonstrations will be presented<br>\nat the workshop.
