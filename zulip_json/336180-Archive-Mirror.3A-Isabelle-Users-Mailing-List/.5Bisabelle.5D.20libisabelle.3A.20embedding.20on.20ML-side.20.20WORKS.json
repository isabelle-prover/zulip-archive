I hope we can live <br>\nwith this during bootstrapping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now I see the arguments for establishing Isac an Isabelle component ...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is a bit odd since you're including a \"user-space\" theory in a<br>\n\"system-space\" theory, but since all theories in an image are \"equal\"<br>\nregardless of their provenance, but conceptually, I don't see why this<br>\nshouldn't work.<br>\nI take it that \"/usr/local/isabisac\" contains the full Isabelle<br>\ndistribution with added Isac? I was expecting that you would specify<br>\njust the subdirectory of the Isac component.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... where presently Isac is just inserted into the Isabelle code and not <br>\nseparated as a component.</p>\n<p>Before I look into Isabelle components I'm eager to see libisabelle <br>\nembedded on Java-side.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot,<br>\nWalther</p>",
