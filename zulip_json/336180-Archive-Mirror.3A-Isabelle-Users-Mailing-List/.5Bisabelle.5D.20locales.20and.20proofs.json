Please explain so I can understand the Isabelle proofs.</p>\n<p>Isn't Pierce's law the rule <br>\n(?P =⇒ ?Q) =⇒ ?P −→ ?Q     (impI)<br>\nWhat do you mean by proof (rule impI)?  </p>\n<p>I would have proved Pierce's law like this.  Either P or ~P, as you<br>\nsay.  Two cases:<br>\nif P, we're done, because the result is **** --&gt; T, which is T.<br>\nIf ~P, the result is <br>\n((F --&gt; Q) --&gt; F) --&gt; F <br>\n= (T --&gt; F) --&gt; F  <br>\n= F ---&gt; F = T <br>\n((F --&gt; Q) --&gt; F) --&gt; F <br>\n= (T --&gt; F) --&gt; F  <br>\n= F ---&gt; F = T </p>\n<p>I don't really see how to justify it easily using the Isar rules like <br>\n( ¬ ?Q =⇒ ?P) =⇒ ?P ∨ ?Q (disjCI)<br>\nwhich seem primitive.  I'm impressed you wrote such a short proof!</p>\n<p>The dox give explain the terms you use, with, show, by etc, but I<br>\ncouldn't figure out what they meant.  Please explain in your example!</p>",
