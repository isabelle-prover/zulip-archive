For instance,<br>\n  In the above code,<br>\n  I can guess some parameters of theorems used such as compl_sets if I use<br>\nthe metis command ,  but I cannot find all.  Therefore it is diffcult for me<br>\nto use it.</p>\n<p>Are there more documents on metis, especially on how to use it eficiently in<br>\nIsabelle.</p>\n<p>lyj</p>",
