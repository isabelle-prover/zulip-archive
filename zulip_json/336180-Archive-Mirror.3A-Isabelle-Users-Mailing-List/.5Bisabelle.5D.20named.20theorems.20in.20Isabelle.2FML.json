More specifically, to obtain all theorems in a named <br>\ntheorem bundle \"a\" I currently do</p>\n<p>Proof_Context.get_thms ctxt \"Theory_Name.a\"</p>\n<p>This works, but it feels strange to add this Theory name prefix <br>\n(although it would not be strictly necessary, I like to avoid potential <br>\nclashes).</p>\n<p>Moreover, how do I add new theorems to an existing bundle? I.e., the <br>\nequivalent of</p>\n<p>declare some_thm [a]</p>\n<p>in Isabelle/ML?</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>chris</p>",
