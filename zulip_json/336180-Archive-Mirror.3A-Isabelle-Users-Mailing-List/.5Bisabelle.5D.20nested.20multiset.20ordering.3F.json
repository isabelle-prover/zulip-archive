The <br>\nequivalences are not hard to prove, but if you happen to need them you <br>\ncan reuse a proof that we (Jasmin and me) made in an ongoing <br>\nformalization of Bachmair and Ganzingers chapter \"Resolution Theorem <br>\nProving\" in the Handbook of Automated Reasoning: <br>\n<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/jasmin_blanchette/superformal/src/tip/thys/Multiset_More.thy\">https://bitbucket.org/jasmin_blanchette/superformal/src/tip/thys/Multiset_More.thy</a>. <br>\nAt some point, much of the linked theory will migrate to <br>\nsrc/HOL/Library/Multiset.</p>\n<p>Dmitriy</p>",
