This entry contains an unofficial version of the CakeML semantics that has been exported from the Lem specifications to Isabelle. Additionally, there are some hand-written theory files that adapt the exported code to Isabelle and port proofs from the HOL4 formalization, e.g. termination and equivalence proofs.</p>\n<p>The project has many contributors:</p>\n<p>The export script and hand-written source files are by Lars Hupel. Lem is a project by Peter Sewell et. al. CakeML is a project with many developers and contributors that can be found on its project page [https://cakeml.org] and on GitHub. In particular, Fabian Immler and Johannes Ã…man Pohjola have contributed Isabelle mappings for constants in the Lem specification of the CakeML semantics.</p>\n<p>The entry is now available from the repository at <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/isa-afp/afp-devel\">https://bitbucket.org/isa-afp/afp-devel</a> and it will become available from <a href=\"https://isa-afp.org\">https://isa-afp.org</a> with the next Isabelle release.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
