The formalization includes transition<br>\n  systems with actions, trace theory, as well as basics on finite,<br>\n  infinite, and lazy sequences. We also provide a basic framework for<br>\n  static analysis on concurrent systems with respect to the ample set<br>\n  condition.</p>\n<p>Since the next Isabelle release is not too far off, this entry should become available on the usual AFP front page in 1-2 months.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
