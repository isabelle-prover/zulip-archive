Applications<br>\n  include alternating automata, models and logics for games, program<br>\n  semantics with dual demonic and angelic nondeterministic choices and<br>\n  concurrent dynamic logics.  This proof document supports an arXiv<br>\n  article that formalises the basic algebra of multirelations and<br>\n  proposes axiom systems for them, ranging from weak bi-monoids to<br>\n  weak bi-quantales.</p>\n<p>Available at:<br>\n<a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Multirelations.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Multirelations.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
