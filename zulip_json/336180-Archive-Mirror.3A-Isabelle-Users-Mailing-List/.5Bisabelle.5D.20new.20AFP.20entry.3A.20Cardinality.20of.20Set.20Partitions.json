In Isabelle, Stirling numbers of<br>\nthe second kind are defined in the AFP entry <code>Discrete Summation</code><br>\nthrough their well-known recurrence relation. The main theorem relates<br>\nthem to the alternative definition as cardinality of set partitions.<br>\nThe proof follows the simple and short explanation in Richard P.<br>\nStanley's <code>Enumerative Combinatorics: Volume 1</code> and Wikipedia, and<br>\nunravels the full details and implicit reasoning steps of these<br>\nexplanations.</p>\n<p>[http://afp.sf.net/entries/Card_Partitions.shtml]</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
