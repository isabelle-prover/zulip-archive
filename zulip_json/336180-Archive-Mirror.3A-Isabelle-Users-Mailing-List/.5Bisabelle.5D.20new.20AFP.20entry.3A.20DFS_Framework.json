It provides a generic DFS algorithm framework, that can be parameterized with user-defined actions on certain events (e.g. discovery of new node). It comes with an extensible library of invariants, which can be used to derive invariants of a specific parameterization. Using refinement techniques, efficient implementations of the algorithms can easily be derived. Here, the framework comes with templates for a recursive and a tail-recursive implementation, and also with several templates for implementing the data structures required by the DFS algorithm. Finally, this entry contains a set of re-usable DFS-based algorithms, which illustrate the application of the framework.</p>\n<p>[CPP-2015] Peter Lammich, René Neumann: A Framework for Verifying Depth-First Search Algorithms.
