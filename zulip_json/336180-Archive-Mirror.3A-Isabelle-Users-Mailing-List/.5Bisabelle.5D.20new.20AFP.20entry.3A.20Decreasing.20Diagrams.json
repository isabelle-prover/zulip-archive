We consider the valley (van Oostrom, TCS 1994) and the conversion version (van Oostrom, RTA 2008) and closely follow the original proofs. As an application we prove Newman's lemma.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
