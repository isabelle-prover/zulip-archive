Some are not of this kind, but, without measuring angles, look as if they were. In that sense, there is exactly one general triangle. This well-known fact is proven here formally.</p>\n<p>Date: 2011-04-01</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
