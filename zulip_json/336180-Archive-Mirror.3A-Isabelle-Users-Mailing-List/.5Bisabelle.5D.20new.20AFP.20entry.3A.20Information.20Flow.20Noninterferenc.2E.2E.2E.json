Moreover, we also illustrate how to lift the control flow graphs of the respective frameworks such that they fulfil the additional assumptions needed in the noninterference proofs. A detailed description of the intraprocedural proof and its interplay with the slicing framework can be found in the PLAS'09 paper by Wasserrab et al.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",
