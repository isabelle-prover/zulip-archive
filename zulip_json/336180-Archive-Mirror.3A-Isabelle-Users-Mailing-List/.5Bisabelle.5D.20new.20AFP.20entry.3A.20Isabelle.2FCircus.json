Its semantics is based on Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP). Isabelle/Circus is a formalization of the UTP and the Circus lan- guage in Isabelle/HOL. It contains proof rules and tactic support that allows for proofs of refinement for Circus processes (involving both data and behavioral aspects).</p>\n<p>The Isabelle/Circus environment supports a syntax for the semantic definitions which is close to textbook presentations of Circus.<br>\nThis article contains an extended version of corresponding VSTTE Paper together with the complete formal development of its underlying commented theories. </p>\n<p>Enjoy at [http://afp.sf.net/entries/Circus.shtml]</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",
