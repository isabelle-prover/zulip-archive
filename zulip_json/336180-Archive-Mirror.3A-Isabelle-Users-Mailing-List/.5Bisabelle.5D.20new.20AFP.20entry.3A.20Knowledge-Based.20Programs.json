Here we present a<br>\n general scheme for compiling KBPs to executable automata with a<br>\n proof of correctness in Isabelle/HOL. We develop the algorithm<br>\n top-down, using Isabelle's locale mechanism to structure these<br>\n proofs, and show that two classic examples can be synthesised using<br>\n Isabelle's code generator.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",
