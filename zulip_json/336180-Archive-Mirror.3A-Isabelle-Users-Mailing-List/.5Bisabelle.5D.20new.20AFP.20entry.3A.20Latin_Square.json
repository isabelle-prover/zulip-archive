A Latin Rectangle is a partially filled n x n table with r filled rows and n-r empty rows, such that each number appears at most once in each row and each column. The main result of this theory is that any Latin Rectangle can be completed to a Latin Square.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Latin_Square.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Latin_Square.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
