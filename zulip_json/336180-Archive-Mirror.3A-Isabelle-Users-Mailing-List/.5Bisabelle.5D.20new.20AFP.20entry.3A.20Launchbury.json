We have formalized both semantics and identified an ambiguity<br>\nin what the operator ⊔ should do: If it is understood as the least upper<br>\nbound, as hinted at in the paper, the original proof fails. We fix the<br>\nproof by taking a detour via a modified natural semantics with an<br>\nexplicit stack. In addition, we show that the original proof goes<br>\nthrough when ⊔ is understood to be right-sided update.</p>\n<p>[http://afp.sf.net/entries/Launchbury.shtml]</p>\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
