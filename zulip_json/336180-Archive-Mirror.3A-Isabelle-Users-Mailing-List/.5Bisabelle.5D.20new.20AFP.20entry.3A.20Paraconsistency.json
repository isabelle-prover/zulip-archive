In<br>\n  classical and intuitionistic logic everything follows from an<br>\n  inconsistent theory. A paraconsistent logic avoids the explosion.<br>\n  Quite a few applications in computer science and engineering are<br>\n  discussed in the Intelligent Systems Reference Library Volume 110:<br>\n  Towards Paraconsistent Engineering (Springer 2016). We formalize a<br>\n  paraconsistent many-valued logic that we motivated and described in a<br>\n  special issue on logical approaches to paraconsistency (Journal of<br>\n  Applied Non-Classical Logics 2005). We limit ourselves to the<br>\n  propositional fragment of the higher-order logic. The logic is based<br>\n  on so-called key equalities and has a countably infinite number of<br>\n  truth values. We prove theorems in the logic using the definition of<br>\n  validity. We verify truth tables and also counterexamples for<br>\n  non-theorems. We prove meta-theorems about the logic and finally we<br>\n  investigate a case study.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Paraconsistency.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Paraconsistency.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
