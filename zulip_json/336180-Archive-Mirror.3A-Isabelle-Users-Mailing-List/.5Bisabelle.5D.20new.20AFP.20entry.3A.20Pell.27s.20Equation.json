This also implies that the set of solutions is infinite, and it gives us an explicit and executable characterisation of all the solutions.</p>\n<p>Based on this, simple executable algorithms for computing the fundamental solution and the infinite sequence of all non-negative solutions are also provided.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
