Gomes and Georg Struth</p>\n<p>Abstract:<br>\nThe theory of residuated lattices, first proposed by Ward and Dilworth, is formalised in Isabelle/HOL. This includes concepts of residuated functions; their adjoints and conjugates. It also contains necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these operations in an arbitrary lattice. The mathematical components for residuated lattices are linked to the AFP entry for relation algebra. In particular, we prove Jonsson and Tsinakis conditions for a residuated boolean algebra to form a relation algebra.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sf.net/entries/Residuated_Lattices.shtml\">http://afp.sf.net/entries/Residuated_Lattices.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
