Several different SAT solver<br>\ndescriptions are given and their partial correctness and termination is<br>\nproved. These include:</p>\n<p>- a solver based on classical DPLL procedure (using only a<br>\nbacktrack-search with unit propagation),</p>\n<p>- a very general solver with backjumping and learning (similar to the<br>\ndescription given in (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2006)), and</p>\n<p>- a solver with a specific conflict analysis algorithm (similar to the<br>\ndescription given in (Krstic et al., 2007)).<br>\nWithin the SAT solver correctness proofs, a large number of lemmas<br>\nabout propositional logic and CNF formulae are proved. This theory is<br>\nself-contained and could be used for further exploring of properties of<br>\nCNF based SAT algorithms.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",
