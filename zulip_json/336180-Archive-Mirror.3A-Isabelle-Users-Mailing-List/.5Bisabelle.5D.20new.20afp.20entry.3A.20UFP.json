Brucker, Lukas Br√ºgger, and Burkhart Wolff</p>\n<p>Abstract:<br>\n We present the Unified Policy Framework (UPF), a generic framework<br>\n for modelling security (access-control) policies.q UPF emphasizes<br>\n the view that a policy is a policy decision function that grants or<br>\n denies access to resources, permissions, etc. In other words,<br>\n instead of modelling the relations of permitted or prohibited<br>\n requests directly, we model the concrete function that implements<br>\n the policy decision point in a system.  In more detail, UPF is<br>\n based on the following four principles: 1) Functional representation<br>\n of policies, 2) No conflicts are possible, 3) Three-valued decision<br>\n type (allow, deny, undefined), 4) Output type not containing the<br>\n decision only.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://afp.sf.net/entries/UPF.shtml\">http://afp.sf.net/entries/UPF.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
