If it turns out to be useful, I <br>\nwould be happy to contribute it to the Isabelle distribution.</p>\n<p>The theory files for the Bits library are available at my homepage: <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.csee.ogi.edu/~brianh/isabelle/Bits.tar.gz\">http://www.csee.ogi.edu/~brianh/isabelle/Bits.tar.gz</a></p>\n<p>Note that you will need to use a recent developer snapshot of Isabelle, <br>\nalthough it might work with Isabelle 2005 with only minor changes.</p>\n<p>The library defines type constructors for n-bit words and for integers mod n, <br>\nwhere the parameter n is given using a numeric syntax for types. For example, <br>\n\"16 bits\" is how to write the type of 16-bit integers. The bitwise operators <br>\nNOT, AND, OR and XOR are defined on n-bit words and type int. They are shown <br>\nto satisfy all the properties of a boolean algebra, and simplification of <br>\nbitwise operations on numeric literals is also supported.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brian</li>\n</ul>",
