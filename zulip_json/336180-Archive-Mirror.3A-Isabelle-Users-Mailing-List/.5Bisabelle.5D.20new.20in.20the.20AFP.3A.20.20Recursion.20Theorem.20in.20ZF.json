And so somehow, the first ever AFP entry for Isabelle/ZF has been followed by a second entry: \"Recursion Theorem in ZF\", by Georgy Dunaev:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This document contains a proof of the recursion theorem. This is a mechanization of the proof of the recursion theorem from the text Introduction to Set Theory, by Karel Hrbacek and Thomas Jech. This implementation may be used as the basis for a model of Peano arithmetic in ZF. While recursion and the natural numbers are already available in Isabelle/ZF, this clean development is much easier to follow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Itâ€™s online at <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Recursion-Addition.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Recursion-Addition.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
