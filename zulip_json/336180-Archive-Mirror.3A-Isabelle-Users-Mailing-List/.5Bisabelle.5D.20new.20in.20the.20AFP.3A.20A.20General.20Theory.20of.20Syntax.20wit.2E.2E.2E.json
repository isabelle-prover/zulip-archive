Terms are defined for an arbitrary number of<br>\nconstructors of varying numbers of inputs, quotiented to<br>\nalpha-equivalence and sorted according to a binding signature. The<br>\ntheory includes many properties of the standard operators on terms:<br>\nsubstitution, swapping and freshness. It also includes bindings-aware<br>\ninduction and recursion principles and support for semantic<br>\ninterpretation. This work has been presented in the ITP 2017 paper “A<br>\nFormalized General Theory of Syntax with Bindings”.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
