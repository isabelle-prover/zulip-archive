This work is described in detail in an article by the authors, published in 2017 in the Journal of Automated Reasoning. The abstract proof can be instantiated for various formalisms, including first-order logic with inductive predicates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Abstract_Soundness.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Abstract_Soundness.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
