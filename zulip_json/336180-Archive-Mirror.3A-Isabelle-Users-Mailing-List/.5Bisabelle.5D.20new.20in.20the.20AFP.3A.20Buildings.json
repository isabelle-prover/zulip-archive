Along the way, we develop some of the general theory of abstract simplicial complexes and of groups (relying on the group_add class for the basics), including free groups and group presentations, and their universal properties. The main results verified are that the deletion condition is both necessary and sufficient for a group with a set of generators of order two to be a Coxeter system, and that the apartments in a (thick) building are all uniformly Coxeter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Buildings.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Buildings.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
