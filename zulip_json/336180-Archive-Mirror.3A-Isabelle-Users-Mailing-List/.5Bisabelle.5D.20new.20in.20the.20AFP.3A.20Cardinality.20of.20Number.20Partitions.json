The main<br>\n proof shows that the recursively-defined partition function with arguments<br>\n n and k equals the cardinality of number partitions of n with exactly k parts.<br>\n The combinatorial proof follows the proof sketch of Theorem 2.4.1 in<br>\n Mazur's textbook <code>Combinatorics: A Guided Tour</code>. This entry can serve as<br>\n starting point for various more intrinsic properties about number partitions,<br>\n the partition function and related recurrence relations.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to Lukas Bulwahn for this contribution!</p>\n<p>Larry</p>",
