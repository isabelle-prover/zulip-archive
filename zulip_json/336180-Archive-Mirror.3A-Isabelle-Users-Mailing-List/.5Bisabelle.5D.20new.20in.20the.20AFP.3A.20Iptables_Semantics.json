We provide algorithms to simplify complex iptables rulests to a simple firewall model (c.f. AFP entry Simple_Firewall) and to verify spoofing protection of a ruleset. Internally, we embed our semantics into ternary logic, ultimately supporting every iptables match condition by abstracting over unknowns. Using this AFP entry and all entries it depends on, we created an easy-to-use, stand-alone haskell tool called fffuu. The tool does not require any input —except for the iptables-save dump of the analyzed firewall— and presents interesting results about the user's ruleset. Real-Word firewall errors have been uncovered, and the correctness of rulesets has been proved, with the help of our tool.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Iptables_Semantics.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Iptables_Semantics.shtml</a></p>\n<p>There is a separate session of examples, which apparently take several hours to run!</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
