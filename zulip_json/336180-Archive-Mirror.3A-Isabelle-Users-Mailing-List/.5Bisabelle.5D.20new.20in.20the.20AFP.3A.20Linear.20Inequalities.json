The main results are the proof of the fundamental theorem on linear inequalities, Farkas' lemma, Carathéodory's theorem, the Farkas-Minkowsky-Weyl theorem, the decomposition theorem of polyhedra, and Meyer's result that the integer hull of a polyhedron is a polyhedron itself. Several theorems include bounds on the appearing numbers, and in particular we provide an a-priori bound on mixed-integer solutions of linear inequalities.</p>\n<p>[https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Linear_Inequalities.html]</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
