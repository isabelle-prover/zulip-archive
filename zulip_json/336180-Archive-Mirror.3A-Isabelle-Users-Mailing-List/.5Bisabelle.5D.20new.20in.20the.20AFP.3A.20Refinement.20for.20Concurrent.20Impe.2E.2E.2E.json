(CSF 2016) presents a compositional theory of refinement for a value-dependent noninterference property, defined in (Murray, PLAS 2015), for concurrent programs. This development formalises that refinement theory, and demonstrates its application on some small examples.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Dependent_SIFUM_Refinement.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Dependent_SIFUM_Refinement.shtml</a></p>",
