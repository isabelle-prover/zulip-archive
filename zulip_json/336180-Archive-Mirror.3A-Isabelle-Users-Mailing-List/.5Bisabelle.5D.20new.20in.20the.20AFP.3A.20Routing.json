A routing table entry is modelled as a record of a prefix match, a metric, an output port, and an optional next hop. A routing table is a list of entries, sorted by prefix length and metric. Additionally, a parser and serializer for the output of the ip-route command, a function to create a relation from output port to corresponding destination IP space, and a model of a Linux-style router are included.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Full details here: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Routing.shtml\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Routing.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
