It supports extraction of satisfying assignments, extraction of unsatisfiable cores, incremental assertion of constraints and backtracking. Formalization relies on stepwise program refinement, starting from a simple specification, going through a number of refinement steps, and ending up in a fully executable functional implementation. Symmetries present in the algorithm are handled with special care.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Simplex.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Simplex.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
