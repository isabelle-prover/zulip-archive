These polynomials are important in the study of the relationship between the coefficients of a univariate polynomial and its roots in its algebraic closure. This article provides a definition of symmetric polynomials and the elementary symmetric polynomials e1,…,en and proofs of their basic properties.”</p>\n<p>You can download it here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Symmetric_Polynomials.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Symmetric_Polynomials.html</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
