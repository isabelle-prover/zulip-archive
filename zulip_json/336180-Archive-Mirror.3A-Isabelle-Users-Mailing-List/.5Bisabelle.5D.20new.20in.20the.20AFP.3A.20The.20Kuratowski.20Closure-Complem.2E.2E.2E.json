In addition, we prove a theorem due to Chagrov (1982) that classifies topological spaces according to the number of such operators they support.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Kuratowski_Closure_Complement.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Kuratowski_Closure_Complement.html</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br>\nGerwin</p>",
