In particular the ones listed in:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.dsi.dsi.unifi.it/~resp/GouldBK.pdf\">http://www.dsi.dsi.unifi.it/~resp/GouldBK.pdf</a><br>\nI have managed \"verify\" the first equation \"BS\"</p>\n<p>lemma Isa_BS:<br>\n     assumes kn: \"m ≤ n\"<br>\n     shows \"(n choose m) = (n choose (n-m))\"<br>\n     using assms<br>\n     apply (rule  Binomial.binomial_symmetric)<br>\n     done<br>\n(suggestions appreciated!!)</p>\n<p>I wish to extend/expand/define the choose function to<br>\n(n choose m)  to n negative.<br>\nThis is the second item in GouldBK.pdf<br>\nand in<br>\nRiordan's \"Introduction to Combinatorial Analysis\" page 5<br>\nand elsewhere<br>\nMy question is strategic.  Should I just introduce a new \"type\" and <br>\nfilter the input into Binomial.thy or go through the whole definition <br>\nphase copying (or something) Binomial.thy.  Possibly there is a way to <br>\nuse \"gbinomial\" but I am not there yet.  Or use the normal field <br>\nextension process somehow?  Using (a,b) over a; and defining <br>\nmultiplication and addition.<br>\nIs there a tutorial with examples using Binomial.thy (and the fps <br>\ntheory)?  There seems to be some peculiarities using \"=\" instead of <br>\n\"--&gt;\" but that is probably just ignorance.</p>\n<p>Ray</p>",

It<br>\nworks for pretty much anything as the first argument, but the second<br>\nargument must be a natural numbers. Seeing as we have the Gamma and Beta<br>\nfunctions in HOL-Analysis, one could also easily extend it to complex<br>\nnumbers.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what field extensions have to do with any of this. What<br>\nfield are you talking about? What do you want to extend it to? What does<br>\nthat have to do with binomial coefficients?</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Manuel</p>",

Some of the techniques in the paper are long and not <br>\ntoo obvious (to me).<br>\nPerhaps my use of \"field extension\" was inappropriate.<br>\nMy intuition is that if you are lacking something that is reasonable you <br>\ncan extend a base set a by (a,b) and form a new set.  For instance:<br>\n  adding negative numbers to the naturals,<br>\ncreating fractions from integers<br>\nsolutions to x^2-2=0<br>\nand of course \"imaginary numbers\"<br>\nOf course you have to prove consistency and such.<br>\nThe procedures seem fairly standard at an intuitive level.<br>\nIs there a standard template/example/constructor in Isabelle for this <br>\nsort of thing?  So a construct can be introduced and checked for <br>\nconsistency.<br>\nFor binomials: I could imagine (a choose b, -c choose d) with a,b,c,d <br>\nnatural numbers and then defining equivalence relations between the <br>\nfirst and second slots.  Putting this sort of thing into Isabelle seems <br>\nreasonable but I don't know how (yet) and hopefully I don't have to <br>\nsince gchoose exists.</p>\n<p>Ray</p>",

But you shouldn’t need to do that to prove these binomial identities. Several of the earlier ones on your list have been proved already in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",

Mostly on <br>\nauto-pilot but I have to start somewhere; I'm kinda slow. Starting on <br>\nFormal_Power_Series (fps) theory.  That looks a little harder but is <br>\ngreat; since it has examples in the .thy file. Actually the fps is quite <br>\nimpressive and probably has all of the obvious Gould requirements.<br>\nAs another exercise: do you know if anybody has encoded Roman's \"Umbral <br>\nCalculus\" reasoning?  If  not, I might do it.  He does an excellent job <br>\nexplaining and<br>\nI have a variation that would be interesting to tie down.<br>\nRay</p>",
