After that, Grothendieck re-proved this result using cohomology and his approach was extended to the proofs of other statements conjectured by Weil.</p>\n<p>The consensus is that Grothendieck-Deligne’s approach is better than p-adic analysis in order to prove Weil’s conjectures and related subjects, because cohomology reduces computations. Nevertheless, such a consensus among mathematicians does not take into account the power of automatic reasoning in proof assistants.</p>\n<p>It would be impressive, to the degree of getting a Field medal, if someone is capable of finding a new proof of all the Weil’s conjectures using p-adic analysis and not cohomology. The extensive calculations involved in the p-adic approach may be impossible for humans, but not for a computer. Such a research may open a way to prove Riemann’s hypothesis using the automatic reasoning Isabelle/HOL, because Riemann’s hypothesis is a variation of Weil’s conjecture.</p>\n<p>Good luck to the adventures (I am not going myself in that direction)<br>\nJosé M.</p>",
