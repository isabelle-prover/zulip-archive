The old plan to have document preparation without batch build <br>\ninside the Prover IDE is still not implemented.</p>\n<p>Note that \"isabelle mkroot -d\" as explained in the \"system\" manual will do <br>\nmost of the work to setup a session with document preparation according to <br>\ncurrent standards.  It works the same in Isabelle2013-2 and <br>\nIsabelle2014-RC0.</p>\n<p>What changed in Isabelle2014-RC0 a little is the Console/Scala shell <br>\ninside the Prover IDE.  It now allows to run the batch job<br>\ndirectly like this:</p>\n<p>import isabelle._</p>\n<p>Build.build(PIDE.options.value, new Build.Console_Progress,<br>\nselect_dirs = List(Path.explode(\"~/Slides/Isabelle_Workshop_2014\")))</p>\n<p>Here you see that I am presently preparing slides for the huge VSL 2014 <br>\nevent next week.</p>\n<p>Running directly from Isabelle/Scala inside the Prover IDE saves a few <br>\nseconds JVM warmup time.  Scala is also a bit better as system programming <br>\nlanguage than GNU bash, although there is sometimes more to type.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
