I do not ever<br>\nwant to use any of these features, so I have unchecked them in the<br>\nIsabelle &gt; Settings menus in ProofGeneral, and saved them to my .emacs<br>\nusing Isabelle &gt; Settings &gt; Save Settings. I can see that the settings<br>\nwere saved properly, since the following lines appear in my .emacs<br>\nfile, in the custom-set-variables section:</p>\n<p>'(isar-display:eta-contract nil)<br>\n '(isar-tracing:auto-quickcheck nil)<br>\n '(isar-tracing:auto-solve nil)<br>\n '(isar-tracing:auto-solve-direct nil)</p>\n<p>When I start a new Isabelle session in ProofGeneral, these settings<br>\nare all disabled, as they should be. However, if I stop the Isabelle<br>\nprocess with C-c C-x, and then start it again, these options magically<br>\nturn themselves on! It is very annoying to have to dig through 3<br>\nlevels of menus to turn each one of them off again. The \"Auto<br>\n&lt;whatever&gt;\" options are especially problematic because they can slow<br>\ndown theory processing so much.</p>\n<p>Has anyone else experience a similar problem? And is there any way to<br>\nfix it, short of changing the hardwired default settings in the<br>\nIsabelle sources, and recompiling all my heap images?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brian</li>\n</ul>",

However, I just<br>\ntried reverting to 4.1pre101216, and I get the exact same behavior as<br>\nfar as I can tell. Using \"Save Settings\" doesn't change any relevant<br>\nlines in my .emacs file. I am using PG with GNU Emacs 23.2.1.</p>\n<p>For now, I think I will be recompiling my Isabelle2011 heap images<br>\nwith different hardwired defaults.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brian</li>\n</ul>",
