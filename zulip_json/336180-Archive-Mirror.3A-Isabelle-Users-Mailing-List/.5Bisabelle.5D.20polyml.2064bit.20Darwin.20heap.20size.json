The error message is</p>\n<p>val it = (): unit<br>\nML&gt; Exception- SysErr (\"Cannot allocate memory\", SOME ENOMEM) raised</p>\n<p>(This is from an Isabelle build of the image CBaseRefine in <a href=\"https://github.com/seL4/l4v/tree/master/proof\">https://github.com/seL4/l4v/tree/master/proof</a>)</p>\n<p>The initial heap size was specified as “-H 2000”. Playing around with that option, I got for instance for “-H 8000” the message:</p>\n<p>\"Value of -H option is too large\"</p>\n<p>I’m getting the same for trying to increase —maxheap. The same -H 8000 option on a 64-bit Linux machine works fine.</p>\n<p>The check that throws this error seems to be:</p>\n<p>libpolyml/mpoly.cpp:177</p>\n<p>// Check that the number of kbytes is less than the address space.<br>\n    // The value could overflow when converted to bytes.<br>\n    if (result &gt;= ((POLYUNSIGNED)1 &lt;&lt; (SIZEOF_VOIDP*8 - 10)))<br>\n        Usage(\"Value of %s option is too large\\n\", arg);</p>\n<p>As far as I can see, config sets the value of SIZEOF_VOIDP to 8 on both platforms, so I’m a bit mystified why one works and the other doesn’t.</p>\n<p>The polyml version is 5.5.2 (-3 in the Isabelle distribution, but same problem for vanilla 5.5.2).</p>\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The information in this e-mail may be confidential and subject to legal professional privilege and/or copyright.
