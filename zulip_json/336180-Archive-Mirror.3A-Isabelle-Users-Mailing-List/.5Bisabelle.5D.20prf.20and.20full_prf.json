So if you spot something somewhere, you just make a <br>\nformally checked example like this:</p>\n<p>text {*  @{prf reflexive}  *}</p>\n<p>Then you ask the Prover IDE to jump to the source text for \"prf\".  In the <br>\ntarget you continue with plain jEdit hypersearch etc. to get an idea how <br>\nit all fits together.</p>\n<p>Since proof terms are rarely used, there might be some inconveniences and <br>\nsnags on your way, but that is to be expected.  For the current release, <br>\nI've made a few renovations together with Stefan Berghofer, but it is not <br>\nfully up-to-date in every sense.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
