Now, I noticed that when a variable <br>\nhas the name is reserved in the current outer syntax (for example, a variable called <br>\noracle), then there are no quotes around the fixed variable.</p>\n<p>Here's an example:</p>\n<p>lemma foo: \"oracle = 0 ==&gt; 0 = oracle\" by simp<br>\n   print_statement foo<br>\n   (* output:<br>\n   theorem foo:<br>\n     fixes oracle :: \"'a\"<br>\n       and x :: \"'a\"<br>\n     assumes \"oracle = x\"<br>\n     shows \"x = oracle\"<br>\n   *)</p>\n<p>Could print_statement be changed such that the output encloses the variable \"oracle\" in <br>\nquotes? I.e.:</p>\n<p>theorem foo:<br>\n     fixes \"oracle\" :: \"'a\"<br>\n       and x :: \"'a\"<br>\n     assumes \"oracle = x\"<br>\n     shows \"x = oracle\"</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
