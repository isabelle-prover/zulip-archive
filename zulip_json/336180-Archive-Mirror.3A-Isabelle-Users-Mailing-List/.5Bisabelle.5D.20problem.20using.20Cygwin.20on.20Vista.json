These precompiled <br>\nbinaries have been created on XP/SP3, so there is some chance that there is a <br>\nproblem running them on Vista, although I've heard from people who managed <br>\nthat.</p>\n<p>Since this is Poly/ML 5.2 from the Isabelle2008 distribution, I do recommend to <br>\ntry PolyML/ML 5.2.1 from the current Isabelle2009 distribution.</p>\n<p>Also make sure that your Cygwin is up-to-date.</p>\n<p>If Poly/ML 5.2.1 still crashes on you, just compile it yourself from the <br>\nsources, according to the included README.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can also work with a virtual Linux installation, say Ubuntu <br>\non top of Virtualbox (it usually takes less than 1h to install the whole <br>\nsystem).</p>\n<p>Makarius<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/hJugTmonVNwYU3LtOofEIjGv/README\">README</a></p>",
