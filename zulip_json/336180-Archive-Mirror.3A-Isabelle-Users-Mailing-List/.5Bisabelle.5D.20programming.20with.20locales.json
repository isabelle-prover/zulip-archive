Do_pred indicates whether predicates <br>\nshould be defined; this is the default behaviour in theory files, so<br>\n   do_pred = true<br>\nand<br>\n   name = \"globals\".<br>\nThe imported expression is empty,<br>\n   import = Locale.empty.<br>\nThe type of elements is declared in Pure/Isar/element.ML.  You need<br>\n   Fixes [(\"x_address\", \"nat\", NoSyn)],<br>\n   Assumes [((\"x_nzero\", []), [(\"x_address ~= 0\", ([], []))]),<br>\n     ((\"x_aligned\", []), [(\"4 dvd x_address\", ([], [])))])]<br>\nHope this is all type-correct!  The _i variant, as usual, certifies <br>\nterms rather then readiing strings, so that's probably the version you <br>\nwant to use.</p>\n<p>Add_locale returns (besides of the theory) a context.  This is only <br>\nused for printing locales in document preparation and should be <br>\ndiscarded.  Most recent development versions also return the internal <br>\nname of the locale (which is qualified by the theory name).</p>\n<p>Note that defines elements are part of the specification.  They cannot <br>\nbe added later.</p>\n<p>Hope this gets you started!</p>\n<p>Clemens</p>",
