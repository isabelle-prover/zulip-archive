You need the assumptions that both xs and ys <br>\nare non-empty --- see your own proof. If you have those, you can convert <br>\nfrom xs ~= [] to EX a as. xs = a#as (similarly for ys) by simplifying <br>\nwith neq_Nil_conv. The rest is done by auto.</p>\n<p>Tobias</p>\n<p>Gregory Kulczycki schrieb:</p>",
