I'm not sure what it is in this case, but it obviously failing. Write</p>\n<p>proof -</p>\n<p>to open a proof without attempting a proof method.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you try to develop a structured proof by experimenting with lines of the form “apply &lt;method&gt;\", you may find that everything fails for no apparent reason. It is the same reason as before, and can be fixed by ensuring that your first line is “apply -\". This is particularly important if you have chained facts.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",
