Record.thy, only label the  <br>\nThm parts of the<br>\nproof tree with the short name of the theorem, eg. \"induct\", when  <br>\nthis is suppose<br>\nto signify \"Record.product_type.induct\".<br>\nSee, eg. the proof of \"Record.product_type.surjective_pairing\"<br>\nIt is rather difficult to figure out when I'm<br>\ndealing with a locale theorem, and then I can imagine when two  <br>\nlocales are open<br>\nat once and this will be doubly confusing.  Even if only one locale  <br>\nis open, it's an ugly<br>\nhack to figure out which \"induct\" you mean, as there are many.<br>\nWould marking the Thm nodes in this way be a problem?  If so, please  <br>\nsuggest<br>\na workaround.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Sean</p>",
