Hence I was not<br>\nsurprised that when trying to extract programs from my own (classical)<br>\nproofs, the algorithm failed.</p>\n<p>Hence I was wondering: Are you (or of course anyone else on the list) aware<br>\nof any work on implementing some functional interpretation of classical<br>\nproofs (e.g. by using double-negation + A-translation, or the Shoenfield<br>\nfunctional interpretation) in Isabelle?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nDaniel</p>",

See also the following NEWS entry for Isabelle2013-1 (November 2013):</p>\n<p>* System option \"proofs\" has been discontinued.  Instead the global<br>\n     state of Proofterm.proofs is persistently compiled into logic images<br>\n     as required, notably HOL-Proofs.  Users no longer need to change<br>\n     Proofterm.proofs dynamically.  Minor INCOMPATIBILITY.</p>\n<p>Note that compiling the HOL-Proofs image may require quite some time and memory.</p>\n<p>Greetings,<br>\nStefan</p>",
