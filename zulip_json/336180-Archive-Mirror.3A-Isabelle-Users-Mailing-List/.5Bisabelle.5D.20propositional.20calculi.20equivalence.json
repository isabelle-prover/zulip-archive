Now I'm teaching myself some mathematical<br>\nlogic (back to the foundations!). My question is: how to use Isabelle<br>\nto establish the equivalence of different propositional calculi, say<br>\nHilbert-style vs. LK sequent calculus (restricted to propositional<br>\nlogic)?<br>\nI hope I'm making myself clear. Any pointers would be appreciated.<br>\nThanks in advance,</p>",

Just make sure that you formalize your<br>\nlogics inside a logic that has induction, eg HOL. Do NOT formalize them<br>\nas Isabelle object logics, because Isabelle's meta logic does not have<br>\ninduction (and is not meant to formalize the relationship between<br>\ndifferent calculi).</p>\n<p>Tobias</p>\n<p>Hector Villafuerte schrieb:</p>",
