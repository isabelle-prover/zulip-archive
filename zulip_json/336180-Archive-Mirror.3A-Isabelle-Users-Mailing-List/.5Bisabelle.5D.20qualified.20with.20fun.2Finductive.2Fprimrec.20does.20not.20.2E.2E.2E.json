According to <br>\nIsar-ref, a qualified name is accessible outside of the context block only with additional <br>\nqualification. This seems to work fine for constants and plain definitions, but I run into <br>\nproblems with packages like fun, inductive and primrec. The defined constants are only <br>\naccessibly with qualification, but not the generated theorems. Thus, they take precedence <br>\nover existing theorem names, which somewhat defeats the purpose of using qualified.</p>\n<p>Below is a small example. Here, the generated theorem from the context rev.simps shadows <br>\nthe existing theorem List.rev.simps. This makes qualified much less useful. Is there any <br>\nother way how I can avoid the shadowing? hide_fact (open) does not work either, here.</p>\n<p>theory Scratch imports Main begin</p>\n<p>term rev (* refers to List.rev *)<br>\nthm rev.simps (* refers to List.rev.simps *)</p>\n<p>context begin<br>\nqualified fun rev :: \"nat â‡’ nat\" where \"rev x = x\"<br>\nend</p>\n<p>term Scratch.rev (* refers to Scratch.rev as desired *)<br>\nterm rev (* refers List.rev *)</p>\n<p>thm rev.simps (* refers to Scratch.rev.simps, but should to List.rev.simps *)</p>\n<p>end</p>\n<p>Andreas</p>",

In the examples considered <br>\nhere, names like \"rev.simps\" are already qualified, so the is no change. <br>\nIt was always like that, but it does not mean that further reforms are not <br>\npossible.  After the release, I would like to re-open the can concerning <br>\nqualified name bindings again, to see if even more useful name space <br>\npolicies can be allowed.</p>\n<p>The present confusion is probably due to the wording \"additional <br>\nqualification\" in the isar-ref manual.  I've changed that here: <br>\n<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/commits/1f9e08394d46\">https://bitbucket.org/isabelle_project/isabelle-release/commits/1f9e08394d46</a></p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
