[| a = b ==&gt; ?P (b # l); a = b ==&gt; ?P (b # l); a<br>\n\\&lt;noteq&gt; b ==&gt; ?P l; a \\&lt;noteq&gt; b ==&gt; ?P l |] ==&gt; ?P (a # b # l);<br>\n ?P []; \\&lt;And&gt;v. ?P [v] |]<br>\n==&gt; ?P ?a0.0</p>\n<p>where both cases \"a = b\" and \"a \\&lt;noteq&gt; b\" appear twice, which does<br>\nnot pose any limitation but may result a bit annoying when trying to<br>\nnumber hypothesis.</p>\n<p>May somebody know a way to avoid this behaviour?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\n<p>Jesus</p>",

The function package never does  <br>\nsuch things automatically, in order to have a predictable berhaviour.  <br>\nIf you know what rule you would like to see, you can also state it  <br>\nyourself and use the \"induct_scheme\" method to derive it, usually  <br>\nalmost automatically. See ch. 5 of my thesis for details<br>\n(<a href=\"http://www4.in.tum.de/~krauss/diss/krauss_phd.pdf\">http://www4.in.tum.de/~krauss/diss/krauss_phd.pdf</a>).</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nAlex</p>",
