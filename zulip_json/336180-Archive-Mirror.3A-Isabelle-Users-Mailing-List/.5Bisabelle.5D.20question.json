While formalisation is, of course, much easier when you<br>\nalready have a solid idea of /why/ the theorem you're trying to prove<br>\nholds, I often find it very helpful to just write down a theorem<br>\nstatement in Isabelle and prove away even if I don't have the first idea<br>\nwhy it should hold.</p>\n<p>For instance, in my Bachelor's thesis, I had to prove that some<br>\ninvariant (that I first had to find, so I wasn't even sure if it was the<br>\nright one) is preserved throughout a loop. Isabelle told me precisely<br>\nwhat facts I could use and what I had to prove – which is hard to keep<br>\ntrack of in your head with a large proof such as this – and I proved<br>\neverything in a short amount of time; by simply exploring “forward”,<br>\ni.e. deriving everything I could think of from the assumptions I had,<br>\nand “backwards”, i.e. reducing what I had to prove to simpler<br>\nstatements, until everything fell into place. It was only much later<br>\nthat I actually understood /intuitively/ what I had proven.</p>\n<p>This is probably a rare case, normally you first understand something<br>\nand then formalise it, but Isabelle can help you to develop a proof from<br>\nscratch as well. I also found it very useful during homework, most<br>\nrecently in social choice theory. Nitpick is particularly useful to<br>\navoid wasting time trying to prove things that are simply wrong, and it<br>\nis also very useful for exercises such as “Prove or disprove X“ or “Show<br>\nthat in general, X does not hold”.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nManuel</p>",

That would have been far too big to do by hand<br>\nfirst (at least at the speed I write).  But when I couldn't easily keep<br>\na part of the proof in my head all at once, I'd draw myself a map of<br>\nwhich lemmas were required to prove which other lemmas, and then I could<br>\nconcentrate one at a time on any lemma such that all of the lemmas it<br>\ndepended on had already been formalized.  I've attached a couple of<br>\nexamples.  Having said that, I did do pen-and-paper working for some of<br>\nthe lemmas mentioned on those pages, though many of them went straight<br>\nfrom my head into Isabelle, probably including some that were never even<br>\nmentioned on the map.</p>\n<p>This suited my style well, but I suspect that the best strategy is<br>\nhighly dependent on the style of the person using it.  For me, I<br>\nnaturally tend to write proofs in more detail than most, so writing<br>\nproofs for Isabelle wasn't as much of a hurdle as it probably is for<br>\nsome other people.  And I grew up with computers, too; I often feel more<br>\ncomfortable writing a letter on a computer, rather than writing it by<br>\nhand, but some people prefer to write by hand first, even if they're<br>\ngoing to type up the result in the end.</p>\n<p>Tim<br>\n&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Tarskis_Geometry.shtml\">http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Tarskis_Geometry.shtml</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/vSTEGftoMUsCzk9bcs1umzUP/IMG_20140125_125138.jpg\">IMG_20140125_125138.jpg</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/39ZSO5S_kDASy-dzzL4ZIna7/IMG_20140125_125401.jpg\">IMG_20140125_125401.jpg</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/YQlxS-LdxM5V4jye8mMYvhQ5/signature.asc\">signature.asc</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/vSTEGftoMUsCzk9bcs1umzUP/IMG_20140125_125138.jpg\" title=\"IMG_20140125_125138.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/vSTEGftoMUsCzk9bcs1umzUP/IMG_20140125_125138.jpg\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/39ZSO5S_kDASy-dzzL4ZIna7/IMG_20140125_125401.jpg\" title=\"IMG_20140125_125401.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/14278/39ZSO5S_kDASy-dzzL4ZIna7/IMG_20140125_125401.jpg\"></a></div>",
