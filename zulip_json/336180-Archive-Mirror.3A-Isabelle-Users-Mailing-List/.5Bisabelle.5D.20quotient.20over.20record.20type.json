Later the <br>\npackage has acquired more and more features and sophistication, both for <br>\nsyntax and proof tools.</p>\n<p>Note that as plain type abbreviation, you would see the expansion <br>\ndirectly, which is sometimes not exactly desired, but would help here for <br>\nclarity. Since the record package puts its own syntax translation candy <br>\nover the basic type syntax it is hard to see to the bottom of it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, using Isabelle/jEdit \"CONTROL hover click\" over the 'record' <br>\nkeyword, or other means to get to ~~/src/HOL/Tools/record.ML, easily <br>\nreveals some (undocumented) configuration options.  For example:</p>\n<p>record my_record =<br>\n   foo :: \"nat\"<br>\n   bar :: \"int\"</p>\n<p>declare [[record_type_abbr = false]]<br>\ndeclare [[record_type_as_fields = false]]<br>\ntyp my_record</p>\n<p>An old version of these options were mentioned in Isabelle2004/NEWS, but <br>\nthey did not make it into the IsarRef manual so far.</p>\n<p>I have also a question about quotients.  The \"Q3\" seen above has passed by <br>\nseveral in times recently, but I did not find an explanation of it. Are <br>\nthere now three quotient packages?  Is there a chance to get back to just <br>\none?</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
