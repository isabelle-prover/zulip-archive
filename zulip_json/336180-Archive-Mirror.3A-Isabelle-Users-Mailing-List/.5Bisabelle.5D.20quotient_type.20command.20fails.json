If not, please refer me <br>\nto the right place.<br>\nApparently in Isabelle 2013-2 the quotient_type command doesn't work, <br>\nif the theory name contains white-space.<br>\nIn my testcase the theory was called \"With Whitespace\" and the command <br>\nproduced the following error:</p>\n<p>attribute \"Lifting.lifting_restore_internal\": bad arguments<br>\n     Whitespace.foo.lifting</p>\n<p>I attached a testcase for the problem to reproduce the issue. One <br>\ntheory called \"WithoutWhitespace.thy\", which works fine, and a copy <br>\nrenamed to \"With Whitespace.thy\", which fails.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nSalomon<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/i6cwgnsWnHDmldTr-wg1rLca/With-Whitespace.thy\">With Whitespace.thy</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/14278/ahCX-36A7EtQwD9qsbm36WxS/WithoutWhitespace.thy\">WithoutWhitespace.thy</a></p>",

Anything else feels a bit <br>\ninconsistent.</p>\n<p>Apart from that:</p>\n<p>Guessing from the error output, I would say that some function is <br>\nsplitting the string containing theory names using whitespace as <br>\ndelimiter. Thus ends up with the theory name \"Whitespace\" and loses the <br>\n\"With \" part.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nSalomon Sickert</p>",
