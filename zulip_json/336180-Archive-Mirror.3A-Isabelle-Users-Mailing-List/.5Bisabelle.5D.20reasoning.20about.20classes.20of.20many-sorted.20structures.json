In the recent snapshot development <br>\nthere is theory in HOL/Library/Finite_Cartesian_Product.thy which <br>\nintroduces a new type constructor \"'a ^ 'n\" which represents 'a * ... 'a<br>\nand this as many times as 'n has inhabitants. This is true only if 'n <br>\nhas finitely many inhabitants.</p>\n<p>Of course this is more restrictive that an abstract view, but better <br>\nthan nothing. You can also look at an other new theory in <br>\nHOL/Library/Euclidean_Space.thy, where it is shown that e.g is 'a is a <br>\ngroup, then so is 'a^'n etc. for several interesting algebraic classes. <br>\nSo you get implicitly that it is a vector space (there is scalar <br>\nmultiplication) but this is not a class.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you want to have thing really general and nice, <br>\nyou could use locales.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nAmine.</p>\n<p>Andrei Popescu wrote:</p>",
