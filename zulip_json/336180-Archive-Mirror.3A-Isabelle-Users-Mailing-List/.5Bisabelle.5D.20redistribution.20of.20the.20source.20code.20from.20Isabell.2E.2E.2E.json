Hopefully, my understanding/interpretation of the<br>\nlegalese involved is correct. However, I would like to confirm<br>\nmy understanding with someone more knowledgeable.</p>\n<p>It is my understanding that HOL is a part of Isabelle and, therefore, it is<br>\ndistributed under the terms of the BSD license. Thus, if I am not mistaken,<br>\nI can amend and redistribute any code from HOL under a compatible license<br>\n(e.g. LGPL v3), provided that the file COPYRIGHT that is located in the top<br>\ndirectory of Isabelle is included together with the amended files from HOL.<br>\nIs it acceptable to rename the file COPYRIGHT (e.g. to COPYRIGHT-ISABELLE)?<br>\nDoes it need to be located in the top directory of the project that<br>\ncontains the amended file(s)? Are there any other files that I should<br>\ninclude? Should I provide any additional information?</p>\n<p>As a side note, I would like to mention that my intention is merely to<br>\ninclude some of the source code from several files that are located in<br>\n\"HOL/Types_To_Sets/Examples\" (with certain amendments) in my personal<br>\nproject that is licensed under LGPL v3.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
