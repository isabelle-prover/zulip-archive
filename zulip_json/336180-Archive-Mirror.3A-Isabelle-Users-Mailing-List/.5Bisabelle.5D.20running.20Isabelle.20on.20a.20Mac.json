Recent benchmarks suggest that the recently updated 27 inch iMac delivers much better performance. But I’ve been advised that Xeon chips are particularly good for multithreaded tasks, compared with the i9 chips used in the iMac. Does anybody have any experience of the latter?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks\">http://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks</a></p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",

I did this in the presence of an Apple <br>\nguy beside me, who was was quite impressed by the amount of cores that <br>\nwere used by our fine application (just Isabelle HOL + HOL-Analysis, no <br>\ntests of AFP). Overall performance looked pretty good in this test <br>\ndrive, but I don't have concrete numbers.</p>\n<p>Technical side-remark: Apple presumably has a standardized setup of test <br>\nmachines. You can do whatever you want as long as the OS configuration <br>\nlets you so. The staff can reset it later to return to a clean state, so <br>\nthey are normally not worried about arbitrary testing by customers.</p>\n<p>One thing you cannot do in the test configuration is to download an .app <br>\nbundle and run that as an application. But of course, you could just <br>\nopen a Terminal window an run <a href=\"http://Isabelle2019.app/Isabelle/bin/isabelle\">Isabelle2019.app/Isabelle/bin/isabelle</a> on <br>\nthe command-line (unless Apple has nailed down the OS even further in <br>\nthe meantime).</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
