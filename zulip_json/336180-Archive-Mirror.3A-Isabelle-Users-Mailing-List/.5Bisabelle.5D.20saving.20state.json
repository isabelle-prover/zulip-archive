My translator is coming along  <br>\nnicely,<br>\nbut maintains a rather extensive state (of name-mappings, etc.)<br>\nI'm trying to save the state so that you don't have to re-translate  <br>\neverything<br>\nwhen you start up the system.  I don't know anything about heap saving<br>\nin sml.  I'm only familiar with checkpointing in general, which  <br>\nprobably wouldn't<br>\nbe the right approach here.  I know Isabelle stores heap images, so I  <br>\nwas wondering<br>\nif it would be possible to extend the heap image or something.<br>\n   Alternatively, I could invent some kind of text format and read/ <br>\nwrite.  This seems<br>\nlike a pain though.</p>\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Sean</p>",
