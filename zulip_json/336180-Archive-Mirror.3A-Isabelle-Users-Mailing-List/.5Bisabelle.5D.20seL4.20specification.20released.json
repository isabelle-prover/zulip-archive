The C code of the kernel is verified (in Isabelle) to implement this specification. The release includes ARM and x86 binaries of the kernel, documentation, user-level libraries and examples, and a paravirtualised Linux that runs on top of seL4/x86:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ertos.nicta.com.au/software/seL4/\">http://ertos.nicta.com.au/software/seL4/</a></p>\n<p>The specification works with Isabelle2009-2, and the release contains all files and libraries necessary to process it in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>Please note that the release is for non-commercial only. Educational and academic research use is explicitly allowed. </p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGerwin</p>",
