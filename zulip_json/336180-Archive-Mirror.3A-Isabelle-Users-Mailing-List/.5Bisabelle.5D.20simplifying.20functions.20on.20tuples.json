For example I have a composition on<br>\nF_Type that, when applied to F(p,f) and F(p',f') reduces to:</p>\n<p>F(p,f) comp F(p',f') = F(inf p (p' o f),  f o f')</p>\n<p>I have also more complicated operations, and they all are<br>\nreduced to a composition of functions. The sizes of the tuples<br>\nare not fixed, and some of the operations change the<br>\nsize of the tuples.</p>\n<p>I have an expression of Fs and composition operators, and my<br>\ngoal is to simplify it to F(p,f), and have p and f as simple as possible.</p>\n<p>The main problem is that the tuples could be quite large (160 components<br>\nfor some example), and simplifying functions over these tuples<br>\nseems very slow.</p>\n<p>So far I came up with the following simplification pattern:</p>\n<p>I use the format \"\\lambda (x,y,z) . (x+y, x*x, z - 1)\" as the canonical<br>\nformat for functions (and predicates), and whenever I compose</p>\n<p>F(p,f) comp F(p',f')</p>\n<p>I compute p'', and f'' in canonical form such that<br>\nF(p'', f'') = F(p,f) comp F(p',f'),<br>\nand I prove this as a theorem.</p>\n<p>In order to compute f'', I take f o f' and I apply it to the tuple<br>\n(x,y,z,...), I simplify it and I get the theorem</p>\n<p>(A) \"/\\ x y x ... . (f o f') (x,y,z,...) = some expression on x, y, z\"</p>\n<p>and from this I abstract to</p>\n<p>(B) \"f o f' = (\\lambda (x,y,z, ...) . some expression on x, y, z)\"</p>\n<p>To get from (A) to (B), I construct dynamically a specific theorem for<br>\nthe tuple (x,y,z,...)</p>\n<p>The questions are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Is there a more efficient representation of functions on tuples<br>\nthat I can use?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is it possible to get from (A) to (B) using a generic theorem?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>Viorel Preoteasa</p>",
