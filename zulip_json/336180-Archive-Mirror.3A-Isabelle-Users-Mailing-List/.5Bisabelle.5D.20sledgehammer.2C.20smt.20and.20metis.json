All in all, it's a matter of calibration, of trade-offs. The state you described is clearly suboptimal, but things have changed a lot in the past year or so.</p>\n<p>So once you've upgraded to the repository version or the forthcoming Isabelle2015, keep an eye on proof reconstruction, and if you still feel things could be improved further, I would be happy to get your feedback. I have myself started using Isabelle and Sledgehammer (as opposed to developing it) and did notice a number of misfeatures, which I quickly resolved. I will still not claim that everything is perfect. ;)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, indeed a couple of Isar proofs generated by SH were readable, and I happily used them.<br>\nIt was a very nice sensation, by the way :)<br>\nI mean, reading a proof that nobody wrote.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks for the feedback!!</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
