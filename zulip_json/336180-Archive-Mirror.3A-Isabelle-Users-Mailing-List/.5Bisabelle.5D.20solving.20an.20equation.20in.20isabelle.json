But <br>\nisabelle can not solve this problem with auto.</p>\n<p>is there any other method for solving problems automatically (i have tried <br>\nsimp and arith too. )</p>\n<p>the important things in the equation are :</p>\n<p>(((y1-y2)^nat (p - 3)) - x1 ) ^3 = .....</p>\n<p>i think the use of nat and power may be a problem against the auto.</p>\n<p>can anybody recommend something?</p>\n<p>thanks</p>",

Yet I do'nt think that it would work for <br>\nthese instances. The key questions are:<br>\na) is nat a variable?<br>\nb) can you get rid of substraction (-) in your context</p>\n<p>If the answer to both is yes, then the method would work for you. <br>\nUnfortunately It might take time to include it.</p>\n<p>Otherwise try stuff like ring_eq_simps and add appropriate theorems for <br>\npower.</p>\n<p>Aemin.</p>",
