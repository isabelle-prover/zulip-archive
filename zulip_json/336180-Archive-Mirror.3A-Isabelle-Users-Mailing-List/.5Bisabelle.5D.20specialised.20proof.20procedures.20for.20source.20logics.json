In the paper \"Encoding<br>\ntwo-valued nonclassical logics\" [1], the authors say</p>\n<p>\"Predicate logic theorem provers which are highly optimized for the<br>\nparticular fragment of predicate logic which is the target of the<br>\ntranslation are not available.\"</p>\n<p>As this was written more than a decade ago, it can be that some<br>\nprogress has been made concerning predicate logic. Could someone point<br>\nto relevant literature?</p>\n<p>And, are there research results for higher order logic as a target logic?</p>\n<p>[1] Ohlbach, Nonnengart, de Rijke, Gabbay: Encoding two-valued<br>\nnonclassical logics, in: Handbook of Automated Reasoning</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gergely</li>\n</ul>",
