In particular, the HOL4 et <br>\nal., Mizar, Coq, Isabelle, etc. groups don't all choose to be a part of <br>\nthe springboard site.</p>\n<p>(3) Someone doesn't choose to make it practical for people to listen in <br>\non the small number of proof assistant, etc. related questions that will <br>\nbe asked on the springboard site.</p>\n<p>Now, I give my opinions about (1), (2), and (3).</p>\n<p>The challenge for (1) requires a list of 3 questions:</p>\n<p>(a) On what site are the experts who have knowledge that is most closely <br>\nrelated to proof assistants, etc.?</p>\n<p>(b) For that particular site, will those experts tolerate questions <br>\nabout proof assistants, etc.?</p>\n<p>(c) For that particular site, will those experts tolerate questions <br>\nabout proof assistants from non-experts?</p>\n<p>As an example, there is <a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com\">math.stackexchange.com</a>, and there is <br>\n<a href=\"http://mathoverflow.net\">mathoverflow.net</a>, and though mathoverflow is not a stackexchange site, <br>\nit is comparable.</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com\">math.stackexchange.com</a>, there are many experts in math, and they <br>\ntolerate a wide range of questions. On <a href=\"http://mathoverflow.net\">mathoverflow.net</a>, there are many <br>\nexperts in math, and many of those experts work to protect their domain, <br>\nto the point of keeping out advanced areas of math that overlap with <br>\nthings like computer science.</p>\n<p>I looked briefly at <a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/sites\">http://stackexchange.com/sites</a></p>\n<p>1.8m users, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\">http://stackoverflow.com/</a></p>\n<p>4.9k users, computer science, <a href=\"http://cs.stackexchange.com/\">http://cs.stackexchange.com/</a></p>\n<p>11k users, theoretical computer science, <a href=\"http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/\">http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/</a></p>\n<p>2.6K users, computational science, <a href=\"http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/\">http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/</a></p>\n<p>The choice of a site ties (1) and (2) together, because eventually for <br>\nany user, the important questions are not just about how to use the <br>\nsoftware, but also about the application.</p>\n<p>Based on my observation, if I was going to pick one word to describe the <br>\ngroup of experts that proof assistants, etc. revolve around, it would be <br>\n\"logician\". So it appears to me that the experts are mainly going to <br>\ncome from logicians, mathematicians, and computer scientists.</p>\n<p>So which of those four sites has the highest concentration of logicians, <br>\nmathematicians, and computer scientists who will be tolerant in the ways <br>\nI describe above?</p>\n<p>And to increase the size of the group of experts, you need the people I <br>\nlisted in (2) listening in. Someone using Coq would be more likely to <br>\nanswer certain questions of mine than someone using Isabelle, because <br>\ncertain questions will be more application specific than software specific.</p>\n<p>Finally, someone would need to make it practical for everyone to listen <br>\nin, like post a daily summary of the proof assistant, etc. questions <br>\nposted on the springboard site. I have <a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com\">math.stackexchange.com</a> in my RSS <br>\nreader, but I never check what messages are retrieved. At this time, I <br>\nhave only a very narrow interest, which happens to be learning how to <br>\nimplement some math in Isabelle, where the math is sufficiently <br>\nexplained in textbooks. I'm not going to browse the message titles <br>\nlooking for something very unlikely to be there.</p>\n<p>This daily summary email on lots of different mailing lists might make <br>\nthe specific site chosen less important. But you would need a <br>\ncombination of it being practical to find the pertinent, daily questions <br>\nusing a search, and the people on that site would need to not be hostile <br>\nto proof assistant, etc. questions.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nGB</p>",

But, <a href=\"http://discourse.org\">discourse.org</a> also requires a person to have an account, <br>\nso if you're looking for the most potential traffic, then you pick the <br>\nsite which has the largest number of people with accounts.</p>\n<p>The other general downside is the voting, but that's independent of all <br>\nthis, and they're all going to have that, and the voting raises the <br>\nquality of questions in some ways. That's my observation. I don't have a <br>\nstackexchange or mathoverflow account.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nGB</p>",

I knew how to put a stackexchange site in my RSS reader, but <br>\nI've never even considered the idea that the tags are there to get a RSS <br>\nfeed. And the nature of tags is that there can be a lot of overlap, and <br>\npeople don't take the time to tag things in a way that all the <br>\ninformation can be found based on tags.</p>\n<p>But even now, my motivation remains low to put any thought into <br>\nstackexchange as a meaningful source of information about Isabelle. I <br>\nsee here a total of four questions that are tagged \"Isabelle\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/isabelle\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/isabelle</a></p>\n<p>If I was going to make another point in my initial email it would be this:</p>\n<p>The people who are running these proof assistant shows will have to<br>\n    promote the use of a stackexchange site for it to become, any time<br>\n    soon, a hub of activity for proof assistants.</p>\n<p>I present an analogy. If none of the proof assistant groups promoted <br>\ntheir mailing lists on their web sites, would very many people subscribe <br>\nto their mailing lists?</p>\n<p>It's a common problem. To get people to jump on the bandwagon so you're <br>\nnot forgotten, you have attain critical mass. You can't attain critical <br>\nmass because no one will jump on the bandwagon, which leads to everyone <br>\ntotally forgetting about you, tuning you out, and turning you off, to <br>\nwhere you've lost any ability to get their attention, because you got <br>\ntaken out of their RSS reader, or got unsubscribed to because your <br>\nchannel was a dead channel.</p>\n<p>I'll try to make this my last comment about this. Getting all this going <br>\nis way bigger than me. It's not my problem; it's just I have lots of <br>\nopinions.</p>\n<p>People higher up on the ladder like you would have to get things rolling.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nGB</p>",
