I can't recall all of them on the spot.</p>\n<p>Any change will inevitably break many things and require years to sort it <br>\nout.  So as usual there need to be 2-3 really good reasons to consider <br>\nthat at all.</p>\n<p>The standard way to get a line-feed into the HOL term language is indeed <br>\nterm \"CHR ''\\010''\".  It is funny that \"CHR ''\\013''\" also normalizes to <br>\nthe same -- there are a few more such normalizations built into the notion <br>\nof Isabelle symbols, which underlies all text that the prover processes.</p>\n<p>Generally, when working with text, especially on top of unicode, there can <br>\nbe a number of really big surprises.  Isabelle avoids most of the dangers <br>\nof official Unicode by working with its symbols instead, but this is not <br>\n100% bullet proof.  We are living in a time where computer systems cannot <br>\nprocess text material reliably and unambigously ...</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
