I have proved that AAA is a sublocale of a <br>\nlocale BBB. I am proving a theorem in AAA. During the proof, I construct <br>\ntwo objects M2 and T2, and I can prove \"AAA M2 T2\". Then, I would like <br>\nto apply to M2 and T2 a theorem of BBB. I tried two approaches:</p>\n<p>1) interpret AAA M2 T2</p>\n<p>to get all the theorems of AAA and BBB for M2 T2. However, there are a <br>\nlot of name clashes, between all the objects already defined in the <br>\nambient AAA M T, and the new AAA M2 T2, so this command is rejected.</p>\n<p>2) have \"BBB M2 T2\"</p>\n<p>If I could deduce this from \"AAA M2 T2\", then I could apply the theorems <br>\nof BBB to M2 T2. However, I did not find how to prove this using the <br>\nalready proved \"sublocale AAA \\subseteq BBB\"</p>\n<p>To get 1) to work, I would for instance need all objects in AAA M2 T2 to <br>\nbe prefixed automatically by something, say, to distinguish them from <br>\nAAA M T.</p>\n<p>To get 2) to work, I would need to have a lemma saying that \"AAA M2 T2 <br>\n==&gt; BBB M2 T2\". Is a lemma like this available somewhere once the <br>\nsublocale inclusion is proved?</p>\n<p>Anyway, any hints on better methods, or best practice, are welcome!</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nEsseger</p>",
