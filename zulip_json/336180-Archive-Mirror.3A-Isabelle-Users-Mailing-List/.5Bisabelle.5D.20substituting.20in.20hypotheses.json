        "content": "<p>From: John Matthews &lt;<a href=\"mailto:matthews@galois.com\">matthews@galois.com</a>&gt;<br>\nIs there anything analogous to Isar's \"subst\" method that allows me to <br>\nperform a one-off substitution in a selected subgoal's hypothesis? Here <br>\nis a contrived example that could be proved trivially by auto, but <br>\ndemonstrates what I'm trying to do in general:</p>\n<p>lemma L1: \"(x::nat)+1 = x+1+0\"<br>\n   by auto</p>\n<p>lemma silly: \"[| P(x+1::nat); R(%(x::nat). x+1) |] ==&gt; R(%x. x+1+0)\"</p>\n<p>When proving \"silly\" I'd like to use lemma L1 to substitute \"x+1+0\" for <br>\n\"x+1\" in the second hypotheses. Note that</p>\n<p>apply (simp only: L1)</p>\n<p>will cause Isabelle to loop, and</p>\n<p>apply (unfold L1)</p>\n<p>fails. Even if unfold didn't fail here, it would likely also loop or <br>\nunfold the occurrence of x+1 in the other hypothesis and conclusion of <br>\n\"silly\", which I don't want.</p>\n<p>Currently, the easiest way I know of to perform the substitution in the <br>\nhypothesis is through these cumbersome series of methods:</p>\n<p>apply (erule_tac Q=\"R(%x. x+1)\" in contrapos_pp)<br>\n   apply (subst L1)<br>\n   apply (erule_tac Q=\"R (%x. x+1+0)\" in contrapos_nn)</p>\n<p>Is there a more concise way to do this?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\n-john</p>",
