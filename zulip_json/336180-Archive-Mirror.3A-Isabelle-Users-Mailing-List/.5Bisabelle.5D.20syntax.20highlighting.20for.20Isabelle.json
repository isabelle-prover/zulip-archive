I was then <br>\ngoing to change them, but don't know which emacs-faces correspond to <br>\nwhich commands... anyone have a list handy?</p>\n<p>Also, I was wondering if I can colour things according to the <br>\n\"isar-keywords.el\" file. Although keywords exist in several categories, <br>\nsomething more customisable would be nice. :)</p>\n<p>cheers,<br>\nlucas</p>",
