Nevertheless, the proof cannot be completed<br>\n(as can be seen by trying \"by auto\"). A goal seems to remain<br>\nunsolvable:</p>\n<p>function (tailrec) remove :: \"'a set =&gt; (nat =&gt; 'a) =&gt; 'a set\"<br>\n  where \"remove A f = (if A = {} then A<br>\n                        else remove (A - {f 1}) (%k. if k &lt; (1::nat)<br>\nthen f k else f (Suc k)))\"</p>\n<p>Are there any problems with the definition? Which additional facts<br>\nhave to be proved? (I am using Isabelle 2009-2).</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help,</p>\n<p>Jesus</p>",

Things go sour only when you enter \"done\", and then the error says \"Proof failed\". This indicates than an internal proof obligation couldn't be discharged by \"function\".</p>\n<p>When such a thing happens with a definitional package (e.g., \"datatype\", \"inductive\", \"function\"), it usually indicates a bug in the package. The \"tailrec\" option is seldom used or tested; a bug there wouldn't be so surprising.</p>\n<p>Alex will hopefully be able to help you here...</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",

It is a funny <br>\ncoincidence that just today I eliminated the remaining uses from the <br>\nAFP, (cf. <a href=\"http://afp.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/afp/afp/rev/cfeb14dc4509\">http://afp.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/afp/afp/rev/cfeb14dc4509</a> , <br>\nin particular, SatSolverCode.thy).</p>\n<p>My recommendation is to move to Isabelle2011 and use the new <br>\n\"partial_function (tailrec)\" command. There is an example in <br>\nHOL/ex/Fundefs.thy, and you should be able to see from the changeset <br>\nabove how to port things. Note that currently no pattern matching is <br>\nsupported, but you can easily  work around this by using \"case\" on the <br>\nright-hand side.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\n<p>Alex</p>",
