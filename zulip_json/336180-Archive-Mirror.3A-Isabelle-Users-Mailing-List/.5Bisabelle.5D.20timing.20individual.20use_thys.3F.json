Is there a replacement or alternative  <br>\nto achieve the same effect?</p>\n<p>I know that with usedir's option \"-t true\" I can time the whole  <br>\nsession, but I would like to get a little bit more resolution without  <br>\nbreaking up a session into smaller ones.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time,<br>\nChristoph</p>",
