Legacy features like 'constdefs' <br>\nusually take 1-3 releases from the first indication that they are <br>\ndiscontinued (by issuing certain warnings) to removal.  This gives more <br>\nthan 1-2 years to update existing theories.  This typically becomes <br>\nunconfortable when NEWS about changes and legacy warnings are ignored for <br>\na long time, and you are forced to convert in the last moment, when old <br>\nfeatures are finally deleted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Mercurial repository.<br>\n  Isabelle's development uses Mercury as version control tool.<br>\n  Now is it possible to download the most recent version of some materials?<br>\n  Is it readable for a user who is not a developper?<br>\n  What command to use?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Using\" the repository version is quite adventurous.  You need to make <br>\nyourself an expert of the build process, and the only guarantee is that <br>\nthere will be really many changes in a short time.  If you need your <br>\nthrill every morning instead of working productively, you can start with <br>\nREADME_REPOSITORY and Admin/makedist from <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/</a></p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
