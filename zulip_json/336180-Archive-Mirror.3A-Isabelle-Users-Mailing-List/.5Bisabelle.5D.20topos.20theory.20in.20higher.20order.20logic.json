Spivak</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10258\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10258</a></p>\n<p>they write:</p>\n<p>The logic we present is higher-order logic, plus subtypes and quotient<br>\ntypes. Higherorder<br>\nlogic-aswell as its strong connectionwith topos theory-has been<br>\nverywell-studied<br>\n[LS88; Fou77; BJ81; Awo16; Joh02], which is part of our motivation for using<br>\nit. In fact,<br>\ntoposes support not just higher-order logic, but also dependent type<br>\ntheories. This means<br>\nthat one can use an automated proof-assistant based on dependent type<br>\ntheory-such as<br>\nCoq or Lean [CH88; Mou+15]-to validate proofs.</p>\n<p>The category theory development in Isabelle I know is </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Category2.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Category2.html</a></p>\n<p>it uses the HOLZF theory.</p>\n<p>Would encoding the above type theory in Isabelle/HOL be doable, or dependent<br>\ntypes are essential for that?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gergely</li>\n</ul>",
