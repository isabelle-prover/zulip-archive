That might have a variety of reasons, such as bad <br>\nluck in the gambling of libc/libc++ dependencies of the pre-compilied <br>\nbinaries of Isabelle2013.  It might be also bad luck in conjunction with <br>\nEmacs process management, so you should try using \"isabelle jedit\"; and <br>\nthere is also \"isabelle tty\".</p>\n<p>We should probably make some videos on youtube that show quickly how <br>\ncertain elementary things work in Isabelle/jEdit.  It is a bit like a <br>\ncomputer game to do formal proofs.</p>\n<p>When it starts up, you have your Scratch.thy already open, so producing <br>\nthe standard boilerplate should be sufficient (\"theory Scratch imports <br>\nMain begin ... end\").  Then you type all commands into the body text, and <br>\nhover over the grey squiggles to see the results (which are clickable for <br>\nsledgehammer), or use the more conventional Output panel.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
