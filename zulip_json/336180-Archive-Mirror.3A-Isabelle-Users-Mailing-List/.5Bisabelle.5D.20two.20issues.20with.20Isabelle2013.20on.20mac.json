It would be ever-so-slightly nicer just to have one.</p>\n<p>-- When Isabelle is <em>not</em> running, I can double-click a theory file in Finder, and it will happily launch Isabelle and open that theory. But when Isabelle <em>is</em> already running, nothing happens when I double-click a theory file in Finder. It would be slightly nicer not to have always to use the jEdit \"Open\" menu.</p>\n<p>John</p>",
