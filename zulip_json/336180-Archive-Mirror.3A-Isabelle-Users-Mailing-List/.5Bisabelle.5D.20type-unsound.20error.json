I didn't want to hard-code my email address in Isabelle, but I felt more comfortable to do so in a manual of which I am the author. Whether you send future bug reports directly to me or to the mailing list is up to you. The mailing list has the advantage that other people might jump in if I'm on vacation.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>Jasmin</p>",
