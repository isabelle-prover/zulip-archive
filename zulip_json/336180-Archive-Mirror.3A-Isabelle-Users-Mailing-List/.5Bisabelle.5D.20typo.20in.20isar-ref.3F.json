Most of the isar-ref manual is formally checked <br>\nor generated from prover output, but this part is just some adhoc <br>\nLaTeX-painting with tabular environment and some @{text} antiquotations to <br>\nimitate the formal style of Isabelle.</p>\n<p>While this rule composition framework is the main concept of <br>\nIsabelle/Pure, it is not relevant for proof terms.  The \"assumption\" and <br>\n\"resolution\" inferences are derived rules on top of plain minimal logic <br>\nover !! and ==&gt; as explained by Larry in his early Isabelle papers from <br>\naround 1989.  The proof term layer by Berghofer and Nipkow expands these <br>\n\"derived primitives\" on the fly, see here <br>\n<a href=\"http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/Isabelle2012/src/Pure/proofterm.ML#l821\">http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/Isabelle2012/src/Pure/proofterm.ML#l821</a></p>\n<p>Note that \"bicompose_aux\" is a slight generalization of the resolution <br>\nprinciple.  You can see further in thm.ML and drule.ML how Larry makes the <br>\nactual user-space d/e/f/res operations from that blueprint.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
