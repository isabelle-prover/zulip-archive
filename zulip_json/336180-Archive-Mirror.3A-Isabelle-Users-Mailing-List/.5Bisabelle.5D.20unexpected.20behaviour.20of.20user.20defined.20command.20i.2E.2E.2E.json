The parsing of <br>\ncommands is done \"declaratively\" in a way that makes it hard to foresee <br>\nthe exact operational behaviour. (The deeper problem is that old stateful <br>\nconcepts like the global command table are getting in the way.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, definining and using a command within the same theory file was <br>\nnever supported in the history of Isabelle so far.  Only last week, I've <br>\ngot an idea to solve this problem in the near future.</p>\n<p>In classic Proof General there are certain ways to cope with this <br>\nsituation.  In Isabelle/jEdit it is a bit more difficult, because the user <br>\nhas little control over the scheduling of command execution.  One <br>\nworkaround is to define your commands beforehand and build an image in <br>\nbatch mode that is then used as starting point for the editor session.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
