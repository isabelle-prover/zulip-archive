The strict<br>\nupdate policy of former update_thy is now already performed by<br>\nuse_thy, so the former has been removed; use_thys updates several<br>\ntheories simultaneously, just as 'imports' within a theory header<br>\nspecification, but without merging the results.  Potential<br>\nINCOMPATIBILITY: may need to refine theory headers and commands<br>\nROOT.ML which depend on load order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, neither use_thy nor former update_thy should occur in regular <br>\ninteractive use of Isabelle at all: when processing a theory header <br>\ninteractively, the system already updates all required theories.  Invoking <br>\nuse_thy (or its simultaneous version use_thys) mostly occurs in batch mode <br>\nROOT.ML files, until we replace these by plain ROOT header specifications <br>\nusing existing theory syntax.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
