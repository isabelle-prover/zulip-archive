(Many humble <br>\napologies!).  Emailed answers are also acceptable, if you no longer <br>\ntrust the HTML form.</p>\n<p>Both proof interfaces are now available on<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.discmath.cl.cam.ac.uk/DiscreteMathsBook\">http://www.discmath.cl.cam.ac.uk/DiscreteMathsBook</a></p>\n<p>The system has been seen working on the latest versions of IE, Firefox, <br>\nand Safari.  (Testing on Safari was briefer than we'd have liked <br>\nthough).  Java 5.0 is required.</p>\n<p>The questions in the left column of the front page -- \"Experiment for <br>\nIsabelle Experts\" -- use the Isar syntax itself.  The questions in the <br>\nright column of the front page -- \"Experiment for Everybody\" -- use <br>\nMathsTiles, which is our way of trying to make proof-writing questions <br>\nanswerable by students.  Please try both sets if you are willing!</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your interest and patience. </p>\n<p>Will Billingsley</p>",
