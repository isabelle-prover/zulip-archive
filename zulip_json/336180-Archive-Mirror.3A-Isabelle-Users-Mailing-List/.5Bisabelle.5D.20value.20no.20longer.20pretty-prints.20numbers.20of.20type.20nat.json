I can confirm that in <br>\nIsabelle2013, you get pretty numerals for nat, but in Isabelle2013-RC-1, you don't get <br>\nthem by default. One could argue that the Suc representation is more faithful to the <br>\nrepresentation of nat, but for other types like int and rat, they are printed as pretty <br>\nnumerals.</p>\n<p>If you import HOL/Library/Code_Target_Nat, then you get pretty numerals for nat, too. But <br>\nof course, they are then implemented as target-language integers (rather than a datatype <br>\nwith constructors 0 and Suc).</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndreas</p>",
