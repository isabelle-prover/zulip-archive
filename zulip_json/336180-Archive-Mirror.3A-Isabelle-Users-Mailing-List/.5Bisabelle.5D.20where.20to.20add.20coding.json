You haven't stated, incidentally, whether you want to extend Isabelle/HOL (and therefore higher-order logic), or another built-in logic, or Pure Isabelle (some formalism of your own).</p>\n<p>You might consider HOL4, an implementation of higher-order logic where coding is fairly straightforward.</p>\n<p>Larry Paulson</p>",

        "content": "<p>From: Makarius &lt;<a href=\"mailto:makarius@sketis.net\">makarius@sketis.net</a>&gt;<br>\nIsabelle/jEdit is a fully-featured IDE that supports development of<br>\ntools in Isabelle/ML, although most users apply it most of the time to<br>\ndevelop theory libraries.</p>\n<p>To implement anything yourself, you should study how others have done<br>\nthat before. E.g. pick a tool that you think is close to what you want<br>\nto do (lets say the \"blast\" proof method), and use C-mouse-hover-click<br>\ntechnique described in the Isabelle/jEdit manual to get to its<br>\ndefinition. This will usually lead to some ML_file or ML commands that<br>\nincorporate the new Isabelle language element.</p>\n<p>Note that in order to browse Isabelle/ML sources of tools in<br>\nIsabelle/HOL, you need to do this with \"isabelle jedit -l Pure\", i.e. in<br>\na session that does not yet contain Isabelle/HOL. In contrast, tools in<br>\nother sessions (e.g. src/HOL/Library) require the default HOL image.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to browse Isabelle/Pure sources with full IDE<br>\nannotations by opening src/Pure/ROOT.ML in Isabelle/jEdit. Here the<br>\nlevel of sophistication is usually much higher than plain user-space<br>\ntools from elsewhere, but looking at the core implementation also helps<br>\nto understand how things are done properly.</p>\n<p>Some further background information on Isabelle/ML is available in the<br>\n\"implementation\" manual.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
