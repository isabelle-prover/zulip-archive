According to the isar-ref manual, \"where\" is an attribute<br>\nlike \"OF\" and \"of\", but in tex documents \"where\" becomes \\isakeyword{where}<br>\nwhereas \"of\" and \"OF\" are unmodified. Is there some subtle distinction I should<br>\nbe aware of?</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nTobias</p>",

That is a historical accident, and I would <br>\nnot do it again today: Isabelle sub-languages should be cleary separated.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless there is an easy workaround for books or papers where \"where\" <br>\nis meant to be really just a plain name, not a keyword disguised as name: <br>\nsimply put double quotes around it, and use a Isabelle/latex style that <br>\nsuppresses the quotes.</p>\n<p>Makarius</p>",
