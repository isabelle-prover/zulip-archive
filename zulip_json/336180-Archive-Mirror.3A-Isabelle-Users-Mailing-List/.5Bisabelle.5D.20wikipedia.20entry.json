We actually had this discussion internally last week, and <br>\nthe entry can certainly be improved. I just replaced the strange proof <br>\nexample by an Isar proof that the sqrt of 2 is not rational. I think <br>\nthis is the same direction as what you had in mind...</p>\n<p>btw, editing wikipedia is really as easy as clicking \"edit\", so if <br>\nanyone has relevant things to write, go ahead. In particular, some major <br>\napplications should be mentioned...</p>\n<p>Alex</p>",
